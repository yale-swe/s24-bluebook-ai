   "comments": [
    "I enjoyed the amount of development in my writing and grammar that I noticed at the end of the semester. I think this was especially due to the time and amount of effort that Professor Alexandrov put into correcting each person's work, while recognizing that each student had different areas that needed improvement.",
    "I developed my ability to speak and present academic content in front of people in the Spanish language with comfort. I also gained a lot of knowledge about the grammar of the Spanish language and about the different vocabulary that is used throughout Latin America and Spain.",
    "You learn a lot of grammar and how to use it properly.",
    "I deepened my own confidence as a Spanish speaker and writer. I also began to think more critically about the grammar and vocabulary I was using.",
    "This course built the L3 curriculum, focusing on vocabulary and brushing up on grammar, while also discussing current event and culture of New Haven and Latin America.",
    "Both basics and fine points of grammar, phonetics, culture. I improved my speaking skills - especially my intuitions - greatly.",
    "I can comfortably speak in Spanish with others and feel like my comprehension skills have improved.",
    "This course helped me strengthen my Spanish-speaking and writing ability. It has allowed me to become more comfortable and in turn has allowed me to interact more with other Spanish-speakers.",
    "I have improved my overall Spanish",
    "I gained a much deeper understanding of the Spanish language, different Latinx cultures, and my own cultures.",
    "Overall, I feel as though my ability to understand the Spanish language has improved considerably while taking this course. I have benefited greatly from it, and look forward to continuing it in the second semester."

   "question_id": "YC403",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The strength of the course comes from the ability for each student to improve in his\/her own way, while also learning more about their country of heritage. I appreciated that the professor allowed us to choose our own topics for all our projects, which helped us dive deep into what we were interested in. I think this course could be improved by emphasizing a little more on grammar, but besides that, the course could not have been better.",
    "The strengths are that the small class size allows for a lot of engagement between the professor and the students as well as between the students. No weaknesses that I can think of.",
    "Strenght is definitely being in a heritage speaking environment and Professor Alexandrov makes of us that environment to teach in a way that is unique to Spanish classes.",
    "I think this course benefits from having a lot of consistent work (there is quite a bit of homework due for every class). Along these lines, though, I think the class would benefit from slightly less homework due every class (e.g. one assignment), since the number of assignments tends to strain the students ability to complete any one assignment intentionally.",
    "This course had a lot of individualized attention and feedback, but the workload was significant.",
    "Strengths: It is genuinely immersive and has improved my fluency with the language. Weaknesses: Some of the assignments are a little tedious.",
    "The course was very interactive and it was clearly adapted to fit our needs. The homework, although lengthy at times, was useful in ensuring we all practiced frequently. One weakness I felt could be improved was the lack of review over the textbook readings. I felt as though covering the readings more would have helped strengthen my understanding of the grammar as opposed to primarily focusing on learning through select examples.",
    "Weakness - the amount of homework Strengths - how well the course is taught"

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course to another student because it allowed me to improve all aspects of my Spanish. I really enjoyed how different the course was from a typical language class; it was multifaceted with many overarching themes and projects to keep us engaged.",
    "I would recommend this to anyone who has grown up speaking Spanish at home but isn't quite comfortable with speaking the language outside of the home or with writing in Spanish.",
    "If you are a heritage speaker who has never taken Spanish before, it's a good learning experience.",
    "I'd recommend this class to all heritage speakers who want to improve their Spanish at this level.",
    "Absolutely! Heritage speakers should take this course.",
    "Yes, adamantly yes. I was looking at taking regular L3 because, though I could speak fluently, my grasp of grammar etc. wasnt perfect. This is the place to be to challenge yourself in the right areas as a native speaker. I much preferred it to be in this class with classmates in my exact situation. The class challenged me where I needed to be challenged, and allowed me to learn. Sybil is excellent. Get in this class!",
    "Absolutely. I learned so much from this course and it was catered to Spanish speakers like me, heritage speakers, and it was really important to me to have a class like that.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to other students; the professor makes a genuine effort to ensure that all students are keeping up to the pace of the classroom and provides detailed feedback. The class is taught in a way that makes heritage speakers much more comfortable than a basic Spanish course.",
    "Yes this was the best Spanish class Ive ever taken.",
    "If you are a heritage speaker, no matter your skill level, absolutely take this class. Sybil is incredible and the class is amazing. The format is much better-suited for heritage speakers than the normal Spanish track.",
    "Yes, I would and have recommended this course to other students. For any student who is in a similar situation to mine, being a first generation Spanish speaker in the United States who grew up speaking the language but with a desire to have a better mastery of the language, this course is perfect."
