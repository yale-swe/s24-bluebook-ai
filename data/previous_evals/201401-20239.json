   "comments": [
    "Basic Calc 1 class. I would recommend it to another student. It didn't have too much work, just problem sets and exams. Everything was doable, there were many opportunities for help if needed.",
    "I wouldn't recommend it if you have a background in calculus or are simply looking for a QR - it's not worth your time, especially at 9:25am.",
    "The concepts are simple enough just make sure to do the homework and ask questions as soon as you don't understand something. I'd recommend it if you're looking for a simple math class that still engaged much of high school calculus.",
    "good review course for calculus",
    "Math 112 is a pretty boring basic math course. If it's a requirement for you you'll be fine, if you're taking it for fun I might suggest something else.",
    "It's an entry level calculus class, and is very manageable. The pace is good, as well as the weekly problem sets. Without taking calculus before, it might be very challenging, but with previous knowledge, it was a great course to take."
