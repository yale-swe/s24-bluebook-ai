   "comments": [
    "Pretty standard. Probably will have to take it so do.",
    "It is a good calculus course, but it is not as easy as some people think and so I would recommend that you take the course only if you are going to need calculus for your prospective major. Otherwise there are easier courses you can take to fulfill the QR requirement.",
    "Take it if you need it.",
    "I would not recommend this class unless you have no other choice or you like math or want to major in it if you can skip it take math 118 it is supposed to be easier.",
    "If you need to take it, take it. Some people got overwhelmed, but if you stay on top of the material, read through the textbook, and get help when you need it, you will be fine. Just make sure you get a decent section, as the different TAs are not so good. Professor Previdi was one of the best ones.",
    "Very fast pace class. Need to keep up with work or will fall behind. Hard especially if no prior math experience. Don't take it if do not need to for major.",
    "This course is pretty awful.If you take it, make sure to take advantage of the personal and college tutors right away because unless you've taken it before, you probably won't get the material in class and you'll probably wish you had slept in another hour rather than getting up for calc.",
    "i recommend it if you took a BC calc level class in high school and want to do really well and get a math credit or haven't taken BC calc. If you are taking it for a math requirement for a major, like econ, and have taken a BC equivalent you probably should just go straight to 118 or 120.",
    "It's just math.",
    "Mathematics 115 is a course that covers the second half of Calculus, from integration to series. Exams for the second semester MATH 115 are fairly straightforward. I think opinions on this class primarily differ based on the instructor. I would recommend any student planning on taking this class to take it with Luigi Previdi.",
    "I would not recommend it to anyone who did not take calculus in high school or did not ace Math 112. It moved too fast to pick up on a lot of the material.",
    "This seems to be a pretty standard second semester of single variable calculus class. More techniques of integration (e.g. parts), some polar geometry and parametrics, and then sequences and series. Even though I took some calculus before, I think this class's problems tend to be a bit harder, and I never got a firm grasp of sequences and series, so this class was good for that, too. Even for new students, I think this class would be decent. Previdi is also a pretty good teacher for this class, especially for picking out examples to go over in class, so no worries if you get him.",
    "The course is difficult, but doable. Most people take Math 115 to fulfill a requirement."
