   "comments": [
    "Global majors have to take it - it should be a class you enjoy even if you aren't quant oriented.",
    "If it is necessary for you to learn why equations and rules work, don't take this class. Very practical applications-focused, with some explanation but you don't derive anything.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class for all global majors. The material for the first 3\/4 of the semester is very similar to what many kids learned in high school AP Statistics. However, we do go into more depth on these topics and the regression section is very helpful for people who have taken AP Stats before.",
    "GLBL 121 is a great class, even for those just looking for a QR credit. The material is actually useful, and Professor Thomas is such a great teacher that even the higher level concepts were not that difficult to grasp.",
    "If youre looking for a well-taught intro stats class, this is your best bet.",
    "Good background to social science research concepts.",
    "GLBL 121 is basically an intro stats course with the statical application STATA. Required for the global affairs major. Generally an easy course that is moderately paced. It starts out quite simple but picks up after the midterm.",
    "Statistics class for non-math students",
    "I absolutely recommend this class! If you would like to take a stats class (even if not a Global Affairs major), I highly recommend this class because Justin is a fantastic professor.",
    "Wow! This class is absolutely 5 stars. Prof. Thomas does a great job introducing a practical approach to statistics. He does an awesome job making sure that the material is accessible and understood - not just memorized. I actually think I understand something about statistics at this point. The only thing I would've liked was the ability to cover more material in the class we lost out on some sessions as a result of the weather and what not so it would've been nice to make up the material since I think there is no better way that to learn it with JT. MUST TAKE IF YOU NEED A QR OR AN INTRO TO STATISTICS.",
    "Light class where you learn some Stata. Prof Thomas is great.",
    "This class was excellent. I never expected to enjoy a math course so much! Professor Thomas is engaging and always willing to help, and gives us the tools to succeed in this class. Our material was very applicable, and helped me in my other Global Affairs courses this semester. I hope to take another course with Professor Thomas, and our TA was the best I've had so far at Yale.",
    "GLBL 121 is a good time. It's not too difficult, particularly if you've taken AP Stats, and Justin makes the class fun. Problem sets and exams are fair, and you'll learn useful Stata techniques in discussion section. I would even recommend this course for any Yale student looking to learn about stats, regardless of their major. You'll learn useful material that's relevant to almost any field of study.",
    "Absolutely would recommend if student is looking to gain some skills in analysis",
    "This was a very challenging class and took a lot of effort. JT makes all the tests very fair; however, that doesn't mean that they are not VERY hard. The material is just plain complicated for someone who has never taken a stats course."
