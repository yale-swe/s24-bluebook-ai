    "This class really feels like an academic book club- you read one book every week and then have an in-depth discussion lead by one student while munching on snacks. For me, it was a wonderful opportunity to dedicate myself to reading every single book and I enjoyed having a really interesting group of people (MPH, PHD, and undergrad students) to discuss it with. I would say that to get the most out of the class, you need to really be committed to reading everything, which means depending on your reading speed, the reading load can be a lot.But I highly recommend this for anyone who are really critically interested in qualitative aspects of global health and medical anthropology.",
    "I would recommend students to take it if they are interested in learning health-related topics that span the social, political and cultural domains. It will be helpful if you have some background in medical anthropology or public health previously. It is also important to look at the reading list and make sure you would like to read the majority of the books, since reading and discussion are the major components of this course.",
    "If you can get in, take it. You will NOT regret it.",
    "Overview: this is a global health book club. A different student leads each class, there's a book a week, and you get free coffee and breakfast every class period, which is so so great. More detail: This class is not for everyone. If you're not going to do the reading, don't take this class. Please. You're doing yourself and your classmates a favor. But, if you look at the syllabus and you love what you see, you should fight tooth and nail to get into this class because it is FANTASTIC but hard to get into, for good reason. Marcia Inhorn is an incredibly gifted professor and in my opinion one of the gems of the Yale faculty. Make sure that you are going to be able to do the reading though, because you won't get nearly as much out of the class and you will likely not do very well (much of the grade is class participation and engagement with the ethnographies). However, outside of the reading the workload is very light, just two two-page single-spaced book reviews and a 15 page comparative book review at the end of the semester. Tips for the workload: TAKE NOTES both when you're reading and during class, because you won't remember the details when you're going back to pick a book to use for the final paper; DO THE READING DO THE READING DO THE READING seriously it will help you so much and the ethnographies in this class are fantastic; START YOUR EXTRA ETHNOGRAPHY AHEAD OF TIME, because you may think you can skim it and write a 15-page comparative review, but you really don't want to do that. This class has really opened my eyes to medical ethnography. I'll probably read all of these books again, and also plan to expand from there. Summary: TAKE THIS CLASS if you'll do the reading",
    "I would recommend this course to a student who wants an understanding of ethnography a it relates to medical anthropology. The reading load is heavy."
