   "comments": [
    "yes. great professros, interesting material, good TAs, and field trips to Yale resources",
    "If this class is better organized, I would recommend it. It is interesting, especially if you need a ROW credit.",
    "If Zimm is around, take his section. Awesome dude. The class itself seemed a bit disorganized. Interesting subject matter--the Hellenistic world is rife with incredible stories--but the execution could use some refining.",
    "I would recommend this class, especially if you need a pre-industrial or a 300 credit. That being said, read the articles. The final exam was really hard, and the chronology sections are next to impossible. But if you pay attention in class and do the readings, you're really fine. Skim them at least; it will pay off later.",
    "Do not take this. Material was sloppily thrown together sometimes entirely bizarre. A lecture talking about Alexander in the 21st century included weird memes that looked they were created by some 9th grader on the internet.",
    "Never. No. I would not take this course, or any other course with Prof. Manning.",
    "This is an interesting period of history and it is well taught. It is not too hard as there is only a final and a midterm, no papers",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. While it certainly had some issues, especially regarding overall organization, I found the overall experience to be incredibly interesting and rewarding. Each individual lecture was fascinating, and Professor Manning and his co-teacher Tyler had an obvious love for the subject that they made very clear. While they should definitely think about re-working the syllabus (it would probably have been better to arrange topics chronologically), the class was an excellent experience overall, with knowledgable and helpful TAs, not too much work (although a good bit of reading), and a fascinating subject matter.",
    "This course is very good when it stays within the boundaries of the hard-and fast Hellenistic history, but when it ventures outside of this domain into the modern reception aspects of the Alexander myth and the other tangentially-related subtopics that we touched on during the semester, the weaknesses of the lecture outweighed the strengths. Manning is the man.",
    "Yes, if you are interested in what happened in the 3-2 centuries post Alexander you should take the class.",
    "This is the most frustrating class I have ever taken at Yale -- despite the promise of its underlying structure (half classical history, half historical memory) it is poorly taught and poorly organized. A laughably easy in-class midterm was followed up by an inexplicably impossible final. Lectures go nowhere, especially towards the second half of the semester where the professors are clearly removed from their field of expertise.The only reason to take this course if you're incredibly interested in the exact period, looking for a rest-of-the-world credit that requires zero paper writing, or just like hearing about guys named things like Antigonus Cyclops and Ptolemy the Oboist. Even then, I would stay away.",
    "Take it but be careful to prepare for the exams.",
    "It's fun and not hard. 1 day of Pre test cramming twice a semester.",
    "This class was interesting and very approachable even for those with little background in history.",
    "YES- great way to fulfill a rest of the world history requirement while learning about a truly interesting historical figure and his legacy within the Western World.",
    "History302 is an overview of Hellenistic history, focusing on Alexander the Great and his successors. It is a small lecture in which there is time to ask questions. Professor Manning and Tyler each teach every lecture on what they know best. The course covers the hard history, but also cultural history and the legacies of Hellenism and Alexander the Great. I would recommend it to a student interested in Greek \/ Mediterranean history. It is not overly difficult, but does require you to do readings every week.",
    "The subject matter sounds quite interesting, but I have taken better ancient\/classical history classes at Yale (however, with Professor Kagan leaving, this may no longer be the case). I think this course has a lot of potential, but it wasn't very well organized. It's not too much work, however, as your grade consists of only a midterm, final and participation points in section, but the tests were both very stressful to prepare for because of the disorganization of the class. It felt that many readings were irrelevant, and the subject matter often changed significantly from week to week, making it difficult to trace important themes. I took this class because it counted as a ROW and pre-industrial, but I think as a general history credit there are better options.",
    "Good ROW for history majors, especially if you're interested in the ancient world."
