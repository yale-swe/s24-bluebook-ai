    "I feel like I've learned so much since the beginning of the semester, when I did not even know the alphabet. A few short months later, I am able to write short monologues and give information about myself in a grammatically correct manner.",
    "I learned some Russian",
    "I learned basic Russian speaking, reading, and writing skills: six of the seven cases, a solid base vocabulary, and many verb conjugations (past and present). I feel that I developed a very strong foundation for future study of the language.",
    "Learned a lot about grammar: future, present, past, 4 of the 6 cases. adjectives, nouns and a lot of useful vocabulary.",
    "Great introduction to Russian.",
    "I learned basic and conversational Russian in this course and several parts of Russian grammar, including the case system (5 out of 6 cases are covered in this course), declensions, aspect, and more."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I quite liked that the course met everyday and had frequent assessments of us in the form of weekly quizzes\/tests, and required daily class participation. The best way to learn the language is to engage with it as much as possible. I would actually in the future like to see more weekly quizzes to help me gauge my progress; ideally, quizzes and tests could be weighted lower, and more so on a basis of completion, to allow for us to really grapple with the language without the anxiety of GPA concerns.",
    "Strengths: Julia and Anya are both great instructors! I legitimately looked forward to class everyday. Fun, interactive, you get to know the others in your class, play some games in Russian, I laughed almost everyday Honestly don't really have any suggestions for improvement",
    "I thought that the textbook was a strength of the course. It had a good amount of vocab and it explained concepts well. I also thought the homework assignmetns reinforced material well. The course had no obvious weaknesses.",
    "Strengths: wide range of vocab, great TAs, a lot of additional material besides the book Weaknesses: it was a bit hard to get used to the russian keyboard at the beginning, making us waste some time during tests and quizzes",
    "Very well taught. Loved learning about daily life and culture in addition to language.",
    "There are many strengths to this course. It is strong in teaching the foundations of Russian necessary to progress to a higher level in the language, and does so effectively. If one puts in the work and studies hard for tests, one can have no problem getting an A. There are many chances to keep grades up or recover from a not-so-excellent grade on a test. The weakness for our section was that it had more people than the others, so we did not get as much speaking time in class, though this was just a logistical issue rather than something intrinsic to the course. The course, though well-framed, does take a bit of self-studying to do well.",
    "The online tests were possibly the worst part of the whole thing. All the homework and practice is written and in cursive, but the tests must be typed. While I have no issue with the grading of the exams, which is done by hand after the computer grades them, the amount of time simply spent on typing the Cyrillic characters is very annoying."

   "comments": [
    "I would truly recommend this class. Russian is a very critical language to know and a good option if you are looking to try a new language out. The introductory level is certainly challenging and require daily efforts to learn and review, but it is not impossible or inaccessible, especially considering how kind and accommodating the department is.",
    "Yes! Russian is a very interesting and different language. More interesting than Spanish! The people are also great and make class very enjoyable",
    "Absolutely. It was a phenomenal course. I wasn't sure if I really wanted to take Russian at the beginning of the semester but by the end of the course I was so glad I decided to do it. The course requires a decent amount of work, but all of the work is helpful and reinforces material from class. For anyone interested in learning a new language, foreign affairs, or for someone who wants to be immersed in a vibrant culture, I couldn't recommend taking this course (or learning Russian in general) more!",
    "I would highly recommend taking Russian at Yale, because the department is generally very strong and Russian is one of the most elaborate and rich languages out there, so you should definitely take advantages of this opportunity. I personally would prefer a faster pace at times, which might be more common in the intensive course. However, you should keep in mind that some students have a harder time getting used to the cyrillic alphabet and some grammatical concepts that are very different from English.",
    "pretty good russian course.",
    "I would completely recommend this. It introduces what is widely considered among the more difficult languages to learn in a way that is easy to engage with and understand. I am a STEM-y person and this became one of my favorite courses.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to those who are interested in learning a cool and uncommon language, want to go into foreign service, or simply want their perspectives broadened (many people in the world speak Russian). Learning Russian has already made me fall involve with Russian culture and has made me realize how little Americans really know about the country and its history. Speaking Russian opens up doors, and its very cool to see how quickly you can hear random Russian being spoken on the streets and your comprehension of some of what they are saying. Keep in mind, though, that Russian is not an easy language, but it is a very rewarding one."
