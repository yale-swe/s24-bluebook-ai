    "I thoroughly enjoyed this class. As my first true film studies course, this was a fantastic introduction while still being a specific topic. The weekly reading\/film responses could be a drag because they had to be submitted the same night as our (often lengthy) film screenings, but I generally liked the films and the discussions that ensued. I also liked how we spent one day in more of a lecture\/theory format and the next day in an open class discussion format.",
    "Amazing class! I learned an awful lot and I really got to experience another side of environmental studies that I would not have seen otherwise. Take it if you're into watching documentaries.",
    "If you love documentary and want to at least view a canon of contemporary, relatively decent documentaries, this is the class to take. Keep in mind that Prof. Musser's requirements for each component of the class are pretty unclear, even when you ask him in person. Also, lectures can be a bit redundant or historical, so it seems as if there aren't too many ties to film theory (might be a plus or minus depending on who you are). It's relatively difficult to get yourself to do the readings because the expectations for each paper or written requirement for the course are unclear. But use the TA as a sounding board and Musser himself is pretty understanding when it comes time for papers. Not a bad class to credit\/d\/fail.",
    "If your interested in the environment take this course. Great overview of how the environment and film intersect",
    "The material is interesting, and the documentaries are engaging, but the class can be a bit dry.",
    "Overall good course that talks about a lot of different environmental issues. If you can get past the complete lack of organization of the course it's good. Not a crazy amount of work, but definitely a lot of time as there is at least one full length film if not two to watch a week. Never did the readings and was still able to participate in discussion.",
    "EVST 366 selects one environmental topic each week (Oil, Gas, Food, etc.) and then chooses one or two films and several readings that correspond. The course covers an interesting array of topics and gives the opportunity to see a lot of important environmental films. The class is certainly a time commitment though - two 75 minute periods plus a 2-3 hour screening each week."
