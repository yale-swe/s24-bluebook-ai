   "comments": [
    "YES. Teacher is great and class is fun. Two weekly written assignments though so you have to be okay with that",
    "Great class to keep up your Spanish and very helpful if you're going to travel to any Spanish-speaking country. Entirely manageable workload: basically short assignments due for every class session. Mercedes is amazing. She's incredibly nice and very knowledgable. Take it!!",
    "I would say it's a great class for those interested in learning about Spanish in a somewhat technical environment. I would definitely recommend it to another student, but if you aren't premed and aren't incredibly interested in the human body and its ailments, you have to be ready to push through some of the more complicated illnesses which can be boring. In general though, a very relaxed class that is totally worth whatever you put in.",
    "A good class. Really fun if you like just generally knowing about lots of random medical conditions. Don't take it if you already know lots of medicine of epidemiology; the Spanish terminology is similar enough to the English that you'll really be wasting your time if you do. But it's great if you don't know the stuff already.",
    "YES",
    "I would definitely recommend it. Two assignments a week, a midterm and a short paper, and a great teacher. Mercedes is the best!",
    "I would recommend SPAN 225 for a fun and easy class if you're willing to put some effort into learning from the class.",
    "This course particularly interesting if you are interested in medicine but also have an interest in the SPanish language. The work isn't taxing and is quite interesting. Professor Carreras is very knowledgable.",
    "I'm a sophomore, and I never really believed that there was such a thing as a gut class at Yale. I was so wrong. This, my friends, is THE gut class. It is nearly impossible to not get an A. Literally everyone gets A+ on all the homework. The midterm exam was extremely easy. The rest of the grade is just a presentation, which is very relaxed, and a 5 page paper about literally anything you want to write about. If you can take L5 Spanish and need another credit, take this class! If you're a premed student, also take this class! No matter where you practice, it is almost guaranteed that you will have Spanish-speaking patients. Being able to communicate well with your patients is extremely important to the quality of care you give, so it's essential to know basic medical terminology in Spanish.",
    "Yes- great class if you're interested in Spanish and\/or medicine. It is very very chill. Great 5th class",
    "Definitely take Spanish 225. Even if you aren't a premed or interested in being part of the medical profession it gives you an understanding of how to manage with spanish in a medical environment. It also gives brief explanations of common diseases and how the medical system works.",
    "Great course! Definitely a must-take if you're interested in premed. Carreras is a wonderful professor.",
    "Spanish for Medical Professions is a good class, but you will only learn as much as you want; if you're interested and do the readings, you'll learn a lot, but it is also easy to not read thoroughly and therefore not retain as much information. The homework is easy and the professor is very sweet. I thought this class was a good combination of medical learning and Spanish language, which was a great combination for me, and it seems like very useful knowledge in the future.",
    "This class was wonderful, low-stress, fun, and useful. The concepts that we learned and the vocabulary will definitely come in handy in medical school and beyond. I would heartily recommend this class. The workload is low, Sra. Carreras is awesome, and the material is interesting.",
    "Yes, take it! Pretty chill level 5 course and really useful especially for premeds!",
    "comfortable environment to practice your spanish and interesting coursework. Super fun class to take with little work (a short assignment for each class that's very easy). Great way to either get your language requirement or brush up on spanish skills. Definitely recommended!"
