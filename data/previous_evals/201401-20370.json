    "Absolutely shop the class for the full two weeks to see if you enjoy the class. This class is NOT about answers but about examining the questions one should be asking about creating one's own life. I really enjoyed lecture, section, and the readings. I am not a philosophy major or even majoring in the humanities, but I found my thinking was a lot more clear after the semester. The classwork load is light enough for a 5th class: three 5-page papers. This class is not for everyone so please shop it for two weeks.",
    "I recommend this course.",
    "Yes",
    "Take it Credit\/D.",
    "Really cool class. The readings are amazing and stuff that you would probably want to do on your own (magazines, short chapters from books, etc.). Definitely take -- loved it as a second semester senior (as a credit\/D class, of course).",
    "I would not recommend Philosophy 179 to other students. If you are extremely self-driven and happen to love writing philosophy papers, 179 isn't a particularly hard course. It's a bit of a waste of time otherwise.",
    "Looks easy and fun, but isnt",
    "I would definitely take it, but take it Credit\/D unless you're planning on being a philosophy major.",
    "Yeah it was an interesting class. You should take it credit-D though.",
    "I highly recommend the course, for those who like thinking about questions which have no easy answers, but which will come up again and again in conversations with friends and family.",
    "Yes, especially if Kagan decides to restructure the last few weeks of the class.",
    "Would recommend. Consider Credit\/d, but just put in effort in section and on the papers.",
    "I would recommend this as long as you take it Credit\/D. That way you can engage in the material and learn a lot but not have to stress about each of the papers. However, it is definitely possible to do well if you take it for a grade because there are only three five page papers and the reading isn't necessary.",
    "Solid class if you would like to think critically about what's important in your life. It can be a bit boring if you have never taken a philosophy class before. Also, they grade the papers pretty hard, so be prepared for some tough grades. Take it credit D.",
    "I wouldn't take this unless it was credit d. Unless you're an awesome philosophical writer. They say the goal is to teach you but you but it's not that easy. Well at least it wasn't for me.",
    "This class is okay. It was fun to take as a credit\/d though I was actually rather afraid of getting that D. So don't really take it thinking you are not going to have to put in much work, because you will have to put in a lot work. Still, it's not impossible to pass. Now if you want to get an A, I hope you are a philosophy major.",
    "If you want to actually do philosophy as opposed to learning about it, this is the class you should take.",
    "a very thought-provoking class! if you make the effort you'll do fine. yes id recommend it",
    "A perfect senior credit\/d class. Only three 5-page papers and section. Really interesting topics too!",
    "Great class as a second semester senior. Take it credit\/d.",
    "Unbelievable course. Shelly Kagan is an amazing lecturer. After each class, I left inspired to continue discussion with peers. I'm a science major, so I was worried about taking a philosophy course. But Life is accessible and interesting. It applies philosophy to every day questions - the value of love, friendship, career, children, helping others, honesty, etc. Section was worthwhile, too (unlike any other section I've had to attend at Yale!) Discussions were engaging, thought-provoking and fun. DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS FOR A GRADE, however. The average for the first paper was a C or C-. A perfect Credit-D course. You'd be silly not to take this class. Seriously, a must-take course at Yale.",
    "i would recommend it i think it's a great class sometimes a bit repetitive but wonderful overall and i loved it.",
    "Very light workload and interesting course material but definitely take it credit d if you want to do well. Kagan has one of the harshest grading policies on campus.",
    "Life is a class in which you discuss major topics in most lives, such as friendship, love, and achievement. By doing most of the readings and attending lecture, you learn a lot about your views on life and what you believe in. Many times, I question my opinions and was able to talk them through over section. This class was one of the greatest thought experiments I've ever experienced. I thought about things I had never thought of before and truly appreciated what I learned from what others in my class had to say. I would definitely recommend this class. It's fun, engaging, and I found myself thinking about what we discussed in section weeks later. If you are confident with your writing skills, I would say take it as a grade. If you want to take a more relaxed approach, Credit\/D is great for this class.",
    "A pretty good philosophy class; it was my first, and didn't find the grading harsh at all, although it is difficult to get an A on a paper. Very interesting readings.",
    "Straight talk: this class is a waste of time. Nothing of import is said in the lectures. On most occasions, the instructor takes the entire fifty minute period to work his way up to making a statement of comparable simplicity to \"In life, we must make difficult decisions\", and ends class with that, as if he has somehow inspired deep reflection and thought in all of us. Perhaps he does this to...actually I don't know why he does this. It seems like, with a subject heading as big as \"LIFE\", you could say something more interesting in lecture than \"there is a child drowning in a lake. do you save him? most of us would save him.\" After the first two or so weeks, when you realize, after looking at the notes you've been taking down, and realizing that they just say the same three ideas over and over again for a length of four pages, you will start zoning out. It's a great time to send emails, plan your homework schedule for the week, or fantasize about the hot guy you saw in the dining hall. And then you'll realize that you can do all of that--or even better--sleep or watch netflix--from the comfort of your room. So you will stop going. And you will likewise realize that the readings are a big fat waste of time, because they do not contribute to your academic success in the class. The first thing that contributes to you getting a good grade is your participation in section. Anyone at Yale is intelligent enough (well, most people) to say something meaningful in section without having gone to lecture or done the readings, because presumable, most of us have thoughts about LIFE. The papers, the second avenue to success, are nothing short of a fruitless pain in the ass. You will moan when you see the topics. You will come up with something you think is interesting to say. And then your TA will respond with comments like \"Good Argument. Well Written. All the bread and butter of a good philosophy paper. B\". Because Shelly has pretty much told them not to give As. Which is whatever. But there isn't actually any way to \"work hard\" in this class, in so far as you hope that \"hard work\" will payoff in terms of grades. It is an easy class to get a mediocre grade in. And given that attendance is totally irrelevant, and section is kind of fun some times (the only fun part), hell, take it if you want. But if you came to Yale to be stimulated, to learn, to be excited by your classes because they are taught by the best people in the world--of which Shelly Kagan is supposedly one--then DO NOT take this class. You will be severely disappointed. And you will get angry when your friends laughs when you say \"I haven't been to one lecture since spring break\", because there is simply no way to convey how meaningless and empty the lectures are, without having taken it. Although, I now think, as I write this, that I did learn something--LIFE lectures are a metaphor for life itself! Meaningless, void, entirely too long and also somehow over in the blink of an eye (assume you daydream like I do). Oh but wait, I already knew that about life. So I guess that brings me back to: this class taught me nothing. Happy Shopping!",
    "After a whole semester of this class, I'm still not entirely sure how I feel about it. Sure, it's a great Cr\/D class, but I feel like I could have taken a class I would have gotten more out of. The sections are absolutely wonderful - that's pretty much the only place I actually learned anything. Shelly Kagan's lectures are fine, and sometimes they are even great. The problem is that sometimes he essentially rehashes the readings, giving you no motivation to actually read them yourself. It's was also hard to make myself get up and go to lecture since none of the material we covered was strictly necessary for any sort of assessment. Altogether, I'm ambivalent. Take it at your own discretion.",
    "Very interesting class. Definitely worth shopping this class and engaging in the topics. The readings were my favourite thing about this class.",
    "take! not too much work. interesting and worthy exercise\/thoughts",
    "I would, but if you are not willing to go into the TA and\/or Shelly multiple times to review your paper, it should be taken Credit D. He is a good lecturer and a very smart, thoughtful guy. I think his insights definitely shed light on some important points in our lives.",
    "Good fifth class to take. Definitely take it credit\/d",
    "Interesting lectures, but the papers are hard",
    "Yes, absolutely. Shelly is the best professor I've had at Yale. Every lecture, he models how to think clearly about tough questions. Take either this or \"Death\" Cr\/D. I loved it.",
    "Yeah but only take this class for credit.",
    "take it Credit\/D to adjust to phil essay-writing",
    "Great class! Not much work. Lectures and readings are very interesting. Will make you think about life in a new way.",
    "A course everyone should take before leaving Yale. Whether or not you agree with Shelly's point of view, he makes you think about things that are relevant to our stage of life. He makes it interesting too, and not too much work.",
    "I definitely would not recommend it to another student. The lectures aren't interesting and the grading is pretty ridiculous; I'm definitely happy i took it credit\/d. I can't say that I took anything away from this course no matter how hard i tried.",
    "I would recommend taking it credit D",
    "This course is not your standard philosophy course. Each week one aspect of life is covered (eg. accomplishment, career, children) and thoroughly examined. There are three five-page papers, which are not to difficult if you are competent writer and attend lecture. I would wholeheartedly recommend the course to literally any student. Life is something we must all deal with, so it is important to know how to live it well. This course is not an instruction manual, but will certainly help you figure out your own priorities nonetheless. TAKE THIS COURSE.",
    "Yes! Definitely take this class! Do it!",
    "Great class. Some people like it. Some people don't. But it covers a lot of questions that you probably won't be thinking about now, that you almost inevitably will have to think about one day. After all, we only have one life. Might as well try to understand how to make the most out of it.",
    "You get out as much as you put in. If I had done all of the readings, gone to every lecture, and really gotten into the material, I think the class would have been amazing. I took it cr\/d so did not prioritize it over other classes, and while I still enjoyed it, I definitely didn't get out as much as I could. Very easy cr\/d class--I think in general Shelly's hard grading is over-exagerated.",
    "I'm a Phil major, and I found this course stimulating and rewarding",
    "I would recommend PHIL 179 for students who are interested in philosophy but have not had much exposure, and are looking for a non-textbook based, relevant course.",
    "Take it, but only if you can credit\/D it. Ridiculously cruel grading. For no good reason.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to another student. It may be a bit difficult in the beginning if the student doesn't already have a background in writing philosophy papers, but as the course progresses there will definitely be growth.",
    "Take it if you honestly care about questions like \"What makes a life valuable?\" or \"What do I really want from my life?\" The class functions best as an excuse for you to question and think more deeply about your personal goals and beliefs. If you're not going to do that thinking yourself, you won't really get anything out of it. Professor Kagan is a great lecturer, as you probably know, and please take advantage of the fact that he hangs around after class to talk to students for however long they want. Even if you don't have specific questions, it will almost always be worth your time. For the essays, if you're not going to take the class Cr\/D\/F, the way to succeed, unfortunately, is to write very simple, possibly trivial arguments where each premise, term, and deductive step is clearly defined and appropriately hedged. If you do that (the grading method seems to be that you start with a perfect score, then lose points for each aspect that is not fully justified or explained), you'll do fine.",
    "Great lecture. will be one of your best sections.",
    "Take it credit d - really interesting and worthwhile class!",
    "A class worth taking just for the sake of taking a class with Shelly Kagan. It's also just a great class to take because it makes you ask important questions that I'm sure we've all thought about, but haven't taken enough time to thoroughly think about them.",
    "Take this class if you want to force yourself some time to think. The papers are harder than you might think for being 5 page papers, but they allow you to take the time to consolidate your thoughts and take a position on an issue. Professor Kagen is interesting, but don't expect him to give you the answers to life.",
    "One of the best classes (and definitely the most entertaining) I've ever taken at Yale. Everyone should definitely take this class; it gets you thinking about some of the things that are arguably most important in life - love, friendship, children, careers, etc., and ask ourselves how we would like to make decisions regarding them in our own lives. We get to explore some philosophical viewpoints about these topics in the readings, although the lectures are still really comprehensible and interesting even without the readings. Workload isn't that bad: just three 5-page essays for the semester. Overall a really solid class.",
    "Life is a puzzling class for sure \u2014 you'd likely take the class for Shelly Kagan, who is undoubtedly a fantastic lecturer. But the really interesting thinking goes on in section, in the readings, and in writing the papers. The lectures end up being very broad in scope and were never particularly insightful. Of course you're not going to come away from this class with the answers to life, but I thought the lectures were at their best when Kagan attempted to argue a slightly controversial point instead of working with existing platitudes. Meanwhile, the readings explore specific arguments in-depth and the sections are also a great way to discuss specific thought experiments. Overall I think this class is worth it just because of the conversations it generates with your friends and classmates \u2014\u00a0if the strength of lecture is really important to you, if you feel like you must \"learn something\" concrete from a class, or if you already engage in philosophical conversations regularly, then maybe I wouldn't recommend it. Take it credit\/D to remove all stress \u2014\u00a0it is true that the grading is more difficult than most classes, but I think that part of it is also somewhat overblown. Adam leads a good section as the TF if he's available again.",
    "yes.",
    "Yes, it made me think a lot about important things.",
    "Great senior spring credit\/d",
    "I'm a senior. Couldn't care less.",
    "Solid introductory course to philosophy. You actually get to \"do\" philosophy. I recommend starting it Credit\/D\/Fail if you have a choice, simply because the grading might throw you off a little.",
    "As a second semester senior, I was looking forward to engage in reflecting back on my life experiences so far and this class was perfect for helping me do so. However, the class does not provide any answers to the themes discussed as is usual with philosophy classes. So it is probably not a good idea to take it if you like concrete answers about any of the topics discussed. It really stimulated me to think about issues\/topics that I had taken for granted before or hadn't given much thought about. It's a great class for a second semester senior wanting a light course schedule (provided they take it CR\/D\/Fail). The class has only three 5-page papers and no exams.",
    "Eh. Not great, not terrible. I did all the readings, worked hard for the essays, Cr\/D'd it just because (2nd semester senior). Having friends in the class made it enjoyable. Otherwise I wouldn't have taken it. It was a good first exposure to philosophy. But don't expect to come away enlightened. Kagan wasn't worth the hype.",
    "Definitely take this class. You learn important things. Everyone should spend time thinking about the topics that are covered.",
    "Inspiring, thought-provoking, excellent. As an econ major, I started taking this cred\/d but switched to a grade after doing really well on my first two papers - hopefully my overall grade doesn't take a nosedive after my third (and final) paper of the course... We'll see. Even if I end up with something below an A-, this course was so worth it because I got a lot out of it that I would not have gotten otherwise. It made me less judgmental about other people's behavior because now I can analyze motives and beliefs and actions through philosophical means. This is the longest evaluation I'm writing this semester; my other courses were not worth writing a paragraph about, some more so than others, but this one deserves all the praise it can - and surely will - get.",
    "Take it, it's fun. Take it credit D and it's fun and chill. I recommend the second route. Don't consider this a class to learn specific things. You'll learn a little about how philosophy works and get to mull over some interesting topics.",
    "Great credit class that has minimal work and interesting material",
    "yes completely.",
    "Taking this class credit D was not bad. It was thought provoking, and enticed me to do some self-reflection.",
    "PHIL 179 01 is the course Life. It is a course everyone at Yale should take. One reason to take the course is because it gives you an introduction to philosophy. Philosophy is a unique major and, because everyone has an internal voice, something we all should have a way of analyzing in a proper way. The course looks at topics such as love, giving, education, and the meaning of life. Not all the topics are analyzed equally, however, the reading lists are the types of resources an individual can go back and read over the summer or many year later. Take this course. We are all currently living life. I would recommend this course to any type of student on Yale's campus.",
    "This was a fabulous Credit\/D 5.5th credit. I think it would be good as a more serious class also, but for me it was great because there wasn't very much work (only 3 5 page papers), you didn't need to do the reading to follow the lectures, and the lectures brought up really interesting ideas that I hadn't had a chance to think about much before. Shelly also encourages you to really think for yourself: this class is much more about doing philosophy than learning about what the great philosophers have done before.",
    "Take it credit\/D\/fail. But take it!",
    "Life is a great class. It's a great concept, given another year or two it'll develop into an even better class. Take it! Take it Cr\/D in the beginning because Kagan is a harsh grader (wasn't a problem for me somehow, even though I'm a freshman who never studied philosophy before this) Do the readings, but you can coast by without them -- only 3 papers to write on incredibly open ended topics.",
    "Interesting class if you really want to ponder everyday things.",
    "Great class; take it by all means.",
    "A great credit d\/fail class. It is worth it to take it in either your sophomore or junior year. Not too much work, and you learn a lot about life in it. seriously.",
    "Yes, take it as Credit\/D!",
    "Would definitely recommend. Great way to start philosophizing.",
    "To anyone who is interested in really thinking about life and what the best life for them may be, I would recommend this course. That being said, one should be aware that this can be a long and tedious process, and while some weeks the lectures may be very interesting, others may not be as exciting to discuss. Shelley Kagan is a great lecturer, but also has a harsh grading policy, so this is a good course to take Credit D. That being said, if one is willing to put in the time and effort to write and rewrite the papers, one can do well in this course. The workload throughout the semester is minimal in terms of readings, but the papers do require a lot of work and section participation is weighted heavily."
