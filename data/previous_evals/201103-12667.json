    "Take the lab. Marta is great, likely the TA will be, likely your classmates will be. You will get so much more out of the class.It is a LOT of work, especially during finals when you have the lecture paper and final as well as the lab final and curating your collection. But it's worth it. Go to Florida if it's offered. Our whole lab went and had a great time. Completely worth missing the game once you make that hard decision.",
    "Definitely take bugs lab. This is one lab at Yale that really enhances the lecture. I think I got much more out of the lecture because I had learned so much about the orders of bugs from the lab. It's also a great way to get off the Yale campus for the first few weekends of the semester, and you get to go to Florida over Thanksgiving break.Fair warning though: I think I put more time into this class than I did into any of my other classes. There aren't any lab reports, but you have to learn to identify all the insects, and making your collection takes A LOT of time. I was in the lab for at least four hours a day for two weeks before the collection was due.",
    "Awesome course - tons of fun, great prof, great way to get to know a random collection of classmates really well. Time-intensive (curating your collection at the end of the semester takes 15-20 hours on average) but never really feels like work, and you'll be genuinely proud of\/excited by your collection by the end. If you're at all intrigued, take it for sure.",
    "The lecture is good, but the lab is AWESOME. The trip is incredible, and the people who end up taking the lab are very cool. It is just so cool to come away from a class feeling like you know a chunk of nature, and with a bug collectionto show for it. Prepare, though, for a huge amount of work during reading period--and be willing to sacrifice working in other classes for this one. Overall, it's totally worth it.",
    "First half of the course: field trips!Second half of the course: curation! And MANY hours in lab.Lab is awesome. This was my first lab class, and I don't think I would take another science course without the lab component after this. There's just too much to learn and too much excitement to be had from getting your feet wet.Marta is amazing. Rich is amazing. And the kids in the class are generally enthusiastic, supportive, and willing to geek out about bugs.A couple things to keep in mind: lab is a lot of work, especially at the end of the semester. I took it during a 5.5 semester and that was a bit much. Also, develop a system early on for material on the quizzes. I'd recommend two sets of flashcards -- one with images on one side and names on the other and the other with names on one side and attributes on the other. It's just crazy to keep track of everything otherwise.Also, go into lab before quizzes and use the teaching collection to study. Helps an IMMENSE amount with ID-ing.",
    "Amazing class. You absolutely must take this before you graduate. It offers a type of hands-on experience that you will get in no other class here. Tons of field trips, an amazing teacher, and you learn a lot about insects. Do it! You won't regret it!"
