   "comments": [
    "If you want an introduction to comparative politics it is actually quite good. The lectures are vaguely dry, sometimes just a rehash of readings so you will find yourself doing things online or other work. However, the readings are really good.",
    "Good intro course. It familiarizes you with some interesting bodies of work.",
    "Don't take it.",
    "Adi Greif is amazing",
    "great intro poly sci class.def take it.",
    "This was a hard class and there wasn't really any structure.",
    "Political Science 116 basically takes different questions (What causes civil wars? What is the difference between democracy and dictatorship? How do states form? Does economic development lead to democracy, or vide versa) and explores them. Students read different academic articles& theories, which are then summarized and critiqued in lecture. Learning to effectively critique an argument is a big part of this course, and is expected in the three short response papers (2-3pp). Other than that, there's a midterm and a final, and a weekly section todiscuss the readings.I'd recommend this course lukewarmly--though the subject matter is interesting, as a rule it seemed like none of the articles could come to a conclusion that we wouldn't tear apart. Additionally, a large percentage of lecture time was spent summarizing the assigned articles, which made for less than engaging lectures, though perhaps Professor Lawrence will change that for next year. On the other hand, you can learn a decent amount from this course (its a great overview of the field that covers many different authors) and the papers are a really interesting, low-stress (they're short) way to engage with the material.",
    "I would recommend PLSC 116 only if the student is really interested in the subject matter. Personally, I found the main ideas of the course fascinating, and the readings and lectures have truly informed my understanding of political systems around the globe. As a freshman and likely political science major, I felt the course was an excellent base for further study of international politics. However, for a student only casually interested in political science, the readings may seem dense and the lectures not quite engaging enough. Adria Lawrence is fairly new to teaching the class and is obviously still working out a few \"kinks\" in the course. My advice is to shop the class and look closely at the syllabus before deciding whether or not to take it.",
    "This course is a great introduction to Comparative Politics. Be warned, however, that this course is NOT about comparative GOVERNMENT. Rather, it focuses on broader themes such as the development of democracies, sources of civil war\/ethnic conflict, and how authoritarian regimes maintain power. The most important thing I learned from this course was actually how to analyze and think about political science literature.While a few readings are tedious, most are manageable and actually quite interesting. The workload is average - readings every class (about 60-80 pages per class) and three short papers throughout the semester. I would recommend this class to anyone who is interested in looking at sources of conflict and democracy across the word - Adria Lawrence is a GREAT lecturer and is very clear and engaging.",
    "I would recommend this class only to political science majors seeking a basic introduction to international case studies and the methods of research\/presentation associated with the field. Otherwise, I think there are more interesting political survey classes for the non-major to take.",
    "I would recommend it to anybody wanting an intro to politics course.",
    "Comparative Politics was a blast--especially with Prof. Lawrence. I have only taken one other political science course here at Yale, but this one is by far the best. The short response papers were not a hassle, although the midterm is surprisingly difficult, and the final was a pain--two 6 or 7 page response papers. The lecture was definitely good and professor Lawrence enlivened discussion with her personal anecdotes and statements throughout the course. If you are like me and don't want to go through political science taking gut classes because--to be honest--political science is filled with gut classes, then this class is a must--especially for an introductory class. In comparative politics you actually got the opportunity to read academic papers and critique them, which personally gave me great satisfaction as other political science courses that I have taken seemed to lack a component of information synthesis and critical analysis.",
    "I would recommend this class for another student. It was useful in learning about the major theories in the field and definitely provoked my interest in comparative politics.",
    "I would absolutely not recommend thiscourse to another student. The political science department, if it is actually interested in getting Freshmen to be interested in the major, has some serious work to do.",
    "I'd recommend the class to those who have an interest in political science. It's a good class.",
    "I would recommend it. It's an interesting class. Not too hard, not too easy.",
    "I would not recommend this course to a fellow student. I took this class as an intro to the field of political science, and I was completely turned off.",
    "Poli Sci 116 will introduce you to ALL kinds of topics in Comparative Politics. You will learn from things as varied as religious riots to state-making to how sewage can be used as an indicator for political effectiveness. This is a great course that I recommend to anyone who wants a basic understanding of the social, political, and economic dynamics of today's world.",
    "Don't. Yes there is great material. Yes, it is a great introduction to comparative politics, but you will regret going to class because it gets very repetitive and very superficial.Given intro courses are not are requirement in Pol Sci, dig a little deeper and find a course you can truly be passionate about.",
    "PLSC 116 is a very solid course- not amazing or inspiring, but you learn a lot and read interesting material. I would recommend it."
