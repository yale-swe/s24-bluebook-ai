    "Math 120 is a course centered around problem solving and geared primarily at people who will be applying the techniques to another major. It's not really a course taught for the love of math. If you were an IB student in high school, the de-emphasis of critical thinking and greater emphasis on memorizing specific equations and problem setups will be a disappointment. That said, there are some really cool concepts involved. PICK YOUR INSTRUCTOR WISELY. Some are amazing. Some are terrible. No, you don't need to get Miki, but shop a few sections and make a careful decision. There is a lot of material to cover and you can't afford to fall behind, so if you can't get the clearest instructor, at least get someone who is willing to take the time to offer help.",
    "Math 120: overview of multivariable calculus, just as it says on the tin. That means taking like \"derivative\" and \"integral\" from single-variable and dealing with them in 3-D! Kind of fun if you have Miki or Kyle or Susie, although it's pretty rigorous and the tests are tough. Take it if you need it for your major or if you're very fond of calculus, I'd say.",
    "Challenging. Be prepared to study a lot.",
    "If you do not need this class for your major, if it's only recommended for your major, or if you just feel like taking a math class, I would recommend taking this Cr\/D\/Fail. I found the material incredibly difficult, and I would have needed to spend an ungodly amount of time reviewing every week to keep up with the class. There are resources, however, to help you out. The instructors have office hours every week, and they're very helpful. There are tutors available, and this semester we had optional weekly review sessions.",
    "If you really want to challenge yourself with a difficult class that has a bad curve, only take it if you get Miki as a teacher. She is the best at explaining the difficult material in a way that is easy to understand and comprehensive.",
    "Very difficult. Exams are always hard."
