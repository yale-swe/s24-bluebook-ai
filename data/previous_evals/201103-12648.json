    "An introductory course of reading music and basic music theory, with some (not a lot) listening. I would recommend.",
    "Music 110 is a great, low stress intro course for people with little or no knowledge of music theory. I did a few years of piano when I was young, so I came in knowing the basics of reading music, but it isn't necessary for the class. Shop the different sections - I found one of the instructors unbearable, but I switched to Ben's section, which was great. I'd recommend it as an easy fifth class for anyone with any musical background.",
    "If you know nothing about music and wish to learn theory, then take it.",
    "I would recommend this class only if you have a reason for taking it. If you do not have experience with music and you don't have a particular passion for it, this may not be the right class for you.",
    "It was a great intro to music class! Even if you have played music before, you will learn something new!",
    "I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in learning about the structure of music and has played some sort of musical instrument or plans on playing one in the future.",
    "MUSI 110 is an introductory course in music theory, featuring some listening and performing parts. It is intended for absolute beginners and covers all the basics from rhythm and pitch music notation, major and minor scales, to triads and cadences. I would recommend it to another student because it's organized very well and I've learnt a lot while not feeling I had to study a lot, but just enjoy learning about music.",
    "It is a quick run through of basic music theory. I would recommend it to people interested in learning basic music theory, but be aware that it is a class that needs to constantly be worked on. Even though it is a \"introductory\" music theory class, be prepared to be in a class with more advanced students."
