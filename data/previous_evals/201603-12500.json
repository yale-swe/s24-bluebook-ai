    "probability theory, Lebesgue integral, hypothesis testing.",
    "I learned the underlying theory of confidence intervals, point estimation, and hypothesis testing.",

    "A strong understanding of the mathematical underpinning of probability theory and asymptotics.",
    "Basics of measure theory, probability theory, asymptotic theory, estimation and test",

   "comments": [
    "Strengths: Professor Andrews is a fantastic teacher. The course is very organized and the lecture notes are like a mini-bible of knowledge. It's clear he's perfected the notes and the teaching structure. Weaknesses: It's fast paced, and if you don't have a strong background you will need to work very very hard.",
    "One TA section per week was too few. Two would have been really helpful. Also, I found the homework proofs very challenging and sometimes hard to get started. Some hints could have been really helpful to make sure I was heading in the right direction.",
    "It could be better to spend less time on probability theory and more time on statistics.",
    "Don Andrews and his notes were great.",
    "The course was extremely organized.",
    "I think the class is well designed.",
    "The homework questions sometimes seemed to outpace the lecture material.",
    "Strength -- well-organized class and lecture notes Weakness -- Questions of homeworks are almost the same every year",
    "Our instructor's deeply engaging and profoundly interesting style of teaching is the biggest strength of this course. However, the assignments were sometimes too long and tough and did not add a lot of value to my learning."

   "comments": [
    "Yes. You probably have to take it, but it's worth it.",
    "Clearly, it's an essential course for anyone trying to develop an economics skillset. For someone with a weak math background, a prerequisite course would be very helpful.",
    "Yes, it lays a solid foundation.",
    "Yes; I learned a lot; it is also mandatory for the first year PhD program.",
    "Yes, I learned a lot.",
    "It is the best way to gain confidence with the basis of probability and statistics at a pretty deep level.",
    "Yes, if you have some knowledge about linear models and statistical tests but have never seen rigorous treatment of them.",
    "Yes, this is a great course on probability and basic statistics. Professor Andrews is a great teacher.",
    "Yes",
    "Yes. I'm sure you can develop basic knowledge of mathematical statistics by taking this course.",
    "Yes, I would highly recommend this course to all students in quantitative PhD programs as these concepts will be of great use in future research."
