   "comments": [
    "I learned a lot of different cool applications of BME.",
    "I gained knowledge about the different research opportunities that are available for me after I graduate.",
    "I gained greater exposure to the different applications of BME research, a lot of which were suuuper interesting. I also learned how to write research proposals and to think a bit more creatively in a way that other BME courses have not had me to do.",
    "Learned more about the kinds of research that BME faculty are doing and got a broad sense of what BME as a field can do",
    "A bit of writing skills.",
    "You get to work on your writing and presenting skills and learn how to write a project proposal. You also got to see all the different work that BME professors are working on which is pretty cool.",
    "This course was a good survey of what Biomedical Engineers work on and do. It was great to learn about new innovations in the Biomedical Engineering field and what researchers are working on. The course required some technical writing which strengthened my ability to write research proposals.",
    "I learned to question and actively engage with research papers and presenters, as well as how to write a proper research proposal for a grant.",
    "Of the Yale BME curriculum, this was the class that taught me to think the most like a BME researcher and looking back, I really appreciate it! I have to admit, as a senior required course, I wasn't that excited to take this at first and thought it would be a mundane series of speakers and written papers. Sometimes, it was like that when we had un-engaging speakers. However, most of the time, I found the speakers to be inspiring and came away with a greater understanding and awe of BME research.",
    "I primarily got to work on scientific writing (primarily that of research proposals, which I had never done before), which I found very useful and incredibly rewarding. I enjoyed the creative exercise of thinking of a research topic, and would have liked to have more creative prompts like that in other classes as well.",
    "I learned how to write critical reviews and how to develop an NIH grant proposal.I think these skills will be useful since I hope to continue in the engineering field. It was also interesting to learn about all the exciting BME research occurring a Yale.",
    "A greater exposure to cutting-edge BME research in a variety of subfields. More experience writing formal scientific work.",
    "This was really just a mandatory survey course of several BME-related labs. I learned a lot about the potential paths to academic research and how they each tie into BME. We also read a lot of papers, but, because of our disparate tracks, we had different levels of understanding of the reading material."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The writing aspect of it was very frustrating, but the speakers were very interesting and engaging.",
    "This course should have been either a sophomore or a junior level class, not a senior seminar. It was a good overview of what's happening in BME at Yale and if it had come earlier on in the curriculum, it would have been helpful in choosing an adviser for a senior project. However, this class was not incredibly useful at all and on top of that, it was often disorganized. We often didn't know what the actual expectations for presentations or papers were, and although the assignments got us to engage with some of the *broad* topics we were learning about, I didn't really see the point in a lot of the assignments especially after all of the courses we've already had to take in BME.",
    "Strengths: an incredible exposure to all of the different types of BME at Yale, very informative, engaging and interesting, diverse Weaknesses: this course should be offered earlier in the undergraduate program. By time we are seniors we all have interests and have worked on getting into a lab and such. This course could be a freshman\/sophomore year course that displays the diversity of BME and provides motivation for getting into the major.",
    "This class should be offered earlier on in your BME career so you are introduced to professors and their lab work. It would help you find something interesting early on for your senior thesis.",
    "I think a lot of the strengths and weaknesses were already mentioned in the last class but here are some more I could think of: Having a basic outline for making the presentations and receiving feedback faster on graded assignments. Also I feel like there was a large disparity in how Professor Tagare and Amanda graded, so it was hard for me to gauge how well my writing was.",
    "I think that the course is well-intentioned and interesting. Weaknesses: - Sometimes the presenters either go to technical or remain too broad.",
    "As discussed in class, this course could be offered to BME undergrads even earlier in their career, because it enables students to familiarize themselves with the nature of the work that different labs do at Yale.",
    "The strengths of this course are its breadth of BME topics covered, the practice students get in writing scientific papers and proposals, and the independence students have in constructing their presentations and papers. The weaknesses are that as a speaker-based course, it's sometimes unpredictable what class will be like (either mundane and uninteresting or super engaging). The grading for individual assignments could be a littler clearer by having more comments and feedback.",
    "I believe that this course is organized in such a way where you either have very little work or a large amount of work. We were given very little time to do the final proposal, which added a lot of stress to the hefty project. I also feel as if there was little guidance in areas where guidance would have been helpful. For example, the instruction behind our presentations were not very clear. Many of the groups had little idea of what was expected in the presentation.Other than that, both Prof Tegare and Amanda were always available and willing to help.",
    "I found it incredibly informative to hear from professors about their research, but would have preferred if this course (or a similar one) were offered earlier on in our academic career. I understand that the purpose of the course was to help us choose a lab for our senior project, but I came into the class already having made that decision, as had many of my classmates. I think an earlier exposure to professors' research and an opportunity to talk to them directly would have been better.",
    "I think the course was good in that it exposed me to the BME research at Yale, and I think my writing improved. Also, it wasn't too much work in the beginning. However, I think that there was little guidance in this course. We were expected to write papers without really knowing what the TA or professor was expecting. Since I don't have a strong writing background, it would have been helpful to have the professor guide us more on the papers. I felt like there was no way for me to have control over my paper grades as it was largely subjective.",
    "My comments are probably addressed in the others, so I won't repeat them too much. This course just needs to appear earlier in the major or not at all. Most STEM people are driven and find labs by searching on their own, either by looking at the faculty website or asking around, not by being spoonfed a survey course. That's what I did both my freshman and sophomore year. I'd rather have a class like BENG 404 or MENG 489 than another lecture about things I won't ever be able to do.",
    "Strengths: Interesting material, wide variety of research topics, not super intense in terms of workload, nice listening to lectures about research (in addition to solely reading papers). Weaknesses\/Areas for Improvement: The group project should absolutely be eliminated, most simply for the reason that there is a huge disconnect between the amounts of work that different individuals put in. Greater clarity in terms of feedback on assignments would be much appreciated.",
    "We went over a few potential improvements during our last class meeting: having industry speakers (because we felt funneled into academia), figuring out which speakers would be best suited to the class's interests ahead of time, and clarifying work expectations. We appreciated that the workload was decreased from the previous year, but most of the grade was contained within the last few weeks of class, when many final projects and papers were due for other courses. A bit more structure or a clearer rubric for each paper would be appreciated. Additionally, if this was intended to be a course to discover potential labs to work on senior projects in, it should be scheduled earlier and have guest speakers from BME-affiliated labs only."

   "comments": [
    "This course is mandatory, but I really hope that they change the format of it for the future. As it is right now, it feels like a bit of a waste of time even though some of the lectures are pretty interesting. Hopefully the class gets better organized in the future, but as it is right now, it's a bit hard to understand the assignment expectations or why we're even doing these assignments in the first place.",
    "It does not really matter if I recommend it or not. If you are a BME major, you have to take it. That being said, it is a good class. Definitely much better than most BME electives.",
    "Listening to the faculty members speak about their research was not only engaging, but also really, really interesting, and it was an opportunity that I am thankful was a requirement for senior year.",
    "I would recommend it if you are a BME major!",
    "If you're taking this course, it's probably because you have to since it's a BME requirement. However, I found it very enjoyable--the more you put into it, the more you'll get out of it. The lectures presented by professors are genuinely fascinating, so if you would like to learn more definitely read as many of their papers as you can. In addition, it reminded us all about the cool things that you can do with our major; I think that sometimes can get lost throughout our learning.",
    "This course is probably required for most BME majors. I think it is a great class that all BME majors will enjoy.",
    "Required course :)",
    "This would be an interesting course for students in the underclass who are trying to figure out whether or not they want to continue pursuing BME. However, as it stands, it is mandatory for seniors and not really scheduled for anyone younger to take."
