   "comments": [
    "Can better understand the current political climate and the history behind it",
    "I learned a lot about how the American Government operates. I learned about expression by way of understanding how ideas and values become represented in politics. I gained a lot of knowledge about the progression of ideas and system dynamics in our national government. And much more.",
    "I learned a lot about the American system of representation and how our current structure of governance has deviated from what representation meant at America's founding.",
    "I loved this course, a great seminar for anyone interested in American politics and some insight into why the current climate \/ key political events in history are such.",
    "I learned a ton about the different types ideas of representation in American government and politics.",
    "Learned about American Political History, and specifically how our representative institutions have evolved and adapted over time. I had studied American history before (obviously), but found that I learned a lot of new interesting facts and phenomenons that I hadn't before (for example, the invention of the presidential mandate and responsible party theory). Also just interesting to look at American history through a political lens, and try to understand how our democracy works. As far as skills, I just learned more about writing, there are three essays and the professor gives really good feedback. Also, with every essay you're asked to come up with a creative solution to a problem of representation, so you also work your creative skills a bit. Felt I learned a lot.",
    "This course provided me with a very good general lay of the land of the political science literature in all of the topics we discussed. Professor Dearborn was very thorough, and I appreciated his rigorous presentations that he prepared for each class on the week's readings.",
    "Taking this course clarified the development of different representational institutions throughout American political history. It forced me to think critically about which different institutions within government represent the people best and how we can work to fix a polarized system. The class's response papers additionally helped me develop clear, logical arguments that synthesized large amounts of information.",
    "More detailed theories of presidential and Congressional representation and how styles of representation have changed over time."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: Classes were always interesting. The course material was always reviewed thoroughly in class and we were always able to ask questions about any of the material we did not understand.",
    "Strength is the way and order that information and ideas are presented by the instructor. The connectedness of the ideas presented were not totally clear to me at first, but as the class went on, my understanding of the teachings and their dynamics became apparent.",
    "Strengths: Class format (breaking up the class into half lecture\/half seminar, plus including memes\/videos, was very helpful for me, especially for a 9:25 seminar), very clear presentations, well-selected readings, strong essay feedback Weaknesses: Nothing really! I think I would have enjoyed getting a chance to research a specific race\/district or certain phenomenon in representation that we couldn't really do within the bounds of the response papers, though I understand why John structured the class the way he did\/with a final exam. I also really would have liked to do more on the differences in how white people & POC view the state & \"representation\" conceptually, though we covered so much ground that I'm not sure what I would have taken out to give us more time.",
    "John runs through the readings, some of which were theoretically dense, in a very clear and in depthl way. The structure of class was great, and even left 10 minutes or so for us to ask questions about the week's political news. The grading rubric and essay prompts were also very clear, and students knew exactly what John was looking for in our work.",
    "Strengths: - Engaging Lectures from Professor - Interesting Course Material - Professor did a great job explaining and making the course understandable",
    "I think the structure of this course is very conducive to deep understanding of the material and promotes excellent discussion in class.",
    "Lecture is very good, the material is interesting. Don't have many critiques, the readings were do-able and interesting as well. Wish I'd done more of the readings honestly, the ones I did were really engaging. Got bogged down by some of the really long ones, but most are worth doing. I liked the essay prompts and the assignments so no complaints there. Would love to actually talk more about American history, I know it's hard to do, but the best lectures (in my opinion) were the ones that mixed history and concepts well, not the ones that focused more on concepts. The one thing I'd say is that the class is branded as a seminar but is mainly a lecture. There are discussions at the end of class, but I think that more could be done to stimulate this if the goal is to have it be a seminar. It's a good lecture right now, but if the goal is to make it a seminar, some changes should probably be made. Maybe get more class participation during the actual lecture? By no means essential but could be fun to have more discussion questions throughout lecture to keep engagement up. It's just a long class.",
    "Strengths: very targeted and relevant course readings, the presentations were always relevant to what was going on in the news, Professor Dearborn is extremely knowledgeable about everything we were learning and answered our questions very directly and with the information that we needed Weaknesses: I wish that we had more lively discussions about the seminar questions that Professor Dearborn prepared for each class, but part of it was that the room that the course was taught in was not particularly conducive to discussion in the first place",
    "The strengths of this course are that the readings assigned are interesting and Professor Dearborn is an incredibly dedicated teacher. Professor Dearborn created slides summarizing all of the important parts from the readings for each class, which ensured that everyone came away with important the most critical insights. I find it frustrating when discussions in other seminars feel meandering or unfocused - in this class I always felt like class was well structured and I learned something from Professor Dearborn each day. Additionally, he was always free to meet and go over essay topics. As for weaknesses, I think the fact that all of the readings are gone over in such depth during class means that writing the response papers can feel a little bit contrived. I wished they were on a topic that required more than just regurgitation of the points from the class slides (there was always a part of the essay at the end that was more creative - I wish the whole essay required more thought as that part did). I also wish he gave line edits on our papers rather than just filling out a rubric at the end. I sometimes felt as though I wasn't getting much feedback on the particulars of my arguments, but rather just a report on whether I checked the right boxes.",
    "The instructor was extremely well organized and his slides were probably the most useful I've seen in a course at Yale. It was taught more like a lecture than a seminar, which may have been a good fit for 9:25am class in which more than half of the students were athletes."

   "comments": [
    "Yes - great professor and course. Very informative and really helps you understand past and current political events.",
    "Yes if you are interested in the functioning of American Government.",
    "If you're looking for a class to examine American politics more institutionally and want to work with both Congress & the presidency, I would!",
    "YES, absolutely. Especially to students who have taken Intro to American Politics, this is a great one to take afterwards. I would also recommend any course offered by John Dearborn, he is a great teacher. I learned so much in class but also during office hours or when I met to discuss the papers. He is so insightful while being so positive and encouraging.",
    "100%. Professor Dearborn really helps his students to grasp the concepts, helps in their writing, and presents material in a way that engages his students and retains their interest",
    "Yes I would the material is very interesting, readings are not overly long and arduous, lecture is very engaging, and we had very interesting discussions in class.",
    "Definitely, if you want to learn about America's representative institutions throughout history, and just become a better educated voter it's a great class. Cool to understand more about how democracy works, how it's changed and that it isn't a static thing. The professor is also great, the essays are actually fun because they ask you to think about solutions to problems as opposed to just summarize lecture. Also, I came out of the course with a few opinions and beliefs about the American political system that I didn't have when I went in. Fun to look at our institutions critically in an unconventional sense, I felt like we critiqued and examined institutions that often aren't critiqued enough in normal dialogue (like the separation of powers, or independent agencies). Really fun and stimulating class, highly recommend.",
    "Yes, 100%, especially if you have had some previous political science exposure and are looking to supplement this with a class that covers domestic American political concepts in greater depth.",
    "I generally would recommend this course if you have any interest in American political history. You should know before going in that at least half of each class in Professor Dearborn lecturing about the week's readings, but I generally found that to be helpful. Go to office hours on the essays and make sure you're thorough. The workload isn't too bad, especially if you start the essays a few days in advance. Professor Dearborn is happy to talk about literally anything related to American politics in class - if you have questions, bring them. He always has an interesting perspective and is just generally a nice guy.",
    "I enjoyed the class discussions. The readings were reasonable."
