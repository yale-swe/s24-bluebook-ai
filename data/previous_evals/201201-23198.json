   "comments": [
    "Great class. You get to read amazing texts and they are definitely worth it. be prepare to do A LOT of reading and writing. It's defintiely do-able. But this class is going to be one of the more difficult ones. That said, if you enjoy reading...take this class! 4 papers, 6 reading responses, 1 final.",
    "It was fine. Not my favorite class (I really don't think Ulysses should be read in such a short amount of time. Doesn't do it justice) but if you really want to read these books at some point in your life I would recommend taking the class.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student. The reading and the professor are great.",
    "This is a wonderful class. Take it!",
    "Epic is a great class if you like the sort of books covered in the class. I'm no humanities major, but I really enjoyed this class. It's a LOT of work since you're reading six gigantic, difficult texts, but I found them all quite rewarding. Prof. Pravinchandra is great, too. She always pulls interesting discussions out of the class, and her feedback is invaluable.",
    "Take this course! You'll read six awesome books that, frankly, you probably would never read otherwise. And reading them together and chronologically makes them way cooler.",
    "In Epic you read 6 epic texts. It's a lot of reading, so only take it if the books really interest you. I mainly took it for Ulysses, so I was surprised how much I enjoyed The Odyssey and Dante--so don't write the class off if you think you don't like classics. Take it, but be prepared.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class! Books I wanted to read but probably wouldn't have ever mustered the drive to slug through. At times a mountain of reading (ok, most of the time), but so worth it. Advice: budget your reading according to the last class of the week, so you'll be ahead on say Tuesday and won't drown (or not do the reading) in between Tuesday and Thursday.",
    "If you want to read these texts - take it. It'll take work and lots of it, but you will be glad that you took the class and pat yourself on the back for having read Ulysses. Also Prof Pravinchandra is amazing, asks good guiding questions in class, super approachable, gives great advice and is friendly in office hours. You won't regret it.",
    "Yeah, if you want to read and write a lot, or are really interested in reading the course books!",
    "This is one of the courses you must take at Yale. The reading list is superb. All of the books are books that you should read before you die (so might as will get them done now). The course load is very heavy (150-300 pages a week and essays), but completely worth it."
