    "This class is hands down the worst class I've taken here at Yale. In the past, I've gathered the strength to give a bad class a funny review, or mock the professor, but this class is too horrid for any amount of levity. The professor will ramble on about tangential topics for lectures on end, only to test on material that he should have been covering. He will assign massive problem sets (10 hours a week if he's feeling nice) and proceed to return them back with minimal feedback. He makes absolutely no effort to make the material vaguely interesting, preferring condescending lectures in which the class is given a problem to work on in 30 seconds. Upon the obvious dumbfounded failure of the class to figure out new material on the spot, he proceeds to power through solutions, leaving the handful of us who actually went to class in the dust. If you have to know whether you should take this class, the answer is simple: Do you like pointless work? Being talked down to? 10 hour problem sets for a prerec class? Laughably bad TAs? Then boy oh boy is this the class for you. If you have any measure of self-respect and aren't a complete masochist, you will avoid this class like the plague. For heaven's sake, take math 120, watch Khan Academy, read the book and do the practice problems teaching yourself, do ANYTHING but take this class. You'll thank me for it.",
    "Challenging course but I would recommend it over 120.",
    "I would recommend this course on two conditions: you like math, and you're a very fast worker. The concepts were difficult; the material moves by fast; the p-sets are long; and Prof. Ismail-Beigi expects a lot from his students. However, if you do put in the work (or most of the work, in my case), you will get a lot out of the course.",
    "This class will teach you multivariable calculus quite well. The midterms will really strain your GPA. But the problem sets are reasonable as long as you put in sufficient time.",
    "yes",
    "Would recommend. Much more engaging and entertaining than its equivalents. At the cost of more challenging workload, the student understands the mathematical concepts at a much higher level."
