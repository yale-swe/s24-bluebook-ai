    "Definitely! A really engaging, higher level course.",
    "This class is an excellent introduction to evolutionary medicine, a topic that I knew very little about before I actually took the class. The course faculty is amazing and accessible -- it consists of four professors who are all experts in their respective fields and who are eager to teach. The class readings can sometimes be dense, but are usually extremely interesting. The class is a mix of undergrads and grad students (PhD and MPH students) so it makes for an interesting discussion. Additionally, the class helps you get funding for a summer research project, which is amazing. Sometimes you will feel intimidated by the level of discussion in the class, but you will learn so much from it. There is also a lot of reading that you MUST do. This is a small seminar, so there's no room for hiding! That being said, take this class if you can get in!",
    "Take it if you get in! You read three to four papers a week and discuss them. You're asked to think of your own hypotheses and it's a really liberating experience. it could be intimidating but you learn a lot.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. It is amazing and will teach you so much about being a critical and thoughtful reader of scientific papers and about how to speak about a diverse range of topics. Every discussion was interesting. There is a decent amount of reading, but it is all interesting well-worth your time. A few times a semester there is a guest speaker and then you have dinner with them afterwards, which is a lot of fun! Definitely a must-take class.",
    "I recommend Studies in Evolutionary Medicine wholeheartedly if you are at all interested in evolution and\/or medicine. This class has done more than most to expand my mind and expose me to some of the really important, big ideas in a field that I care about. I also gained confidence in my own ability to critically analyze the research literature. The level of discussion in the classroom is exceptional. Professor Stearns expects a high level of engagement from everyone in the class, but don't be intimidated - the material is so interesting that you can't help but be engaged. One of the best parts of the class was the four visits we had from professors at other universities. We had ample opportunity to talk with them not only about their research, but also about their lives and the paths they have taken to get to where they are, which was always inspiring and enlightening. The only written work required for the class (spring semester) is a proposal for the research you will do over the summer (which you will turn into a paper in the fall semester). The readings each week are fascinating, and completely reasonable in terms of quantity.",
    "This is a wonderful course. The workload is very little in comparison to other higher-level courses (about 50 pages of journal articles etc per week). Most of the written work comes fromt the final research proposal; however, you'll probably have written something to get funding for summer research. You also get a tremendous amount of help from all of the course faculty (it\u2019s a ratio of ~5 or 6 faculty to about ~12 students). I would heartily recommend this course to anyone interested in medicine or public health.",
    "The course is mostly discussion and very student-driven. It relies heavily on doing a large amount of reading each week and coming to class ready to provide input. you will get lots of public speaking practice, and will learn how to discuss research articles. The course reminds me of a journal-club like environment, and it is nice when the professors offer varying opinions as well."
