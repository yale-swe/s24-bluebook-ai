    "I gained a lot of knowledge about the function of ecosystems and how to examine ecological analyses. Additionally I learned a lot about my project ecosystem as well as how to conduct research well with others.",
    "I gained valuable insights into planning, executing and evaluating progress on an independent research project working in small teams. The instructor and the teaching fellow were both stellar and taught us insights into biogeochemical cycles and ecosystem science.",
    "Understanding how the carbon and nitrogen cycle works in relation to cycling and climate change. Also, I improved my perspectives of what might become nature based solutions to climate challenges.",
    "A broad understanding of ecosystem and landscape sciences, biogeochemical processes and a more critical eye for research methodology.",
    "Unfortunately, I felt like I ended up leaning on existing skill sets to get through. The content felt sort of scattered and I didn't feel like it built upon itself.",
    "I learned that animals affect nutrient budgets and gained an understanding of how nutrient cycling and budgets work in depth.",
    "I honed my understanding of biogeochemical cycling.",
    "How to look at landscapes in a broader context and think about the different components that need to be considered when thinking about different management objectives. I expected this class to be more science-y but I was very pleasantly surprised. This class challenged us to think about what makes good science and how to ask questions.",
    "I learned about ecosystem science and the role of uncertainty in climate modeling. I learned to work alongside grad student in a group and to comb through research to find estimates that were necessary for our final budget.",
    "A huge, broad overview of ecosystem science. There was so much information packed into the class!",
    "Ecosystem budgeting",
    "Mark and Eli have done a phenomenal job developing a curriculum that teaches critical assessment of academic literature and literature review!",
    "I learned how difficult it is to prepare an element budget. I also learned a bit about nutrient cycling and soil, which I otherwise might not have been exposed to.",
    "A broad knowledge of the field of ecology, including material flows, soil science, science journal article writing and reading, evolution, animal behavior, and ecosystem measurement.",
    "great informayion about nutrient cycling and processes by which it happens in different systems.",
    "Ability to construct a nutrient budget",
    "the connection between nutrients, organisms, ecosystems and humans. How to analyze an ecosystem. How to read and interpret scientific articles.",
    "I learned a lot about nutrient cycles and systems in Prof. Bradford's course. In particular, I had deep engagement with the carbon cycle because of my group project. These were new skills for me and so very valuable.",
    "The exercise of modeling an element's movement through an ecosystem under different conditions was very insightful for me and helped me to recognize the complexity of ecosystem management. This course also improved my ability to think critically, both in the analysis of scientific journals and in the consideration of ecology and science in management decisions.",
    "This course was excellent in content, in teaching methods and teaching style. The course covered ecosystems from the abiotic to the biotic, from bacteria scale to whales. I found the written 'critiques' highly valuable in sharpening our critical skills and skepticism in evaluating scientific articles. Class discussions were inclusive and discussion breakouts were a great method to engage students more deeply in the material. I loved it! The one place I struggled was with the team project dynamic. I completely support the intention of the course and the institution to assign students to team projects. It is 100% rationale. Students will be working on interdisciplinary teams. And I did not personally enjoy my particular group dynamic. There were uneven levels of commitment to doing our best work. I did not succeed in finding a satisfying way through that.",

   "comments": [
    "I did not expect the class to be so project focused, rather I expected the whole class to be more like the first half of the semester -- lectures and paper reading\/critiquing. However, I really enjoyed the project aspect of the course.",
    "Very well",
    "At the beginning, I was concerned that the scope of the course was focused on primary production (soils and nutrients) but later I appreciated the interaction between the primary level and secondary level-ecosystems and landscapes.",
    "I was expecting this to be more of an ecology-esque class, but I haven't ever taken a class that focused on nutrients moving through the ecosystem that it was all good",
    "This class exceeded my expectations",
    "I thought this class would be more about the nuts and bolts of how ecosystems function and how to manage them. It ended up being more about the merits of scientific methodology and designing experiments. Not that this was a bad thing, it just wasn't where I expected the class to go.",
    "Beyond expectations!",
    "I was surprised at the scope of the classit's really much broader than just ecosystems and examines so much science in a (mostly) comprehensible and engaging way. This was a net benefit of the class for sure, not something that should deter future students.",
    "I learned more than I thought I would! It's also structured in such a way that I think I was learning and I didn't realize it. Mark Bradford is sneaky that way.",
    "Very well-- the syllabus does an excellent job describing the content of the course.",
    "I honestly didn't have terribly high expectations, so on the plus side, I ended up learning slightly more than I expected to. I don't really understand why this class is called \"Ecosystems and Landscapes,\" because it doesn't feel like it covers much at those larger scales. A course title about soil\/elements\/chemical processes would give a better picture of what the class covers.",
    "There was a greater focus on material flows in the soil than I had expected.",
    "Thought it would be a bit more ecologically focused.",
    "It aligned well with what I expected",
    "Very well. I expected to learn more about ecosystem management.",
    "I was not quite sure what to expect from Prof. Bradford's class. I took it purely because it was a core requirement for my degree and I liked Prof. Bradford, so that is a challenging question to answer satisfactorily.",
    "I expected a typical landscape ecology course, where I would be learning about the natural world and its components, but the course offered a much more reflective view of ecology itself. I found this to be new and helpful in my own development as a student and environmental manager.",
    "Very well!",
    "The course matched my expectation."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of the course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The lectures and the projects were definitely strengths of the course. Around the mid-late part of the semester when most of our class time was used to discuss readings or papers was less useful and engaging. It would be helpful to be reminded in the class before that we are going to discuss readings so students can put more effort into reading the papers beforehand.",
    "Strength: The professor is very engaged and geniounly interested in the students. Weakeness: At a very high level (since the class was so good); I would have liked the instructor to present how to build a nutrient budget earlier in class as this was the main project of each group.",
    "Strengths 1. Balance between lecturers, discussions and group work 2. Connectedness between the faculty and TA and students Weaknesses 1. The lectures are science heavy and could be challenging with persons with limited ecological background. 2. The group discussions in class could be better organized by assigning groups and discussion points before class.",
    "see question 11",
    "I enjoyed the paper critiques as they made me more aware of how little we know and how difficult it is to make a management decisions. For the nutrient budget project, I never felt like I had the tools to make the budget and understand what the numbers truly meant. I wish we had down a sample budget as a class and went through it in depth so that we could understand better what was going on in our ecosystem.",
    "I liked having a semester long project that I worked on witgh a group.",
    "The beginning of the course was really dense (going over nitrogen cycle) and a little discouraging but then I really liked how the course expanded to focus more on how to understand and question science.",
    "Mark is a smart and enthusiastic professor. He moves quickly and talks fast, so if you zone out (as I often did), when you come back, you'll feel like you missed a lot. He uploads the slides to the canvas page but doesn't always include enough info on them that you can catch up with at home. Luckily, he also videos all of his lectures, so that was really helpful to me. It was a really strong course overall.",
    "The one piece of feedback that I have for this class is that there isn't a huge amount of accountability for the learning. Without an exam, I didn't feel like I need to completely internalize all of the material and so even though I know we covered certain concepts, I don't actually know them. I read about them, I heard the lecture, but I can't explain it. I don't know what the answer is though...",
    "No improvements could be made. Mark and Eli made the course very adaptive.",
    "My biggest critique of this class is that it is possible to do well (grade-wise) without actually understanding much of the material in the course. Problem sets might be a better way to regularly assess understanding of the material than the group projects; additionally, writing papers as a group can be a pretty painful process, which could be avoided because the course content doesn't demand this format. As far as forming the groups goes, I think it may work better to form teams and then choose a system to study, rather than the other way around. Preparing the element budgets involved so much guesswork and making so many assumptions that it felt fairly futile. If there was a way to provide data for actual sites that students could choose from, that might be more productive. On the strengths side, I appreciated that the course went beyond the science and covered management considerations, as well as some larger philosophical questions.",
    "The course and the professor were engaging. The classes had a balanced mix of lecture and interactive learning \/ discussions. I loved the discussions overall. I would have liked them even more if they could have gone deeper and people were encouraged to respond to one another and find strength's and weaknesses with each other's arguments, as opposed to occasionally getting into a purely \"yes, and\" mode or \"listing of ideas\" mode. IMPORTANT: I think students should not be required to take the foundations course \"Ecological Patterns and Processes\" class if they take this. There is a lot of overlap. The administration told me that I did not have the option to wave out of \"Ecological Patterns and Processes\" because I was taking this, but I think if they thoroughly looked through the lecture slides and syllabi as I have now done, they would change their mind.",
    "Mark clearly knows so much and is a wonderful and dedicated teacher. Sometimes he knows so much and doesn't know what to do with it and loses some students. The projects were really helpful and I learned a lot from exploring a particular cycle",
    "I thought the paper critiques and discussions of the strenghts and weaknesses of various methodologies, as well as the way positionality affects research, were useful for understanding how to use and interpret scientific knowledge. It wasn't particularly challenging or new for me since I'm now in my second year and many of my courses have included similar critiques, and I already had a background in many of the things we covered, but took the course because it's required for my concentration.",
    "Strengths: Good overview of the scientific consensus and disagreements in ecosystems science. Interesting lectures and readings. I enjoyed the discussions in class. The reading critiques were a good training and it was very helpful to read the other critiques as well. It was very interesting to hear about current developments in the scientific world (for example the p=0.05 discussion). Weaknesses: The comments in the discussion section on canvas that were required for the reading critiques were too short to be of value. An additional discussion section would have been nice to have more time to talk about the social science side.",
    "Ecosystems and Landscapes is a quality class that taught useful skills. Prof. Bradford is a thoughtful instructor. I enjoy him quite a lot as a person and he is extremely knowledgeable. I felt grateful to learn from him. I think he knows this, but he talks too fast and goes down esoteric rabbit holes occasionally in class. It is hard to follow when he does this, but not prohibitive to learning. Most of the time, students just stopped him and asked him to slow down a bit. Eli was also very available and a thoughtful TF. I liked the group work. Much of the course is designed around a single group project. This is a very comprehensive \"deep dive\" into material of interest to the group. It also taught some inter-personal group skills. My group did not always get along due to some strong personalities, and navigating that felt much like navigating group work in-the-field. As for improvements, I think there needs to be a way for the lectures to follow a more linear narrative. The lectures often felt like thoughtful, but occasionally random or disconnected lecturettes. I wished there was some way to weave everything together more completely. I would also honestly suggest a midterm. I found myself not doing the readings and actually hoping for some accountability to that material.",
    "I thought that the course was successfully built around one large assignment and enjoyed the opportunity to look into one particular application in depth. This assignment allowed me to apply other aspects of the course and internalize an understanding of parameters and uncertainty. I also thought that Professor Bradford's lectures were thought-provoking and interesting, and I appreciated the wealth of constructive feedback. I felt like the course could have better incorporated materials in the readings, but overall, I thought the course was taught very well.",

    "Students should come in the course prepared to engage with complex scientific papers. However, the faculty is always willing to help. Also, flexibility is desirable.",
    "If you majored in environmental sciences in undergrad this seems like a great class for thinking critically about the field.",
    "Pick a project that you're interested in since you and your group work on it all semester. Also go to office hours.",
    "Take it! I was reluctant to take it because it was required and I felt like I was giving up taking another course and it was hard for me to understand Mark sometimes but it turned out to be one of my favorite classes. Meet with Mark and the TA anytime you are confused and they will provide great feedback and really listen to your concerns\/course suggestions.",
    "Students who are self-driven will do well in this course, while students who know that they will slack if given the chance will quickly fall behind. Those students who fall behind in this way won't necessarily see that impact their grades, but the class is dense enough in material that they will quickly zone out in lecture and continue to slack off with regard to the readings. It's important that everyone who takes this class is honest with themselves about how much graded assignments play a role in their motivation to do the work, because in this class it's pretty to BS your way through without putting in lots of work.",
    "Engage with Mark\/TA.",
    "I wouldn't take this class unless you're required to.",
    "It is an engaging, fun, and educational intro class into ecology.",
    "It's a good class but not well defined. If you are an MF, do not expect to learn skills you use day-to-day as a forester. Honestly, it may be missplaced a bit as an MF core requirement. Find a good group for the project and do so by asking questions about the skills and interests of your classmates. If everyone writes well but has no hard-sciences background, maybe find someone who does. You want a rounded group. Do the reading for your own good!",
    "If the course maintains a similar structure in future semesters, I would recommend a careful consideration of the ecosystem and nutrient you will analyze in the main assignment for the course.",
    "When choosing a group project, focus most on finding compatible teammates. That turns out to be more important than the topic you choose, IMO.",
    "Talk to Mark before making the decision- it's helpful to check if your previous experiences have covered the materials in this course."
