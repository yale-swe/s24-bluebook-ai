   "comments": [
    "It's a wonderful setting for learning a foreign language. It's a decent amount of work, but you come out of it better at French than before. There's definite, quantifiable progress and that makes the class satisfying.",
    "If you are taking this class, you most likely are required to, so a recommendation doesn't make much of a difference. I think it's a great class, so you're in luck that this is your requirement. Meeting every day and having work every day is a pain in the butt.",
    "This is a L3 language course. For people having taking L1-2 I'm sure it's much of the same. If you do the course packet and pay relative attention in class I don't predict any problems.",
    "I do recommend this course! Even for someone getting back into French courses after having taken them for years -- definitely a good place to start. The literature and movies were enjoyable and the work was not too repetitive. You get what you give, in every way.",
    "Yes, I would recommend FREN 130 06 for another student. It was a very comprehensive study of the French language at that level. It moves at a manageable pace, and the professor was an understanding and very helpful teacher."
