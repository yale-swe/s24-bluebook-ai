   "comments": [
    "The course covers really important topics. You really learn epidemiology, and learn how to effectively read articles in epidemiology.",
    "great course. the topics chosen for the course really helped you start reading the scientific articles better",
    "I learned so much from this course!",
    "It is good in terms of giving a fundamental idea of the epidemiology. Just too easy.",
    "Strengths- Instructor and TAsWeakness- The quizzes and test question can be better",
    "The strength is that it was comprehensive, the weakness is that it was targeted too simply. Adding a PhD section with perhaps additional assignments might be an idea for the future.",
    "The course is a great one and not yeah one to miss !!",
    "I thought that some of the concepts could have been explained more clearly - I found that her explanations of concepts were sometimes unnecessarily confusing.",
    "helpful and informative",
    "some improvement in ppt",
    "I thought this course was excellent. I am someone who does not have a strong science or math background and was tentative coming into the class. I found the class very challenging, but learned a great deal. I would actually say that this was one of my two favorite classes this semester, which I wouldn't have expected coming in. I feel that what we learned in this course was very practical. I thought having a discussion section to go over the homework assignment each week was very helpful to supplement the lectures, which were very instructive.",
    "Very interesting material.",
    "Strengths:I really enjoyed her powerpoints and how they complimented the reading material.Tested often which helped the concepts sink in deeper.The Friday section was great because it allowed me to develop friendships with my classmates that is hard to do in such a large class.Weaknesses:Large class size.Hard to participate in Winslow.Spoke a lot about epi terms that I wasn't very familiar with (i.e. certain STDs)",
    "Really great course - I sincerely hated typing up most of the homeworks, however - typing math-heavy answers is really annoying, and takes forever.",
    "I thought the material was a bit repetitive and the course moved slower than I would have liked. A few of the exam answers were graded inaccurately.",
    "The course is structured adequately. The division of coursework and constant quizzes and homeworks facilitate the grasp of the material.",
    "Strengths: introduces students to all of the basic contents of epidemiology and its practice.Weakness: some of the material is complex enough that it may warrant more time for explanation.",
    "Strengths: learn about a lot of things that I think everyone doing any kind of work in health should know (study designs, biases, risk ratios, etc.)Weaknesses: I don't think the testing style is conducive to an assessment of our understanding of the material, so much as it is about deciphering ambiguous wording.",
    "The course is interesting. powerpoints are helpfulHowever:1. the quizzes are more like test. There should be a greater emphasis on the format of the first quiz.2. people ask irrelevant questions in class that waste time. The instructor should limit answering these types of questions.",
    "Wonderful class! Always enjoyed coming. Homework was thought provoking and interesting.I did find the difficulty levels on all three quizzes to be very different, however I am not sure how to better break up the material. Perhaps more practice questions for Quiz 1 would be helpful since these are fundamental, yet tricky, concepts to grasp for people brand-new to graduate school (and some out of school for several years).",
    "I loved this class! The textbook and accompanying reading materials complemented lecture material and Dr. Niccolai was always available to answer questions when I was in need. I really enjoyed the material and lectures.",
    "Overall this course provided a slow and thorough introduction to the basic concepts of epidemiology and was very useful for me. The course was extremely well organized and had a schedule involving regular homework, review sessions and quizzes that made it basically impossible to fall behind. The lectures were thoughtfully prepared and the content was appropriate. The main weakness of the course is its failure to treat some of the quantitative topics with sufficient depth.",
    "Great TFs, really made the class work in addition to Dr. Niccolai's lecturing style. She has clear slides, present clearly, and adds humor into an otherwise dry subject.",
    "It is a very important course, although it can be taught better.",
    "great class- well taught, clear, easy to understand, the homework helped hammer down important concepts* I liked how we looked at real articles to see \"real world\" applications",
    "strengths - include total base of epidemiology, which helps to know the all principles of epidemiology",
    "Good overview of epidemiologyImprovement: change the time of section! No one wants to be there on Friday morning. Yale College sections take place all throughout the day, even later at night (~8pm), but there are very few on Friday mornings.",
    "Lectures were organized and structured. Homework assignments were provided early and supported material taught in class. Could spend less time reviewing articles and focus more on the rudiments.",
    "Definitely a great introduction to epidemiology. Very-well explained, clear course.",
    "- Very organized- Great turnaround on marking assignments- TAs were very involved and responsive- Love the sessions. Very good for reinforcing concepts and making a large class feel more intimate.- The structure of the course really worked with how I learned. I liked weekly assignments and frequent quizzes. Thought it really reinforced the materials.",
    "Strengths - clear presentation of the material, great introduction to epidemiologyWeaknesses - very tailored to first year graduate students who are scared of math, puts other students at a disadvantage as the course engages certain concepts at far too superficial a level (almost unnecessary to distill it so intensely) and certain concepts are conveyed to be memorized rather than to be understood out of fear of scaring the students with 'too much math.' Some questions on the different examinations were just wrong, and while it's okay to simplify the material, it's not responsible to convey knowledge that is actually incorrect and also be unwilling to engage these errors.",
    "The curriculum is very well designed and layed out. The weekly homeworks ensure that we keep up with the material, but they aren't graded which takes the pressure out. The quizes are all fair. I can confidently say that I understand the basic epidemiological concepts after having taken this class.",
    "Felt like a lot of work but covered a lot of material and ultimately I felt like the way it was taught supported integration of the material and was very good at preparing you for exams.",
    "It would be wonderful if it was a smaller class, but that may not be feasible...",
    "A very solid course that is accessible to everyone regardless of math background. You will develop a strong foundations in the fundamentals of epi and be able to understand pretty much any peer-reviewed literature as well as apply the tools that you learn.",
    "I learned an incredible amount about epi in the first semester. I had no background in the subject, and now I feel well-versed in the vocabulary and able to read and interpret epidemiological studies.My biggest complaint with the course is slightly trivial. I think that its misleading to use the term \"quiz\" to characterize the assessments through the semester. In my experience, quizes are generally quite short. These are (more accurately put) are 6-8 page exams. Of course this is not a huge deal, but for a first year expecting a quiz, the length and depth of the first exam was a little shocking.",
    "I thought this was a really great course \u00e2\u0080\u0093 I feel like after taking the course I have a strong understanding of the foundations of epidemiology. The content was very clearly presented in an orderly fashion \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the powerpoints were very clear, easy to use to take notes, and easy to study from. Occasionally there were a few points that were a little bit unclear from lecture but Professor Niccolai was good at following up to clarify those or I was able to get clarification from the TAs during the discussion section. I really liked the structure of the class with two lectures and a discussion section each week, weekly homework, and quizzes often \u00e2\u0080\u0093 I felt it helped me keep up with the material and learn it better.I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see any real weaknesses with the course. It might have been interesting to see a little bit more of where the field of epidemiology&epi methods is going (what are the new thoughts in the field, are there new ways people are thinking about doing public health research?).Overall \u00e2\u0080\u0093 great class! Really good experience.",
    "Great class, I wish there was a little bit more correlation between the textbook and the course material. The slides were great and very comprehensive.",
    "It's a great course and it outlined very well. It's organized well. The slides are great, and the material follows the textbook closely so that provides another source of learning. The material is at the appropriate level.",
    "I think this course is excellent. The readings (text and manuscripts) were well-chosen and perfect companions to the lectures. I think the format is excellent, and the discussion sections are well-utilized in clarifying material and applying concepts discussed in the lecture.",
    "This course was excellent - it was taught very efficiently, and I felt well supported throughout. No weaknesses come to mind.",
    "Too much workload and too many classes. But the instructor is excellent !",
    "The course is absolutely great. The strengths far outweigh the weaknesses. Strengths include the lecture content and organization (one topic blended seamlessly into the next). One weakness might include the class size for purposes of participation.",
    "The discussion sections help very much with learning the material. Class lectures are presented very well. The slides are structured very well.",
    "Strengths: good organization of material, clearly presentedWeaknesses: not enough time in lecture to have discussions\/ questions",
    "A wonderful introduction to epidemiology, I feel like I have taken away a ton of new skills from this course.",
    "This class was good. The homework was helpful but became tedious and seemed like busy work at times. The discussion section was great and helped clear up any confusion. The lecture slides were clear and easy to follow.",
    "It is well put together and the instructor and TAs really work together to make it a wonderful experience",
    "great course, no improvements necessary",
    "Great course! I liked the powerpoints a lot. Printing them out for class was super helpful.At the beginning I was surprised at how hard the homework was in relation to what we were taught in class. Everything in class seemed really straightforward and then the homework was hard. I realize she wanted us to take things to the next level ourselves, but perhaps some examples in class on how to do things before having to do it in homework would be helpful. Then again, I realize we do that in section.",
    "This course was excellent! The material was well taught and organized.",
    "Great class, though I wish that we had more time to cover the material.",
    "great",
    "Definitely a good class",
    "well organized, lectures were clear and well planned, material was presented in lecture, section, and the homework so that we were well prepared for the tests",
    "I loved how organized the course was. The quizzes really helped solidify the material learnt and the weekly homework were really beneficial. I think the way the course is structured is great.",
    "it's a good course, but it is a lot of work, which can't be avoided, it just is what it is.",
    "I loved this course. I am a management student, so this will be the one and only epidemiology course I take. I found the content to be stimulating, engaging, and applicable to real life situations. There are a lot of assignments, but they truly helped to obtain a better grasp on the information.",
    "I think the course is very well designed and organized. It is very helpful to build up my foundation in epidemiology. Even though the workload is a little greater than other courses, looking back I think the homework and quizzes are necessary to reinforce the concepts learned in class and master the use of the formulas in practice.",
    "Great course! Covered a wide range of material that will be very helpful in the future.",
    "Strengths: intentional instruction, current-day examples, drilling down of nuances, weekly discussion sections, cumulative reviews prior to each quiz\/examWeaknesses: 1 more class should have been devoted to reinforcing the Quiz 1 material prior to the quiz, would have liked more than 12 hours between the pre-quiz super TA sessions and the quizzes themselves.",
    "This was a great course to start the public health program. The weekly homework assignments were very helpful in understanding the concepts. The discussion sessions with the TAs were very helpful as well. I really enjoyed this course!",
    "Linda was always very nice and friendly. I liked attending her lecture. She would occasionally get mixed up in class, though, which was frustrating. The first quiz was out-of-control. Way too lengthy and that really hurt my grade, which is unfortunate.",
    "I think it is a great class and should continue to be mandatory. In terms of evaluation, it would be nice to gant redemption in the final for sections that cover the same material as on the midterms",
    "This class is all about memorization and how fast a student can complete tests rather than understanding the information.",
    "I appreciated the format of this class and learned so much. Lectures were boring at times , but anything that I did not understand in lecture were clarified during the recitation on Fridays. The homework assignments were a lot of work and could take over 8 hours to complete. However, as long as you made an effort to complete it, you got credit for the assignment. In addition, the recitation sections were very helpful. The homework problems the,selves were a very helpful way to help us learn the material. My one criticism about the class is that some of the quiz questions were a bit vague.",
    "The course gave a good overview of epidemiology without going to in depth.",
    "Excellent course. The instructor devised a great way to walk her students through the material. Her lectures were interactive and complete and the examples drawn from YSPH faculty tied the material together for the students. Overall excellent course!",
    "Good",
    "Strengths- the TA sessions help break down the material into a more manageable workloadWeaknesses- mostly lecture based and HW's were very long",
    "This was my favorite class--very well-organized, interesting, solidly taught. Section each week was really helpful, as were review sessions before tests. The class can be a lot of work each week with the homework, but the homework were very very helpful.",
    "Very interesting material presented in an easy to understand way.",
    "The course was easy to follow, well-organized in a way that built current lectures upon the previous ones. The lecture slides were very easy to follow and learn from.",
    "This was a great introductory epidemiology course. The lectures were a strength. They were clear and well organized.",
    "Although the workload was much heavier, it seemed necessary to really understand the content.",
    "Homework assignments and quizzes helped to check for understanding throughout the course.",
    "Strengths are experienced teacher and quality teaching TFs. Subject material is hard, especially as differences between book and lecture material occasionally occurred. Weekly homework was a good model of test material, but would have preferred having extra practice problems or a workbook of problems. Smaller lecture sizes or ability to rewatch lectures (e.g. video lectures) may have improved course for me.",
    "This course is not particularly interesting because it covers the very basics of epidemiology and study design, but the professor did a good job of keeping us engaged.",
    "This course was fairly interesting and mostly presented an overview of epidemiology research techniques.",
    "This course was well organized and well taught. The instructor said initially that she likes to test early and often and this happened - and it is a good strategy. Having the discussion sections each week with a set of in-depth questions due is a good teaching method - it encouraged regular work and solid learning of the material. The instructor and the TAs were all enthusiastic and clearly committed to helping students learn the material. I enjoyed this class and learned a lot.",
    "Good course.",
    "Excellent. Throughout the course I was able to read scientific literature with a greater understanding. Very helpful.",
    "important",
    "discussion session is very helpful to fully understand the content of the lectures. Literature applied to illustrate concepts are really helpful too",
    "Tough to say; my interest in the material was very low... If I have any complaints they're that 9am friday morning sections were brutal. Kind of a tough course (some low test medians -- 75 on the first test) but not necessarily overly so. Cavils, really. Teacher and TAs great.",
    "Strengths:-Discussion sessions are very helpful to review class work.",
    "The course provides a good basic knowledge of epidemiologic principles and how to apply epidemiologic skills in practice.The structured outline of the course and the combination of the lectures and discussion sections were excellent.",
    "The course covers the essentials of epidemiology and in general, public health. It is a much needed core course. Some of the concepts are tedious but important nonetheless.",
    "STRENGTHS: Having the lecture notes posted before class was awesome because I was able to print them out and fill in additional notes as necessary during the lectures. The posted lectures were very detailed and extremely useful for studying and reference. BEST LECTURE FORMAT EVER!! The weekly homework assignments and discussion sections allowed me to apply the concepts discussed in class and to identify any difficulties so that I could ask questions. The same is true for the quizzes and the quiz review sessions. WEAKNESSES: none IMPROVEMENTS: none",
    "Strengths:Instructor and TAs were accessible, friendly, student oriented and very generous with their time. They were genuinely interested in students and pedagogy.Weaknesses:The homework and the exams\/quizzes questions were sometimes difficult to interpret (wording could have been clearer). A lot of emphasis placed on rote memorization of the concepts.I don't know how much of the material I will retain. Some of the more time consuming aspects of the course were memorization of the equations. I don't know how useful this is, since there really isn't a situation where this would happen in the real world."

    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Dr. Niccolai is a very thorough, engaging and clear instructor. I would not say she is a strong examination writer, the exams could be strengthened in terms of clarity. She is interested in feedback, but not with regard to how poorly some exam questions are written.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0I think Professor Niccolai is one of the most effective educators I've ever had. Her teaching style at first comes off as basic, but over time, I realized that that's exactly how an intro epi course should be taught. She explains things very clearly. Her lectures are very well designed, each PP slide is generally very effective at conveying the message.I also sensed that Professor Niccolai genuienly cared about students' learning, something that doesn't always get conveyed by professors. I could also tell that she put a lot of time and energy into planning the course. A successful course requires great effort on part of the student and the professor, and I think that definitely happened with this course.",

    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Professor Niccolai is a great instructor. She makes the material very digestible, and the fact that she quizzes often makes it so that you are forced to keep up with the material and learn it better.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0She is so warm and approachable. Somehow all of her calculations and questions would go differently than planned, which was unfortunate. This is obviously not her fault, just bad luck.Her email methods are her biggest weakness. Often she would make key announcements in class really briefly, and these could have used reminders by email. A common situation would be, \"OK Class, all we're going to do today is review the practice exam that was on coursework. I wont be projecting a version of the questions here, so if you didn't print them out you are out of luck. Why is everyone giving me such a confused look? Well, here we go.\" This happened exactly like this literally two or three times, and I learned quickly from my mistakes to bring printouts. International students around me all had a difficult time following the questions, especially the ones that we covered so quickly, such as multiple choice, and sometimes students would ask, \"Wait, was that b or d? Does anyone know?\" and all six or seven students around would have no clue either.Otherwise she was great!",

    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Prof. Niccolai was a very good instructor. Her lessons were funny, interactive, and thought provoking.I would ask the professor to be careful when providing feedback to students that participate in class.

I enjoyed the lectures and learning from her own professional experiences and expertise. However, I believe she got lost a few times during several of the lectures, which distracted from the learning experience.

But overall, she did a fantastic job and I really enjoyed her lectures.",

It is not only instructive, but fun! Though it was quite challenging, I learned a great deal and would absolutely recommend it to other students.",

    "Well taught, extremely useful - really solid introduction to epidemiology. Work-intensive and very quantitative - the homeworks take a long time to do.",

    "I would definitely recommend this course. I tprovides strong foundations for Epi and can be taken and understood by anyone (without Epi background).",

However, I feel much more equipped to read scientific papers and evaluate them critically. I also love that we discussed the policy implications of what the research means. This is very useful for me in the roles that I want to play.",
