    "I could not recommend this seminar more highly. Butler is an amazing and very caring professor; the readings and final projects are fascinating. Take it!",
    "Take it if you want to strengthen your analytical skills. Not too much work. A fair amount of thinking.",
    "This is a good course, if a little unfocused. It's really fun to look at a variety of aspects of state governments in the US and think of experimental designs to take advantage of them.",
    "I would recommend this course highly - excellent research design component and a great professor. If you've taken Statistics beforehand, you'll find the readings more manageable than if you haven't.",
    "Take it if you're into stats. Prof. Butler is great.",
    "Definitely. Low workload and a great class if you want to learn how to write a good social science research paper.",
    "I would recommend this class, but only if you know you have an interest in political science research design. Let me emphasize, research design - meaning how to look at issues of representation and election using data and statistics, most typically using a regression analysis. Although various issues are covered, we did not talk at all about the normative aspects of elections and representation, but rather the effectiveness of different research approaches. The workload is not bad, the readings are manageable, though they are often somewhat boring. A good knowledge of statistics is also extremely helpful for understanding.",
    "I really enjoyed the material, and gaining a deeper understanding of how our electoral and representative system really worked. However, some of the more technical lessons of the course were a little harder to grasp. Overall a really good course if you're interested in research, okay one if you're not."
