    "Yes! This class is amazing if you want to learn lots of repertoire and have fun doing it. Professor Lalli is also an incredible instructor and you'll grow as a singer and a performer.",
    "If you want to learn a lot of music in a non-stressful environment and get used to singing a lot on stage, this is the class for you. It is a ton of fun! Take it!",
    "TAKE IT. I'm not a music major but love singing and really loved this class. Professor Lalli is awesome. It involves full class on Tuesday nights and that would always be an interesting surprise, from listening to folk song renditions to performing ourselves to learning group pieces to working on pronunciation to talking about collectors and other related music history. Almost every week we would do coachings with Sara, our amazing pianist and just as much the teacher in the course. Every now and then we would have coachings with Professor Lalli. Sara was excellent for helping with pronunciation and all the minute details, and she has a way of providing criticism that is both fully honest and kind. Professor Lalli is excellent at technique and getting through to all of us in different ways. He's very quirky, opinionated, and hilarious, and might make you do very odd things (like running in place while singing, serenading another student), but more often than not they'll help. It was amazing to watch him work with other students in class and see the transformation. I feel like I've discovered a whole new voice under his tutelage. It was a really fun class because it's so small and we all got along well, enjoying the concerts, sometimes dueting, and having dinner at his house at the end of the semester."
