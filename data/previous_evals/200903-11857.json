   "comments": [
    "For psych majors I feel it was a pretty easy Research Methods course. I haven't heard anything about any of the others though. Other than that I don't see why anyone else would take it.",
    "I only recommend this course as a requirement, or if you are truly interested in the ethics of psychology. Though Professor Clark is a lovely woman, the course is so disorganized as to be frustrating.",
    "If you need to take it for the major, take it with Professor Clark. She makes the material more interesting. Also, the workload is manageable and the tests and papers aren't bad at all.",
    "Only take it if you need to for the psych major. Take it as early as possible when the information may be new to you.",
    "well, you're probably required to take this class, so just know going into it that it'll likely be confusing at times- there's a lot of logistical stuff that gets messed up. but if you focus, you'll actually learn a lot of useful things about research.",
    "its required. that's why you woudl take it.",
    "If possible, avoid this class. It has the potential to be useful but in actuality is extraordinarily frustrating. If you must take research methods for the psychology major, take the other ones.",
    "I would not recommend it, but some kind of research methods is required for psych majors.Do not take it if you are not a psych major. If you are a psych major, try to get a more exotic variety of research methods, like animal studies or neuroscience or something.This class needs some dramatic changes if it is going to be interesting to Yale students.",
    "NO. If you have to take it, pray that Professor Clark isn't teaching it. The class will still be boring and somewhat useless, but at least it won't be infuriating and painful. It seems like you learn nothing-you go in thinking it's going to be a joke-and then somehow it turns out to be nearly impossible to do well in.",
    "I thought this course was fine. Considering what I had read about past research methods courses, I thought it was pretty good. The material can be dry at times, but that's no fault of the course design or the professor. The workload was light and classes were mildly interesting. The tests, though, were surprisingly difficult.",
    "recommended: you learn some pretty sweet techniques",
    "take it if you have to take it, there's no other reason to. The lectures were pointless. If you want a light workload, take it with Clark. if you want to be even mildly engaged in the material, take it with someone else.",
    "It is a required course for Psyc majors, so you should take it gain knowledge of research methodology used for psychology. It may be useful for students in other fields, but I am not quite sure what requirements they might have. Therefore, if you are Psych major, you should definitely take this course, otherwise, check with your DUS.",
    "I would kind of recommend it. It's not necessarily a difficult class because, if you read the book and go over lectures before tests, you'll do fine. It just required a lot of attention to figure out what was due etc. Most people will be taking it for a requirement anyway so...",
    "I took this course with Prof. Clark, who seemed to have this philosophy about the class: \"Yes, it's required, but I'm going to make it fun and interesting (and not too hard). You're all great students, you're all Psych majors, you probably know of this material to some extent, but we're going to have a good time learning the rest of this.\" Wonderful philosophy for a required course.If you've ever had Prof. Clark before, you'll enjoy this course. And if you're a Psych major, then you probably need to take this course! (or another Research Methods one).",
    "You're probably looking at this class if your psych major. Don't expect it to be anything more than just a required class.",
    "I thought it was a great intro to research methods and really useful if you want to pursue research. A great way to fulfill the requirement for psych majors.",
    "It's a required class for the major but not as unbearable as some people make it out to be. I would suggest taking statistics prior to the class. Make sure you go to class and do all the reading and this class would be a breeze.",
    "Take it only if you're required to. You really don't end up learning anything useful - just the basic of research methods, which can easily be done by reading the textbook on your own rather than taking an entire course.",
    "You learn about psychology methods. It's very useful information if you're thinking of doing psychology experimentation. Professor Clark does a good job making the material more interesting with personal and outside experiment anecdotes, thorough powerpoints, and interactive clicker questions. I'd recommend the course.",
    "Not a terribly difficult class, but not very interesting at the same time. I would say one of the more boring classes I have taken. I do not recommend taking this if you are not a psych major and dont have to take it.",
    "Frustrating class. If you don't have to take it, don't. That is, unless you enjoy being tested on material largely not presented in class, detailed questions from the textbook on tests, papers graded with little or no explanation, and my personal favorite, unanswered emails to the professor. Also, you'll have to get over being allowed to assume that correlation equals causation in a *psychology* final paper. Like I said, frustrating, but if you have to take it, whatever, just be ready to pregame lectures.",
    "Take it with another Professor, PLEASE. This was the worst class I have taken at Yale! Easy, unstructured, little depth, boring, a thorough waste of time. Psych majors: find another Professor for this course or take one of the alternative research methods courses.",
    "You have to take it. Just go in with a positive attitude and you'll come out better off, with a better perspective on how researchworks. Professor Clark will work with you well if you're willing to put in a little work and to do things ahead of time - this really will pay off if you do. Also, if you're reading this but are for some reason not a psychology major, don't take this course.",
    "I don't have any strong feelings towards the course. It's pretty much required for the standard track so you might end up taking it anyway, but it doesn't really go above and beyond for a course.",
    "If you have to take it, it's not as bad as it sounds.",
    "Well only take it if your a psych major. Be prepared to memorize stuff in the book. The final project is harder than expected.",
    "Only take this class if you are absolutely certain that you are majoring in psych. There is no point of taking it other than to fulfill the requirements for the major.",
    "Do not take this course unless you need to. If you have to, though, it's not actually as bad as some might make it out to be.",
    "Psych 235 is one of the possible required credits for Psych majors. It is a good background class for general research methods. Good for students who do not know which field of psychology they want to pursue. However be prepared to learn much of the information on your own. I suggest forming study groups to learn the material before the exams.",
    "You should take this class if you are interested in doing your own psych research or if you have to do it for the major. If you can, take it with Professor Clark who is very fair and helpful.",
    "You have to take some sort of Research Methods course if you're a Psych major, but I wouldn't recommend this one. Boring and disorganized. Not too much work, which is a plus.",
    "As a psych major, you have to take a research methods class, but DO NOT TAKE THIS ONE. I suffered of total boredom this semester, which I guess is pretty typical of research methods classes in general, but the other ones have to be better than this one. While Prof Clark is very approachable, class moves excruciatingly slowly and you learn nothing of any real worth the whole semester.",
    "THIS CLASS IS AWFUL. PROFESSOR CLARK IS THE WORST. SHE IS DISORGANIZED AND GIVES OUT SO MUCH EXTRANEOUS BUSYWORK. DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS WITH PROFESSOR CLARK IF YOU CAN HELP IT.",
    "Only take this class if you are required to for your major and cannot meet the requirements for the other options.",
    "This course covers basic research methods as they relate to psychology as well as other academic fields of research. I would recommend it to other students interested in the research process, whether or not they intend to pursue research, because it is a helpful tool for being a proficient soncumer of research as well."
