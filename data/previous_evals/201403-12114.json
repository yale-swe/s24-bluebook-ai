   "comments": [
    "I would not recommend this class. If you can take the physical sciences version, do. There is nothing but blind derivations, and while you'll get good at algebra, this course won't do anything for your understanding of chemistry.",
    "No! Not if Professor Yan is teaching it. Her lectures are uninspiring, hard to understand and full of errors. Sitting in class is kind of like having faulty derivations read out loud with no conceptual basis.",
    "A pretty standard science class. You go to lecture and copy down the notes, there are three midterms (drop one) and three problem sets.",
    "The professor is very intelligent but also incompetent. She makes mistakes when writing out her derivations, and it confuses all of us. She also seems to put in zero extra effort in professing: she doesn't show up for midterms, probably doesn't look over her notes prior to lectures, and isn't willing to give us practice problems for the midterms or final exam. Other than that, not sure what I learned from the course other than how to cram equations onto a sheet of paper and to locate them quickly during exams. My TA was extremely helpful, though, in organizing class material, highlighting the important stuff, and giving us practice questions. The class was very little work, though: three midterms and three psets (though each pset takes around ten hours).",
    "This course is a requirement for the MB+B major. It's fine, seems to do its purpose (provide a bit of context in the form of chemistry for some biological processes, in addition to stuff that is advanced gen. chem). It's not particularly inspiring, nor particularly difficult (both of these are due to the subject material covered). Class time is spent going over derivations and example problems, and section seemed pretty useful. The midterm exams are based quite heavily off of the psets, so doing the psets on your own (try not to use the solutions manual that's online for help, plus the solutions manual is littered with errors, as is the actual textbook) will help you do well on the midterms. The final seemed to be a bit more random but seemed a fair assessment.",
    "A basic physical chemistry class. This is the easier of the two pchem classes. People say this class is worse than the other, mostly due to Elsa Yan's teaching. She's not that bad. Basically she derives a lot of equations in class and you sort of understand if you follow along. If someone asks her a question, you usually don't get an adequate response though. There's only three (long) psets, three midterms (drop the lowest one), and a final. I think everyone gets ~100 on the homework and the exams were easy. The other class is at 9 am. I wouldn't recommend that. Take this if you're MBB.",
    "Yes if you like pchem but don't want to do the quant stuff in normal pchem. That or you're in MB&B.",
    "If you are an MB&B major, it is probably preferable to the other physical chemistry section. The exams and homeworks are fair. I would really recommend doing\/reviewing the homework thoroughly, since a lot of the exam material is based on it.",
    "If you're MB&B, you gotta take this or the legit pchem. I would seriously consider it if you're the type who actually wants to work and learn something. Even if the material is slightly harder in the other one, this class is just so bad I can't suggest you take it.",
    "If you like copying down proofs really fast with little to no understanding of what's going on, this is the class for you. Take notes. Trust me, they are useful later for studying even if you don't get it at the time. If you take this class without needing it as a req, you're insane. Three tests, drop your lowest grade. Three psets. Final was pretty hard. Good luck.",
    "This is your move if you don't want to do a ton of math -- it is very laid back, although the weeks that psets are due or there's an exam on the Friday are a little stressful. Overall, not bad at all.",
    "Decent class. Very easy for a pchem class.. Just do well on problem sets and test (only 3 of each!!). Lectures are kind of confusing but honestly a better class than 332 if your MBB",
    "I'd take this over the Chem 332. Elsa's teaching style was difficult to follow in the first few weeks but it got better over the course of the semester. This could be because of the subject material or because I eventually got used to her teaching style - I'm not sure. One thing to watch out for is that she had a lot of chalkboard typos in her lecture notes which become very confusing if you don't catch them and point them out. The material and the midterms were not very difficult. However, the final was much more difficult.",
    "A standard Pchem course, it is slightly more biology focused than the other Pchem, but not significantly. If you prefer rate laws to pressure changes take this course. The dropping of one midterm was also nice.",
    "They don't have a choice, it's required for BBSB.",
    "Do not take this class, take the Chemistry departments version. The professors not that bad intentionally, but the problem is she spends almost all of the class with her back to the students just doing derivations of equations on the board. I feel like the derivations could just easily be given in a hand out or something instead of wasting all of class doing it, and there's so many its hard to know what to actually focus on and whats just a side note of not much importance.",
    "If you are deciding between chem pchem and bio pchem you may want to choose chem pchem. I thought that what we learned in this class was interesting and useful. However, I have heard that the other pchem class, although hard, was just a better class overall.",
    "CHEM 328 is a good survey of principles in physical chemistry including kinetics and thermodynamics, with a minor focus on current research in the field. A good introductory physical chemistry course."
