    "take it. take all the chinese",
    "Great class! A decent amount of reading but so worth it!",
    "Chinese 165 was a good course. Every week you will read 10-20 pages in a Chinese story. There are standard dictation tests and four 1000 character essays throughout the term. The tests focus on vocab, grammar and a short essay (which you can use a dictionary for). I would recommend it if you have any interest in pre-revolutionary literature. Also Professor Su is great. If you haven't had him before, he loves telling stories, which take up a fair amount of class.",
    "Excellent course, a nice change from the normal run of the mill Chinese classes. Really nice to learn about something IN Chinese rather than just learning grammar patterns",
    "Would recommend for those happy with their language acquisition level and looking to focus on literature for a bit instead of traditional language study.",
    "A high level Chinese language course that greatly sharpens your skills of self expression in the target language through reading and discussions of the great Chinese literary works of the last century. The language is the means towards a greater understanding of yourself, of literature, of China, of self expression and the world around you."
