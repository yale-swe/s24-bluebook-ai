   "comments": [
    "Senior studio is the best studio I've had so far. It's great to spend a long time on a single project, and really develop an idea. Adam and Turner are amazing, encouraging, and enthusiastic. Overall, this is a great course. Good luck!",
    "Well it's required.",
    "required! you'll enjoy it.",
    "A much more hands-on approach to architectural thinking. The emphasis on hand-drawing and model building was particularly helpful in thinking about space making in a different way than you normally would with computer modeling. I'd say the absence of the usual rigor of a studio was it's only weakness.",
    "It's mandatory for arch majors.",
    "Yes, you can lookforward to this class. It's a lot more chilled that junior year, but you will have to motivate yourself if you are going to have a successful project at the end of the semester. Dont be afraid to get help from the TA's on your own. They will take an interest in your project if you are enthusiatic. We had great projects and exciting reviews.",
    "This is the crazy, creative, dreamer's-obsession architecture course that you take before you tackle real world architecture projects. However, like the real world, the projects are long with often distant deadlines. You have to keep up on yourself and be independent, which is challenging but definitely a real-world skill that lets you know that you're getting something out of it.",
    "ARCH 450 is a great senior studio. Adam and Turner are really supportive instructors, and allow you to have more freedom in what you want to design. There are 2 small assignments, and then an extended final project. It was great to have a long period of time to develop the final project, but it definitely requires self-motivation to keep up the momentum. The course is great because you have more independence and the work you produce is driven more by what you want to create and what you think you need to do to develop your project, and less (or not at all) on strict requirements. Enjoy this course and allow yourself the time to develop great projects! Don't slack off just because you can - this studio is really worth it.",
    "Unlike the other studios, the professors don't tell you conflicting things and work hard to hear your ideas and give you proper critique. Often this meant long after-hours critiques at 8pm to 11pm or receiving critique for an hour during a normal class meeting. You have much more agency over the your designs and will only to feel pressure to maximize your projects potential."
