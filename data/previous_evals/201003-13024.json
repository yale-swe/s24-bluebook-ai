    "yes it is a good class",
    "You will learn how to read French primarily in L4, but if you're interested in improving your language skills, you don't have many options. I found this course frustrating because it's focused on mostly reading complicated texts and not on really developing advanced speaking skills through discussions of current events, presentations, etc. Katrien is great, though, so try and get in her section if you can.",
    "It's a lot of work but if you're willing to work for it, take the class. BE AWARE that there is writing, and it increases exponentially as time goes by.",
    "This is a challenging class with tough readings and lots of grammar. Madame Wynant makes it totally worth it though, and it is a lot of fun. Be sure you are ready for the level, but take it with Madame Wynant if you can. She is great, and your French will improve a lot.",
    "the course moves rather quickly so you should try never to miss a day of course. that being said, i thought it was less work than 130 because there aren't as many tedious listening excercises. it's similar in structure to 130, just a little bit less work. i felt like my french improved a lot",
    "Yes",
    "Definitely take French 140 04, especially with Katrien Wynant. I learned more in a semester in this class than I did in my four years of french in high school. Wynant is an amazing teacher. She is very reasonable and is always willing to help when you need it. Take this class with her if you have to take French!",
    "I'd advise against taking FREN 140 if you can avoid it. Though if you need it for a language credit, definitely take it with Prof. Wynant- she's incredibly enthusiastic and helpful.",
    "If you are beginning French at Yale, 140 is a good place to start. You'll get a handle on a lot of grammar and read a lot of sad stories. There's homework every day, but it's never too daunting, and since at least half the class is just trying to complete the language requirement, no one's too intense - or really that good at French - which is a relief. Take it with Katrien if you can- she's the best.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student because we learned so much about culture as well as the language and had fun. One thing is that it meets every day, so be ready to have a lot of homework.",
    "I think that French 140 was a good class. I liked how there were a lot of opportunities to practice speaking, whether in a seminar, in a small group or with a partner. Class participation is very important in this class--so be well prepared every day."
