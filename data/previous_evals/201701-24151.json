    "Having never taken an anthropology course before, I gained an excellent understanding of both the field as a whole and the field of primate intelligence particularly.",
    "In Evolution of Primate Intelligence, we discuss the unique abilities of primates and humans, and the ecological pressures which gave rise to the \"smartness\" of humans and their closest phylogenetic relatives. This course surveys a large body of literature on the topic, from various disciplines including anthropology, comparative psychology, biology, and linguistics. Evolution of Primate Intelligence is great for those who want to familiarize themselves with experimental paradigms within primatology and comparative cognition."

   "comments": [
    "Professor Watts is incredibly knowledgeable and engaging. He is this course's strength. The material is compelling, but sometimes repetitive. Professor Watts does a great job emphasizing important information and making class fun.",
    "This course was excellent, and I do not think much could be improved. Perhaps the paper topics could be announced further ahead of time than they were, but they were very short papers and were still easy to write even with topic announcements only a few a days before the due date.",
    "The course is as conprehensive as possible, and presents some of the latest groundbreaking research in a field which is full of debate and disagreement."

   "comments": [
    "Absolutely. Any student who has the slightest interest in animal cognition should take this course.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course. I took it with no formal anthropology background and had an absolute blast learning about a completely new topic from a fascinating professor (David Watts). The grading is easy, the readings are mostly skimmable, and the lecture is consistently engaging and thought-provoking. Definitely take this class if it fulfills any of your requirements, or honestly even just for fun. You will get to dive into an esoteric (and yet quite important) field with one of the foremost scholars in it, all while doing minimal work.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who has asked the question \"what makes humans (and other primates) unique?\" And anyone interested in how humans evolved to be such a clever, complicated species with language, technology, and culture."
