   "comments": [
    "You meet for about 45 min - an hour to talk about the history of a material, say concrete or metal or brick. Afterwards, you build something with it for a few hours. It was very relaxed. Only a final project, which really is as time consuming or challenging as you chose to make it. Great class.",
    "You will learn to believe in yourself to make amazing things, or at least to make things! And you won't get hurt because Tim cares! There's a final project, get that done. And you'll learn materials!",
    "Yes,fun class for anyone not an architecture major and for arch majors it's a low-key interesting elective.",
    "As a non-architecture major, this class has made me appreciate the beauty in the materials used to make structures. The time commitment is pretty light (just really Friday morning through early afternoon), and if you're at all interested in getting some hands-on experience building things, then this is for you. (The lectures are sometimes not that interesting, but you do learn a bit.)",
    "Materials in Arch is a really fun class, even (especially) for non-architecture-majors. Tim is one of the most compassionate, understanding, knowledgeable, and generally pleasant teachers I've had at Yale. The 9:30 start time is not ideal, but that's the only drawback to this class.",
    "Take it! You'll learn more practical skills in this class than any other class at Yale. You'll learn how to sand, saw, lay brick, pour concrete, weld, and more. You'll see that fabrication is an art, not just a skill. You'll find yourself staring at buildings around you in awe. And you'll meet the really cool guys who work in the fabrication shop. There's no work outside of class except for the final project, but beware that the final project takes a lot of time. You should be all set to enter production mode by the time you return from spring break.",
    "An interesting class for both majors and non majors. Work with the fabrication shop in architecture is good regardless of your field of study.",
    "Great class, you learn a lot and have a lot of fun but no stress because the only graded assignment is the end one (and your participation).",
    "This was a great course. Perfect for non-majors trying to learn a little bit more about architecture as a profession and a craft. Definitely a great 5th class. No work outside of the course except for the final project.",
    "This class was very educational and extremely fun. It is one of the few opportunities to have such a hands-experience when learning about specific materials and building methods. Both Tim and the TAs are a great help at all times and the work is neither overwhelming nor hard to learn."
