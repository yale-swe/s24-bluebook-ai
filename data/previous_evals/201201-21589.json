    "you have to take so there is no point in answering this question. I can only say it really depends on your group of people in your class. Ours was nice so it was a nice time. Also, we had food at each meeting which was wonderful and had everyone coming in for every class, keeping morale high.",
    "It's a pretty mellow class because people are just taking turns presenting each week. I don't really know how useful it is to present especially in the beginning of the semester, but by the end of the semester it's definitely useful. Plus there's snacks!",
    "The class is very helpful in keeping you on track. You should also be meeting with your advisor periodically too. Do NOT leave anything to last minute or you will be stressed. It's best to have a solid topic down by first semester and it doesn't hurt if you start writing. Once you do start writing it really helps you pin down a direction. It can be tedious to listen to everyone else's presentation when you don't really know their field that well but it's helpful for presentation practice, especially to an audience that doesn't know your field as well.",
    "I believe the format changes from year to year, but this year, we presented our progress on our theses in groups each week (so that we presented every 3 weeks-ish). Besides that, we met with our advisers and worked on our theses, posting \"progress reports\" on classesv2. Finally, at the end of the semester, we presented our research to the department. Overall, this was a good experience for me because it taught me that I do have something to contribute to the linguistic literature and that I have learned the tools to do so. From the sounds of other majors, there are way worse ways to write a thesis. Also, we brought snacks to each class, which was adorable and delicious."
