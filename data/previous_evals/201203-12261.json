    "take it!",
    "Take it! It's one of my favorite classes I've taken at Yale; this class was not only interesting, but the material was really relevant and going through the course definitely improved my economic intuition far more than any other economics class at Yale.",
    "Great class that is not too hard.",
    "Yes. Not at all what you'd expect out of this class. the listing seems like a typical environmental course where you hear \"the planet is doomed\" \"we pollute too much\" and \"we need to control the use of our resources\", but this course models these scenarios and makes you really consider the costs of natural resources in a rational way. This was a refreshing take on resource management and pollution. Really great class for econ majors",
    "Good econ class--gives you a very interesting perspective on natural resources and the environmental concerns of today. Mendelsohn is also a very engaging lecture, so classes aren't boring. There is no textbook, though, so you have to attend lectures in order to know what is going on. Sections are mandatory. There are weekly problem sets, two midterm exams, and a final. All of them are pretty straightforward as long as you pay attention in class.",
    "Not if you are looking for a gut. A pretty easy class in terms of material, but you must put in the work.",
    "Yes. It's a great class to understand resource management. As a global citizen we should all know these concepts.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. The class goes along at a pretty slow pace, so even if you haven't taken econ since high school, you will be totally fine. If you are an econ major, this class will probably be easy for you. In general, it was very interesting to learn about environmental issues through this framework. However applicable or not you deem the class and its teachings in the way you approach and think about the environment, I think it's still important to take this course and understand it. I enjoyed the course overall.",
    "Absolutely loved the class! As an environmental engineer I was taking this as an elective and it gave me an entirely new perspective on how we should manage the environment. I think it was taught in a way that made sense and did not try to over complicate things like many Yale courses do. Final exam was absurdly easy but I'm guessing that means it won;t provide much of a curve. Midterms were a little more difficult but not overwhelming. Pset took an hour each week max.Great class for everyone, whatever your major, to take. Puts our resources into perspective is everyone's problem.",
    "This is an INCREDIBLE course!!!!! It summarizes the economics of subjects like forestry, recycling, fossil fuels, fisheries, and pollution control. Professor Mendelsohn is a great lecturer and is really one of the leading experts in the field. TAKE THIS CLASS. The work load is really manageable and its pretty easy to do well!!!!!!!!!!!!",
    "this is an unexpectedly a really great class. it's just hard enough so that you learn something but it is not so hard you want to shoot yourself in the face. Also, when I say it's just hard enough I mean it is generally pretty easy if you passed pre-calculus and don't have trouble accepting global warming as a thing and you believe in capitalism. The concepts you learn are pretty cool and applicable outside the environment. Just be aware that Mendelsohn is obviously a great guy who has made such an impact on his field, but he really can't write test questions. At all. Be prepared for them to be mildly tricky and somewhat ambiguous. But I guess it is fine because they are that way for everyone. Overall, this is a really great course so take it and learns something and chill out.",
    "Economics of Natural Resources is a course designed to make rich, politics-oriented kids feel better about the impact they have on the planet without providing any serious thought into how to fix these problems. If you are a rich kid who wants to relieve guilt related to the environment, take this class! If you are interested in thinking about how to solve any of these problems, this class will make you depressed.",
    "Take if if you need an econ credit and want to study environmental econ. Pretty easy and pretty interesting.",
    "Econ 330 is a really good introduction to the application of micro theory to a fascinating, important, and timely set of issues. It equips you with a language to talk about environmental and social policy issues, and also helps provide good argument material for defending what seem like smart policies. Mendelsohn is excellent and chose awesome TFs for the class, and it's nice to have a morning lecture full of jokes. I absolutely loved this class and would definitely recommend it to people who know nothing about the environment or economics, but have a willingness to come and learn.",
    "I would take this course if you are interesting in environmental conservation, resource management, or pollution. The class is well taught, however, Professor Mendelsohn can be confusing at times and he DOES NOT know how to write exam or problem set questions. The midterms basically covered one lecturer only, the last lecture before the midterm. Also, make sure to go to office hours and send in articles on top of sections if you want to get over an 80 in participation",
    "It's a great class. There is a basic premise of the class that economists are smarter than everyone else, and, if that offends you, you probably shouldn't take it. I learned a lot, and this class definitely made me much more interested in environmental economics. If you care about the environment at all, you should take this class. The problem sets (not counting the last two which involve excel) generally take an hour or two. The questions on the midterms are very tricky. If you interpret them the wrong way, you won't get any partial credit. However, the curve is pretty generous because the class includes a wide range of people,some more familiar with economics and some not. Take it!",
    "One of the more interesting econ lectures. I would definitely suggest it if the topic interests you.",
    "Take this class! All you really need is intro microeconomics to understand all the econ concepts in this class. It's not math intensive at all. Most importantly, the topics are really interesting. You learn how pollution should be controlled, why we waste water and don't recycle, and the secret of non-renewable resources like oil and coal. Homework and tests are generally straightforward. Mendelsohn's lectures are interesting and vital to understanding the material. I learned a lot from this class that I expect will be really useful in my environmental policy career. This is an easy, eye-opening class for everyone.",
    "Economics of Natural Resources is a course on the economics of pollution control and natural resources, such as fishing, land, water, and non-renewable resources. Problem sets did not take that much time and were relatively easy, especially if you went to TA office hours. Exams were sometimes relatively straight-forward but sometimes worded in a weird way. Mendelsohn made the two midterms weigh very little in your grade (15% each), so that students have an opportunity to get used to his testing style. There is no course book, so your notes have to be pretty good when it's time to study for exams.",
    "Very interesting course. But perhaps a better title would be \"The Ramblings of Prof. Mendelsohn about Natural Resources and Related Subjects.\" While the subject matter is fascinating and Mendelsohn is an interesting lecturer, the course is basically focused on whatever he feels like talking about, and has no textbook to back up the occasional equation he scrawls on the board.",
    "Very good class, Professor Mendelsohn is great. Strong focus on environmental economics, natural resources course name is slightly misleading.Watch out for TAs, they brought down most people's grades with the participation component. First time I've ever seen a TA do that.",
    "This an interesting class in which you learn quite a bit of practical things. Virtually no work is required. The problem sets are quick and easy. Mendelsohn is a good and engaging lecturer. The final exam was poorly constructed and grades didn't seem to match students' command of the subject, and they seemed to pull participation grades out of thin air with no real reasoning, but other than that, it was a solid course. An interesting econ class with little time commitment.",
    "Take it if you like forestry&environmental management.",
    "A great class. Work isn't too demanding, but the subject matter is consistently interesting",
    "I would recommend the class",
    "Yes!! It's an great overview to all different facets of environmental economics. Professor Mendelsohn is very clear speaker and keeps your focus for the entirety of the class. He doesn't use a powerpoint, so you can't just look on the slides to studyfor the midterm or final. You actually have to listen and go to class. This was my favorite class at Yale thus far.",
    "Yes.",
    "Ok class. Does not have book, you just have to listen to whatever mendelsohn says in class - that means that you cannot miss lecture, seriously, or else you will have no idea what is going on. Because there is no book, if you are confused in class, then you will be confused in section. Then they give you a pop quiz in section before you can ask questions so that you can feel doubly bad.I would say skip it unless it gets a book.",
    "Yes, a must take",
    "Very interesting materials, though beware that sometimes the lectures get a bit messy and it gets hard to review the materials after class. Also the exam questions are sometimes random, so do go to every lecture and take detailed notes. The class does not have a textbook, so the notes are essential.",
    "This was an intriguing and eye opening course that gave a thorough understanding of the basic of environmental economics. The assignments were easy but served to reinforce the material, the midterms were strangely selective in scope but fair, and the final was relatively easy and fair as well. I would recommend taking this if you are a economics major looking for an easier course, or if you want to sound somewhat educated when talking about environmental issues."
