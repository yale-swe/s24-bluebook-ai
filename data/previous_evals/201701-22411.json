    "Overall interesting. For a non-economist \/ econometrics guy admittedly some of the nitty-gritty bits of some papers went over my head but that has more to do with me taking the course without having taken the required courses before hand. I think it would have been helpful with a final round-up session trying to tie the many streams of thinking together.",
    "Jose needs to learn to be a better presenter. His presentation of the material is generally weak and not engaging. His use of powerpoint slides does not add anything to the presentation.",
    "Content and selection of topics was very interesting. The title is a bit misleading- the course was maybe 50% American Economic History, which was explained up front in the first lecture. I don't feel like I know a great deal more about the U.S. specifically now, but on the history of innovation and different institutions I feel much more comfortable."
