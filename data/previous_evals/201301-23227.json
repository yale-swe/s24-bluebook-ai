    "This was a lovely course. If at all possible, take it with Leslie Brisman. You will probably notice other reviews discussing his constant use of anecdotes, and I think I have finally figured out how to explain it. For Brisman, this stuff isn't just literature. It's the most important thing in the world, and it's about LIFE.As a teacher, Brisman is morally opposed to thesis in essays (and in discussion)- you will instead problematize, brooding over what Brisman finds to be the most difficult issues in the poetry.Take this course with Brisman, whether or not you're an English major- you won't regret it.",
    "It's a great class for learning more about classic poetry. I would definitely recommend it because it's very interesting, very useful, and a great way to get better at writing. The skills of analysis and language translate to other classes and departments as well.",
    "An engaging introduction to English poetry from Milton forward; the curriculum with Prof. Brisman was a lively one, helped possibly because we read Yeats and Heaney for our final unit. Prof. Brisman was a fantastic instructor. He held us up to high standards, but was equally eager to help us meet those standards. He really shaped the course to be a journey, not allowing us to become complacent with where we were, but challenging us to become ever more mature as thinkers and writers.",
    "Yes. Take it with Brisman if you want to learn how to read a poem. I knew squat about scanning lines of verse before taking this class, and now I feel more confident about my abilities as a reader.",
    "ENGL 126 is about letting the great poets teach you to how to read poetry. It's a magnificent course, and I'd highly recommend it not just to English majors but all.",
    "A great class. I recommend it even if you don't need it for the English major. If you take it, absolutely take it with Brisman.",
    "Brisman is great. You'll work for it, but you'll appreciate the artistry and beauty of the poets so much.",
    "A formative journey, and a wild one. Take it if you are ready to be pushed close to your limits, and to be somehow changed. It doesn't matter if you are an english major or not. I started out not being one, but now I'm seriously considering it."
