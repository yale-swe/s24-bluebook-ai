    "DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS. At least, not with Dave Evans. The first half of the semester is an overview of tectonic concepts, except that it's trivial stuff for geology majors but presented in a way that the non-geo majors probably had absolutely no idea what is going on. The second half of the semester is slightly more interesting, but, still, very poorly taught, and the papers that you have to read are miserable. This class has no textbook, no midterms, and the final got canceled, which sounds great, except that means that our entire grade is based on one 20-page research paper (which we *never* got any guidance on and had to bug Prof. Evans about incessantly before he would tell us how long is should be and when it would be due) and a handful of reading responses on extremely technical papers, and that looking back on the semester I'm pretty sure that I learned absolutely nothing. Also, the Sicily trip is an EPIC waste of Yale's money (they pay for the alcohol tabs, which again, sounds great, but) - all we did was stand around in the rain. No, not stand around talking about geology, just stand around. The rain I can't blame anyone for, and the excessive drinking every single night was our own damn faults [where \"our\" includes the professor and the TA's], but the sheer irresponsibility of Dave and the TA's was rather mind-blowing - we were forced to do a lot of stupid stuff, we were not allowed to sleep, over half of us missed our flight back to the US, and they forgot to bring the first aid kit. Or tell us that it would be below freezing some nights. So, yeah, DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS, and if for some reason you do, DO NOT GO TO SICILY, and if for some reason you do make sure to bring _oodles_ of warm clothing and as much homework as you can so that when you get sick after all those days shivering in the pouring down rain and nights in sketchy Italian bars, you won't fall too behind in your other classes.",
    "Haha. You would be a fool not to take this class. There's no work for the first half of the semester and then only a few reading responses and a paper after spring break. The Department of Geology&Geophysics heavily subsidizes a two week field trip to Sicily, which was, at least this year, a nonstop party with minimal geology. Seriously. Lots of people in the class had very little background in geology, or science, for that matter. Prof. Evans (aka Majestic D) is a blast (and extremely knowledgeable and organized and friendly and approachable). Oh, and you'll learn a lot about the global process that have affected the morphology, ecology, and climate of the Earth for the last ~4 billion years. Yay! This class rocks!",
    "You learn some general tectonic jargon and evidence for theories on global tectonics. In sicily you map out a small mountain region. Then, you learn about other theories of global tectonics and read articles from research geologists. I would recommend it t any student who doesn't mind mountain climbing and seafood.",
    "I would definitely reccomend it. While I hadn't taken a geology class before, the material was a little dense. However, the implications of what you learn are really interesting. Oh, and also you get to go to Sicily for all of spring break for 300 dollars, which is an incredible trip, no real complaints about it at all.",
    "YES. TAKE IT. Dave Evans is awesome, the trip to Sicily is AMAZING, and there's very little work. An experience you will never forget.",
    "The most awesome awesomeness imaginable. If you can take it and don't you are an idiot.",
    "Global Tectonics was an amazing class. We covered basic tectonic processes, the tectonic history of various regions, and current controversial theories. Dave Evans gives great lectures - very fast-paced, but he breaks things down because at least our year, most of the class did not have much or any geology experience (don't worry if you're a humanities-oriented major!) And of course, the highlight of the class would have to be the two week spring break field trip in Sicily! Those were the best 2 weeks of my life - roadside geology, a field mapping project, ancient sites, Italian food and culture, and best of all, bonding with your classmates\/TAs\/professor! The students barely said a word to each other before the trip, but now we're all great friends. I wouldn't blame you for taking the class for the trip - it's the best science credit at Yale. However, if you take the class seriously, you will get a lot out of it! Definitely do the reading at the beginning of the semester - you will understand a lot more in Sicily, and when you get back to 5 weekly papers and a term paper. It was a lot to finish at the end, but well worth it. Take this class!!!!!!!!!!",
    "This class is ok - don't do it just for the field trip (and if you do go on the trip, pack warm clothes!). You won't learn very much actual geology, so know that going in.",
    "G&G 212 is a course that attempts (and largely succeeds) to cover the entirety of tectonics in a single term. It is a survey course, so this is of course a shallow investigation, but students leave having learned quite a lot. You really have to want to understand the material, because the dearth of written assignments leaves a lot of the learning up to personal commitment from the students. If you take it, DO THE READING.",
    "Take it! It is a great class.",
    "TAKE THIS COURSE. It was awesome. The teacher, TAs, and spring break field trip all make it one of the best I've taken at Yale so far. Geology is super interesting and gaining a better understanding of it and how it shapes the earth has definitely been worthwhile.",
    "This class is great even if you are not a geology major, or if you are and do not specialize in physical geology. There is a lot of information in the lectures, so make sure you attend class, and yo u will be rewarded by learning a lot. The field trip is awesome, and I would recommend this class to anyone interested in the earth sciences.",
    "This is an interesting class if you're into geology and have some background in the subject. The Sicily trip is awesome of course, and you'll end up learning a lot about geology and seeing a lot of Sicily. I felt a overview of geology and key terms at the beginning of the class would have been helpful, as I had a difficult time following the lectures. I feel the lectures were geared towards those with prior geology classes; it's easy to be lost in the class because it goes so fast. No midterms or final (this year at least). Reading responses and final paper were challenging because this was the first geology class I took. I would recommend the course to those extremely interested in geology, or have had one or two classes in geology. Otherwise, it's difficult to follow.",
    "G&G212 starts out slow, accelerates quickly before and during spring break, and all the work this year was after the trip. I'd highly recommend it even if you haven't taken geology before, but know that it is a real science course, so have good chemistry and maybe a little physics background. Also know how to read journal papers as well. Prof. Evans is awesome and I heard Prof. Brandon was also good. I took this class to explore a topic I hadn't touched before and really enjoyed it."
