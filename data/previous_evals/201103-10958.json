   "comments": [
    "Yes. The course jumps around a bit chronologically and location-wise, but the final paper gives you a really interesting chance to explore a particular apocalypse-related topic in more depth, which I really enjoyed.",
    "I highly recommend the course.",
    "I would describe the course as an evaluation of Jewish, Zoroastrian, Christian, and Islamic messianism that examines apocalypticism as a genre and compares across cultural and sectarian boundaries. I would recommend the course because of this comparative dimension and the strength of each of the instructors, who provide balance between text-based, theological analysis and historical approaches.",
    "I would certainly recommend this course and both professors to peers in the future. It is a niche area of study, so I would explain that this isn't a general studies course, however, it is the first time I have ever been exposed to this material and I am glad that I took it."

    "unique insight with coming together of history of the eastern and western apocalypticism.",
    "This course and my positive interaction with the professors has encouraged me to further explore in the field of apocalypticism. I have been using the free time during the break to read more course material in hopes of deepening my knowledge base."
