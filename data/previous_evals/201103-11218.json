    "Take it if you can",
    "The professor is a former transaction lawyer specializing in energy deals; a great person to learn from. Class was always relaxed; mixture of lecture and class discussion based on the week's readings. Workload consists of an 7-8 page midterm paper and a 13-15 page final paper, plus 3 energy observation reports. You can pretty much write the papers on any subject relating to energy and Tom is a very fair grader.",
    "I would recommend it for anyone interested in learning more about energy. Having somewhat of a background in energy sources could be beneficial, otherwise the student should be prepared to embrace a lot of information. Otherwise, the class covers a wide range of approaches to energy, whether it be production, expansion, or policy.",
    "Great class.",
    "This class is awesome. Tom Weil provides a comprehensive overview of domestic and international energy industries and their development. The mix of students in the class brings in contribution from a variety of fields of study, contributing to the class. Weil has endless experience in a number of large projects, many of which are international.",
    "This class is an overview of energy topics in the US, mostly. It is very interesting to hear from the instructor, who has a lot of experience in the field, as opposed to learning a purely academic view. Take it! Assignments: 3 very small observation reports, midterm paper, final paper.",
    "Take it if you wanna learn exactly how hard the energy problem is to solve",
    "From the perspective of someone who applied on a whim and did not intend to take this course, I would highly recommend this to anyone with the slightest interest in energy issues. Learning from Mr. Weil was a pleasure, as was engaging the diverse mix of students which Mr. Weil brought together from very different majors. Whatever your previous foundation in energy related issues (and no pre-experience is necessary), you will be pleased by how much you learn from this course, and from the different perspective that Mr. Weil offers relative to the majority of Yale professors. The work load is not at all stressful, but be prepared to do the readings (or otherwise engage in energy related issues) so you are prepared to participate in seminar. One of the very best of many wonderful courses that I have taken in 3.5 years at Yale.",
    "Definitely take this class if you can - by far my favourite seminar that I've taken. You cover a lot but in a relatively relaxed manner which means that you get some great discussions."
