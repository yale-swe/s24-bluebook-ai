   "comments": [
    "An exploration of the philosophy that is so central to western thought starting from the bottom up. This means mostly Plato and Aristotle, but there are many other exciting philosophers presented. This course and program is very challenging, but even more rewarding I would definitely recommend it.",
    "This is a course that gives an effective overview of most of the prominent philosophical schools of Antiquity as well as an introduction to Catholic theology and a sampling of Arabic philosophy. I would recommend this Directed Studies philosophy course to any student with an interest in how philosophy challenges individuals to live for ideals greater than themselves and their material situation.",
    "Its a solid introduction to Western philosophy and the general precepts of philosophical thought and argumentation. I'd definitely recommend it.",
    "DS Philosophy is an amazing introduction to ancient philosophers. Some philosophers can drastically change your outlook on life, especially if you, like me, are coming into the course without having taken philosophy before. In Professor Whittles class in particular, you get to both talk about broad, and modern, takes on the text, and also focus on important parts of the text. Some of the weaknesses might be trying to cover a bit too much, especially at the end, with the Arabic philosophers. I would either try to spend more time on them. I would also have liked to actively draw comparisons between philosophers. DS Philosophy is so enjoyable, especially with Professor Whittle, and of course because of the material.",
    "Yup! Definitely take it if you have Professor Whittle as your instructor."
