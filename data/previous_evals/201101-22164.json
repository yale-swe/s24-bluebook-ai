    "If you are committed to learning German, take the class.",
    "I feel that I learned more German in a semester than I learned French from 8 years of school. We moved at moderate pace which both challenged us and kept us from getting bored. The grammar and vocabulary were broken up by watching The Comedian Harmonists and Lola Rennt. I highly recommend this course, especially with Marleen Schulte, who is extremely nice, patient, understanding, helpful, and an overall joy to have as a teacher.",
    "I would definitely recommend GMAN110-- it's a light workload language course and a great language.",
    "German is excellent!",
    "German 110, although not the easiest of languages, is a great course to take; it moves at a manageable pace and provides a great introduction. If you're looking for a language requirement, this is an excellent choice -- it's not mind-bogglingly difficult but is different enough to keep it interesting."
