    "This was an amazing class.",
    "Absolutely. It was my favorite of the three Directed Studies courses.",
    "Yes! For any student truly dedicated to the study of philosophy, it is essential to study these philosophers of the Western canon. While DS possibly doesn't allow you to go in depth with any specific work, it gives you a great introduction to all the seminal texts. You can decide which you wish to delve deeper into later in your Yale career.",
    "Yes, I would. Philosophy was my least favorite of the three DS classes. I enjoyed it, but because the other two DS classes come in a package deal with it, it is worth it to take philosophy for that reason.",
    "DS Philosophy requires a level of precision in your thinking that may take some time getting used to--it certainly did for me. But the satisfaction that you will get from finally, finally hitting on an argument that makes sense is something you don't get very often in other classes. Do not, I repeat, do NOT be afraid of admitting that you're confused--the learning curve for this class is really steep, and it's likely that if you're having trouble figuring something out, you're not alone. Talk to the professor (who is hugely helpful), talk to your classmates outside of class, read and reread the texts you've been assigned. No matter how impenetrable it seems at first, I promise that it will click eventually.",
    "A really good introduction to philosophy. I would recommend it to students interested in finding out more about philosophy."
