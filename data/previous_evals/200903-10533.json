    "yes awesome class",
    "Anybody who has any interest or stake in economic policy, financial strategy, or the economic behavior of people, (ie, pretty much everyone) should know the concepts covered in this course. As opposed to much of neoclassical \"mainstream\" economics, Shiller talks about the real world, why people do the things they do, and what we can do about it. It's solid gold in a field of tin foil.",
    "I think the subject material is interesting but I wouldn't recommend the course because of the instruction. And only take it if you are interested in the financial crisis.",
    "Definitely recommended. You will only get out what you put into it however.",
    "yes",
    "really interesting and important material",
    "The course focuses heavily on examples from behavioral finance, placing less emphasis on other areas of economics and policies to which it could be applicable (e.g., environment, health care, etc.)",
    "Yes.",
    "It's a good intro class so you should take it if you want to figure out if behavioral studies is something that you want to pursue. It's also a good class if you want to figure out why certain things happen, like the financial crises, etc. Also, good class to take if you enjoy reading. There were several good books that were required reads, but they were really enjoyable because we always talked about them in class.",
    "yes."

    "yes, great depth into financial theory",
    "This course gave me access to understanding economic behavior and economic patterns at a far deeper and more helpful level than anything I would have gotten out of years of neoclassical \"mainstream\" economics; as someone interested in economic development and working in the \"developing world\", it's absolutely vital to understand WHY things happen, and not how they \"should' happen according to standard economic models. Tremendously helpful.",
    "The first bit of the course was good when we talked about behavioral implications for economics as a discipline but beyond that it was tedious because I am not interested in the financial crisis.",
    "This is not in my field, nor is it related.",
    "somewhat helpful",
    "Have a better understanding of behavioral economics.",
    "It deepened my knowledge significantly"
