    "The colloquium, at times, may seem suffocatingly overwhelming as it requires you to wake up at 9am, and pointless as it requires you to complete small assignments and read others theses while you're attempting to write your own. However, in the end, the bi-monthly accountability and the comraderie of your fellow classmates makesit highly worthwhile.",
    "The class is fine. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nice that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s every other week. You have to take it if you want to do the intensive major, so you really can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t avoid it. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s worth doing the year-long essay. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a great introduction to a very academic experience and it will give you a better idea of whether you want to go into academia. It really just depends on the other students and what their senior essay topics are. Philip Smith is Philip Smith. If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re thinking of taking this class, you know him already. And he is brilliant.",
    "You have to take this class if you want to write the year-long thesis and graduate with honors. If you took the first half of this class, you're not even going to read the reviews for the second half. If for whatever reason you do find this review, be warned: your classmates will likely take forever to get their act together. Get your act together early! Otherwise this is much the same as the first semester: reading each other's work (or lack thereof) and offering feedback.",
    "Do the yearlong thesis - it's a worthwhile and rewarding experience to build your own project over a whole year. Pick your adviser wisely - some may be on leave during the spring for when you need feedback. Keep yourself to a schedule as well.The yearlong thesis is also great because you do it together with the rest of the intensive majors - we meet every other week, everyone becomes friends, and it feels much less stressful when you know everyone is working.The workload actually isn't that bad if you space it out, I think the average thesis length was 60-70 pages which is doable if you need to cram it in in the last month, but this is a chance to do real original research and analysis, so really take that opportunity!",
    "Definitely. This is a great place to pursue your passions and discover something new. A lot of work, but with some discipline, totally doable.",
    "If you're taking this class it's because you are required to: it's a great experience in that you will learn so much from the DUS and it's really awesome to hear what the other intensive majors are doing. If I have one word of advice it is GET STARTED ASAP--you will be busier than you ever imagined second semester, with academic work, fun events, senior obligations, etc. Try to have a full draft by winter break, you'll be soooo happy you did later."
