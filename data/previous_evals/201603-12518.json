   "question_text": "What knowledge, skills, and insights did you develop by taking this course?",
   "comments": [
    "Health economics Healthcare market and its characteristics (mostly adverse selection), sufficient statistic approach, behavioral economics perspective, interrelation with labor market General public finance issues Optimal unemployment insurance, disability insurance and targeting, tax incidence",
    "This class taught my a lot about health economics and provided a good introduction to other topics in public finance. I learned a lot about reduced form estimation techniques, especially RD and DD. I also learned a lot about the research process. This class was particularly useful in light of the emphasis on structural econometrics in all of my other classes.",
    "I developed skills that enabled me to critically read and understand research. The assignments for the course made me engage with research in depth, which helped me realize what questions I should be asking when I read an academic article.",
    "Excellent articles! I learnt the art of reading papers in a very short time!",
    "This class was pretty good, I feel like I got what I was supposed to out of it. It was a little heavily health focused initially but I still felt like I learned something new every day. Additionally I think this class was good for helping us develop research techniques.",
    "Skills: to develop, organize ideas and to articulate with colleagues Knowledge: some knowledge on literature of public finance, especially health economics",
    "I really learnt a lot about health economics, which is one the fields I am interested on. Also, I think this course was really useful to develop other skills such as how to write a research proposal, or how to prepare a good presentation, etc.",
    "Amanda provided really valuable insight into the research process and how we could start this process for ourselves. This is instruction from which I think that all students in the program could benefit, and not only those of us who happen to be interested in Public Finance. Additionally, coverage of topics related to what types of data are out there and available, grant writing, and referee report writing were very useful and appreciated (some overlap with the empirical topics class, which was fine)."

  {
   "question_id": "GS403",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The strength of the course is the instructor's will to let students be a thesis writer. The weakness is that there is a considerable variation in what we can learn from the instructor and I could not have a consistent prospect from the lecture. (But this is minor.)",
    "I don't have any suggestions. I thought it was good.",
    "Strengths: I liked the project proposal assignment and the problem sets, which helped me engage with the literature in depth. Weaknesses: I wish we were able to go more in depth with several topics. I felt that we just barely touched on several topics that are important for public finance research.",
    "Strength: interactions between students and between students and professors. Weakness: I would like to learn in a more systematic and in more depth literature of public finance.",
    "Strengths: this is a very dynamic course, which foster participation in class and enriching discussions. The response papers make us to read the papers on a different way, adding our own perspective (which is very useful to start thinking in research ideas). The idea of keeping a research journal was really motivating, and is something I will incorporate to my life in the future. Weakness: we would benefit for a smaller class size, so we can have more feedback from the professor. Some of the problem sets were not very useful to learn the material.",
    "The forum could be improved. In the end, it was confusing when trying to find people's updates of ideas (because it was needed for discussion). The course was extremely interesting and I learned a lot.",
    "The main strength of this course is the way that it is structured to start the process of generating research ideas for future years in the PhD program. Since we have limited class time, this coverage of how to approach research came somewhat at the expense of time spent covering standard public finance topics, which in my opinion is a good use of time because resources were provided for those of us interested in exploring these topics to a greater depth than the class coverage. Overall, I feel like I learned a lot in this class. It is one of the best and most useful courses I have taken thus far at Yale."

   "comments": [
    "Even if you are not going to do the public finance, this class may give you the insight and mindset on how to be a thesis writer. I could learn a lot on what to do now as a second year student from her. If you want to do health economics, then all the more you should take this course.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to another student if: (1) they are interested in health or public policy and (2) if they want to learn more about, and practice, the research process",
    "Yes. You will learn a lot.",
    "Yes",
    "Yes, because it gets you into the habit of thinking about research ideas often and early.",
    "Yes, I will totally recommend this course. This was one of the best courses I have taken so far.",
    "Yes,definitely. It was extremely useful keeping a research journal and writing a research proposal.",
    "I would recommend this course to all Econ graduate students regardless of whether or not they are interested specifically in Public Finance. There is significant flexibility in the assignments that allows everyone to explore topics related to their research interests even if these are not covered explicitly in the class.",
    "Yes!",
    "Absolutely.. I already have a truly enjoyable experience for economist with an interest in public finance or public policy."
