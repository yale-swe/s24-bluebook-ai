   "comments": [
    "A very hard but very interesting class. You don't really need to do the reading, though it helps and the primary text is well-written.",
    "A survey of the classic discoveries of neuroscience. Follows a predictable pattern, focusing heavily on the biophysics of the cell membrane and the connectivity of a number of representative brain circuits. Rather well-taught. Overall a good class.",
    "This course was a great exploration the nervous system at a very detailed level, from individual neurons to complex neural circuits in the CNS. A huge amount of material was covered, but it was consistently interesting. I would recommend this class to someone with a strong biology background who is interested in learning about a bodily system in excruciating detail. There are two different professor with very different styles, but the lectures were well-done and the numerous TAs were very helpful. The professors could have been clearer on what material would be covered on exams.",
    "Interesting material, but for the most part it's poorly taught. The semester starts out with Forscher talking about membrane potentials at the molecular level. This part is physics (electricity) heavy. You will go on to learn about topics including growth cones, synaptogenesis, synaptic plasticity, neuromuscular systems, sensory systems, the visual system, memory cellular basis of memory, and briefly touch on disorders like Schizophrenia (~0.5 a lecture) and Parkinson's and Huntington's (~0.5 a lecture together). 2 midterms and a final. Perhaps less wrote memorization than PSYC 170, but considerably more difficult.",
    "I took it credit-d and still didn't enjoy it. Luckily I had friends in the class that made it sort of worth it to go. I love the topic but it's focus was far from what I enjoyed.",
    "This class was alright. It wasn't as exciting as I'd hoped, and the lectures were more confusing than they should've been.",
    "Neurobio was one of the best classes I've ever taken at Yale. I would highly recommend it. If you really want to gain something from this course be prepared to put in a lot of work, but it's all worth it if you're really interested in the material. And to me, the material was fascinating.",
    "If you haven't taken the E&M half of physics or cell bio, you'll be behind in this class. You'll have to work really hard and memorize a bunch of stuff, and then the test questions will be on little picky details and all your hard work will be for nothing.",
    "I'd suggest this class only to the individuals who intend neurobio to be part of their major or who have an INTENSE interest in neurobiology. This class can and will give you a large wealth of neurobio knowledge (augmented by taking the lab), but the class, as of now, is poorly taught and tested. While the three professors are VERY capable and VERY knowledgeable an VERY eager to teach their students, their teaching styles are not always conducive to learning. They are so interested in their subjects that they sometimes run off on tangents and run overtime, concentrating on minutiae rather than the bigger concepts.As a result, their tests sometime test these factual minutiae rather than the bigger concepts, making the tests rather grueling. To exacerbate the problem, there are no practice exams and no answer keys (not even for the exams given in the current semester). Thus the class is interesting, but those who are \"not sure about taking it\" should take care before deciding whether they truly do or truly don't.",
    "I think the class was poorly taught. Like most biology classes at Yale, it has many professors with different styles, and it suffers because of that. The first half is really physics heavy, so don't bother taking it if you haven't studied physics at least a little. The second half was actual biology, but still manages to be poorly taught. There were things that we were tested on that was either only mentioned once, or was mention in depth in the days after the test. The book was pretty useless and overly wordy. There were slides used that not only were rarely useful, but were out of order with the packets given, or not in them at all. Why is that? Didn't the same professor make the packets and slides? In other words, don't take this class unless you have to.",
    "Overview and in depth analysis of a lot of material, lots to learn and keep up with. Very interesting, but you have to put in the time",
    "The material is very interesting, especially towards the end when you start to integrate previous material into whole systems like visual processing or language. The textbook is very dense, however, and not always related to the lectures. Some prior knowledge of electricalcircuits is helpful in the beginning for understanding neuron membrane potentials and action potentials. Later on, some knowledge of different parts of the brain would be helpful.",
    "If you need to take this course, you will survive. If you don't need to take this course, well, then its your call. But I think there are more interesting courses at Yale that teach about the brain and there are definitely courses in the bio department that are less work.",
    "Great bio class. Highly recommended. Haig Keshishian and Paul Forscher were good. I particularly enjoyed Forscher's portion and thought he was great.In general, lot's of work (they expect you to know a ton of information). It can be confusing. Try to not to get too far behind.",
    "Yes, but only if you're interested!",
    "Take it if you're willing to work and be confused but want to learn interesting things and work with very smart people.",
    "Be prepared for a lot of material to be thrown at you at a fairly fast pace. The textbook itself is a testament to this, and whenever I lugged it around with me, someone always commented on the size, without fail. Also, there is quite a bit of eltro physics in the first section of the course, so if you can brush up on that beforehand, it would be a big help.In the end, think big concepts for the exams and you should be fine. It's not so much the exact info in the textbook, but it takes a while before you separate the info from the concepts that you're expected to learn.",
    "Interesting course, don't expect to get an easy A.",
    "Avoid if at all possible. If you want to learn about single channel conductance, fine, but if you care about the mind, this will be useless to you. It entirely misses the forest for the trees.",
    "This is a difficult but very interesting class about neurons, starting on the cellular level and zooming outward. There is a lot of reading.",
    "I would recommend it but with a few words of advice. First of all, it is not as impossible as people make it sound. As long as you read the book (and later on for Haig's part of the class that isn't even a necessity) and go to lecture you'll be fine. I guess the class just isn't taught particularly well, and since some of the information is complicated you need to take your own time to figure things out that you don't understand. I was lost for the first bit of the class until I started reading the book thoroughly and then everything suddenly made sense.Also, don't obsess about writing down everything that is said in lecture. Write down the key points, but I would suggest looking through the handouts as you are in lecture so that you don't waste your time writing things down that are already in the packets. I made that mistake and it made lecture very stressful, since a lot of information is covered and it's hard to copy it all down. Once I started looking at the packets lecture became much more enjoyable, since I would only write down things that weren't in the packets, or make notes on the packets that I thought were important.The tests were not that difficult, but my one bit of advice is to make sure to study every topic that could possibly on the test. I know that sounds obvious, but there were some things that were barely touched on in lecture, or were implied to be supplementary, that then turned up on the tests. Pay particular attention to Paul Forscher's lectures on neuronal cell biology and growth cone dynamics because he's really into that and it took up two out of eight questions on the final.With all that said, if you're interested in neuroscience at all take the class. Everything that's covered is really interesting and exciting. It opened my mind up to all the current research going on and all of the questions that still need to be answered."
