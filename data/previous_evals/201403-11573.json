    "I was really excited to take this class because I am very passionate about nutritional justice and the intersection of poverty, health, and food. This class, however, focused almost entirely on racism. While racism is of course an important topic, and integral to discussions of food justice, I felt that the class should have been called \"Racism in the Food System\" or something, because that is almost all that we talked about. I think that the professor's research is about racism in urban farming, so it's understandable that it's what she wanted to focus on, but after a while I wanted to learn about something else. Furthermore, the class size was very small and often I felt the quality of discussion suffered from our small number.",
    "Questions 5: More field trips are not necessary, but the one we went on was very good. More field trips of a similar caliber would be a great addition to the class.",
    "Professor Reynolds is doing some really incredible work in this area; it was very cool to spend a semester with one of the \"scholar-activists\" whose work we were so often reading. I think, though, that she was assuming a sort of base level of comprehension that some of us may not have had. I wish there'd been more unpacking of the readings\/theories\/concepts, before we actually jumped into critiquing them and utilizing them."

The topics covered were great and I enjoyed the 5 minute final presentations as a way to hear everyone else's projects and also really focus on the most important aspects of mine.",

   "question_text": "What aspects of this course need the most improvement?",
   "comments": [
    "Need to delve into topics other than racism; way too theoretical. I wanted more discussion on how we can actually solve problems, maybe some examples each week of different organizations or models. There weren't enough people in the class to have interesting discussions all the time.",
    "Bringing in more case studies from outside the reading. While readings were very helpful, some were repetitive and case studies, even if not written in peer reviewed journals, would have been more helpful.",
    "The learning curve in the beginning of the course felt fairly steep, and the reading load was relatively heavy. However, it improved over the course of the semester as concepts became more clear.",
    "The first class I still think of as being very disjointed, I perceived the readings for the first class to be not cohesive as a group of readings...maybe just a more guided discussion would have been more helpful. I felt like that first class everybody was just sort of spouting opinions and talking at each other rather than having an actual discussion. It took several discussion sessions before we were really able have productive discussion.",
    "The reading load was a little heavy certain weeks and, especially later in the semester, it became impossible for me to do all of the readings, or if I did them all read them thoroughly enough to really grasp them, which was frustrating because I wanted to read them all but didn't have time with my other courses. I'm not sure the best way to solve this, I'm not sure if a shorter, prioritized reading list each week would help or if it would be shaving off important concepts and material from the course. Also, since there were only 8 people in the class this semester (which was great in a lot of ways, I feel like I really got to know everyone in the class), the three hour long discussion sometimes dragged. If the class period is going to continue to be that long it would be nice to break up the class more with activities, or something like that.",
    "There needs to be a better process for handling the readings and covering the theories\/concepts. I felt very much that we would arrive in class and be immediately put on the spot - as in, asked to provide answers to problems I was still wrapping my head around. I would also say that I found the reading responses less useful, and the grades I received on them seemed rather arbitrary. I was frequently surprised (either pleasantly or negatively) by my response grades."

    "If you have any interest in farming, food systems, or public health, and feel any sort of inclination to orient yourself around social justice concerns (hopefully everyone, on the latter point), take it! It's a hefty amount of reading, all rather dense; as a result, discussions were rather tough. But it's a really important topic, and Professor Reynolds is well-equipped to lead you through it. She assigns short weekly reading responses, one instance of discussion leading, a presentation (on your final research topic), and a term paper. The term paper was daunting, but very rewarding; the presentation felt like a missed opportunity to let students talk about stuff that really interests them (missed because we were required to follow a high-speed, highly-choreographed format that seemed to throw everyone for a loop). In sum: a challenging, rewarding, important class."
