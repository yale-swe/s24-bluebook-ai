    "This is an extremely disappointing class. The course material is interesting, and the other students in my class were motivated, but Professor Klein simply does not know how to guide discussion, so the two hour seminar dragged on and on, and we never built toward a common idea.Professor Klein is also completely inaccessible, so if you have questions or concerns, you cannot reach her by email or through a meeting. The final research paper is long and arduous, and Professor Klein basically teaches you nothing about how to write it, so you're in the library during reading week, just freaking out.Don't take this class.",
    "There is a lot of reading. A lot. Klein is extremely knowledgable, but you'll have to seek her out if you want help on the response papers \/ research paper.",
    "Insane amount of work, so don't take it with a lot of other reading-heavy courses, but really good. A lot depends on the people in the seminar, too, but Professor Klein is a good discussion leader.",
    "While I think more students at Yale should be learning this kind of material, I wouldn't recommend this course. There's more work than is justified by genuine engagement with texts or ideas. Discussion tended to feel aimless and poorly run. Professor Klein is really knowledgeable and commands respect but ultimately seemed really busy.",
    "History 129J was primarily a labor history class. It focused strongly on the plight of women, racial minorities, and labor between the onset of the Industrial Revolution in the later half of the 19th century and the present day. Professor Klein assigned a large yet reasonable amount of reading each week for class. I found most of the reading intriguing, but if you are not interested in learning how the capitalist system oppressed everyone except the rich white man, then this is not the class for you. The main purpose of the course was to help you write a 20-25 page research paper on the topic of your choice. Professor Klein provides you with a wide variety of resources and has a great knowledge of secondary literature written on any topics you may be interested in pursuing.",
    "No\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00e2\u0080\u0093there is no guiding thread and you learn little.",
    "I was sorely disappointed by this course, partially because I had such high expectations for it. Prof. Klein is clearly knowledgeable, and I definitely learned a great deal about labor history through her interpretation of our readings. But at the same time she made the class, and as a result the semester, completely unbearable. We had weekly major assignments (\"reading responses\" that were in effect papers, major outlines, etc.) in addition to a reading load almost twice the size of any other seminar I've taken. I'm not one to complain about the amount assigned, except that it became clear that the class simply wasn't able to handle it, and our discussions became disjointed and uninformed. The class even revolted and refused to turn in the final reading response; given that a central motif of the class was unbearable factory owners overworking their employees, I'm surprised at her behavior. Also, the readings she chose were often interesting, but not in relation to each other: instead of having an opportunity to discuss competing narratives, historical styles, more general theories, or other themes that could have driven discussion, we merely summarized the reading in discussion. In that vein, discussion was abysmal: not only did was the class so physically and mentally exhausted by the unbearable amount of work she assigned, but she asked such inane and obvious questions to jumpstart discussion that, even when we had read the material, we found ourselves at a loss as to what to say. A lot of that can be chalked up to the reading, but she underperformed even her uninspiring choice of material.Overall, I regret taking this class. I still have hope that Prof. Klein will be able to put together a decent seminar in the future, as she is a brilliant woman with much to say, but she needs a great deal of preparation before she should be allowed to lead another seminar--it was the worst of the twelve I've taken at Yale.",
    "A very good course on labor history, bound to make you change the way you see the world around you. But because it's a seminar and your research is the primary assignment, you'll have to put in a lot to make the class worthwhile for both you and the others.",
    "Overall it was a great course. However, it should really be called a labor history of America\/class struggle. It is interesting but very liberal. Klein is very intelligent but also very opinionated and some of the readings don't seem to really connect to the theme of the class. She focuses on the lower class worker struggle and women a decent amount. These are her specialties so she knows what she is talking about.",
    "If this class is offered again with the same syllabus as it had this year, I would not recommend it. But I think that is unlikely to be the case: with a revised syllabus the class could be good.The course is heavily labor history, with the aspiration of placing labor history in the broader context of social and economic history. The course does a good job of tracing the history of American capitalism from the late 19th century (the civil-war-era cotton market, the railroad barons, the Haymarket riot) into the early 20th century (craft unionism vs. industrial unionism, workers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 control, the role of women and consumers) through the New Deal and into the late-20th-century service-sector economy. It is a fantastic opportunity to be in a class with other leftist students (how often do you get to walk out of a film screening and have everyone criticize a left-leaning film for not openly advocating socialism?), and the seminar also engages in a serious way with Marx\u00e2\u0080\u0099s economic analysis. However, the readings tended to be somewhat disjointed and our discussions were lackluster.The real reason to take the class (or not to take the class, as the case may be) is the research paper, a 20-25 page project based on original research, with a series of preparatory assignments modeled on the first semester of the History senior essay. This has the potential to be a really formative experience for a junior history major, but in order to be rewarding, it will require that you put in more work than a seminar ordinarily requires. You will need to have a great deal of personal initiative, set up meetings with Klein throughout the process, arrange meeting with librarians, track down primary sources. Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t take the seminar if you are not prepared to start working on your paper a few weeks into the semester\u00e2\u0080\u0094but if you are, the research experience might make the seminar more than worthwhile.",
    "I'd absolutely recommend it. I think everyone at Yale should read this material. Really. However, it is a serious commitment. Don't go into this underestimating the amount of work involved. Every book chapter and article assigned is eminently worth reading, and there are a lot of them. Class discussions were worthwhile, and Dr. Klein leads discussions with a firm hand, which is invaluable in a seminar leader. Don't expect to do a lot of historiography, though. This class is about learning important history, not about evaluating how different authors and schools of historical writing present these issues or any of that sort of thing. The events are to be critiqued and discussed in this class, not the authors."
