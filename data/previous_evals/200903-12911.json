    "Good class. You should take it.",
    "If you need to take this course, I would recommend learning the material on your own (by reading the text book) and using your professor for any questions you may have. A large majority of the professors do no speak English very well, and it is often very easy to get confused in class because of this.",
    "Good as a prerequisite. Try and get a helpful TA. Otherwise it can be very very hard trying to manage it by yourself.",
    "This is a good class that covers lots of calculus material. The homework isn't at all heavy, but the tests are difficult. The only bad thing about this course is struggling side by side with people who already know the material. This is frustrating if you're learning it for the first time, but the instructors will stick with you.",
    "It's a good class with a decent amount of work.",
    "It is a class where you have to teach yourself a lot of the material, but just be sure to ask questions in class. I recommend shopping different sections to see which TA works best for you.",
    "Math 115 meant class 2-3 times a week, a problem set due every week, 2 midterms and a final. The final is 50% of your grade, which is a bit daunting. The material found in the midterms and final were many times a lot more challenging than the homework problems or those gone over in class. Sometimes, things showed up there were pretty foreign too. I would not really recommend this class, but if you have to take it, make sure you geta good TA."
