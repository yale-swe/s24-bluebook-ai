    "Great course where anyone can come in no matter their painting level and learn a ton. We made a variety of works with two major crits. Everyone improved. Especially coming from no formal training, it was amazing to see the progression of my work throughout the semester. You do learn specific skills and new ways to look at the world, but a lot of improvement comes from dedicating significant time to painting.",
    "I wouldn't recommend taking this course. It was dry and unfulfilling.",
    "Occasionally rigorous, often unfocused",
    "the best possible introduction to practical visual art one could ever hope for. ever."
