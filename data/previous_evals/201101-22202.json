    "I would definitely recommend this course to any student. As a second-semester freshman, I thought it would be intimidating with my limited amount of experience in the lab, but I decided to go for it anyway because Professor Van Tassel had recommended I look into the course. In a semester I've learned new methods of experimentation and analysis that some students will be learning in their junior years. This is a course for absolutely everyone and anyone who desires to get their hands wet in the field of research. It definitely shaped some of my ideas and my perception in what type of engineer I want to be.",
    "Very flexible schedule and good way to gain research experience and make progress on a project during the school year, and for credit.",
    "Yes - great way to get experimental design experience and independent research time. Try to get a good graduate student or professor to work under."
