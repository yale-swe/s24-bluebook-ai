   "comments": [
    "Focus more on current events on the continent to tie it in with our historical readings",
    "strengths: material, knowledge and passion of teaching staff weakness: length of papers was pretty unprecedented and a deterrent for a lot of people that originally enrolled and dropped; need to figure out balance of lecture and section; need more transparency on reading responses",
    "Strengths: Really good readings Weaknesses: Summaries of readings in lectures, lectures that were more like seminars, too long of a final essay for a survey course.",
    "The lack of broader class engagement was the weakest part of the class. Furthermore, I'd also point out the pace with which we covered various issues left little room for proper engagement and consideration. The best way to solve those issues is to change the class into a seminar. That said, I'm inclined to want a much deeper discussion with more detail. Unfortunately, as an introductory course, perhaps that is not the best solution. Other than that, the course was excellent because of Jason's immense knowledge in the field and the guest lecturers brought in a unique set of perspectives that I found rather interesting.",
    "The course seemed somewhat disorganized but still taught and enlighten us a lot",
    "Strengths: - Covered a diverse array of material - Engaging in class discussions Weaknesses - Perhaps the focus was too much on breadth and too little on depth - Insufficient guidance on expectations for the midterm and final paper"

   "comments": [
    "amazing class and professor but tough work load;",
    "Lectures are dull. Professor sometimes didn't have enough to cover 50min, would ask kids from African countries what they thought about their home countries politics when pertinent? Final essay was too long and had no course resources, barely any preparation.",
    "If you're looking to get a broad overview of an area of political science so rarely discussed, the class is crucial. However, for those more accustomed to thinking about Africa, this class may be too easy for you at this stage."
