    "\"The course is actually a 'cog lunch' series where outside speakers come and present their research to the cognitive area of the psych department. It's good because most people in the department have scheduled time for it, and some of the talks can be really interesting and bring an outside perspective to cognition. However, recently it's been poorly organized and the talks have been mediocre.\"I wouldn't highly recommend it to another student."
