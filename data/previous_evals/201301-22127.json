    "Recommended only if you're looking for more of an historical rather than economic take of American economic history. Writing intensive. The class title is a bit of a misnomer, as the class progresses as an historical narrative rather than as a chain of economic events leading from one to the next. European economic history was taught from more of a management perspective, which I preferred, as I think I'll get more out of that in the long run.",
    "yes, for a nice and interesting econ credit and for a writing credit.",
    "I would only recommend if you want an easy econ class or writing credit. Otherwise, don't take. There are better econ classes and better history classes.",
    "maybe, if you like history and dont like homework (otherwise take a seminar)",
    "Good course",
    "An incredibly interesting topic with a mind-numbingly monotone professor. Not a lot of work, but Melinda Miller has been, without a shadow of a doubt, the absolute worst lecturer I've had the displeasure of listening to in my life. I had a great TF, which saved the class for me--somewhat.To her credit, Prof. Miller's droning coupled with the warm semi-darkness and high-backed theater seats of Davies Auditorium made for some great afternoon naps.",
    "Okay class. Pretty boring; not much work. I had a great TF which helped a lot.",
    "This is such a great course! Melinda Miller is the best professor I've had at Yale! It was really awesome to apply much of what I had learned in introductory economics courses to American history, and I really enjoyed professor miller's lectures. The course has a few papers and final, so it's by no means a gut, but still extremely enjoyable! GO FOR IT!",
    "If Melinda Miller is teaching it, LITERALLY DO NOT TAKE IT! So much work for so little intellectual gain. What a bummer.",
    "Take it",
    "It is an interesting history and economics class.",
    "Class should be titled \"Writing for Econ Majors\"",
    "This class is average. It's not too difficult, and the papers are pretty reasonable, so it makes for a good writing credit. However, there is sometimes a fair amount of overlap with what you might have learned in high school history class. Consequently, it can get boring and redundant. However, it was sometimes nice to see a more in-depth economic analysis of what was going on in the US. Take it if the subject matter sounds really interesting and you need a writing credit. Otherwise, maybe not.",
    "Lectures are extremely dull - the material could have been presented in a much more engaging way. Section was actually very useful. Take it only if you need the writing credit.",
    "It was an interesting class if you liked at least of two of the three focus areas: America, Economics, and History. The economics was somewhat disappointing, since it did not move beyond supply and demand graphs for the most part. Some interesting econometrics was discussed if you read the readings. The research paper was short but not fun at all.",
    "Clutch writing credit, interesting material. However, Professor Miller was a pretty dull lecturer. She was okay--taught very effectively, and seems super nice--but she didn't really engage the class well. Essays weren't difficult but were sort of annoying--the Wikipedia project in particular was frustrating.",
    "A pretty dry and mundane class, it won't really excite you. The professor's lecture style isn't very engaging either. She lists off many facts and figures, so most of lecture is just writing down what she says, because there's very little information given in the lecture slides.",
    "If you are interested in the subject then this is great. Not very difficult to score well, and you even get rid of one WR requirement!",
    "eh take it if you need a writing credit and an econ credit but IDK there is probably something better. it is a good refresher on american history though.",
    "Cool",
    "Take it. It's a nice writing credit, and good for learning a bit of history with an economics view.",
    "NO",
    "Take this course if you wish to learn about American History. Lectures oscillate between being very fun and very boring.",
    "This class will be the most boring and stupid you take at Yale. I never went to class, since i went the first two weeks and couldn't bear it. A ridiculously easy writing credit that feels very high school .",
    "I would not take this class. Very boring, a lot of material that you've heard before and a couple tedious papers where you might find yourself having trouble figuring out what to write.",
    "I would probably not take this unless you need the writing AND econ. credit. American economic history sounds a lot more interesting than it actually is and you MUST go to every single lecture if you want to really do well.",
    "Take it if you're interested in a basic history of American economics.",
    "I would recommend it if you want an econ credit but don't want to be doing a lot of quantitative analysis.",
    "First, I think Prof. Miller gave very engaging lectures. Looking at American history through an historical lens was very interesting, and I think Prof. Miller presented the material in a fascinating way. The workload is not overbearing. My only critique is that this year the class was bigger than in previous ones, which created the problem of finding enough (and qualified) TAs. My TA did not have any economics background, and I don't think the class should have been allowed to run in this way. Moreover, since TAs were grading assignments and not Prof. Miller, I found some grading to be inconsistent and arbitrary. Overall, I enjoyed the class with this one caveat.",
    "I would recommended it. It was pretty interesting course material and an economic perspective on American history (which you don't get in high school). There are some parts that can be a bit dry but overall it was a solid course.",
    "For a writing credit only",
    "It's more work than it looks, but it's not a hard class",
    "Doesn't focus on anything recent, we really stopped at the Great Depression. So take if you want to write essays and focus on the American Economy pre 1940.",
    "Yes. An easier Econ credit, and it's not math intensive at all.",
    "Bad class.",
    "I would only recommend this class for someone looking for a writing credit. For someone looking for an interesting class on American Economic History, you should look elsewhere. While the topic and class material should be interesting, I was not a fan of the lectures and the way that the information was presented. The pace of the class was too slow and it was difficult to hear what the professor was saying. Perhaps you should take this class with another professor. I don't feel like my writing improved over the course of the semester and some of the assignments were questionable, such as writing a Wikipedia entry. I would recommend taking something else.",
    "I would recommend this class to an economics major who is looking for a writing credit. The papers were graded tough in my opinion, so expect to put in work and possibly not receive the greatest grade. But it seems like a useful class to economics majors that is a little bit different from the classic micro\/macro classes.",
    "Easy writing and ECON credit",
    "Can't pass this up. WR, and Econ, and History. Dope dude.",
    "It's a pretty good economic examination of American history. Some lectures will feel like they don't cover enough, while others feel as though they try to cover way too much. Overall, however, it's a good way to get a writing credit out of the way if you need it. The class may not be incredibly interesting if you aren't big on Econ, but was a good WR and Prof. Miller is clearly passionate about the subject. If you're interested in the subject material, I would recommend checking it out.",
    "General overview of American development starting from Native Indians and going into the 1930s New Deal. Much more history than economics, however so bear this in mind when selecting the class. Very limited in depth economic analysis, mostly look at qualitative data although some articles do delve further into the realm of economics. Despite this looking like an easy class to get a writing credit (big lecture), it's actually a lot of work, at least it was for me. Two 5 page essays and one 10-15 page essay which require a large investment of time to do well in as they require the use of historical sources.",
    "AEH is essentially an AP US History course from an economic perspective (as suggested by the title). The course also emphasizes debunking economic myths in American history such as the influence of railroads and the New Deal on economic growth and whether taxes sparked the American Revolution. This is a good course if you're interested in the material and need a writing credit.",
    "I don't recommend it, despite what you may have heard about this class (econ gut, etc.). Lectures are dry, boring, redundant, and vague. Professor is technologically challenged, the consequences of which the students had to suffer throughout the year through various means. It's your basic APUSH class all over again, same depth of material, with 2-3 supply\/demand curves thrown in and a few figures to memorize. A lot of writing. Final was easy enough, and the assigned readings are interesting, but the lectures aren't worth it.",
    "Definitely not. Maybe easy material if you can fight through the boringness of it. Also, the grading is weird because the papers are so tangential to the material. Very hard to actually do well in the class even though it isn't very difficult.",
    "I would not recommend it. I had to take it for my majors. You will not learn very many things that you didn't already know. It was a very long semester in this class.",
    "Hullo, fellow student. I really like economic history. It's a great subject. That said, take Guinnane's European histories. He's engaging, funny, and a prick-in a good way. Professor Miller teaches about an interesting subject in a less-than engaging way.Nevertheless, this is a WR credit and an econ credit at once. That eases the pain a little.",
    "Horrible class. Boring lectures, too many assignments that are not spaced out well, horrible TAs and random paper-grading. It all depends on which TA you get, so choose wisely.",
    "Miller is a great lecturer, and the class is really informative and interesting. You'll get nice study guides to help you prepare for the final. Writing assingments are very interesting, however they are graded by the TAs who might turn out to be grammar freaks who don't care about your economic analysis. So make sure you take time to write them and visit MULTIPLE writing tutors\/partners to proofread your papers.",
    "Compared to other classes this course may have less work, but it's still time consuming and not terribly rewarding. There were 3 papers (2 5-page and 1 10-15 page) and a comprehensive final exam. The course felt like a review of high school US History with a bit of intro micro and macro thrown in.",
    "Take it if you find it interesting (I did) but know that if Prof. Miller is teaching it, you'll be struggling to stay awake in class."
