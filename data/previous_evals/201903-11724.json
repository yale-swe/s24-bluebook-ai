   "question_text": "What knowledge, skills, and insights did you develop by taking this course?",
   "comments": [
    "I think this course taught me a lot about a few texts, but also a lot about how to learn. I developed skills in careful textual interpretation alongside learning texts like Genesis and Hamlet in the context of metaphysics. I felt like the text I learned the most about as a text was the Kant. But overall, it was a great introduction to the careful reading, writing, and thinking that makes for good work and discussion.",
    "This class helped me a lot with my writing. I was able to improve my ability to take on more sophisticated ideas and write about them clearly and cogently. Additionally, this class places a lot of emphasis on textual analysis, both in paper and class discussion. I also feel I have a much better understanding of some more complicated thinkers, especially Kant.",
    "I learned how to explore a text alongside other students. I also learned how to discuss without a particular direction and let books speak for themselves.",
    "At the end of this course, difficult philosophical texts seemed much more accessible and interpretable. While I was confused at the beginning about what we were supposed to do in terms of the papers, I felt like I understood the task much better by the end of the course.",
    "I developed a keen insight into metaphysics and the nature of intellectual modernity, in addition to developing and strengthening writing and argumentation skills (in the philosophical style).",
    "Learned textual analysis of a variety of philosophical texts throughout history.",
    "I learned how to more critically read and think- to not simply accept what one person says (or for that matter what I believe) and instead to find the flaws in logic and contradictions in argument."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "There was a strong emphasis on students driving discussion. This was good in that it forced us to really think about what we thought the texts meant. However, it also meant that we also floundered a lot and probably would have learned a lot more about the texts themselves in Professor Levene had shared more about her own readings of the texts. It felt like she did that for Kant, but was more reticent (perhaps due to time) in explaining her readings of the other texts in the class. You will find out that she expects to develop very rigorous reading when you get your paper grades back :) But I did think it was a good experience to be pushed so hard to really read and discuss well.",
    "I think the clarity around the grading and expectations of and for assignments could be much improved. I found this class to be very confusing and stressful and not very well organized.",
    "I think the strengths of this course is attention to text, feedback received on thinking and writing, openness and willingness to engage of Professor Levene, the texts and their connections. I think at times the discussions in class struggled a bit to get going, or we would talk around things instead of getting into the meat of it. It would have been nice to feel that peoples points were more connected to each others.",
    "Strengths: Professor Levene is incredibly smart and has a great deal of wisdom on each of the course's texts. The seminar was set up to encourage student participation and nearly all students spoke each class. Weaknesses: There was little directive given to the essays and readings. The readings were lengthy so many students did not see eye to eye during discussions.",
    "Nancy is a major strength! Shes a fantastic seminar leader and an absolutely brilliant person. The strength is the slow pace we approach philosophical texts with; we really got ahold of these texts, got to deep understanding. In terms of weaknesses, I wish we had gotten to Hegel (but the timeline is hard).",
    "Strengths are in the texts and progression of the class. I am not certain however that once a week was sufficient to best understand the material",
    "I think this course is a very good course if you have some experience in philosophy. Even though it was stated that the course should be isolated in terms of prior knowledge, this course is quite daunting when it is your introduction to philosophy. Eventually I got used to it but initially it was a very steep learning curve. Despite this drawback, I found that the challenge did help me grow as a reader and thinker in general."

   "comments": [
    "If you care a lot about grades, you should be aware that Professor Levene a very stringent grader and has very particular expectations for papers. But there is also something very humbling about going through the process of trying to read and write and being shown your weaknesses. Take it if you want to be a better reader, or if the texts interest you, or just to get to talk to Professor Levene. Don't take it if you want an intellectual history in the sense of leaving the course with very clear ideas about the meanings of various texts, and how they relate to each other in a clean way.",
    "I would not take this class unless you want to be confused and stressed.",
    "I think it depends a lot on the people in the seminar. I feel that when shopping this course try to pay attention to the other people in the class as much as possible. Professor Levene is great and very willing to engage and provide feedback to help you improve, but I felt that the discussion did not always take full advantage of the texts.",
    "For students who are confident in their reading comprehension and writing skills, this course provides a great setting for challenging and abstract conversations. I am not leaving this class with a multitude of facts about Kant or Hamlet that I could spout out, however I did learn how to think and write much more meticulously.",
    "I enjoyed this course a lot. If you are the kind of person that holds their grades in high stakes, this course might not be the best for you, but for the sake of the takeaways, I would say this course was well worth it. I left every day with my mind spinning and feeling very lucky to attend this school. There is so much room for your opinions and interpretations of the text, and it is gratifying to use this to your advantage.",
    "Absolutely! Take the course, youd be stupid not to. If you really want to understand things and by things I mean the nature of everything, this course will who you realize what a dumb goal that is... thats the greatest realization, the highest use of intellect, the same freedom from suffering in enlightenment that the Buddha realized. This course will slap you with the beautiful futility of life, its great.",
    "Yes, for a higher level philosophy class this is a great one.",
    "I would recommend this course to other students who are interested in philosophy (specifically, metaphysics) and who are either very confident in their reading and analysis abilities or who have some experience in philosophy."
