    "The course was very good, especially considering that this is the first time it's been taught. I enjoyed the lecture followed by lab sections. I think students who took Ginny's class were more prepared for Lab sections but assuming this class will become a pre-req for Ginny's, more time discussing R might be needed. The last few topics on uncertainty, estimating parameters and stochastic models I think were rushed\/ didn't grasp them as well as other topics. I think the estimating parameter values topic should be taught earlier in the course. Also, students have the option to pick between making a model for their final project or variations on a lit review. I think most students wanted to take a shot at making a model but when we started doing that, we felt extremely unprepared, especially those who had not taken Ginny's course. I think the class is geared more towards understanding concepts rather than applying them. I would recommend setting aside some class time to go through making a model on our own. or create an extra lab section just for making models like once every two weeks.",
    "There were innumerable strengths to the course. As far as weaknesses, I felt like I was ill-prepared to model myself. Working through coding a model and training it to historical data were things I wish were touched on more.",
    "Great class overall, the most difficult concepts were made very understandable. For the years to come it would be good to have more \"hands-on\" modeling where we create models from scratch (so that it is also easier to create the final project).",
    "I think the class started out strong but went downhill especially after spring break. In the beginning, we were actually learning how to do things. For example, we drew compartmental diagrams, wrote out equations, etc. As soon as we got to using R though, the learning declined rapidly. The ShinyApps were dumb because we never actually got to look at the code. We should have been going into R and changing the numbers manually. Additionally, more time could have been spent on going over how to generate beta. For example, a homework assignment could have been looking into the literature to come up with suitable terms for beta. The last part of the class, we spent a lot of time reviewing different types of models\/what we could do with models such as link to cost data, sensitivity analysis, stochastic models, and network analysis. I knew we could do all this stuff prior to taking the class. I took the class to learn how to do this stuff, but instead we just talked about that you can do this. It was somewhat of a waste of the class's time. If people want to learn how to interpret cost information, there are classes dedicated entirely to this subject at YSPH. I wanted to learn how to actually link transmission data to cost data rather than just talk about it as a possibility. I understand that the entire class doesn't know R. However, you didn't even give anyone a chance. One thing you can do in the future is have an intro R session for anyone who has never used R at the beginning of the semester. Pretty much any course I have ever taken that uses R does this. I realize that the final projects were probably terrible, but I think given what we were taught, the class as a whole did a fabulous job on the projects. If anything, I hope it shows you that we were capable of way more than you actually expected from us in terms of R programming and if you had actually taught us more, the projects could have been fabulous. I think that the paper review assignments taught me that I literally had no idea what was going on in the methods sections. I learn by doing. Looking at output from other people's published papers or moving a sliding scale in a ShinyApp is not going to help me understand what is going on methodologically.",
    "I am glad that YSPH is offering this course and I thought that for this course being taught for the first time it was well done. The first half of the semester was great and laid an important foundation for transmission dynamic models and how they work (drawing diagrams, writing equations, etc). I wish that in lab we had spent more time manipulating R code because I feel like we focused a lot on using the shiny apps which are good to show how things work and change but when it came time to do the final project I felt that I had very little practice in R code. It was nice that homework assignments were graded mostly for effort, and that the lab time was used to work through problems alone or in groups. I think for going over homework problems you can just call on people because everyone should have done it, or just focus on the problems people had questions about. I think the biggest thing that I struggled with in this course was the final project. I felt that I didn't get a lot of helpful feedback from the proposal and I felt that for those of us who wanted to build a model we hadn't had any experience with doing that in lab. I didn't feel that my project showed what I had actually learned in the class, and would rather have had a take home final exam almost like a lab problem set. If you're going to keep the project and want people to create a model, I think we need more guidance and practice. The modelling literature is pretty advanced and it was hard to jump from what we did in class to making our own model.",
    "The course provided a thorough overview of topics in transmission modeling but I wish we had spent more time learning how to actually build models.",
    "Strengths: We cover a lot of material, and I learned a lot Weakness: 1) Class participation, nobody wanted to participate (especially people who already have a better understanding of the material from Ginny's class and that was frustrating for people who are new to the subject material) 2) Would have liked more hands on experience with R A recommendation would be to have short,simple quizzes on some of the basic concepts and equations. We weren't held accountable for memorizing some of the formulas but that would have made it easier to learn and do labs for coursework later in the semester.",
    "The beginning of the class was great, easy to follow, and helpful. As the content became more complicated, it became more difficult to follow what was happening in class and connecting it to practice. I wish we would have spent more time looking at the R code for the models. The final project was an interesting exercise. It felt almost too open-ended. I would have liked to work on the project more throughout the semester - develop the idea in the first few weeks and follow the course material as it goes to develop the model, figure out the equations and parameters, inform the parameters, explore model behavior, test different variations, etc. Everything felt so rushed and I think this would have been a more useful way to integrate what we were learning into real practice.",
    "I thought the course was challenging and not very accessible for students with little to no modeling experience."

   "comments": [
    "Instructor: Theodore Cohen \u00a0Dr. Cohen is very nice and makes a lot of effort to make sure students are on board with concepts during class. Outside of class, when it came to helping students with final projects, I felt he was less helpful\/assumed we knew more than we did about the process. Amber was also a bit dismissive toward students during office hours when they expressed concerns regarding making a model, specifically picking parameters or Beta values. How to pick parameters, what range makes sense for different parameters, standard values for certain parameters, which ones can be estimated vs which should be pulled from the literature was not well discussed in class and when students brought this up in office hours Amber was a bit rude (wouldn't hear out students concerns essentially) when addressing their models. This was a shame because during presentations students continually brought up how lost they were with parameterizing. Because this course will be taught prior to Ginny's, I think more attention should be placed on how to make a model and pick parameters\/troubleshoot R.",
    "Instructor: Theodore Cohen \u00a0Ted was a great teacher and really seemed to care about conveying concepts and making sure no student was left behind. You could tell a lot of preparation went into his lectures and he taught difficult concepts with apparent ease. Of note, there does not seem to be a space to provide feedback about the TA, Amber. I want to mention that Amber did such a good job when she was asked to fill in lecturing and with each and every lab. It was evident that she is very bright and I appreciated the effort she put into the class. Both the professor and the TA motivated me to dig into concepts more than I ordinarily would and I am thankful for it.",
    "Instructor: Theodore Cohen \u00a0Ted is very attentive to the needs of students and makes sure that everyone understands all the concepts.",
    "Instructor: Theodore Cohen \u00a0I think that feedback\/guidance on the final project was somewhat poor. We get that you study TB models, but you need to realize that the class should offer a breadth of different subject areas. For example, we spent very little time on vectors. After speaking with a number of individuals who sought help from you for the final projects, it seems like you just had the same answer for everyone-- look in the literature or I'm not familiar with this disease or model. I think as a whole, we did look in the literature, and we got stuck. We went and asked for help, and you just talked in circles and we left in the same position that we started in. Additionally, you seemed to lose patience with the class rather quickly. We didn't always know the answers, and for us to sit there while somebody tries to come up with answer when they clearly have no idea is a waste of time. Sitting there longer will not help us come up with the answer.",
    "Instructor: Theodore Cohen \u00a0Ted is very smart and a good professor.",
    "Instructor: Theodore Cohen \u00a0Dr. Cohen is very knowledgeable and was interested in getting students' feedback throughout the semester.",
    "Instructor: Theodore Cohen \u00a0Ted did a good job of trying to make the course interactive and understandable. It's a challenging topic though so the interactive portion didn't always go as planned.",
    "Instructor: Theodore Cohen \u00a0Very knowledgable and enthusiastic about the course. He's also very willing to help students but is not easy to understand and communicate with."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend the course, it's very interesting and I did get a lot out of it. I didn't know much about modeling before taking the course and the course clarified much of my confusion when reading modeling papers.",
    "Great introduction to the basics of modeling and issues that arise in the construction and utilization of models. Probably necessary to take prior to Quantitative Modeling with Professor Pitzer.",
    "A class to take before Professor Pitzer's class to understand the concepts of modeling for infectious diseases. A great class for anyone who wants to understand models in scientific articles and who is curious about whether modeling is something they would want to dive in.",
    "Class started off strong and went downhill rather quickly. Hopefully it can be improved in the future.",
    "I think this course will improve based on feedback, but it is a good course to take if you want to learn the basics of transmission dynamic modeling!",
    "The material is very interesting and Dr. Cohen and Amber did a great job of explaining a wide range of topics. The idea behind the final project was a good one and I learned a lot by trying to figure out how to build a model, but the expectations for it were not very clear.",
    "I'd recommend. The material will start getting challenging half way through the semester, but I definitely learned a lot from this class. The course helped me confirm that I want to pursue math modeling.",
    "I would recommend this as it's a good introduction to the theoretical foundations of modeling. Hopefully there will be some changes for next year. If you don't learn anything in the class though, it's your fault. You'll learn if you put in the effort."
