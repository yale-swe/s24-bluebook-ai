   "comments": [
    "Good overview of data analysis techniques, but most of the ones presented in these class amount to one-liners in R which you will use for one homework assignment. Jessi is a great professor, though, and you should take the course with her.",
    "Good way to learn how to look like you know what you're doing in R.",
    "I would recommend this class because while the teaching is not outstanding, the class is very manageable. You will end up learning R (mostly through the use of Google) and data analysis through reading the lecture notes and copying examples. The HWs can seem hard, but are always manageable in a reasonable amount of time, and the teacher's office hours are helpful.",
    "A good, practical course. Admittedly lecture is pretty dry, but the assignments are great opportunities to practice R and apply the concepts covered in class. It is what you put in, so make sure you leave enough time for the work.",
    "Yes.",
    "Recommended for those seeking practical experience with advanced statistical concepts. The class is accessible for people with different amounts of experience with statistics (some to a lot) and with R (none to a lot). This is the unofficial counterpart to STAT 312, Linear Models, which goes through the mathematical theory behind the models and techniques that STAT 361 covers. You don't need to take both classes, but either one or both classes might be important depending on your needs.",
    "A good introduction to modern statistical methods and the R language. The course does not assume any prior experience with R, although it's good to have some knowledge of basic probability and statistics coming in. The first half of the semester focuses on regressions and related methods, while the second half gets into some techniques from machine learning, like clustering, principal component analysis, and support vector machines. Prof. Cisewski is very kind and knowledgeable, and the course was organized well, but many of the lectures were snail-paced.",
    "I highly recommend this class. The focus on application and presentation was perfect. It was a great contrast to more theoretical courses in the stats major.",
    "Decent course. You learn some cool techniques in R. Not really challenging though, as the problem sets basically involve copying and pasting code from lecture and changing a few lines.",
    "Chances are, this class is required for your major or your research, so you'll take it no matter what. But if you take it with Prof. Cisewski, consider yourself lucky! She's super nice, helpful in office hours, a very clear lecturer (if a little hard to pay attention to for long periods of time), and clearly puts a lot of thought and effort into the resources for the course. The workload is enough to keep you on track if you slack off in lecture, but nothing crazy. And by the end, you'll have improved R coding skills and a better idea of how to attack a wild data set to show for it.",
    "Take it if you're at all interested in applying (even more) the theory you learn from Linear Models (STAT 312)! I would consider this a continuation of STAT 230 (Intro to Data Analysis). Even if a Professor tells you that STAT 230 and STAT 361 teach the same things, don't believe them (unless both of the professors are the same). STAT 361 is more advanced statistically and assumes that you already know how to do things in R (which STAT 230 doesn't). If you're a stats major, or are interested in applied statistics at all, take this class!",
    "Yes, it's a fun class with a reasonable weekly workload.",
    "Take STAT 361 if you want to learn useful techniques for analyzing real data. I think this is a highly useful course and I would definitely recommend it to another student.",
    "A wonderful introduction to R. If you have the theoretical statistical background required, 100% take this class!!!!"
