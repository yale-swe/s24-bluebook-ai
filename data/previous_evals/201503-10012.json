    "Instructor: Rachel Leah Scheinerman \u00a0Rachel is personable, helpful, and approachable. She clearly has a passion for her subject matter and her teaching. That said, it's also clear that the NT is not her field. While her fresher eye to the NT allowed for good discussions and questions, some of her statements were a little insulting (or perhaps just insensitive) theologically.",
    "Instructor: Rachel Leah Scheinerman \u00a0I think Rachel did a very good job at getting our group to engage in discussion about the course materials and in leading discussion. There were times, however, where it seemed like she was lacking the depth of knowledge on the readings (or outside background) that I may have expected. I think this was because this area wasn't particularly her expertise. However, her expertise in early rabbinic Judaism did offer an illuminating perspective that I probably wouldn't have gotten elsewhere, as regards the New Testament.",
    "Instructor: Rachel Leah Scheinerman \u00a0She is the TA I have had",
    "Instructor: Rachel Leah Scheinerman \u00a0Rachel was great. She cares about teaching. In the beginning she had trouble igniting good conversation. When she brought in her own prepared material and relied less on us remembering word for word the lecture from the previous class , we were on more solid footing.",
    "Instructor: Rachel Leah Scheinerman \u00a0On the first day of section, I asked what was expected for the exams. It wasn't until the week of the midterm that I learned we were suppose to have the thesis of every secondary article we read so far that semester memorized. I skipped work that afternoon, reread every secondary article, and memorized the thesis. I was very angry about this. Then, despite citing many secondary sources in my midterm essay, I was marked down on my midterm for not using enough primary sources. I was also marked down for not including enough detail on the ID questions, when Rachel specifically said \"don't write me a paragraph.\" If I written an extra sentence for each of the IDs, I would have received full credit. I was marked down in similar ways for my short answers. There was literally nothing I lost points for on my midterm that I didn't actually know and was capable of expressing in 50 minutes if expectations were clear. Also, section was a very inefficient use of time. There wasn't enough discussion. When I did ask questions about the assigned readings, I felt like Rachel was not able to answer them most of the time. I really learned to hate going to section and because she was rarely able to answer my questions, I honestly did not trust Rachel to grade my papers.",
    "Instructor: Rachel Leah Scheinerman \u00a0Rachel is super enthusiastic and good at initiating and facilitating lively discussions on controversial questions. She is generous and fair.",
    "Instructor: Rachel Leah Scheinerman \u00a0Towards the beginning of the course, section was a bit of a drag. Rachel noticed its pace and continuously looked for new ways to engage our section. By the end of the course I felt it was a very positive learning experience. Rachel also really cares about the students and that comes across well. Overall, I think Rachel was a fabulous fellow.",
    "Instructor: Rachel Leah Scheinerman \u00a0Rachel did an excellent job of fostering dialogue among the students in section about the material. I particularly appreciated her expertise on the Hebrew scriptures and the important perspective she brought to our section conversations and her lecture on Passover\/other Jewish festivals in the Gospel of John was really interesting. Although I enjoyed the discussions in Section, I thought she could have guided the conversations a little more forcefully to ensure that we covered as much of the reading as possible. That is a personal preference and I realize a lot of ppl prefer a more free-for-all section. I just prefer more structure.",
    "Instructor: Rachel Leah Scheinerman \u00a0Rachel was well prepared and knowledgeable in presenting the course material. She was very thorough in her comments in written material. She was also very available for meetings outside of section.",
    "Instructor: Rachel Leah Scheinerman \u00a0Rachel clearly cares a lot about her students and coming prepared for class. I appreciated how much she thought through what we would discuss in class, bringing in poems or other work that she thought engaged with the readings. She also did an excellent job leading the study sessions, which is no easy task. While at times she let students speak for too long, she was still able to make the sessions very productive. Her perspective as a Jewish scholar and person of faith was also invaluable and I really appreciate the ways that she was willing to share her tradition and perspectives with us to deepen our engagement with the material. Her lecture on the Passover was also one of my favorites of the course (which is no small thing since Professor Dinkler is also an amazing teacher.)",
    "Instructor: Rachel Leah Scheinerman \u00a0Rachel was a wonderful teaching assistant. She absolutely cared about her students, and made every attempt to make reading section engaging and discursive. I got a sense from Rachel that her desire in teaching was for students to grasp the material and that her desire in grading was to allow the work of students to be a reflection of what they had learned. I left section feeling respected and encouraged as a thinker.",
    "Instructor: Rachel Leah Scheinerman \u00a0Rachel is very knowledgable and accesible. Her feedback is very helpful.",
    "Instructor: Rachel Leah Scheinerman \u00a0Strengths: Great listener, good at facilitating discussion, good asking questions rather than dominating discussions. Weaknesses: Seemed to avoid conflict, to avoid being direct with her view or challenging students to defend their positions",
    "Instructor: Rachel Leah Scheinerman \u00a0- Rachel was very well-organized, prompt, and thorough in communication with the class. - Rachel brought in helpful additional primary resources to aid our discussion. - Rachel used other media to help us understand broader ideas and themes of the semester (e.g. the use of the E.A. Poe poem to illustrate the uses of feminist criticism). - Rachel invited us to openly share our views and asked helpful clarifying and critical questions. - Rachel provided helpful feedback on written work - she gave straight-forward criticism of areas that needed improvement, while also affirming what was done well.",
    "Instructor: Rachel Leah Scheinerman \u00a0I so appreciated the thought and attention Rachel gave to our section discussions. Often she brought in secondary sources or collections of primary sources which guided or informed our discussions in a really interesting way. She was also very understanding of our range of backgrounds and opinions; whenever we were unclear or we assumed that everyone knew what we were talking about, she would ask for clarification and draw out the full argument. Furthermore, I VERY much appreciated her comments on my written work, which were detailed, concrete, and kind even when critical. My only critique is that at times Rachel seemed a little uncomfortable with debate and discussion. That is, once we started throwing ideas around and disagreeing with each other, Rachel would at times rein us in a little, when I (personally) would've preferred some guidance in the debate instead.",
    "Instructor: Rachel Leah Scheinerman \u00a0Rachel was very well prepared and eager to help us learn. I would have liked more open discussion and a little less structure to facilitate discussion. That said, some of the discussions in section were excellent. Very high standards. Sometimes they seemed higher than the professor's instructions; for example, regarding paper writing and originality or exam preparation and summarizing all articles. I would also like to interpret the NT by reviewing passages together in section. I think we did this once. I would have liked more constructive feedback on my paper outline. I received brief, positive feedback on it. As I wrote the final paper, I was told my thesis was weak. My thesis in the final paper was the same one in the outline. I really enjoyed Rachel's lecture in class. I learned much from it and found it very engaging.",
    "Instructor: Rebecca Kamholz \u00a0Rebecca was helpful in leading us through our major discussions each week. I would suggest more opportunities to examine NT texts, so that we can analyze and present our conceptions and\/or misconceptions of NT traditions.",
    "Instructor: Rebecca Kamholz \u00a0She was great. She could facilitate discussion very well and was helpful on detailing instruction on the papers and tests.",
    "Instructor: Rebecca Kamholz \u00a0Rebecca is awesome and I loved section. She did a good job leading the discussion and helping us make connections. And she was always willing to answer questions and speak after class.",
    "Instructor: Rebecca Kamholz \u00a0For the most part, the materials assigned for discussion were not directly discussed in class. I am not very interested in listening to how fellow students \"feel\" about various issues.",
    "Instructor: Rebecca Kamholz \u00a0She's very nice and wanted to stimulate discussion. Maybe her interests are a little too much to one side but that's just how things are sometimes. I'm glad she was my TF.",
    "Instructor: Rebecca Kamholz \u00a0Rebecca was very kind and did her best to answer our questions. There were a few weeks in which Rebecca provided some sort of handout or constructed an activity for us; these were the strongest of the section meetings. I sometimes wished our conversations in section would have gone deeper.",
    "Instructor: Rebecca Kamholz \u00a0Brought in different sources for us to critically engage with. Challenged us to have meaningful and thoughtful conversations outside of class.",
    "Instructor: Rebecca Kamholz \u00a0Rebecca facilitated conversation well. She listened when classmates shared feedback and was very prompt.",
    "Instructor: Rebecca Kamholz \u00a015. Ms. Kamholz strongly encouraged questions and class participation during her section meetings. She was also available outside class time.",
    "Instructor: Zachary Gifford Smith \u00a0very organized, clear with expectations, always available with questions (especially about exegesis paper). I hope he's my TF next semester!",
    "Instructor: Zachary Gifford Smith \u00a0I enjoyed my sections w Zach. He was always prepared and responded intelligently to every discussion in section, even when we were totally off base. He had a clear sense in advance of section what he wanted to present and how he wanted to engage every member of the group in the discussion--and was expert at getting everyone involved. He prepared relatively few handouts, but all were useful. We could have used more. I think it would have helped our particular section if he had provided more discussion topics and things to think about before the section meeting. He did this occasionally and I think it made the section more useful as a consequence. This class had a LOT of reading of often obscure journal articles. It would have been helpful BEFORE reading a number them to have a sense of the importance of the article, and what we should be focusing on before we read. For example, one article was over 40 pages but only a handful of pages in the middle were actually relevant and a few more pages at the end. It would have been useful to know that before slogging through the rest of an extremely tedious article reviewing every shred of feminist criticism. Exam prep could have been improved as well. The mid-term was more about test taking--use a pen, budget your time, etc--when it would have been far more profitable to focus on content and how to think strategically about answers for each question on the Study Guide. The prep for the final was better, but he didn't manage the time as well as he might have as we only got through 2 questions and not entirely effectively. Even so, I would say I enjoyed Zach's section and found the discussions useful and relevant. I especially appreciated Zach's thoughtful and timely responses to our written work. He responded promptly and fully, not only to papers, but to all questions throughout the writing process, and his comments were invariably helpful and thorough. I deeply appreciated his availability to discuss course materials and to respond to all written materials. Outstanding on this front--best of any TF I have had at YDS.",
    "Instructor: Zachary Gifford Smith \u00a0Zachary was a very thoughtful TF who motivated great discussions, provided very detailed and useful feedback on papers, and was always approachable.",
    "Instructor: Zachary Gifford Smith \u00a0Overall, he was fantastic. My only gripe is that there were a few classes where we only discussed one of the articles that we had to read for the class, and the article that we discussed was the least interesting of the 2 or 3 that we had to read. This issue does not seem to be rooted in Zachary, though, but something that other students in other sessions experienced as well. Also, I found Zachary quite skilled at moderating the class as a whole. I was very glad to have him as a TF and enjoyed working with him immensely.",
    "Instructor: Zachary Gifford Smith \u00a0- Zachary should find ways to engage all students into discussion in his section, since I sometimes feel left out.",
    "Instructor: Zachary Gifford Smith \u00a0Zachary was well organized, knowledgeable and approachable. However, and this may not be entirely his fault, the expectations for the assignments, especially the Exegesis, were unclear. The grading of the assignment seemed remarkably harsh as well.",
    "Instructor: Zachary Gifford Smith \u00a0Zachary did a good job of leading sections--he covered the material well and involved everyone. I found his comments on written assignments somewhat less helpful. Part of that was that what was expected for the first two assignments was very unclear, but part was also that many comments seemed to focus more on stylistic choices than on substance. All in all, though, he was very prepared for sections and always quick to respond.",
    "Instructor: Zachary Gifford Smith \u00a0Strong teacher, very prepared, friendly guy. Tough grader (I think). But overall, I think he has a lot of potential.",
    "Instructor: Zachary Gifford Smith \u00a0He was a good TF. Nothing really exciting and nothing really horrible. I found his grading to be inconsistent. I followed the feedback on my paper outline in writing my exegesis paper, and the grade and comments on my paper were significantly different.",
    "Instructor: Zachary Gifford Smith \u00a0Zach did a great job engaging with the material and facilitating discussions in section. I liked how he varied the tactics and the time where he made us come with a summary of the article was really helpful. My one critique was on his grading of our essays and outlines. He gave me positive comments on my outline, but then on my final essay he critiqued (and perhaps docked points) on aspects of my essay which he said were fine on my outline. Other than that, he was a great TF and lead section well. He did a great job leading lecture that one day.",
    "Instructor: Zachary Gifford Smith \u00a0Zachary is well-meaning and well-intentioned. He was always prepared for section with a variety of approaches to the material. He provided thorough and helpful comments on my assignments. He was available and responsive to my questions.",
