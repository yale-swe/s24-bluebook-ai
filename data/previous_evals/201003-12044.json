    "This class was taught by an extremely qualified professor who is kind and sharp, but he did not know how to construct a class. He gave tons of reading, but we were never rewarded with a discussion based on those readings. I wish this class had been more specific.",
    "yes, if you have any interest in development. this class really deconstructed it for me, and i came out with more questions and wanting to know more. ndegwa is a chill guy, though it felt he was talking more as a world bank employee (which he is) than an objective teacher. but overall, it's a good class.",
    "If you want to study about African development, take it. Its a fun class if you do the readings and keep up with them. the workload is not too bad, one midterm, paper and final and professor ndegwa is really helpful in making it flexible for his students.",
    "I learned a lot as I have never taken a political science class, but it was very difficult to bring all of the readings together.",
    "A course with a very broad scope--all political science theory, across all the continent of Africa. A little too much material, in fact; it could do with a more focused approach.A lot of reading, but it doesn't get brought up in much detail in class. Not much work, otherwise.Prof. Ndegwa is the course's main strength, since he is an expert in the field, as he worked (works?) for the World Bank.",
    "yes; soooo much to know about the continent, so many misconceptions to be dispelled!",
    "Everyone should absolutely take this AFST class with Mr Ndegwa if he is still around. He is a great teacher. He works for the World Bank and we got to read his articles in class. He took us to a conference in New York where we got to listen to speeches delivered by some people eg George Ayittey whose works we reviewed in class.He also used to bring us fruits, donuts and coffee to class because the class was an early morning class and we would all be groggy and hungry.He went out of his way to make learning an enjoyable experience for all of us.Looking back, I think I learnt more political science whilst I was just sitting and chatting over coffee in class than I did whilst I was doing the readings.",
    "Interesting for development. Don't take it if you want to know more about AFrica."
