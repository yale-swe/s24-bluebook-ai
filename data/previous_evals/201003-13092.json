    "Yes, I say it is a good CS class with very practical use. More importantly, it imparts very good programming skills.",
    "Class is not too difficult if you know C. A lot of grad students. Fischer is definitely not the best Professor out there - his lectures are very boring and you can get most of what he says in class from the books. He doesn't really encourage questions - something which I really didn't like. His psets were very strange and I didn't particularly enjoy working through them. That said, the class is useful and you will come out knowing quite a bit about Object Oriented design features and programming techniques.",
    "A standard course in OO programming. It will make you a solid programmer and teach you some of the OO concepts you might not already know. Course is C++, homework is usually good in terms of using concepts learned in class. Most people taking this course will have already had some OO experience, but the course doesn't assume it. Take the class, it's helpful, not too hard, and if you don't already, you'll learn some great coding practices."
