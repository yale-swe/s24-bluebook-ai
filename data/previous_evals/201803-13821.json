   "comments": [
    "This was a required class for first year students. All the other required classes were held at the medical school, while this one was in Science Hill. Although we did have enough time between the required classes to arrive on time to this one, it would have been much easier to have all our required classes on the same campus. Also, for the most part, we already knew almost everything that was discusses in this class. It was nothing new to us. One strength of the class is that we got to learn to code. I enjoyed using the online MatLab learning system to learn more about coding.",
    "I liked how some classes had a lot of discussion and opinion, but I don't think an hour and half for some of these topics was necessary to get the main points across.",
    "The major strength of the course are any lecture taught by Dr. Greco. Her classes were by far the most engaging and I was willing to listen and learn from her because she effectively used interactive teaching strategies. The major weakness of the course is that the code on your own section was completely useless. I did not know anything about coding going in to the class and I didn't learn anything from the online tutorial because I didn't have any sort of project to practice coding and actually understand how it could be used in biological science.",
    "Some part of the course could be a remote online course.",
    "Strengths: Valentinas lecture Weakness: time",
    "I think the coding module could be improved.",
    "Discussions are difficult with such a big group. Faculty talks and rotation talks were very helpful. I did not like the use of laptops to reflect on the student rotation talk presentations. I found the use of computers distracting both as an audience member and presenter.",
    "Interesting lectures. Some of the classes might be a little bit boring because the class were too long.",
    "I think the class could have been greatly improved if there were a policy to not use computers during class. Dr. Greco did this for her classes and those were by far the best classes of this course. It was hard to be engaged with the class when people's computers were so distracting. This was especially the case for the end of rotation talks. I thought that requiring students to give online evaluations during the talks was highly distracting, and the comments themselves weren't really that helpful. Instead, I think it would be much better to have one or two faculty members evaluate the students, and for the classmates to just listen to increase audience engagement.",
    "Strengths: a lot of discussions in the classes Weaknesses: the classroom is too big It would be better if we can take this course in a little smaller classroom",
    "This course was a great chance to get feedback from faculty about the different aspects of graduate life. Some of the lessons seemed to be dragged out to last the entire 90 minutes.",
    "I think the opportunity to engage with peer students on familiar but important topics offered by this course is invaluable for honing perspectives on ethical issues.",
    "Strength: Good chance to get a foundation in R. Weakness: Not very engaging",
    "More engagements",
    "Every session was essential for graduate life and research in some ways, but I felt that the course as a whole was not very coherent.",
    "Strength: The course gave us many useful information, not only in academic filed but in daily life.",
    "I liked the coding assignment, I thought it was a very helpful introduction into MatLab."
