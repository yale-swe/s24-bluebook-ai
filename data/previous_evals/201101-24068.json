    "I was hoping to delve into Islam deeper and truly understand the religion and from that make a very symbolic spiritual building. Instead I feel like it was an exercise in form-making with no real substance behind it.",
    "Expectation: do something I had never done before and was relatively uncomfortable withMet: yes",
    "The issues set forth at the beginning set my expectations to engage a new culture and religion and design a mosque in response. I was very glad to have this opportunity and immersed myself in reading and research, precedents and possibilities. As this was the first time that they have taken on this project as a studio I think the hard issues were often shied away from. Not maintaining this focus my take was that all of the projects lost their strong response, either distracted by the site or tangential geometric explorations. The controversial site was very interesting but too large and the program was too large to take in with all of the issues embedded. A mosque for 1,000 \u0096 3,000 could have been developed to a greater extent instead of the original 14,000, which there are no precedents close in scale. Without this experience and guidance the problem was daunting and responses weakened. I thought that the specialists brought in were a wonderful help, and a pre-organized steady rhythm of mosque specialists and scholars which I am sure are present even at Yale Divinity would have been immensely helpful.",
    "My expectations of the studio were to develop the project to a certain level of detail and achieve a critical position on the status quo of the mosque.The level of resolution represented by the final design indicated, I believe, a strong ground and concept but ultimately I do not think my expectations were met at the detail level - but that responsibility lies with me."

    "The school needs to have more than 1 plaster printer. Everyone uses the plaster printer because it is cheaper and faster yet there is only 1 and 4 plastic.",
    "Yes, although the powder printer queue issue needs to be resolved. Why the hell is it first-come-first-serve, and why does the school not buy another of these instead of a new type of plastic printer as they have?",
    "The resources were wonderful and very adequate.",
    "Yes"

   "comments": [
    "Both of our studio guests were extremely helpful.The one thing I would change about the structure of the studio- and this is purely a personal preference, not a problem- would be to have more major and minor studio sessions instead of the very even desk crit every monday and thursday that we had. This would force students to commit to drawings and then stand back and analyze their effectiveness, as well as allow for days of thinking without the pressure of producing a new drawing or model. Again, this is just how I would prefer to work.Also, as a more general school-wide comment, more linearity between the midterm and final juries would be a welcome change, as would not having Daniel Sheerer on reviews as he tends to drown out other critics who have insightful and relevant things to say.",
    "I think it would have been very helpful to have many more pin-ups in the beginning of the semester, when it is helpful to share ideas with our peers. The pace of 2 desk crits a week became a bit less productive as the semester went on.",
    "The most valuable aspects were the studio trip in pushing an understanding of the issues to the next level and the outside experts brought in. The continuous set of desk-crits was stifling and a greater calibration of what was needed to develop and when per project would have been helpful. With the complexity of the issue there needed to be a greater research phase and pin-ups and studio discussions to support mutual learning through the studio. It was hard to have a discussion with studiomates because we did not have an engagement with each other\u0092s projects.",
    "Private desk crits were certainly the most frequent means by which to engage with the professors. Pin-ups were infrequent and might have occurred with more regularity."
