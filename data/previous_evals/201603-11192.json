    "I learned way more about language than I ever thought I would, and I learned that linguistics is actually really cool and interesting! Never knew how to make so many trees out of words and sentences.",
    "General understanding of basic concepts in linguistics and how to think about problems in linguistics. A good survey course introducing the field.",
    "A basic understanding f linguistics",
    "I gained a solid base for future linguistic studies, from phonetics to phonology to morphology to syntax. I went from knowing nothing about the study of linguistics to wanting to pursue it as a major.",
    "Linguistics is not a class many people take or even know about in high school. So I think we all learned *a lot* about a very interesting subject. Besides all the technical and analytic skills we learned for working with language, we also gained an understanding of how to appreciate language and be non-judgemental about speakers' dialects.",
    "A new-found appreciation for the analytic study of language and dialect. Basic understanding of phonetics, phonology, morphology, syntax, etc.",
    "Not much. I learned that I don't want to be a linguistics major (which I was considering before taking this course).",
    "I learned what linguistics is as a field of study and so many interesting things within each subfield.",
    "I didn't know anything about linguistics before this class, now I feel I know quite a bit I gained an appreciation for the universal relevance of language and how the field is really a beautiful microcosm of a number of other areas of study.",
    "I learned about the basis of language--sounds, words, and some syntax. I learned bits of historical linguistics and sociolinguistics. This was the most interesting course I took this semester. Almost every day during the end of the semester and since I've been home for break, I think about something I learned in this class at least once. This class makes me want to take more linguistics classes in the future.",
    "I was able to gain a better understanding of what the field of linguistics entailed. The course allowed me to understand what linguists study and research.",
    "For me more than anything, this was a \"fun fact class.\" Am I ever going to use what I learned in a practical setting? No. Will I, at some point, identify where someone is from based on their accent\/word usage? Very possibly. I don't know that I developed any major skills or insights, but I think if it had focused on sociolinguistics more, I might have developed more insights.",
    "This class is great for anyone looking for an introduction to the field of linguistics. It's interesting, Jim is great, and you'll be able to shower your friends and family with linguistics fun facts.",
    "I learned a lot about the mechanics of language, particularly different letters, words, and sentence structures. I now have a greater ability to recognize characteristics of others' speech.",
    "Great introduction to the field. This course definitely made me reevaluate how I think about language.",
    "This class really opened my eyes to the complexity of language in a way I had never experienced before. I would highly reccomend this class to anyone!",
    "This course was useful in forcing me to apply previous knowledge on new examples of language use. For example, through the course, I came to pay more attention to how people use language in the world around me. I tried to use the knowledge I gained in the course in order to interpret and understand the use of language around me.",
    "From this course, I gained an overview of methods used in linguistic analysis. I also developed familiarity with the field in general, including its basic premises and the type of work done by linguists.",
    "I learned a great deal about the human language faculty. I'd also say our discussion of sociolinguistics made me a better, more considerate person.",
    "This course helped me develop knowledge about the foundations of the discipline of linguistics. I learned how linguists approach their subject, as well as the central elements of phonetics, phonology, morphology, and syntax. The course gave me an appreciation for the difference between prescriptive and descriptive grammar, along with the reasoning for why linguists study the latter. I now have a vocabulary and framework within which to discuss language and sounds. Finally, the course exposed me to the different ways that language is used in different locations and cultures, which has helped make me a more aware global citizen.",
    "Through this course, I gained an introduction to the field of linguistics and gained foundational knowledge in the foundational disciplines of linguistics, including phonetics, phonology, morphology, and syntax. I had never taken a linguistics class before in my life, nor did I know much about any of the main linguistic disciplines. This course was an incredible introduction to the field of linguistics, and it has helped me view the world and language in general in a completely different light.",
    "This class gives an unmatched insight into human culture and language. The course teaches you the basics of almost all fields of linguistics.",
    "Good overview of linguistics in general. Jim is a good instructor and manages to make all the material fairly accessible for all.",
    "I developed a good understanding of general linguistics, the kinds of work linguists do, and how interesting languages can be.",
    "I developed a different lens through which to examine language. It has made me consider more carefully the way I and others speak and communicate. I've learned that delving into the intricacies of language is much more fascinating than rattling off the \"correct\" conventions of grammar.",
    "I gained some specific linguistic knowledge about phonetics, phonology, morphology, and syntax in this course. Mostly, though, I walked away with a more open-minded (and probably more accurate) idea of what language is.",
    "Really interesting look at language, great engaging perspective."

   "comments": [
    "It's a somewhat boring introduction into linguistics which sometimes dwells on interesting aspects on the language but overall concentrates too much on a few specific things which are arguably useful to future linguists but hardly interesting to those who only wanted to get the gist of the discipline. For me having to learn all the characteristics of sounds by heart to retrieve then on the exam wasn't intellectually interesting at all (understanding how different sounds are created etc. - that's so much fun - but having to memorize all that while this information can always be easily checked is disappointing), whereas in the same time we skipped some conceivably more entertaining parts of linguistics such as sociolinguistics (I was expecting it so much but, regrettably, in vain), pragmatics, semantics and others. I expected 110 to be more of a concept course but it was quite the opposite: we concentrated too much on tiny specifics of, for example, phonetics and forgot about the general picture (however, the morphology part was very decent in that respect). Moreover, section was hardly helpful and often chaotic: much as I liked the instructor personally, he often came unprepared and disorganized to class (e.g. giving the quizzes back once lasted for 15 minutes because they were never sorted by section, so he had to go through 60 quizzes despite the fact that 40 people are not in this section). Quiz 2 was never handed back for no apparent reason, which can't be less helpful given that I did poorly on it and wanted to learn from my mistakes. My copy of Quiz 3 was in my hands for 5 minutes after which it had to be returned because 'they don't want spare copies of quizzes circling around'. Well, Quiz 1 was handed in to everybody and nobody seemed to care. For me, getting the quiz back so that I would have time to review it after class is crucial for learning. Lastly, course also emphasized some general statements which beg an empirical testing as obvious, especially in aspects pertaining to political correctness such as 'all languages are equally complex', which is clearly not true and there seems to be a lot of research to substantiate that hypothesis (there's nothing inherently wrong with some langauges being less complex than others, toki pona being my favorite example). But at the very least, for me this aspect begged some discussion or approaching it from various perspectives instead of sweeping the whole issue under the rug. As for good sides of the course, I found the guest lecture by Ben Zimmer close to fascinating - you should be inviting him next year, too! Jim was very friendly as an instructor and a person, so I liked him very much.",
    "Jim Wood is the greatest human alive. He is clearly so passionate about the field and that transfers to the class. I think the TF's could probably use a little more instruction because it seems hard for them to answer all the questions that students have on the fly (linguistics is hard). But in general, loved the class! I also like the quiz structure.",
    "don't make any accommodations for athletes, making it almost impossibly difficult for me to take it",
    "Generally solid class that covers basic subfields in linguistics in as much depth as possible given the nature of a survey class. As survey classes tend to be, it isn't necesarrily teaching anything incredibly insightful or deep, but that's inevitable for an intro class\/is not a criticism of the class or prof. The main way to improve the class would be making section optional. There is literally no point of mandatory section in a class that isn't discussion based. People that need help with problem sets or need to review lecture can go and those that don't can save an hour of their lives.",
    "The lectures were interesting, and Professor Wood is fantastic",
    "The strength was the lecture. Prof. Wood was very engaging and made linguistics very fun, even for those who aren't particularly inspired by the subject. The weakness was the sections. I don't' feel like I learned anything in the sections. They felt like an exact repeat of what we had just done in class. If they had contained different information or different ways of looking at the same information, I would have found them more engaging.",
    "I really have very few complaints about this class. Lecture was interesting, well organized, and the class was not too difficult. Assessments and homeworks were very fair and all in all it was a great class.",
    "The grading system for the homeworks presented many challenges at the beginning of the course. The homeworks are graded on a 5-point system ranging from 0 to 6. The multitude of 4's I received during the first half of the course almost caused me to drop the course. Many times, a minor mistake here and there would lead to a 4, which is understandable since the grader, in his\/her mind, will not grant a 5 to an imperfect assignment. However, one can easily envision a scenario where a theoretical 90% on a hw is repeatedly rounded down to a (4 = 80%), a letter grade drop or worse. This outcome is incredibly frustrating to the student who is mastering the material at a 90% level but being rewarded with B- or C's.",
    "This course was extremely boring and low-level. It was almost exclusively rote memorization. The textbook was very poorly written, and lectures were not much better.",
    "homeworks were brutally long and repetitive. The class was interesting though. I really enjoyed the first section and thought it tailed off a bit by the end, but that just may have been my preference.",
    "The weekly homework really helps you practice and understand the material taught during the week. I wish that we covered other fields (semantics and pragmatics) at least briefly, but I understand that we had a limited amount of time.",
    "STRENGTHS Interesting Material Very Comprehensive lecture Enjoyable and helpful homeworks WEAKNESS Textbook readings poorly integrated into lecture and section Homework grading system results in unreasonably low percentages given the largely qualitative and estimate-y nature of the grading system",
    "Strengths: provided a good foundation for any future linguistics class I may take, taught in a way that is relevant to the world around us, lecture was always open to questions and discussion, course proceeded sequentially in a way that allowed us to build on knowledge from previous units Weaknesses: Often I felt that we were getting way too caught up in tiny details. Even though it was great that everyone felt comfortable asking questions, the class sometimes got way too sidetracked and caused us to fall behind. I really wish we had gotten to cover more socio- and psycholinguistics, which I find to be the most interesting parts of linguistics and we hardly learned much about it at all. Maybe in the future, if the instructors could set aside a unit for those topics, or ways to incorporate them in most\/many classes.",
    "I really wish this course covered more conceptual ideas of language, rather than just the four areas we studied. Rather than getting into the details of four areas (like knowing the IPA chart or being able to recall all the features from memory), I think that taking a broader approach and looking at many areas of the field would be a better fit for an intro class.",
    "I enjoyed the way that this course was taught. Sometimes, the lectures could be a bit dry, but overall, they were really informative.",
    "I thought it was a lot of material to cover over the semester and we didn't get into satisfying detail about a lot of stuff. Syntax felt rushed at the end and I was guessing on sentence structures on the final. I thought there was a sense of cohesion in the course though which I appreciated. Studying for the exams wasn't too hard because everything built on the things we learned before.",
    "There's not much that can be done about this, since LING 110 is an introductory course, but I did find some sections in the class to be glossed over a bit more than I would have liked. Also, the first few days of class make it seem as though the class will incorporate sociolinguistics or psycholinguistics or something. NO. This class is very quantitative and data driven. If you're looking for something other than straight science, take something else.",
    "The course was great! No improvements come to mind, other than the often frustrating inconsistency in homework grading.",
    "Really only one weakness, the homework had to be typed out, but the formatting was always quite tedious and would have been much quicker if written out.",
    "The material in this course is deceptively dense and difficult to memorize. I think it would be helpful to teach students strategies for how to go about learning and memorizing things like distinctive features. I struggled with this class because the study strategies I'm used to employing just didn't apply well for this class.",
    "The material was interesting and Professor Wood was an amazing lecturer. I can't really think of a way the class could have been improved.",
    "The course was well organized. The pacing of chapters, lectures, quizzes, and homeworks was manageable. I really enjoyed the instructor and lectures. There were very few weaknesses to this course. One complaint I have is that a lot of the course was focused only on English. I wish more concepts were covered that were relevant to other languages; for example, maybe a few more examples of how syntax varies across languages.",
    "The course is structured logically -- the material is cumulative and forms a natural progression. This format is a strength of the course, as it makes the various subfields seem more like a continuum than discrete areas of linguistic analysis. A weakness, however, may be what this logical structure leaves out: though I enjoyed the introduction to various techniques, some of my classmates wished the course covered \"macro\" areas of linguistics, such as cognitive and social implications, more deeply. To me, however, a focus on \"nuts and bolts\" seems appropriate for an introductory course.",
    "One of this course's strengths was its ability to cover a broad range of material, including phonetics, phonology, morphology, and syntax. I appreciated the fact that the course provided me with an understanding of what exactly linguists study and how they approach their subject. Another strength of the course was the slides, which were meticulously constructed and were a great resource for reviewing the material. One way to improve the course might be to take a bit more time to explain new concepts. Some of the ideas were complex or nuanced, and it might have been helpful to slow the pace somewhat when introducing these new ideas, or possibly explain them a second time, using a different explanation.",
    "This course is extremely strong, and there is little that I would change about it. Prof. Wood is a skilled lecturer, easily conveying his excitement for the subject manner and explaining new concepts in a clear, logical manner. The problem sets aided in the learning of new concepts, and the exams were challenging, yet fair. The only suggestion I would make is to attempt to start section sooner. Due to scheduling difficulties, section with the TFs only started about a month and a half into the semester, and I think it would have been beneficial to learning the new concepts if we had been able to go to section earlier. Still, the course was amazing.",
    "The strength certainly lies in the professor Jim Wood; he's knows an absurd amount about each field of linguistics and is very enthusiastic. One thing that might be changed is the grading. Grading can often be fairly harsh, especially on homework assignments.",
    "Overall, this class is very strong. Prof. Wood was a great teacher--incredibly passionate about the subject and very eager to teach. There wasn't a lot of homework feedback, though--I'd appreciate having a couple brief comments on why I got the score that I got.",
    "This course is strong in that it offers a captivating look into several subfields of Linguistics while maintaining the central thesis that language lends itself to scientific investigation. At times, the syllabus struggled to balance breadth of topics and depth of examination, but overall, the class was well-run."

    "Read Pinker instead.",
    "Yes!!! Jim Wood is a GREAT HUMAN. So passionate about linguistics--he makes everyone excited to learn it, which is pretty impressive. Also just really socially conscious and awesome. Get to know him outside of class! I think you'll find that linguistics is way more interesting than you originally thought. The homework isn't very hard, maybe an hour or two a week, and Jim teaches in a way that really helps you learn. Definitely take the class!",
    "don't take if youre an athlete",
    "Good survey if you want to learn something about linguistics and see if the field would interest you.",
    "LING 110 was a great course!! I took this class as a senior and wish I had taken it earlier because I definitely would have explored more linguistics classes later. I learned so much this semester about phonology, morphology, and syntax. The problems we did were all kind of like logic puzzles, so doing problem sets was overall very enjoyable. The workload isn't bad at all - weekly psets, 3 quizzes, and a final - and section is actually super helpful.",
    "It's a solid class, Professor Wood is great. A tad dull at times, my TA really wasn't too great so he put a damper on things. Overall a very good class.",
    "Yes, take LING 110. Everyone should be exposed to this highly useful and interesting subject. LING 110 gives you a very solid overview of linguistics and is complementary to other courses and disciplines.",
    "Absolutely take this class. I think most people in this class were taking it to fulfill a Social Science distributional requirement, and its a fabulous course for doing so. I think a lot of us discovered a hidden passion for language, and if you are at all interested in languages, it is worth discovering this in yourself as well. Jim is a great professor with a very interesting backstory (Air Force helicopter mechanic \/\/ was sent to Iceland \/\/ learned Icelandic \/\/ fell in love with language \/\/ became a linguist [honestly goals]). He creates a light-hearded and fun class while still teaching a ton and getting very important messages about language across. We also had a guest lecture during one class from Ben Zimmer, WSJ journal columnist and low-key popstar linguistic.",
    "If you are a STEM major looking for a nice SO credit, take this course. It is probably as analytic an SO course as you can get. The homeworks are pset-like with very little writing involved. Professor Wood is an awesome lecturer and super approachable and helpful.",
    "Take this course only if you ware looking for a social science gut that won't make you work too hard. There are a few interesting nuggets in the course, but it is dwarfed by the large quantity of boring material and busy-work. Grading is also very arbitrary.",
    "Yes, if they are interested in linguistics. Otherwise it can get a bit lost in specifics.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student who is trying to get a feel of what linguistics is like (especially since it is not something that is usually taught at the high school level).",
    "I absolutely would. This class made me fall in love with linguistics. Jim is funny and engaging, the lectures always had me fascinated.",
    "Not too much work, super interesting, and will change the way you look at the world around you. I took it alongside four STEM classes and it was the highlight of my week.",
    "This is great introduction to phonetics, phonology, morphology, and syntax. If you're interested in other areas of linguistics, this is definitely not the course for you. Rather than study many areas of the field, this class only covers four topics. We did go into pretty good depth in each, but I didn't come away with an understanding of linguistics as a whole.",
    "I would recommend this course to other students, but for best engagement, it would be good for students to know what they are getting into before taking it; in other words, they should have a general understanding of the field of linguistics or what it entailsphonetics, phonology, morphology, and syntax. Students should not expect to learn much of semantics or pragmatics in this course.",
    "This was a good class and I'm glad I took it. I'm also really glad I took it Credit\/D. The syllabus gives this wishy-washy grading policy, but I was later informed that my 93% was not an A, which I found irritating (if the syllabus gives a wishy-washy, we-want-to-see-you-improve grading policy, there shouldn't also be a rigid structure for how grades are assigned behind the scenes). I thought the exams were fair. Definitely go do lecture. I went and only paid attention to 40% of what was said, but still absorbed enough to make the exams okay. Put in the work at the beginning of the semester so you're not playing catch-up later (aka phonetics will come back to bite you if you don't learn it the first time). This class is mostly good for learning \"fun facts\" and I've definitely had interesting conversations outside of class about what I learned.",
    "The answer is, it depends. If you like looking at data sets and doing P-sets, take it. If you want to learn less about the mechanics of language itself and more about how humans interact linguistically, don't.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course. Jim Wood is phenomenal, and the class is extremely interesting, without ever being too much work.",
    "This course is incredibly interesting and the topics are very visible in everyday life.",
    "I would absolutely reccomend this class to anyone. While not too challenging, the material was extremely interesting, and Prof Wood was one of the best lecturers I've ever had.",
    "Yes, I think it is a course that teaches knowledge and ways of thinking applicable to everyday life. Everyone can serve to benefit from being more aware of the way people use language around them.",
    "This course is a great introduction to the methods of linguistics.",
    "ABSOLUTELY. I'd say the first three lectures, at least, should be required knowledge for all people, so at least shop it.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student who is interested in exploring the field of linguistics. I felt that I left the course with a good understanding of how linguists approach the subject and had learned the basics of a number of the subfields. It definitely took a lot of time to understand the material, memorize the necessary tools, and complete the homeworks, but the work was intellectually stimulating.",
    "I recommend all of my peers take this course. Prof. Wood is an excellent teacher who is so excited to teach his students about this rather obscure field, and he makes the course interesting, engaging, challenging, and fun. This course has made me rethink what I want to study at Yale, making me lean heavily towards becoming a linguistics major, something I never expected to say.",
    "Absolutely! Good for any major.",
    "Definitely take this class if you are willing to know more about the field of linguistics. A great class for CS majors as well - you'll definitely be able to relate more to the later parts of the course.",
    "This was a great class! Prof. Wood is an amazing lecturer, and his passion for linguistics really shows. I came in with no background at all, but I've developed a general understanding of linguistics and I'll hopefully take a couple more linguistics classes at Yale.",
    "Amazing class and Jim Wood is a wonderful professor. The material is so interesting and goes beyond the nitty gritty details. You will gain such an appreciation for all language and for Jim Wood.",
    "If you are interested in thinking about language in a vigorous, systematic way, this course is for you. It will provide the answers to questions you didn't even know you were asking.",
    "I recommend this course to any student, especially students who are interested in language as a concept or studying foreign languages. You learn some interesting\/important general concepts about language and dialects. The course gives you a very basic introduction to phonetics, phonology, morphology, and syntax, and you learn principles that are applicable to the study of any foreign languages and that will help you think about how specific languages are different from and similar to each other. If you already know that you're super in love with linguistics, though, you might want to skip this very general overview course and dive straight into Syntax I or something like that. Also, the workload is super light.",
    "Yes, if you are interested in language and want to gain a new perspective on its use, evolution, and structure."
