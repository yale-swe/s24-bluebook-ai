    "If you've done 158, you know the drill. Traditional characters don't take long to get used to, especially if you download Pleco's optical character recognizer. Topics spread from Taiwan, Hong Kong, post-Deng China, and the whole spectrum. Lots of good vocab too.",
    "It's a course which you can learn a lot about Chinese culture, but it might be a little bit difficult for some of the students.",
    "It depends on what you are expecting from the course. If you've spent a good amount of time studying Chinese abroad, you probably won't make tons of progress in this class, but it's a really chill way to slow down the atrophy. It's not a whole lot of work, and Su Laoshi is the nicest man ever. Class is entertaining because most of the time is spent just listening to his life stories, which are all fascinating. The one thing I think I did actively improve on in this class is reading traditional characters, because all of the readings are in traditional. A lot of the readings are articles from the 90s about Taiwan and Hong Kong, which may be of more interest to some students than others.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone with a real interest in modern Chinese society. It is not designed to be a language class that holds your hand and spoon feeds you the vocab and grammar; that part does require a good deal of self study. But the real gem of the course is the fascinating issues you get to read about and hear Su Wei lecture about-- all the most important political and social issues facing modrn China and Taiwan today that Su Wei has incredible insight on. I feel so lucky having left this class able to read, write, and discuss these kinds of \"real world\" important issues, from the economy to politics, a good deal better and having had these issues made real to me by Su Wei and his excitement about the material and his teaching."
