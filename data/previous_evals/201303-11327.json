    "Yes, although prepare for a fair amount of work.",
    "I would recommend it but it's a ton of work.",
    "If you made it through 310 I would definitely recommend 436. Narendra's teaching style doesn't change at all, so you already know what you're getting into. The main differences are: 1. fewer problem sets (5-6) that are more theoretical and involve a lot of linear algebra, 2. semester long project that Narendra really cares about (you'll meet with him once a week to talk about progress) its not that much work, and it can be fun if you choose a good topic, 3. only one exam around midterm, its very easy in comparison to 310 exams. In short, the material is definitely more difficult, but the setup of the class makes it easier to do well in overall.",
    "You need to work hard (especially on the project) to get anything much out of the class - theory can be quite heavy and honestly felt like a distraction from project work, because ultimately you were graded on how well you did on the project. Make sure you meet with Professor Narendra often. Period.",
    "Take it only if you're willing to spend a lot of time talking to the Professor about random topics not related to the course, since that's what will end up determining your grade."
