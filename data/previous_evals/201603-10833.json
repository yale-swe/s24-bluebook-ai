   "comments": [
    "I learned how to conduct research more productively, narrow my research interest, as well as better analyze different forms of writing and knowledge production.",
    "this course was very helpful in guiding thinking about the senior essay, breaking down different steps, and learning from classmates",
    "This class was instrumental in helping me organize my thesis. I could not imagine getting started on this project without this course.",
    "How to go about designing and executing your own research project. Mostly the basics with guidance and lots of feedback from profs and classmates.",
    "I learned a great deal about how to research and begin writing a thesis paper. We explored different styles in which one can write, different methods of keeping research organized, how to find sources, and many other useful skills. Absolutely a necessity for completing the senior project.",
    "This class really helped me kick off my senior thesis. I had no idea what I was going to write about but having this class as a space to brainstorm, share and refine my thoughts quickly remedied that. This class was also really helpful in giving me a rough idea of what alumni of the ER&M have been up to and provided me with a glimpse into what the different post-graduation options are for someone graduating from the department.",
    "This course provides invaluable support and guidance to ERM seniors working on their Senior thesis, and it guides students through every aspect of the research and writing process, including topic selection, assessment of research importance, location of relevant primary sources, and refinement of one's argument or line of inquiry."

   "comments": [
    "Although I did find the working groups to be very beneficial, perhaps also receiving feedback from students who were not in our assigned working groups would have been helpful.",
    "the working groups we formed with classmates was super helpful, as were the built-in checkpoints we had with each assignment",
    "I wish there was more than just one day of writing workshop, but overall this course was stellar. The best part was that we took some time to speak with former ER&M graduates, which added a much-needed practical level to our class. I really appreciate the efforts of Prof. Laguna and Prof. Tran.",
    "I would have appreciate a little more guidance in how to\/when to ask an advisor to advise me and what to look for in an advisor and how to manage that relationship. Other than that I appreciate the one-on-one attention I received from Prof. Tran and Prof. Laguna. And I think I benefited from the peer review groups a lot.",
    "This course was great in that it taught us concepts about how to write the senior thesis and then forced us to complete small portions of it. We had to put the skills we learned to use rather than just learning and forgetting. We also go to work with other students as peer editors which was extremely helpful. Additionally, we got to speak with past ER&M grads and get their advice on the thesis and other facets of life after college. I didn't think the course had any weaknesses.",
    "I really loved how the course built up from brainstorming ideas of senior theses to discussing research methods to actually writing and sharing out work in a very clear and chronological order. I thought placing us in groups with similar subject topics was so so useful as it really facilitated resource-sharing and support from one another. I wish we had more in-class \"work-days\" where we could spend the entirely of class time reading and writing.",
    "The colloquium is extremely beneficial as it currently is."

    "Yes!! This class was super helpful in equipping me with a timeline, resources, and understandings to write my senior thesis.",
    "it's required so i'm not sure the recommendation matters--but i looked forward to colloquium, it's great to have that shared space with other seniors in the major. have fun!",
    "This class is by no means a waste of time-- it's important and you should be excited to take it.",
    "YES but you are already and ERM major if you're looking at this so you already did the right thing.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course. It is invaluable for learning skills to write the senior thesis. You will also gain a lot of other skills and information that can help you grow overall as a student.",
    "Yes! It's a requirement for a reason--it does help you get started on our senior thesis by providing you with a well-organized space to brainstorm ideas, discuss ideas with your peers and learn about the do\/donts of research."
