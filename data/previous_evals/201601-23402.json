   "comments": [
    "I feel like I have a good handle on the course material and will be able to apply it relatively easily in the future. The downside is that I did not think the exams were structured in a way that was able to test my actual knowledge. So I feel like a have a good level of knowledge\/skills in practice but perhaps did not perform as well on exams as might be expected. In particular, including calculus on the first exam meant that I primarily was teaching myself calculus prior to the midterm such that I may not have been as prepared for the course material. In addition, the length of the exams made it difficult to find time to check my work, which is something that I would do in real life when working on a project.",
    "I thought it was a good course in general, and I think Maria is a great professor (I had her for other classes as well). My only complaint is that some of the work was a bit excessive considering there are many non-biostatistics students in the class and we may have other priorities (in terms of classes). The expectations for the final project were a bit high (finding our own data) and some of the deadlines overlapped with each other, making things much more difficult than they needed to be (our final report being due on the same day as when we took our final exam), though Maria did mention that she was flexible and willing to extend deadlines if the class asked for it.",
    "One thing I would like to point out is the fact that we had to take the final exam during the regular semester hours. This was really inconvenient for many students as we didn't have the chance to utilize the reading period to study for the exam.",
    "Lecture note is perfect. Homework is perfect. There is no confusion when working on this course. The most terrible thing was final GROUP project. It is always exciting to work on a final project. However, the requirement of getting data from outside source was very painful and I understand why the instructor wanted us to experience this process. But the time we spent on getting data was much more than the time we spent on analysis which was very depressing. Also, I don't think it was necessary for the instructor to specify team members for the final project. I would have been much satisfied if we at least had some choice instead of working with some student who are not willing to be part of it. But overall this course was very satisfying and useful.",
    "The course was useful and overall quite easy. Though I thought the homework was a little too \"non-challenging\" since most of it just requires changing little bits of the SAS codes.",
    "The course contents are very applicable. Slides are terrific",
    "The slides are great - one of the best taught biostatistics classes at YSPH. The homeworks reinforce concepts learned in class well. I feel very confident in my ability to carry out a project using survival analysis because of this class. The project was a TON of work (too much) - the process of finding a new dataset was a lot of work. The same concepts could have been learned if we all worked on the same uncleaned, but standardized dataset. Working in randomly assigned groups with people I didn't know didn't work out that well - people had very different ideas of the amount of work that should be put into the project. It was due around thesis time, which made time management difficult for second years.",
    "Maria is an excellent teacher. She is able to impart very complex ideas in a relatively easy to understand manner. She is also very approachable and always willing to help. My primary issues with the course are as follows: There was a tremendous amount of material covered in each lecture and so the pace of each lecture was very quick. Calculus was a requirement for the course, however, this was not listed anywhere on classes v2, thus students who had never taken calculus were at a disadvantage. The groups were randomly assigned. This random nature of the groups meant that we weren't able to choose groups according to shared topics of interest. Also some students were assigned to groups in which the teammates did not meaningfully contribute.",
    "Strengths: Survival analysis is very useful in many settings outside of biostatistics. The slides are very well constructed to aid students' understanding of the course materials. Weaknesses: The group project was difficult, not materially, but group dynamic-wise. I understand that group projects are an opportunity to provide a practical application of course materials in a setting that mimics coordination and collaboration with different researchers in work settings. However, the key difference between a classroom and an employment setting is that in the latter, an individual is more likely to work with someone who is equally interested in the topic whereas in a class, students have various different interests and backgrounds. Unfortunately, because the selected topic may be heavily suited for one of two members that have a large amount of knowledge in the field, the other members of the group are always playing a catch up in terms of trying to provide useful feedback to the group and make a meaningful contribution. Furthermore, the projects become heavily loaded for the member who works with data compared to other members who volunteer to write or conduct background research. Moving forward, I strongly recommend having individual projects that are shorter (for grading purposes), or restricting them to 2 people per group so that everyone gets to tailor the class to their needs for future employment and acquiring data skills beyond homeworks.",
    "This was a very well-organized, well-taught class. I enjoyed it. However, I really didn't like that it was crammed into a short time, with the final presentations in mid-April and the exam on April 25. Because of the project, I did not have enough time to prepare for the final exam. I went into the exam feeling unprepared and felt embarrassed. (I don't know my grade yet, but when I was taking the exam I felt that if I'd had more than a single day to study I would have done better.) I wish we had reading week to prepare for the final exam. I especially wish that the final group paper and the final exam were not due at the same time.",
    "Slide decks are very comprehensive and explanations in class are clear. The final project was difficult in that finding a dataset was extremely time-consuming.",
    "The group project is a strength"

    "Instructor: Maria Michelle Ciarleglio \u00a0Strengths: Professor was always well prepared and professional about the course materials and presentation. Sometimes, quantitative materials can be glossed over because the theories and equations are straightforward. However, the professor explained the materials very well and made them easy to follow. Weaknesses: NA",
    "Instructor: Maria Michelle Ciarleglio \u00a0Amazing professor. Very knowledgeable and she takes the time to explain everything with a great deal of detail and context. Her slides are great as well.",
    "Instructor: Maria Michelle Ciarleglio \u00a0Maria is the best instructor I've had at Yale. The class material was clearly and enthusiastically presented. I recommend her to everyone.",

    "Very helpful and applicable, would recommend.",
    "This course is good to take if you plan on doing a lot of data analysis in the future, or want to take a more advanced biostatistics course. I would recommend this for students that have the ability to do more work in their semester, and are interested in learning more about survival analysis. I wouldn't recommend it if students already have a crazy semester with their other classes, unless the way the deadlines and homework are structured is changed.",
    "Perfect lecture note and HW. Terrible final group project.",
    "Very useful course. Final presentation was interesting and I really enjoyed it.",
    "If you have the time to put into this class, it can be the best, most useful statistics class you take at YSPH.",
    "This course is well taught. The first half of the course if very challenging for non-biostats students and incorporates a good deal of mathematical calculations by hand, with less emphasis on the applied survival analysis using software. The latter half of the course is more applied, however, the midterms and finals are both closed book, in-class exams which require calculations by hand and a memorization of many equations. The course brings together a lot of various statistical techniques which is quite useful and Maria is an excellent professor. Just be prepared to spend a lot of time on the homework.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student because I think the materials are so applicable to many different areas of research.",
    "I recommend this course for anyone in either of the epidemiology tracks or biostatistics. It's a great survey of applied survival analysis. However, she's serious when she says that calculus is a prerequisite.",
    "Tough class if you're not on the Stats track, but you learn very useful skills and the group project makes it very \"real world\"",
    "This is an applied course, so it gets practical and that is the fun to it. It is a bit too specialized if you are looking for general survival knowledge. I would recommend this course if you are looking for practical applications of survival analysis for your datasets."
