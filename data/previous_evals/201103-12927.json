    "The Russian department at Yale is great, and I learned a lot from this course considering the number of students enrolled. There is homework every night (even the night after an exam, which occurs about every two weeks), so you can't slack off even if you wanted to. Going to class everyday is necessary for sustained improvement, but can be difficult, especially towards the end of the semester when all the classes begin to seem the same. Sometimes, the textbook is a bit disorganized, making it hard to find grammar points, and the vocabulary at the end of the book is really scant, so get a dictionary or something similar. At the end of this course, you won't be fluent, but you'll have been exposed to most of the common grammar points in Russian. The language is too complicated to master after three semesters.",
    "Yes, it is a good russian class.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend!",
    "It was pretty much what you'd expect from a mid level language class. We learned lots of words and grammar, and some cultural background when it came up. I would recommend this class highly.It's a lot of work. You get 1.5 credits per semester, and believe me, you have to earn every bit of them. I usually had an hour and a half or more of homework every day, and I know students who needed 2 or 2.5 hours a day to do it. On the other hand, there are no bothersome essays or anything; the work is pretty straightforward.",
    "It's okay. Not particularly amazing or enlightening as a language course, but it does what it's supposed to do.",
    "If you're a 2nd year student who took L1 and L2 last year, just go ahead and take this and get your Language requirement over with. If you're a Freshman looking to enter this and do L3 and L4 for your Language requirement, this is definitely a good department to enter (and you probably won't have to worry at all about being behind any of the kids who took L1 and L2 last year).",
    "Harder than 1st year Russian, but not bad.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course if you're interested in continuing to study Russian, particularly if you've come from L1 and L2 at Yale with Julia, which I did. (This is good because there is a lot of continuity, in terms of the course book and workbook and \"soap opera\" storyline that we work with.) However, my classmates who placed into L3 right out of high school Russian seem to have been less happy with their experiences. So just a heads up about that. Though I'm sure you could still have a good experience.",
    "This course goes more in-depth in the topic covered in the first year of study. It is a good continuation of a students' study of the Russian language.",
    "It's the next level of Russian. Some of the grammar topics are the same, but this does not mean the class is easy. The homework gets longer, but the tests stay about the same.",
    "Lots of daily homework and daily classes get kind of annoying but you do improve your Russian and in the end it's worth it. I was surprised that I was able to have a semi-legitimate conversation with the prof at the end of the course (you have to, for the oral exam)",
    "Not the worst language class available. For it being such a different and difficult language the class is very smooth and easy. You would be surprised. However don't expect fluency - its basically on the same level as 110 just more information. You will need to go further if you want to get really good.",
    "If you want to learn Russian, and I think it is a good language to learn, then I recommend the class."
