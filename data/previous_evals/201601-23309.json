   "comments": [
    "The readings were quite tough for a non-native English speaker. But given that this is the minority, I fully understand that this can't be considered.",
    "My biggest complaint about this course was that people didn't take it as seriously as they should. Because the class was partially online, and was a 2-credit pass\/fail course - it was clear that most students placed this course below their other ones on the priorities list. Most people waited until the last moment to do their online discussion posts - which defeats the purpose because by the time there is enough material to have an actual conversation about it, it's too late. It's also unfair to the students who do the assignment within a reasonable amount of time to allow for others to comment (since commenting back and forth is part of the requirement). The environmental community needs courses like this because we have a tendency to ignore things like ethics and communication. There are so few FES courses that are dedicated to these issues, and it's a shame to see one of the only ones be so disregarded by students because they see it as an easy pass. On the other hand, if the \"easy A\" is what gets people in the door, I guess I'd rather them take this course than not at all. It was just frustrating for me because I put more work into this class than most of my peers.",
    "I think the discussion sections were too short - that is my only critique about this class. I would have preferred to have a richer, lengthier in-person discussion rather than a commenting on a class discussion thread.",
    "The debates and class presentations were not that useful for my learning and felt a little too elementary for a master's level class.",
    "Less work the last 2 weeks of class, it seemed to pile on too much at the end of the course, on top of the group presentation."

This was especially helpful in the debate when people had to take views that they didn't necessarily agree with. However, group work in this course was unlike other group projects I've had at FES. My peers regarded this class as not as important as other classes, so working in groups was also half-hearted.",
