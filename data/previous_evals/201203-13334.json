   "comments": [
    "If you don't get something, it is hard to get it cleared up. That being said, I can clearly see the usefulness of the knowledge that I have learned in this course.",
    "It's definitely an important course to take. It only gets harder trying to read papers and even doing your own research if you do not know basic statistics. However, I think the course could be greatly improved.",
    "Statistics 101 is taught in two parts. The first 8 weeks of the semester are taught as a large lecture for all of the intro statistics classes (101-109). During this time, you learn about basic statistical methods and ideas. For the last five weeks, you then learn about other methods that are more applicable to the life sciences, with examples from biology, forestry, and ecology. The material is plentiful, but at the same time, taught thoroughly with many examples. I would recommend this to anyone studying the life sciences as statistics, as shown in this course, are vital for the analysis of any quantitative--or even qualitative, for that matter--data. This will allow you to analyze your own data as well as assess the clarity and results of others.",
    "I DO NOT, repeat DO NOT recommend that you take the life sciences section unless you have to. It is a needless headache and the other sections are much better.",
    "Do not take it unless you need to. Not worthwhile even for the QR. The ability to specialize in the second half is alluring, but do not fall into the trap. I was the only freshman in my section, the majority of the students were premed\/grad students. I think most people also had AP stats even though this was an into class. The problem sets are miserable, especially if you have a mac because you need stats software.",
    "Solid class. JRS makes the big section interesting, even though intro stats is inevitably a bit boring. Life sciences section with Walter Jetz is pretty tough compared to the big section.",
    "If you're a Bio (MCDB) major, take 105. Although what I learned in this class is useful in research and whatnot, it's poorly taught. I found myself teaching myself statistics before our final and for each problem set.",
    "Take it if you have to. Better than calc, and more useful, if you have the choice.",
    "I really enjoyed this class. While taking it, I was a little irked that the life sciences section seemed to be a lot harder than the other options (medicine, poly sci, etc). But, in the end, I really felt like I left with a good knowledge of statistics, and am glad that I was challenged.",
    "take it if you need it.. not super interesting but useful.",
    "I wasn't looking forward to taking this class because I'm not really a math person, but it actually was a lot better than I thought it would be. I learned a lot that is actually going to be applicable to my career. It's the best you can expect for a big lecture course.",
    "Take it only if you need it.",
    "I would recommend it. If you need a quick and simple refresher on Stats or are looking for a nice intro to stats, this is the class to take. Jonathan is a great professor that make stats engaging and interactive.",
    "STATS 101 is a useful class that presumes no prior experience with statistics. I learned a lot, and feel like my new skills will actually be applicable to future projects. However, you have to make sure to keep up with the lectures, particularly those with Professor Jetz. The lecture notes with Professor Professor Reuning-Scherer are very useful. Buy the book and study it!",
    "You probably have to take this class. It's not that bad. It helps if you have some prior experience, not necessarily in the actual statistical techniques, but in just questioning how to deal with data.",
    "Stats in general is an important supplement for most majors. The class is taught in such a way that it is not a burden to fulfill your stat requirement and actually makes it a course that one should take even if it is not a requirement.",
    "I came into this class expecting that it would be boring. It ended up being one of my favorite classes. If you are a science major, you will find this class to be very useful, both for reading papers and for interpreting your own data. You do move quickly, both in the first and second half, so be prepared to keep up. Both JDRS and Jetz and good professors. JDRS is boisterous, excitable, and corny, but he does want to help you learn. His lecture notes are generally very clear, so you can refer to them later if you missed something in class. Jetz is less bouncy, but still manages to pack a lot of information into one lecture. However, his notes are less clear, so you'd better pay close attention to what he says. I would recommend the class--I wish I had taken it earlier in my Yale career because I actually want to take more stats classes now.",
    "Take it with JDRS.",
    "Statistics 101 is a very useful course. It requires diligent study, but if a student continuously stays on top of the work and asks the teacher questions when needed, then he or she can perform well.",
    "Yes, good overview"
