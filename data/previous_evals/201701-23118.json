   "comments": [
    "Fundamentals of how different sound waves are created and propagate through instruments and air. Shapes of different sound waves, properties of sound waves, how instruments affect musical aspects such as pitch, timbre, and volume. How electric, electronic, and digital instruments developed in the mid to late 20th century, and the advantages and disadvantages of different synthesis techniques. Very basic engineering: Laser cutting, drilling, gluing, etc. Some programming in Max",
    "I learned about how tons of instruments work, as well as learning about the CEID. I loved getting to work with 3D printers and the laser cutter as well as hand tools to make things, and can't wait to keep going back next year!",
    "Taking this class as a non-engineering major exposed me to the joy and hard work of the physical design process. Running through iterations of instruments and simultaneously designing as I built my instrument exposed me to new ways of conceiving of projects.",
    "I learned the principles of acoustics and their application in various design projects. In my own design project, I learned principles of engineering, circuitry, and programming.",
    "I gained a bunch of hands-on engineering skills and basic tool skills\/familiarity with the CEID. I also learnt a lot about the physics of acoustic sound and digital synthesis. As this was the first engineering class I had ever taken I learnt about the process of designing something, executing iterations, and making adjustments. I am now comfortable using CorelDRAW, the laser printer, basic woodshop tools, and SolidWorks.",
    "I learned the physics behind acoustics and how a wide range of instruments produce sound."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: Final project was amazing, the professors and TAs spent an amazing amount of time at the CEID. Weaknesses: I thought a little too much time was spent on electronic instruments, but I understand that some find this interesting. I think some of the less important electric techniques that are now obsolete could have been skipped. Also took an extremely long time to return assignments. Was a problem because we didn't get the problem sets back until just before the mid-term, which didn't give us a lot of time to learn from our mistakes.",
    "Strengths are how engaging it is, and how much you cover. It's really an amazing overview of different instruments and building methods. The only thing I wanted was more time on the final project! Maybe that could be a second class you could take after this one, though, because I wouldn't want to sacrifice the breadth of this class.",
    "This course thrives in its hands-on learning environment, and the professors and TAs do a great job of facilitating work time in the CEID, giving us enough freedom to solve problems on our own, while also lending a hand when problems became unmanageable.",
    "Strengths. The course covers a number of topics in acoustics principles and applications, offering plenty of moments for creative inspiration for students' final projects. Seeing the instrument collection on Hillhouse Ave and the organ in Woolsey Hall were exciting moments. Labs were immediately hands-on and engaging. The professors and the TAs offered a mix of useful expertise and experience. The CEID was a rich learning environment that made me want to push myself to learn engineering principles and in general \"make things work.\" Weaknesses. The instructors' patience often wore thin especially during the last month when students were working on final projects. My proposal was approved but then often I would be discouraged from pursuing my initial vision for the project, or would be encouraged to solve problems using work-arounds that led me away from my intentions. The lectures were not especially rigorous which meant that the midterm was predictable and perhaps unnecessary. Creating the stress of studying for a midterm before an enormous design project is again perhaps unnecessary.",
    "I thought the weekly labs and problem sets were great as well as the process of making the final project and the presentation which was a highlight of my semester. The midterm was fair and corresponded to everything we had learnt in class. Many of the lectures during the first semester contained a lot of information that could be pretty overwhelming to a student with less math and science background. While both professors were open to taking questions, given that some students in the class had a lot of familiarity with the topics being discussed, it sometimes felt difficult to bring serious confusions surrounding topics discussed to light during class. I think considering offering a space (possibly online\/on canvas) where students could submit questions surrounding lectures would be helpful as well as maybe facilitating smaller groups discussion surrounding topics between students who were confused.",
    "It could be organized a little better. At times, it felt a little chaotic jumping around to the different topics we covered. Also, emphasizing to the students that if they are struggling, they should read the book that the class is based off of."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "If you have an easy semester, 100% take it. You can basically spend however much time you want on the final project (I spent probably around 120 hours), but the more time you spend on it, the more you'll get out of it. If you don't spend a lot of time on the class, it may not be worth taking.",
    "I would recommend this course. You'll learn a lot of interesting concepts about acoustics and design. I found the electronic music units less intriguing, but I think that's just me. As a senior ABET Mechanical Engineering student, the science\/math challenge was minimal, but I still found the course interesting. You should know though that this course is a good amount of work, especially in the second half when you're working on your project. The project is super rewarding though.",
    "YES. But I would say watch out, because it's a lot of work, and you don't really want to take it in a five class schedule.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to anyone who is interested in building projects and in music. Simply being exposed to the different viewpoints that the staff and students brought to discussions and our final projects was an eye-opening experience in terms of witnessing how other people conceive of music. Some of the most creative instruments were born from the strangest ideas from my perspective, which I feel as though truly opened up new pathways for me to explore both musically and otherwise.",
    "YES. Take this course if you get in, and explore the intersection between music, sound, materials, and engineering. Digital and analog acoustics, sound synthesis, building recorders and two-string instruments. One month to work on a project of your own. The ceiling of the CEID is your only limit. I had no engineering background but brought enthusiasm for digital and analog sound synthesis and I got plenty out of this course.",
    "This class is great--you learn a lot about the science and physics of sound as well as getting to do hands-on projects in the CEID. Be forewarned that the science and math is difficult. If you haven't taken STEM classes in a while (I hadn't) the problem sets will take time and require extra hours of work. Also know that the lab is not an extra .5 credit, even though its 3 hrs. The final project is also a ton of work. You will spend many many hours of CEID. But you will also make an awesome instrument, and get to hear your classmates talk about and play the amazing instruments they have created too. The professors are great and get to know you one-on-one in a really unique way. You will get really close to them. This class gives you a bunch of background knowledge on how acoustic sound works, which was super interesting as a musician, as well as information on digital sound synthesis and provides you with amazing resources to design and realize your own original instrument. As someone with no engineering background it was also an amazing chance to get involved with the CEID, and make a really cool project there. Though it is a lot of work towards the end of the class, I would absolutely recommend it!!!",
    "Yes, definitely, especially since I am around so many musicians who typically don't know how the sounds they make are actually produced."
