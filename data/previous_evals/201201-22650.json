    "This class is so full of issues. The syllabus is entirely structured with activities meant to keep you busy and get scores assigned to your name, and isn't a very good method of teaching or evaluating your language skills in Spanish. You're better off getting Rosetta Stone or something. Take a different language with less bureaucracy and smaller classes.",
    "A decent class that gets you the fundamentals of Spanish grammar but I think it's best served as a precursor to traveling abroad where you could then get comfortable using the range of grammatical structures, vocab, and everyday words in your speech. It's just too hard in a class to speak enough and with enough range to really get good.The work wasn't that bad and my teacher kept the attitude pretty light.",
    "Gansen is amazing",
    "Yes! It'll help you improve your Spanish quickly and obviously.",
    "Not difficult compared to L1. Less homework, but more comprehensive work like presentations and the like.",
    "I would not take this class endless you have to, or have Professor Gansen.",
    "Take it if you want to learn Spanish. It is not too much work, but you will learn a lot.",
    "I recommend it for students who want to take Spanish as their language. It is a manageable class and I enjoyed it."
