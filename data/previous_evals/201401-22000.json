    "Amazing, interesting, fun, and if you do the reading, extremely rewarding. You will learn things about people you didn't know before, and will gain new perspective on yourself and the people around you.",
    "Amazing class. Probably the best class I've taken at Yale. Lecture was super interesting, and even the readings, albeit long, were enjoyable. Professor Bloom is incredible! You need to do the readings and study hard for tests, but putting in the work is definitely worth it. I recommend this class highly!",
    "Yes. Everyone should take this course.",
    "This class can be a bit much at times. Please be aware that you will have an easy but lengthy book report (about 15 pages), weekly reading responses (about 500 words a week), two fairly difficult exams, and an experimental participation requirement of about 5 lab hours. This seemed a bit much for an intro class, and, again, the guest lecturers often broke up Paul Bloom's natural flow to little positive effect. This class does, however, deserve the reputation its accrued over the years.",
    "Take it, but the curve is quite hard as there are a lot of freshmen and eager sophomores.",
    "yeah but credit\/d if you can because the tests are hard",
    "Take this course C\/D\/F if you can, unless you plan on putting in serious work reading through dozens of pages of material each week. Going to lectures shouldn't be a problem as they are fun and Professor Bloom is a great lecturer. Note that there are weekly reading responses due at 6pm on Sundays and a book review that is 3500 words. If you can keep up with the readings and lectures, then the midterm and final will be a breeze. If not, take it C\/D\/F if you can. I would definitely recommend this course overall because it is one of the most interesting I have taken at Yale.",
    "It's Intro Psych--not too difficult, mostly interesting, sometimes fun. The weekly reading responses can be a little annoying, but overall the workload is quite low. Paul Bloom is a fun lecturer, although the class is maybe not all it's cracked up to be--though it's still a good choice for a 5th credit.",
    "Definitely take this class! A lot of what is covered can be seen as intuitive but some things really make you stop and think. Bloom is one of the most engaging and hilarious lecturers I've come across and makes this class a must have.",
    "Take it. There's too much good to say about this class...just take it before you graduate. I took it senior spring, and I'm SO glad I did.",
    "Definitely, it was awesome.",
    "Of course, always.",
    "TAKE THIS COURSE BEFORE YOU GRADUATE. No matter who teaches it, Intro Psych is a fun, moderate-workload class that opens your eyes to all the ways in which psychology influences the world. It's definitely one of those must-take Yale classes, especially because so much of the cutting-edge research presented has originated here at Yale's very own psych department! In short, TAKE IT.",
    "Definitely should take this class at some point, and I recommend with Bloom.",
    "Interesting material but too many guest lecturers second semester made it difficult to study for exams. The class also includes an experiment participation requirement and weekly reading responses.",
    "Yes, but be wary of the amount of time required for this course. A lot of reading and reading responses every week. Also a 10 page paper at the end of the course.",
    "I would definitely recommend PSYC110 to others. It was a fantastic course, but I wouldn't say it was all that easy. The readings are important, especially for the exams, though you don't need to read every single word--just be sure to get the concepts and all of the terms. Lectures are absolutely fantastic, but also vital to the midterm and final exams. Don't miss them--they're a lot of fun, anyway!",
    "Great survey course. Paul Bloom is amazing.",
    "great way to learn a bit about psych without diving in too deep.",
    "KILLER CLASS. Took it as a second semester Senior and it was like your twice weekly Ted Talks. Bloom has got this down perfectly. Note: this class is NOT a gut, you will have to do work in order to get a good grade in the class. This should not deter any one from taking the course. The workload is evenly distributed throughout the semester and over a variety of different assignment, grading is quite 'fair', the readings and lectures complement each other (rather than just repeating themselves), and Bloom is super interesting. Basically, this is how every Yale course should be designed",
    "I would DEFINITELY recommend PSYC 110 to a fellow student. PSYC 110 was an absolutely phenomenal course; it covers lots of different fascinating material and feels like a fun journey. The 75 minute lectures fly by. Definitely try to take it with Paul Bloom because he is a charismatic and hilarious genius. Best teacher I've had at Yale.",
    "I would recommend this class for basically everyone, no matter what major, but especially if you're looking for something interesting and fun. Everything covered is super cool, it informs what you already know\/think you know about the world. Also Paul Bloom is the man. And you should probably try to hear him talk as much as you possibly can while you're at Yale.",
    "Great survey course of many different fields within psychology. Four fantastic guest lecturers (including President Salovey), and Paul Bloom is a lively lecturer. Not much neuroscience is taught, but all of the topics are fascinating. Fine workload: weekly readings (maybe 40 pages or some Ted talks), weekly reading responses, two exams, and an experimental participation requirement.",
    "I think that Intro Psych is a fundamental class that everyone should take at Yale. Frankly, if you don't, you're missing out on a great time (unless you took AP Psych in High school I guess). The professors are great, and the TA's are great at responding when you need them. The work has a tendency to come in waves, so if you are worried about the reading piling up, you should plan in advance. In terms of the reading... do it. The textbook is super clear and informative and it also helps to enrich the lecture experience. Although Prof. Bloom will cover most topics, he may simply mention important vocabulary or concepts in passing, expecting you to have done the reading. There's a lot of information covered in this class, and the exams can be kind of tricky, so be warned. At the same time, it's very fulfilling. I often find myself citing concepts that I learned in class in everyday conversations, and have found that this class helps to provide a clarity to how your mind works.",
    "A must-take. Dont miss out on lectures.",
    "Intro psych with Paul Bloom is fascinating, rewarding, and although there is a consistent amount of work, I never felt overworked or bogged down. The topics are extremely interesting and presented in an engaging way --- I always attended and looked forward to lecture, which I think is a testament to Bloom's skill at lecturing. I recommend keeping up with the readings, I think you get more out of the course that way, and also, the textbook is fun to read --- the authors often try to be funny, and sometimes they succeed, and sometimes are funny because they don't succeed. The book review is lengthy, but manageable if you don't wait until the last second. Take intro psych, you won't regret it!!",
    "Intro Psych is definitely worthwhile to take. It's really interesting, and you actually feel like you've learned a lot. Professor Bloom was really engaging, and had easy-to-follow power points. His exams are a bit tough, and it is a bit of work, but if you keep up with it then you shouldn't have a problem. I'd definitely recommend it as a fun class to take.",
    "Definitely",
    "An entertaining, thought-provoking course with a high reading load, though the concepts are easily digested - emphasis on breadth over depth",
    "I would highly recommend that every student take this class (with Paul Bloom)! It is a ton of fun and you learn a lot about the world.",
    "Take if you're interested in psychology even the tiniest bit.",
    "I would recommend it to all.",
    "Take it!",
    "If you have any interest at all in psychology, take this course before you leave Yale! It's a rare opportunity to study with a true leader of an academic field and really enjoy the experience.",
    "Take this course if you're at all interested in how the brain works or why we do the things we do. That sounds overly simplistic for something as complicated as neuroscience, but that speaks to the approachability and genuine appeal of the material. You will learn things about yourself, your family, your friends, and even people you don't know by taking Intro Psych.",
    "Intro Psych was really interesting and Professor Bloom was really engaging. The tests were pretty hard though and often focused on details that did not seem very important to the overall concepts. I'm glad I took the course but I'm also glad I made it credit\/D\/F.",
    "Great class. Absolutely take it. So worth it.",
    "Great class",
    "Pysch 110 02 is an incredibly interesting course which will expose you to many different sides of psychology, although no one thing will be discussed in great detail. It will get you to think about the human experience from a psychological perspective, and will inspire you to learn more about how the human mind functions.",
    "Absolutely take this class!! Whether you take it for credit or take it for fun, it is definitely worth it. The material is interesting, the guest lectures are great (or at least most of them) and Paul Bloom is a fantastic lecturer. Definitely worth a semester of your time.",
    "Yes I would recommend it because its very interesting.",
    "again, there are a lot of freshmen who study a ton, luckily they havnt been in college long so they still dont know how to do it right. there is little work in the class (Some readings & reading responses) just make sure go reread everything the day before the exam and you'll be set (and go to lecture). That's if you dont take it credit D, which is a great idea as well.",
    "I think everyone should have a strong foundation in psychology, so aside from anyone who would like to major in psychology and need this class as a requirement towards that major, anyone who has little knowledge of the human psyche should definitely take this class.",
    "The course was generally very good, but I would not recommend it if you've taken other psychology or cognitive science courses since much of the material overlaps.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student. I would suggest this class to anyone who wants to fulfill their social sciences distributional requirement and anyone who does not know what they want to major in. Many of my friends came out of this class wanting to major in psychology. I think this class is useful in giving an indication of what psychology is about and whether or not it's a topic that you like.",
    "A must take at Yale...especially with Bloom. Was fully awake and engaged every lecture even though it took place in a dark room right after lunch. i only regret that I didn't take the course sooner.",
    "TAKE IT! Must-do at Yale. Bloom is hilarious, engaging, and it's fascinating to learn how people work.",
    "Psych teaches you about EVERYTHING. Please take this course, especially with Bloom. For some reason, I had a ton of people telling me that you have to take Psych with Chun, but I sat through lectures with both Bloom and Chun, and I found Bloom to be just as engaging as Chun, and probably even funnier. I loved Bloom, and I loved this course (even after almost failing it\u2026studying is important kids). I think that's a testament to how amazing all of the lectures are and how much you truly learn from a semester of Bloom and the really thought-provoking material.",
    "YES take it especially as a fifth credit. Bloom rocks my socks.",
    "I would recommend Intro Psych to students who have not already taken AP Psych and who are interested in the material. I learned a lot since I did not take AP Psych, but I was taking it just to get a social science distribution credit and the class really did not fuel any sort of interest in psychology for me. It was an engaging lecture but that was about it.",
    "Take this class. Paul Bloom is one of the best professors at Yale. He rally brings the material alive with witty anecdotes, studies and clips. Also, the guest lecturers are great too. The material is interesting (even if you are not a psych major (I'm not)). Take this class!!!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to a fellow student! It is a very interesting course that covers a lot of material about the basics of psychology. However, it is a course that requires a significant amount of work if you would like to excel.",
    "Intro Psych is a fun and useful class and I would recommend taking it if you would like to learn a little bit about psychology; the workload is very manageable.",
    "It's one of those classes like English 120: you should just take it as part of being an educated person",
    "Good overview course of psychology and various topics within the field. Bloom also brought in really excellent and interesting guest lecturers to speak to the class, which I found added a lot the course. Definitely recommend!",
    "The class is a basic overview of many concepts that are highly relevant in modern day psychology and YES! This is a class that looking back, most students should take just for the experience.",
    "I would definitely recommend PSYC 110 to anyone who even has the faintest interest in psychology. PSYC 110 was an amazing course. The lectures were highly engaging and entertaining. The grading was fair and the guest lecturers definitely added to the course.",
    "Great class for everyone, from people for whom it's their first psychology class (me) and for those planning on pursuing the major. Not too much work (weekly reading responses, midterm, paper, and final), and everything was interesting. Highly recommended.",
    "Take CREDIT D",
    "I would absolutely recommend it.",
    "Would recommend",
    "I would highly recommend this course. Great for learning everything from the basis of attraction to the mechanics of mental disorders.",
    "Great, fun, you'll learn so much!",
    "Interesting class, but the workload is no joke -- weekly reading responses, a 10 page book review, and a midterm and final. A word of advice: do the readings, as he really does test on stuff that was in the readings and not the lectures.",
    "I would reccomend but need to have time to put in",
    "An incredible course that should be a requirement of every student at Yale. More work than Chun's, but almost worth it - the book report is long, but worth it thanks to the amazing book you get to read that's such a complement to the course. Bloom is a wonderful lecturer.",
    "This is one of the best classes at Yale. It is super interesting, fun, and must take!",
    "PSYCH 110 is a super interesting introduction to psychology. It does require a fair amount of work and time but it all seems worth it because the material learned is so interesting and applicable. Be prepared to work hard. The exams can be tricky and the paper takes time to write so it has to be started early. The weekly reading responses are pretty simple and a great way to make sure you keep up with the reading (which is necessary to do well on the exams). I would definitely recommend this class to another student. Professor Bloom is a fantastic, engaging lecturer and really makes the class!",
    "I would recommend PSYC 110 to any Yale student-- it's practically a must-take!",
    "A must-take class at Yale! It teaches you about the world and makes you question things within your own life! I looked forward to lecture, and would take it again if I could! TAKE THIS CLASS!",
    "You should take this class",
    "Very interesting lecture course. Bloom is a good lecturer. Mostly good guest lecturers. An excessive amount of reading is assigned for this course. Two textbooks chapters are assigned for many of the lectures. Hard to study for exams because there is so much content in the textbook. I would recommend taking this course Credit\/D Fail, unless you need if for a major\/premed requirements.",
    "PSYC 110 is an amazing class that everyone should take. With Professor Bloom, the course is incredibly informative, interesting, and fun. He is a great lecturer and makes the wide variety of topics that he teaches relevant to modern society and thought. I would recommend this class to all students, especially those trying to gain a strong foundation of knowledge about topics in the field of psychology.",
    "PSYC 110 is a wonderful class. The workload is a bit heavy for an introduction class (many readings, weekly reading responses, midterm, final, book review, and required 5 hours of experimental participation). However, I really recommend this course to anyone who is even slightly interested in psychology\/cognitive science\/neuroscience.",
    "Take! Take! Take!",
    "DEFINITELY take this class. It is a pretty comprehensive overview of the different fields within psychology, and even though you may not be considering majoring in psych, I found that a lot of the material is very useful and can be applicable to real life situations e.g. how to improve your memory. A lot of the times I feel like most of the stuff in the lectures are covered in the textbook, but coming to lectures is necessary to do well because he will emphasize things that aren't elaborated in the text. That being said, keeping up with the readings is very important and the weekly reading responses that you have to do help you to some what stay on track. Paul Bloom is AWESOME, he never fails to make the whole class burst into laughter and he just has the most charming personality. If you take this class, take it with him!",
    "PSYCH 110 was a fun course and an note resting overview of the field of psychology. I wasn't a big fan of Professor Bloom and his fairly disjointed lecture style.",
    "Absolutely! I would definitely recommend this course for another student. Professor Bloom gives the most incredible lectures. A lot of people compare his teaching with Professor Chun's, and say that the work load is heavier under Professor Bloom. Although I would agree that it is (from what I'd heard), I think in general, having more work is more rewarding (and it really was a manageable workload). You have a weekly reading response (very helpful for keeping up with course material), a midterm, a final, and a book review. The book review is actually quite a fun assignment. Also, the guest lecturers are super cool. Basically, this class was my favorite of the semester and I'm so grateful I took it.",
    "A class with very subjective material. Do not expect to use much critical thinking or objective analysis because most of the content relies on memorization to understand for exams.",
    "Psyc 110 is a wonderful introductory psychology course and you will learn many new things about the mind and behavior. I would recommend this class.",
    "Intro Psych's syllabus defines that of a survey course; over the semester you get a taste or the most exciting focuses of the current study of psychology. Bloom does a wonderful job presenting the information, really making it come alive. He was such a great lecturer, I almost regretted the guest lectures. The readings, including op-ed pieces, an TED talks supplemented the lectures well. The workload for this class is manageable, but I have gathered the impression from speaking with those that took Intro Psych with Chun that more work was assigned for this section. The weekly reading responses of 400-600 words added up. It was helpful because it kept me up to pace with the reading though. Although I found the concept of reading another book, outside of the textbook, for the book report very interesting, I do feel as though the assignment needs some revisions. The length was too extensive an expectation for the prompt, thinking of and describing an application for the studies of the book. The tests were manageable and fair. I appreciated the absence of a final.",
    "Definitely take it. It's very entertaining and a lot of fun to learn about how the mind works.",
    "Great class, absolutely recommended. Everyone at Yale should take it at some point!",
    "Bloom is boss. The standard lecture is really funny and investigates one interesting idea on the topic of our readings. This is one of the courses at Yale that has been practiced to perfection. I recommend this course for anybody.",
    "Go for Paul bloom's amazing lectures",
    "I took this credit\/D and if it's not for your major, that's how I'd recommend it. The lectures are interesting, but the reading can be tiresome, and the exams are difficult (and mostly multiple choice). Whether you like the class is dependent on whether you like Paul Bloom, who injects his own random opinions about things into lectures all the time. You'll get a good idea of this aspect by shopping.",
    "I would 100% recommend this class with Paul Bloom. Even if you are not thinking of pscyhology it is valuable knoweldge and very interesting!",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course, especially for freshmen or pre-meds. In general, it is a class worth taking at Yale.",
    "Excellent course, absolutely worth taking. Not a gut, but not super hard either. You have to do a lot of memorization for the exams, but they're not horrible. No final during finals week is nice.",
    "A must take course to understand yourself and others.",
    "This is a great survey course. There's a lot of ground to cover, but you will take away a lot. Definitely one of my favorite classes this year. Please, please, please take this class before you graduate!",
    "Great class, very engaging lecture.",
    "A must take class at Yale",
    "Yes, recommended. Broad view of psychology.",
    "Take it. Just take it. For a major, for a requirement, for fun. This is an essential course, and so much fun. Also - loved it with Paul Bloom, although both profs are great. But Bloom is the best!",
    "Intro Psych with Paul Bloom is an excellent course - a must-take. If it is not being taken as a requirement of any form, it is recommended to take it credit\/D because the exams are difficult.",
    "An incredibly interesting class. Beautifully taught! Not as gut as you might think, but definitely a must take!",
    "Take this class. It doesn't matter if you need it for your major, for a distributional requirement, or whatever. This is one class you need to take at some point during your time at Yale."
