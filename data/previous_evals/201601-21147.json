   "comments": [
    "Yes, it's a great class that I would recommend. It's great to read Lincoln's writings and learn about one of the most respected statesmen in U.S. history. The class is a bit more work than most since it requires three 6-7 page essays, but I think it's worth it because the subject matter and Professor Smith are great.",
    "A little long-winded at times but you can't go wrong with Lincoln and Steven B. Smith!",
    "PLSC 318 is a great course that covers Lincoln's main speeches across different periods, while also giving a wonderful overview as to the the Civil War and Nullification crisis area. Definitely would recommend this class!",
    "The class was an interesting overview of the development of Lincoln's political philosophy. While we did cover some history, the class is not a history class in terms of learning about key people and places. I would recommend this class to anyone who enjoys political philosophy and wants to learn more about Lincoln.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone at all interested in Lincoln.",
    "It's okay.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in Lincoln. It is extremely interesting and I came to understand Lincoln on a much deeper level and think about him in new ways. Professor Smith always had interesting and thought-provoking insights on Lincoln and his writings.",
    "Great course to take for a thorough education on the greatness of Lincoln as an American speaker and statesman.",
    "Professor Smith stands in front of the class and talks without visuals, which could be really boring but was mostly saved by Professor Smith's pleasant and thought-provoking lectures. Would highly recommend to those who like reading speeches (most of the class is centered around his speeches and writings, which are great), and those who haven't learned much about the Civil War but want to.",
    "This is one of the best courses I took at Yale. Be warned, though. Most of the class is graded on three essays that will be severely graded. But apart from that, this class is really very enjoyable. The workload isn't too terrible and the professor gives really wonderful lectures. If you need a social science course and you're willing to out a little effort in, this class will definitely reward you."
