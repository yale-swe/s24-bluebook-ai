   "comments": [
    "Amazing course! I learned more in this class than most other classes at YSPH. It was practical, and very hands-on so I actually got to apply the concepts I was learning. I don't have many criticisms or suggestions, other than that it was very awkward to have a portion of the final project that was an individual grade --- this made the group work process uncomfortable and created tension over who could write the \"good\" findings up and who was left cleaning up the random other pieces, without as much of a cohesive flow for their findings section. Also, having transcripts + codes due the Sunday of spring break was crazy b\/c the time was so busy....maybe think about how to re-structure that so it does not fall at such a busy time. Guest speakers were often not very helpful, except for Leslie Curry's lecture on mixed methods, that was great!",
    "This was a great course, one of my favorites over my two years at YSPH. Strengths- learning & applying skills; creating a final product that you are proud of; relevance of lectures to class activities; Focus group & mixed methods guest lectures were fantastic Weaknesses- some of the readings were a bit dry, would have liked to read more examples of qualitative work at home and then get the theory\/methods from the lecture (with readings to reference); for some projects it is difficult to have the participant observation be relevant; digital story telling guest lecture was disappointing",
    "It was overall an excellent course. Certainly one of the best I've taken in two years at YSPH. It's unfortunate that this class is one of the only opportunities to engage in active learning around qualitative research methods at the public health school. We need more qualitative research courses like this one!",
    "Best class I've taken at YSPH by far. Strengths: Practical public health application, learn tangible skills, Danya is the best professor you'll ever have. Weaknesses: It takes a lot of work.",
    "I really enjoyed this class because despite the heavy workload, I found that it was quite manageable and each step was important for conducting good qualitative research. I think the course could be improved by more evenly distributing the workload throughout the semester. There were times when my group wouldn't need any outside time while other weeks required a substantial effort on all of out behalves.",
    "Qualitative Research Methods Strengths: - hands on experience with qualitative research methods - very iterative-- constant feedback - Danya is great Weaknesses: - a lot of work? but totally worth it",
    "This course is great! It is really well taught. Best of all I felt like every assignment was for a purpose, there was no busy work which I appreciated.",
    "I would say that everything about the class was great (please keep the twice weekly schedule! it helped pace the curriculum and gave us all adequate time to work on our projects), but also due to the time limitations we weren't able to talk about other methodologies or techniques beyond grounded theory and semi-structured interviews.",
    "Fantastic course - should be an example to all YSPH faculty. Clear and insightful instruction, worthwhile and interesting assignments. Best class Ive taken here thus far.",
    "Favorite class at YSPH. Learned so much, and all assignments are important and come together at the end.",
    "This course is great. The strength is the instructor who is both knowledgeable and thoughtful. Not so much of a weakness, but this course is more demanding, but I think I was able to feel like I learned something because I did a lot in this course.",
    "The course flowed very nicely - the assignments were relevant and we were guided step by step in designing a mini qualitative project. I learned a ton and thought it was well organized. Danya did an incredible job structuring the course!",
    "This is a fantastic course that I have found to be directly applicable to my research. The course is structured to follow the course of a qualitative research project and is paced well. I appreciated the thoughtful feedback that the instructor provided and how the assignments match up with real-life qualitative research tasks. I also appreciated the opportunity to develop something through the course project that can ultimately be useful beyond the scope of the class. The main weakness of this course is that it is the only course offered at YSPH that focuses on qualitative research practice. As such, it tries to fit too much content into the scope of the course, some pieces of which feel shoehorned in. While I appreciated that we got to learn about these other methods, there should really be two or three additional courses on qualitative research, each of which can focus on a different method, such as in-depth interviews, focus groups, or observation and ethnography. This would allow each course to be more streamlined and better meet the needs of students.",
    "Overall the course was very helpful in providing a foundational knowledge of qualitative research methods. It is a term often thrown around without much understanding of how to do the actual methods and the theoretical information that underpins it. I think the major strength of the course is that we completed a qualitative project during the course of the semester - the methods would not be properly understood any other way. A weakness of the course in general was that it felt a bit rushed at the end of the semester; I wish there was more time devoted to writing and also of mixed methods research (though I understand that that was not the focus of the course).",
    "Take this course!! This course was such an effective use of time and will teach you step-by-step the necessary skills to conduct qualitative research. The main project is conducting interviews and qualitative analysis, with a group, on a topic of your choice. Each week you learn a set of skills and then practice applying them with that week's assignment(s).",
    "I love Danya Keene. Very knowledgeable, practical class. I'm taking skills I learned in this class and applying it to my summer research. It taught me how to think, and how public opinion can definitely shape public health. Great instructor, would highly recommend to anyone at YSPH.",
    "A wonderful and informative course. I not only learned a new skill, qualitative research and methods, but also learned a lot of the theory around this research method, both its pro's and con's. I can't think of any weakness or area for improvement. Dr. Keene has well-honed this class into a great experience for students.",
    "This is a must take class at YSPH. The methodologies and frameworks provided in the class help create a solid foundation for future qualitative work. Danya is an amazing professor (and human) and is able to create a dynamic classroom setting. I would 100% recommend this class to everyone, especially those who are very quantitative focused. As a future public health practitioner it should be mandatory to understand qualitative methodologies.",
    "Excellent. A lot of reading and group work but a must-take for anyone interested in qualitative research.",
    "I love the fact that we get to apply our knowledge through a group project. There is nothing I would change, but it would be great to have more time to go over mixed-methods."

    "Instructor: Danya Keene \u00a0Dr. Keene was extremely knowledgeable about the subject matter and I definitely appreciated her ability to easily pull in her own experiences with\/ research on qualitative methods. She is VERY approachable and asking questions is not difficult. It seems that she really treats her students like colleagues and that is not always my experience of professors here. I think she might improve her teaching style by perhaps taking it a bit slower at times - I know there is a lot to cover in the course and that is why we needed to go faster at times but sometimes it did feel a bit rushed.",
    "Instructor: Danya Keene \u00a0Danya is a true gem at YSPH. She is there to teach us and truly cares about our learning process.

   "comments": [
    "Take this course!! Even if you're not SBS and don't have to, please take this. Qualitative research is much more complicated that you'd think and I learned so so much from Danya. Everything you learn is incredibly practical. Yes, it's more work than most YSPH classes, but it's kind of fun work to design and then do your own research project, so I didn't mind doing it at all. If you work with a group you like then the work is enjoyable & you can make new friends. Honestly, I looked forward to going to this class each week, which is shocking for me. More people should know how to do effective qualitative research and I enjoyed it immensely.",
    "This class is a must-take for anyone considering doing qualitative research as part of the MPH thesis. I was taking the class as I worked on my qualitative thesis, and this class saved me! It would have been a great class to take during my 1st year in the program. The skills you learn are tangible and you have the opportunity to apply them in a very interesting project. The workload was very reasonable, and I felt very supported by Danya and the TF for the course. I have overall not been particularly impressed by YSPH courses, but Danya's class is a positive deviant! Going to each class felt worthwhile and important, as I felt that I was learning skills that I could apply in my project and in my thesis. Danya also genuinely cares about her students and is wonderful!",
    "Take it if you have any interest in qualitative research. I wish I had taken this during my first year. It's an excellent precursor to thinking about the thesis if you think you might be interested in qualitative research. Also, though people complain about the workload, I thought it was very reasonable and felt confident that most assignments were actually educational rather than just busywork.",
    "Take this class. Easily the more useful class i've taken to date at YSPH. Take it your first or second year. it's awesome.",
    "EVERYONE SHOULD TAKE THIS COURSE. super hands on, and I'm sad it was only one semester. You learn a lot, and get to conduct a pseudo-study on a topic of interest. be warned: a lot of group work in this course.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. I wish this were required of all MPH students, because quantitative methodology is not the only answer to develop or answer a question.",
    "TAKE IT - best YSPH decision youll make if you have even the slightest interest in qualitative or mixed-methods research.",
    "Great course. Everyone should take it, even if it isn't a requirement. Qualitative methods is important and growing, and interviews and focus groups are critical in public health and this class is great for that.",
    "Highly highly recommended. If you are ever interested in learning qualitative or even mixed methods (it doesn't go into mixed methods, but in order to do mixed, you need to understand qual), this is it!",
    "I would highly recommend this course to anyone interested in qualitative research - there is a lot of group work involved however it is manageable and is a very enjoyable experiences. It is well organized and you will learn a ton!",
    "Heavy work load but very easy to follow and enjoyable!",
    "If you have any interest at all in learning about qualitative research, you should take this course! It is a great way to learn qualitative research methods and to produce something that can be useful after you're done with the course. Dr. Keene is a fantastic instructor and will keep you engaged and provide excellent support as you go through the course.",
    "This course provides much practical skills if you are interested in working on a qualitative project in the future; even if you're not, it it still good to understand the theoretical foundations and be able to interpret such studies. I would highly recommend.",
    "Take this course!! This is one of the most useful, fun, and engaging courses you will take at YSPH. Danya is a wonderful human being and professor, and her class is perfectly structured to push you each week to learn a set of skills and then go out and practice them on your own (or with your group). The qualitative methods and skills we learned were also very much applicable to other courses and potential internships\/jobs. This course is a big time commitment, but it is fun and engaging and I highly recommend!",
    "I would highly recommend. Danya is fantastic, and I gained actual skills out of this class, which is what I need from my MPH. I feel comfortable conducting qualitative interviews now! And coding and writing memos.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to any student wishing to learn qualitative research skills. Dr. Keene is a wonderful teacher. You will learn a lot, and come away with a thorough understanding of how to conduct qualitative research. This is also a course where you get to do real research, which is pretty awesome.",
    "Everyone should be required to take this class. Understanding qualitative methods helps to better you as a future employee to any public health agency.",
    "A must-take for anyone interested in qualitative methods!",
    "Take this course if you want to learn qualitative methods."
