   "comments": [
    "Vaccines went over the basic concepts in vaccinology as well as current techniques being applied to certain vaccines. I would definitely recommend Vaccines to another student because not only did I learn a lot about vaccines, it also helped to effectively critique and understand journal articles in the field.",
    "MBIO 547 is a course that first explores the basic biology behind the use of vaccines and then verges into several experimental systems that are being utilized for the development of novel vaccines or enhancement of previously existing vaccines. I would recommend this course to another student, especially if they were interested in vaccine development. For other students with just a general interest in Microbiology, it would be a good course because it reinforces the immunological interactions between a pathogen and its host from yet another vantage point. I found this course to be very complimentary to the Immunobiology course.",
    "I greatly enjoyed the course and it made me very enthusiastic about vaccine science and development. I would definitely recommend it to anyone with an interest in this.",
    "Microbiology 547 is an interesting, informative course that covers a broad range of topics in vaccine development. It is especially beneficial to students who are interested in vaccines, major world diseases, and the development of clinical therapies."

   "comments": [
    "This course is inclined towards experiment based study, so it depends entirely on personal interest.",
    "It deepened my knowledge about how pathogens interact with a host immune system, and how we might use biotechnology to develop vaccines that use these dynamics to generate a form of immunity. It contributed a lot to my research.",
    "It helped me to think in terms of what immunological findings might mean for applications to real world treatments.",
    "As a student interested in pathogens, host immune responses, and the development of therapies, this course should make a strong contribution to my research."
