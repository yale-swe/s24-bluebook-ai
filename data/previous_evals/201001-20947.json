    "The reading responses are a good way to help us summarize the key arguments of the books, which can become useful tools for orals preparations.The discussions in class however can be fairly sterile at times, dwelling on minor points.HSHM 702 is required for all HSHM students. However, I will not recommend the course to students outside the discipline, as they might not be able to gain much from it.",
    "This class provides an introduction to the history of science. It is required for all HSHM students, but even if it weren't I would have still taken it to gain a broad understanding of the field.",
    "Since this is a compulsory class for students in HSHM, I would encourage each student to take what they can from the class, accepting that it may not relate specifically to their own research interests."
