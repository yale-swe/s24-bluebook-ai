    "I definitely recommend taking this course -- it's a great class to keep improving your language skills",
    "Yes, I would recommend this class to another student. Everyday there is a daily quiz. There are 3 tests, 2 oral presentations, and 3 or 4 essays per semester. Zhou laoshi is an amazing teacher! I think the homework is reasonable. Every night it took me about an hour and a half.",
    "Great 4th year class- I had taken a year off of Chinese class but actually found this one really easy compared to Li and Wang Laoshi's class.",
    "Chinese 154 manages to be an enriching class even though it only meets three times a week. The textbook teaches lessons on issues such as Chinese migrant workers, popular culture, and the effects of modernization, to name a few. We have ample opportunity to speak in class, but Zhou Laoshi still keeps us on track. The class is very well organized and well executed.",
    "Take it. Especially if Zhou laoshi is teaching.",
    "I would wholeheartedly recommend this course to another student. The expectation is that students in the course will have a strong grasp of the language and in some ways, the class rewards you for reaching this level. The topics in the textbook are quirky and interesting (online dating, TV soap operas, illegal immigration, extramarital affairs) and Professor Zhou makes the class enjoyable. The workload is pretty consistent with other Chinese courses I've taken at Yale. Expect work on a very regular basis, but never too much of it.",
