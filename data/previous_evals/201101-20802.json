    "It has quite some stuff same as 570 Artificial Intelligence. If you are not super interested in Robotics and you have already taken 570, then there is not much sense in taking 573.",
    "CS 573 is an interesting course which will help you build the foundation if you want to take advanced courses in robotics",
    "Yeah, I strongly recommend this course to students who want to explore the field of artificial intelligence or intelligent robotics.",
    "An overview of robot control and implementation technologies. Well taught and highly recommended.",
    "Would recommend this over Artifical Intelligence (570) as an intro course to AI",
    "I would definitely recommend it to another student. Robotics is a growing field and it is essential to know for any engineer.",
    "Yes. This course may not be very related to students who do not want to pursue further in the field of robotics. However, this whole process of designing and conducting a robotics-related or social science related project is highly beneficial.",
    "Would probably recommend it if you're interested."
