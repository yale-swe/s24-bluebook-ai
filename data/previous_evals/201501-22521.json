   "comments": [
    "If you are interested in humanities and don't mind a lot of reading, then you should definitely look into this class. Warning thought, there is a lot of reading assigned.",
    "This is a very good class if you're interested in Near Eastern and Northeast African history. If you want to focus your studies in Egyptian history and archaeology this is a really good foundation course to begin with. However, if you're not really down to do the reading, you're probably not suited for the class. Also, if you don't want to teach yourself how to read hieroglyphics, you probably shouldn't take the class.",
    "This is a good course for someone who is simply curious about Egyptian history and culture, who may have no prior experience in the subject. It's a course covering the key historic events of Egypt and its relations with Nubia but also an exploration of archaeological field techniques to study ancient civilizations.",
    "The class was surprisingly in depth for a course that was so expansive. I wish that he course had covered slightly more about day-to-day life, but considering the scope, that would have been very hard. The course was a lot of work, but was futility and good enough to make that worth it.",
    "This course is fascinating if you are willing to step outside of your comfort zone. If it weren't for this course I never be able to say that I read hieroglyphics and handled 2,500 year old pots. The workload is large and Professor Darnell does expect a lot from his students, but he is always willing to help.",
    "Darnell is a fascinating lecturer, and the class is for the most part. The reading, however, is quite abundant, and incredibly boring. It takes a certain kind of student to enjoy this class. You have to really be willing to put yourself into the assignments, and do at least some of the readings, to feel like you're actually getting anything out of it. Be warned: at certain points, there is a lot of work, and it can be very tedious. This can be a great class if you're interested in the topic and are willing to do at least some of the readings every week. If not, it's a slog, and you'll feel lost."
