   "comments": [
    "If you are interested in philosophy and want a different perspective from Western traditions, then take this class. It's low-key, not a lot of reading, the papers are not too stressful, and interesting. You don't necessarily do a very intensive engagement with any one Eastern philosopher but more get an extensive overview of what's out there. The professor is more concernedabout getting you to reflect and think rather than overload you with papers and reading, which is good. The translations are sometimes a bit frustrating since a good or bad translation really can determine how much you get out of a text. If you actually do the reading, engage with the material, wrestle with the papers, and think about what's being discussed in lecture, it can be quite rewarding. Plus for the last class, a Buddhist monk came and gave a little lesson on how to meditate.",
    "Broad survey of asian philosophies, however the material can get uninteresting quickly.",
    "Interesting course, but the material can be hard to understand. Sometimes its hard to connect the different lectures to each other and make sense of the material. Section helps. The meditation workshop during the last class is fun!",
    "The text that we go over in the class is great, but I don't think it was given the treatment it deserved - especially when the class consists mostly of people more interested in western philosophy, which involves an entirely different method of thought. If a student were more interested in the material, I would encourage him to take a class in the religious studies department. If you take this class, however, you will be reading some incredible texts. Be sure to read them, and think about them. Not just in terms of the class, but just think about them.",
    "The textbook is like a compendium of the worst translations ever made of Asian philosophical treatises, many of which are already incomprehensible. Lecture is often a mess of similarly nonsensical slides, and consists of the instructor reading off those slides or allowing students to talk past each other.Conditions under which you should consider taking this class: I stuck with this class because it gave me EAS credit, the workload got laughably light (though this depends on whether one cares about the material and how easygoing the TA is), and the material on Daoism, Confucianism, and Buddhism coincided nicely with HIST 315 (History of Traditional China). To be fair I also took away some good basic info on Hinduism and its connections to Buddhism.In sum: Don't take it except as a throw-away 5th, and even then it's a gamble. (You may see good reviews for the course; know that they're written by whoever stuck it out after 90% of the people who shopped it either dropped or stopped coming to class.)",
    "Philosophy 210 is an unusual, yet very interesting, course. Beginning with Daoism and progressing through Hinduism, Buddhism, Confucianism, and other schools of eastern thought, Eastern Philosophy is based entirely upon readings in translation. The class is unique for several reasons. First, the fact that Chinese and Japanese characters must be translated into full English sentences can lead to much translational bias. Unfortunately, whether a philosopher's thought is accurately portrayed is difficult to discern. More confusing still, some of the philosophers we studied denied the possibility of knowledge or encouraged people to stop desiring new knowledge. Naturally, assessment in this class is unusual, consisting of twice-weekly philosophical journal entries, and a midterm and final. (Two 2 to 3 page essays for midterm; one 8 to 10 page essay for final). The material varied from extremely interesting to fairly dry, but the workload was smaller than I expected. I would neither encourage nor discourage your taking this class; experiencing a different method of thought is intriguing and valuable, yet the course is extremely lightweight. I'm glad I took it, and if the material interests you, perhaps you could shop it.",
    "Pretty good. You'll learn a lot about eastern philosophy if you do the reading and think about it, but class isn't very helpful--the professor is hard to understand and the lectures aren't obviously related to the material and not too helpful.",
    "A survey of Eastern philosophical\/religious traditions and their views on certain philosophical questions. The material is interesting, but Professor Van doesn't present it very well. I got more out of the meditation workshop the last day of class than the rest of the lectures. I would think that just finding some good translations with analysis would be a better way to learn the ideas."
