    "I wouldn't recommend it. I was confused for 90% of the time. Beginning of the class was ok, even if a little boring, but after the first midterm I had no clue what the point of anything was.",
    "The homework assignments were rarely connected to what we studied in class. It was frustrating, but at least the exams were very fair. I wish the homework assignments had been a review of what was covered in class. It felt like I was continually learning something new but never had a chance to catch up so I a lot just went over my head. Overall the class seems like a nice QR credit. I don't know how I'm doing grade wise but we'll see how it all turns out. If you just NEED a QR, take it- it's not as painful some weeks.Grade makeup is psets (every class), two midterms, and a final.",
    "Do not take Estimation and Error. I took it thinking that it would be a relatively easy math credit for a non-math person and it turned out to be a uniquely horrible experience. If you need an easy math credit and are willing to subject yourself to an inconceivably boring four months, this will give you a qr. But do not take it under any other circumstances: the math we learned was either painfully, insultingly simple or strangely complicated and lacking in good, coherent explanation. I would seriously rather have taken an econ class for my qr--at least then I wouldn't have spent 4 months allowing my mind to atrophy.ALSO: if you just read that and are thinking, \"Well I get that he didn't like the class, but it still sounds nice and easy...\" I should note that there were two problem sets due each week, every one of which was crammed full of literally mind-numbingly boring minutiae that took at least 2 hours to complete. An example question: Write out x^2 through x^20 for each of the following: x=10.1, 10.01, 10.001, 10.0001, 10.00001, 10.000001, 10.0000001, 10.00000001, 10.000000001, 1.0000000001. I'm not kidding.",
    "If you need a math credit, but math is not your strength take this class. The second half is harder than the first, so start going in for help before you get swamped.",
    "Yes! Great way to learn how to round, to think of numbers more critically, and to fulfill your QR credit.",
    "This is an amazing course - you should definitely take it. I was looking for a pretty easy QR to take, and it took me a very stressful week to do so, but I found this and it was perfect. If you're looking for an easy QR, this should be your first priority (unless you didn't take calculus in high school, and if that's you you can take Geometry of Nature with Michael Frame). This was actually the best math class I've ever taken - the professor is very helpful and easygoing\/friendly, and always willing to go out of his way to help you. People always say that they'll never use math in the real world, but this was the first instance where I found out you actually could. Very practical, easy-to-do, and fun math. If you need a gutty Qr, take this. It's also very fun. Homework every class (which is every Tuesday and Thursday), but it's not too hard and doesn't take long to do."
