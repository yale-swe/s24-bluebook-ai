   "comments": [
    "Got a sense of some of the influential and well-reviewed recent books in CP. Was also good for getting a sense of the format of books as a platform for disseminating political science scholarship.",
    "This course was a fascinating survey of recent books on the subject of democratic institutions. Especially with the final writing assignment, I though the course did a great job of pulling together a group of related factors in governance and demonstrating how they are interrelated -- though I wish some more of that comparative discussion happened in class, rather than just in the final paper. The course also helped develop presentation skills and Stathis' sparring with the weekly presenting student seems like good training for presenting at a workshop.",
    "I got a broad overview of the field of comparative politics at present and learned about the differences in how to approach writing a book vs writing an article.",
    "It was very valuable to engage with with a wide array of recent literature in comparative politics. It was useful to learn to present another scholar's work for an extended period in a graduate classroom setting.",
    "I learned a lot about the methods used to write texts in comparative politics, as well as the overarching questions in the discipline.",
    "I read some of the newest comparative politics texts and developed skills to determine and evaluate the overarching arguments of books.",
    "This course provided the opportunity to update myself on the state of the field. Our class discussions and Prof. Kalyvas' insights helped me critique what we read.",
    "This course was not only a welcome introduction to the current subfield of comparative politics, but Professor Kalyvas helped us understand how he thinks the entire field is developing.",
    "By focusing on the book format, the course forced me to improve both my ability to read academic works critically and efficiently, as well as improve my ability to critically evaluate and synthesize academic works."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "No real qualms. Was good.",
    "This course covered a lot of material on a group of closely related subjects. I enjoyed the book selections and the discussions they generated. However, many of the books were responses to previous theories and concepts with which I was not familiar. Some more introduction or foundational groundwork may have been beneficial.",
    "I liked the course design - I wish it would have involved a bit more engagement during student presentations, but overall, it was a nice course design.",
    "The course assumed a basic background in CP methodology; however, it would have been nice to have dedicated a class or two to providing an overview of the subfield (methodologies, topics, controversies, history) before launching into the books.",
    "I think it would have been useful if we covered some of the more classical books in comparative politics, more in the strain of the Putnam book we read, in lieu of more recent books that the class and professor were both more critical of.",
    "The strengths of the course were both evaluating the texts themselves and the ability to create a presentation. The class presentation was a \"low-risk\" opportunity to demonstrate what we had learned from each text in a classroom environment, a valuable skill for rising scholars.",
    "It would be very instructive if the faculty would also lecture briefly at the opening of every seminar on the topic at hand.",
    "Most of the books were great, and even the books that fell below expectations were valuable for teaching us how to critique political science literature.",
    "The course provided an excellent overview of the field of comparative politics, as well as a good introduction to the plurality of methods and research approaches currently utilized in the field."

   "comments": [
    "Yeah. Was a good intro to some important works in CP.",
    "If the student was interested in getting into the weeds on a wide range of issues pertaining to democratic institutions, then yes. Otherwise, I might recommend a survey course or a couple books from the class instead.",
    "Yes - it's a great overview of the field",
    "Yes! This was an excellent introduction to the subject and I learned a lot.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student, regardless of if they intend on making Comparative Politics one of their subfields.",
    "Yes, this is a good opportunity to update yourself on the field.",
    "Never miss a chance to take a class with Stathis!",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student, even those outside of the field of comparative politics. It demonstrates the breadth of topics and plurality of methodological approaches in comparative politics, and shows how the field can easily interact with other subfields."
