   "comments": [
    "The course is what it is. There is very little speaking practice and lots of memorization. You learn more about topics like Korean history and economics, meaning you learn lots of awesome, high-level vocabulary that you probably will never use. Take it to keep your Korean skills up, but don't expect much. Professor Choi may seem a little unfriendly at first, but she is truly intelligent and kind and cares deeply about her students.",
    "You will read a series of texts about Korean society and Korean history with some slightly less dense material tied in. We watched an episode of a drama and had a Hanja quiz once a week. I'd recommend this course for building up an advanced vocabulary and improving understanding of fairly difficult texts. It isn't the best for speaking practice, but it would be hard to do that much better within the class time. There's a lot of vocabulary to learn, so how much you gain from this class depends largely on how much effort you put in.",
    "If you are interested in learning more about Korean history and culture, this class is great. Also if you want to improve your writing skills then take this course."
