   "comments": [
    "strengths: lecture notes were good",
    "I think the course was a good follow-up course to first semester. I liked a lot of the articles that were provided for readings. It really reinforced the concepts of epidemiology and allowed me to understand a slightly different perspective of the discipline.",
    "I think that we learned some incredibly valuable information in this class. Due to the very high level of teaching during Epi I, however, much of the information was not new. That being said, it was still helpful to go over concepts again and delve a little deeper.",
    "There was a ton of overlap with Epi 1",
    "It's good in that it teaches us the foundation of public health and the skills needed to conduct epidemiological research. It covered a lot of the same topics as first semester - sometimes this was good to reinforce what we had learned previously, other times it would have been nice to delve into new topics.",
    "This course would have been a good course if it had not been just a repeat of Epi 1. I don't understand why this course is a requirement when it was literally 95% review. It's sort of frustrating.",
    "I thought the material was quite repetitive. Epi I taught us some phenomenal fundamentals, that were seemingly re-introduced to us in Epi II. It would have been great to have learned about them in greater depth, or even be introduced to new facets of Epi. I did, however, enjoy the study-design aspects of the course.",
    "Unsure why it is only a requirement for CDE students, as EMD students should also complete this course. It was a good review of Epi I.",
    "Pretty good. The course enabled me to reinforce what I learned from the last semester at the basic epidemiology course.",
    "The course gave me a greater understanding of epi methods and expanded on many of the things I learned in Epi I. The course was a different perspective though there was a lot of overlap with Epi I.",
    "This class was a useful refresher of Epi I, but was mostly repetitive. However, I feel some repetition can be helpful and serves to reinforce core concepts. The texbook was a little too wordy for these concepts, though very detailed.",
    "It was a continuation of Epi I, although calling it a 'continuation' is not exactly true. Much of it was direct repitition and therefore unnecessary. I can think of maybe 3 topics in Epi II that were not covered in Epi I, but everything else was, and much of it was actually covered in more depth in Epi I. The professor said at the start of the semester that we would be covering many of the same topics, but in more depth. That wasn't always true. The study-design section of the course was the most interesting to me, because it allowed us to read papers and critique them in class, which is not something I had done before. But when we covered such topics as confounding, bias, interaction, etc., I took very little of out of those lectures.",
    "Repetitive to Epi 1",
    "The course was informative and well taught. The lecture slides were very helpful, and the reading assignments were interesting. It would be nice if the reading assignments were posted well in advance rather than a few days prior to the due date. Also, answer keys to past homework assignments would be helpful since we can learn from our mistakes and also understand what is being expected from us.",
    "This is a wonderful course to reinforce the material learned from Epi I",
    "The homework was given on a Sunday night (late) and due on Friday. This doesn't give a weekend to do an extremely lengthy 5-10 page homework assignment. It's because of this that there was so much tension with the students regarding homework and homework grading, we just need more time to complete such a long assignment.In reference to the lecture, Desai is a good lecturer but the notes weren't very helpful, and it would be good if he did less reading off the notes, but this was a similar problem with the other Epi professors. Winslow is a horrible horrible horrible room.",
    "Mayur is wonderful and incredibly adept at the language of epidemiology. The only problem was that so many of the topics overlapped with Epi I. It was hard to stay engaged and focused without new concepts.",
    "This course could be renamed \"Remedial Epi I\" or \"How to Critique a Journal Article.\" The content of the course was very similar to that of Epi I. The new material was given just as much emphasis as the material we covered in Epi I, which should not have been the case. The exams also seemed to focus primarily on material covered in Epi I, with little emphasis on new concepts. If it weren't a requirement, I wouldn't have wasted my time on it.",
    "This course was quite redundant to Epi I, although some of the material was covered in greater depth, which was helpful. I wish we had either learned new or more complex material as compared to first semester. Conversely, it would have been nice to have the class be more interactive. Perhaps not having it in Winslow might help facilitate this. I liked it when we worked through problems together as a class. The homework assignments were also a very thorough review of the most important material.",
    "Great course and great instructor! I really enjoyed how Prof Desai described Epi... it was interesting to learn about things from a different standpoint (vs last semester)",
    "good follow up from epi I, though there was quite a bit of repetition in the beginning of the semester. a great intro to study designs and thinking analytically about studies and papers.",
    "Good, although similar in many ways to Epi I",
    "Overall, I liked this course. However, it was pretty much a review of Epi I and I didn't think we learned as much as we could have. Then again, the concepts of Epidemiology are ingrained in my mind, which is a benefit to having reviewed the concepts again in more depth.",
    "Would help from seeing questions and solutions (beyond lecture notes)",
    "The course would have been good, but it was not tailored to elaborate on the information we learned in Epi 1. At times it was very confusing because Dr. Desai was teaching us the exact same concepts that we learned in Epi 1, but in a much more complicated manner. In addition, most of the lectures were spent critiquing articles which was not very helpful.Naturally, one would expect that Epi 2 is the next step to Epi 1, but this was not the case. Most of Epi 2 was spent learning the basic concepts that we had already mastered in Epi 1.Overall, I think the course was a disappointment.",
    "The strengths are that it reinforces the concepts taught in epi I. The weaknesses are that they aren't too many new concepts taught, but I thought it was important to solidify the knowledge I gained from epi I.",
    "S: the homeworks and examsW: the book",
    "The course solidified and expanded on cncepts covered in Epi I. Overall, it was a great course. I would have, however liked more practice problems or even practice exams to work through.",
    "unfortunate that desai taught this course after dubrow, but i was still able to learn something new each course. if this course were taught as Epi I and Dubrows as Epi II I feel like I would be more confident in my overall knowledge of Epi. Desai's course provides a clear delineation of Epi concepts and methodology whereas Dubrow's course was much more in depth-- so in depth that it was hard to grasp it all at once without a prior foundation (like the equivalent of that provided by Desai).",
    "The content is very important and interesting.",
    "It is very good course, good discussion and critique of the articles"

    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Dr. Desai was a clear lecturer and lecture slides were mainly useful study tools.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Sarcastic and always appeared on the defense. Could have done with a little bit of sympathy towards students. Refused to provide answers to a homework set to a homework that was returned a day before the midterm and no opportunity to ask the TAs in person or in class (as the HW set was returned during class to our mailbox - so we didn't get the HW set until after class).",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Dr. Desai is a wonderful professor. He is able to explain the information in a variety of ways to enhance student understanding. His tests and homework questions are straight forward - no tricks or anything like other professors.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Professor Desai is a brilliant and intelligent professor, with vast experience at Yale and outside of Yale, who we all deeply admire. However, he pushes students away like pool balls. He seems to want to have nothing to do with us, and seems to think we're all cheating lowlives. He talks down to all of us and makes us feel like idiots, both in class and in office hours. I admire himand think I could learn a lot from him, but every time I leave speaking with him I either want to cry, or cry. I feel like he hates us.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0WONDERFUL! thoughtful, interesting, caring and open to questions.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Dr. Desai had a somewhat abrasive demeanor, which made him unapproachable. His critical attitude was not conducive to class participation or questions.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Dr. Desai did an excellent job of providing relevant journal articles to supplement the lectures. Discussing them in class was always very helpful. His powerpoint slides were usually very clear and concise.I felt that sometimes near the end of the semester, some of the lectures felt very rushed, but overall, I felt like I came away with a good understanding of basic epi methods\/ study designs as well as calculations.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0I really enjoyed Prof Desai's lectures. I think he is an excellent professor and receptive to our questions\/thoughts\/ideas\/etc. He was very encouraging, and I would recommend this course to students who don't have it as a requirement. I think it was very useful and helpful for our future research.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0really got the class to read papers thoughtfully and not believe every word that we read in a journal, which was refreshing.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Dr. Desai is a great professor. He was very straightforward in his lectures and in his responses to questions. It was not difficult to follow his train of thought. I appreciated the slides given in addition to the lecture.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Sometimes his spunk was a little abrasive. Deterrent from wanting to speak with him or meet with him. Making fun of the emails people send in or saying that they're a waste of your time or that you won't even validate them with a polite answer and just ignore them... is sort of discouraging.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Professor Desai is super cool, and was always interesting in class, even for topics that I didn't find terribly interesting. He was also very helpful anytime I asked for help or advice, and made me feel more comfortable with the material.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Although states that he is willing to answer any questions, he proceeds to do so in a condescending manner. Many students, including myself never felt comfortable approaching him to ask questions.Although he is very educated on the material he was presenting, he did not clearly explain the concepts he was trying to get across. The only reason I understood them was because of the knowledge I obtained in Epi 1.Also,he used a horrible text book.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Dr Desai is very animated and worked hard to make sure we understood the basic epi concepts. I liked his teaching style, and it was apparent that he is very interested in epi and finds joy in teaching it.",

    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0very knowledgeable and personable. Could have been a bit more in tune with the previous semester's material and terminology to avoid overlap and confusion (usually semantics).",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0He is very enthusiastic about epidemiology. But I imagine\/have heard that teaching this class might not be the most rewarding experiece. Sometimes it seemed as though the core aspects of the class were meant to be elusive with unclear expectations. I am specifically thinking about the homework and the need to make additional appointments to review with the TAs or professor. This can be challenging for already-working professionals and frankly was not worth the time. I also felt there were points taken off by TAs that were not justified but again, did not have the time to make additional appointment to address these issues.",

    "The Epi TAs were okay, they seemed very busy and really unable to devote their complete time to actually TAing the class. I think these problems just show the YSPH issue of how PhD students have to teach, and some of them are completely unqualified to teach and\/or don't want to teach! It seems everyone at YSPH hates to teach, so why, are they teachers??",

    "I felt as though the TAs frequently graded at higher difficulty level than I expected. I thought that there were several occasions where, for example, Dr. Desai told us that we need only write a few sentences, but they graded down for not writing enough. This frequently felt fairly harsh.",
    "Hannah, was also not very helpful. Not willing to let you know if you were right or wrong. There were some questions from the homework that I met with her to discuss and because she did not want to say that my response was correct or incorrect, I was thinking about the concept completely wrong and was only corrected when it was marked off on my homework.",
