    "If you want to keep studying Italian, then take this class!",
    "I would recommend Italian 130 to a student who did well with the structure of elementary Italian and wants to solidify their understanding of the language.",
    "If you are taking Italian L3, take it with Rachael Streeter. Rachael is such a good teacher. She is the third teacher I have had for Italian, and I would say she is the best. She has high but not unreasonable expectations, and never puts students on the spot or makes them feel uncomfortable for not knowing something, which I think is very helpful because it encourages students to speak more. She makes herself very available if you have any questions, and overall she is just a very nice person.L3 is a lot like L2 in that you go over familiar concepts, just more in depth.",
    "Definitely not a gut class but a great review of basic Italian concepts. If you need this to meet the language requirement and have already come this far, definitely take the class. Rachael Streeter is great and makes class enjoyable."
