   "comments": [
    "Theories of science\/scientific history and knowledge of basic astrophysics",
    "Knowledge on relativity and black holes. Knowledge from class felt more meaningful in a way due to learning the history behind the discoveries and the people who discovered them",
    "Special relativity, general relativity, and black holes.",
    "LEARNED SO MUCH ABOUT RELATIVITY! Wow. And black holes, but that's more difficult. Learned a lot that I really didn't expect to learn while at this school. Relativity is very very interesting, and learned a lot about the history of science and astrophysics. WOW. huge fan.",
    "I learned how to apply what previously seemed like useless math in order to understand more about the universe. We also learn a lot about how scientific theories get accepted and the social implications of theories such as Einstein's relativity.",
    "A lot of cool stuff about relativity",
    "We learned special and general relativity and discussed their application to studying black holes.",
    "You learn about special relativity and general relativity, and a bit about physics and astronomy along the way. However, the course doesn't really require any math besides algebra, so you aren't going to be learning these topics the way they would be taught to people majoring in astronomy or physics. Nonetheless, I did walk away with a basic understanding of these very cool (trippy) topics. Professor Bailyn also does a great job of integrating his interest in the history and philosophy of science to the course.",
    "I feel like I learned so much in this class. Basic classical physics, special relativity, general relativity, all things black holes, and the present state of astrophysics kind of sums it up.",
    "A breadth of topics related to Relativity and Black Holes was covered in this course.",
    "The history, concepts, and phenomena of special and general relativity. Basic algebraic manipulations. Meta-theories of the scientific method.",
    "So much about the stars! And the history of astrophysics!",
    "Learned about special and general relativity and many thinkers who helped to develop these ideas. Used algebra and geometry to solve problems, and gained some specific writing skills.",
    "Learned more math",
    "Knowledge into a wide variety of sub topics under the topic of astronomy\/astrophysics.",
    "It's a very insightful class that teaches you the fundamentals of Astronomy, Astrophysics, and Black Holes. It's an amazing class. No background needed!",
    "I definitely learned a lot about relativity, black holes, and space in general from this course, having had no exposure to astronomy\/astrophysics before. I also had to flex my old algebra 1 brain, which was surprising difficult (but I'm a Humanities major, so.).",
    "I acquired various knowledge about astronomical phenomena.",
    "I learned about the recent history of astronomy and the process by which humans progressed from Newtonian astronomy to the complex theory of General Relativity and Black Holes we have today.",
    "I learned more about the field of astrophysics and some of the concepts that came along with it.",
    "The course is split into 3 main section: special relativity, general relativity, and black holes\/what's happening in the field currently. All 3 of these succeeded in teaching me these things.",
    "I developed the ability to apply and interpret certain astrophysical situations using equations. I also learned lots about relativity and star structure.",
    "Introduction to Einsteins main theories of special and general relativity , focus on black holes",
    "I gained a ton of knowledge about the very basics of relativity. I thought it was very fun to learn about various advancements in the field of astronomy.",
    "basic astronomy skills",
    "I have sharpened my quantitative skills, gotten a really holistic overview of physics after Newton, and generally gotten a much better understanding of whats happening in the universe!",
    "I learned about special and general relativity, the behavior of black holes, and the philosophy\/history of relativistic astrophysics.",
    "I learnt about the basic concepts of special relativity, some insights and observational evidence for general relativity, and relativistic astrophysics. It was a great introduction to the world of astronomy and astrophysics, simplified to an extent suitable for the non-physics college student. I now can understand astro references in pop culture (like Big Bang Theory and Interstellar)! Learnt about scientific epistemology and the qualitative aspects of scientific research too.",
    "A particular skill I strengthened by taking this course was my ability to apply concepts (rather than memorizing straight material) taught in class to an array of problems on problem sets\/tests\/exams.",
    "Introduction to special and general relativity with overview on their connection on an astronomical level in terms of stellar objects and black holes",
    "Basic knowledge of relativity and black holes, neutron stars, etc",
    "Just a greater appreciation for the stars and the physical theories behind them.",
    "time dilation, special and general relativity, space-time curvature, and the formation of stars, and nature, identification and measurement of black holes. Skills developed include formula use, drawing space-time diagrams, analyzing graphs of pulsars, learned far more math skills than writing skills. Found understanding of observational astronomy, history of science, and black holes to be most interesting.",
    "An elementary understanding of Special and General Relativistic physics.",
    "The course allowed me to familiarize myself with important concepts in astrophysics. We covered topics ranging from black holes and white dwarfs to relativity and gravitational waves. The course explored both the science and history behind each of the topics we learned about, which was an approach I had never been exposed to in STEM classes.",
    "The course is an excellent introduction to Special Relativity, General Relativity, and the recent discoveries made in the field of astrophysics."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "It meets very frequently for shorter periods of time, but it's interesting and fun to go to!",
    "Strengths: Questions every lesson worked well. Content was interesting and all linked well together. I think it is really interesting learning about the history of the discoveries as well as what they actually are and mean Weaknesses: Would have been nice to have more questions answered every lesson but I also understand that there is only limited time and that is also what office hours is for",
    "The syllabus is well-organized.",
    "STRENGTH: The fact that this class is a very low pressure environment is GREAT. Because the material can get really weird, but since there's not a lot of insane pressure to do well, it feels much more relaxed and I felt like I could actually complete the work. Office hours were very very helpful. sometimes the lectures weren't the most interesting, but that's ok. still learned a lot",
    "Great structure and grading policy. The lectures, even though they were pretty early, were engaging and not painful to sit through.",
    "i liked the contents of the class but good lord i couldn't understand so much of it",
    "Really interesting stuff. Decent pace through material Lectures pretty boring but understandable for those with no STEM background. Also, really harsh grading in writing sections of psets for no real reason",
    "StrengthsProfessor Bailyn is interesting, funny, and does a great job of making the material matter and situating it historically. His breadth of interests across disciplines comes through in lectures. He is also super helpful and really wants to help you learn and succeed! WeaknessI think it would be super helpful if there was an accompanying textbook(let) or clearer instructions on which Khan Academy videos would be useful for the course. The powerpoints are well-designed as powerpoints, but not great for summarizing or reviewing. I also wish there had been more of a general summary of everything we learned at the end of the course.",
    "This course is structured pretty perfectly. I wouldn't change anything. Especially make sure to keep the question sheet approach, that was a fantastic idea.",
    "Dr. Bailyn is a very engaging lecturer. The topics covered in this course were engaging and relevant to understanding of modern astrophysics. The course is well structured and builds chronologically to an understanding of the most recent developments in the field of astrophysics. If you want an understanding of astrophysics with lots of math and physics, this is not the course for you.\/",
    "Strengths: open to student feedback and interaction, interesting material. Interdisciplinary insofar as it including historical and philosophical material. Weaknesses: alternated between being very focused on one subject, or very broad. How could it be improved: the QR aspect of the class was present in the problems and tests, but not taught in lecture much outside of discussing sig figs. I'd suggest either teaching QR more, or rework the questions.",
    "Content was a strength of this course. I thought Professor Bailyn did a great job telling the story of astrophysics. Unquestionably, the grading policies were a weakness. It seemed like every single time on a problem set or quiz, there were students who needed to have their assignments regraded because the teaching assistants had improperly taken off points. The course WOD be much improved by a more standard grading system.",
    "Very good course",
    "Good grading system and a week to complete each pset.",
    "A strength of this course is that the lectures are usually pretty engaging and Charles Bailyn is a super helpful professor who truly does care about his students and helping them succeed. If you reach out to him, in office hours or separately, he will do all he can to help you. The biggest weakness of the class, however, is its organization. The office hours are just individual students\/groups of students working on the psets, with the professors and TAs walking around helping where needed. But when some of the complex problems can take 30 minutes to explain, this means that many times people have to sit and wait for a very long time before getting any help at all. And in addition, the TAs are extremely useless - more than once did they just completely incorrectly explain how to do a problem to people, wasting hours of student time and completely misleading them if they hadn't gone to the professor to clarify. Further, in the lectures it can often be difficult to know what is important information.",
    "My weaknesses were the analysis questions involving Vulcans and human response to discovery. This could have been improved by focusing more on the impact of the discovery rather than just the mathematics.",
    "The Strength of this course is the organization. The main weakness is the inherent conflict of trying to learn about complex mathematical topics without doing very much math, which sometimes doesnt run particularly smoothly.",
    "Absolutely fascinating. If you have interest at all about space, black holes, how the universe works, etc. this is an amazing course. Material is unique and really makes you think (for example the concept that time is not continuous or linear can be quite difficult to wrap your head around at first) but Prof Bailyn is so good. It has been my favorite course at Yale, and if he teaches this course I recommend in 10\/10. Honestly no real weaknesses without nitpicking. Could be nice to move to 2 times\/week for an hour fifteen instead of 50 min 3 times\/week because he starts the class by answering questions that you submit at end of previous class (which is a really nice aspect because the concepts can be very confusing the first time he goes over them, so its nice he addresses common concerns amongst the students), but that usually takes 20 min or so, so there are classes where you won't have much, if any, new material. Only other thing I could think of would be that Prof Bailyn also likes to focus a lot on past researchers\/noble prize winners\/etc (esp in third section of the class), but a lot of these concepts get a little wishy washy (esp in terms of writing questions on problem sets and essays) because its all about what he finds interesting about those people\/their contributions to the field so there isn't a true \"correct answer\" like there is for the math-based questions.",
    "Strengths: Lots of resources to help you understand the course, very active professor and set of ULA's, course structure that appeals to people with different strengths, interesting material Weaknesses: None that I can think of",
    "Fascinating material but instructor sometimes went too fast and rubric for written answers was not very clear.",
    "The class was well taught.",
    "I really loved how structured it was, and the quizzes, psets and lessons were organised to ensure we could do knowledge checks at every step of the way. Professor Bailyn was a brilliant lecturer and made lessons very engaging even for a non-science student.",
    "The lectures are engaging and the content is fascinating. Although I was initially daunted by the meetings (three times a week at 9:25), I found that the frequency of lectures kept my understanding fresh. Professor Bailyn's teaching is, of course, a highlight of this course. I think the course could be organized more clearly. The lecture slides, which we can print and take into the open-book exams, are too difficult to navigate when studying. Maybe the printable slides could be shortened to eliminate duplicates and organized by topic headings? I also found that, although the qualitative questions on psets and tests were often broad, the professor was looking for very specific answers. I wish there were either a more flexibility for those questions, or more specific criteria.",
    "Strengths: Prof Bailyn was committed to the course and designed the curriculum well, great help at office hours, great powerpoint slides, open-book exams, grading structure that allowed some leeway (eg. 2 pset drops, 1 quiz drop) Weaknesses: the wording in psets was sometimes confusing, essays on psets took up much time as we weren't clear of the requirements. Felt like the psets didn't really evaluate my knowledge on the material but tested my interpretation of the confusing question. Time could be saved by making questions much clearer, telling us which numbers to use, etc.",
    "A strength is Professor Bailyn's genuine and enthusiastic teaching style and attitude, as well as both the material and pace of the lectures. A weakness is the seemingly open ended amount of material that could be tested on and the fact that no two problems were ever alike, making it difficult to really study anything in too much detail. I think the math and physics of the course was a bit harder than advertised at the beginning on the syllabus, and think it should be changed accordingly from just high school level algebra.",
    "The beginning of the semester was quite easy to follow and well structured. However, as the concepts became more complex, the lectures were too much information overload that I could literally not follow with the concepts that we were learning by the end of the semester. I felt as if the professor were assuming too much that the students are able to retain the information automatically when during lectures we barely were keeping up to write down notes to fully comprehend. Also repetition of information reviewed in previous classes that were mentioned in following classes out of order was confusing in terms of students trying to organize the things we learned in our minds. Also during office hours, the TA's were sometimes helpful but a lot of times misinformed and gave wrong answers to questions, and sometimes even refused to ask simple conceptual questions during reviews for quizzes and such on the basis that they did not understand the information fully either.",
    "Lectures were organized in a really disorganized way for a STEM class, which made it hard to learn.",
    "Content is so interesting. However, it is a large workload for non-stem people.",
    "interesting lectures and material. very good at providing sessions to work on problem sets. weakness includes difficulty in asking questions in class, both in speed of material leaving us unable to frame questions, and not having time to ask. also inconsistent grading by ulas--one quiz was incorrectly graded unfairly deducting substantial points.",
    "It is very interesting but not very committal. It is a great class for people interested in astronomy and physics but not enough to major in either. The problem was that it was advertised as a course that seemed easy but it was not easy enough for people to use to meet their science requirement. A bit of genuine interest in the material is necessary to keep up with the course.",
    "I would say there's definitely a steep learning curve at the beginning. It definitely takes some adjusting to, especially if you're not used to approaching STEM at this level. Strengths include that there are several office hours during the week to get help on the p-sets; Professor Bailyn is an extremely accessible professor and dynamic lecturer; and everyone (Professor and ULAs) wants you to succeed, so they go out of the way to help and ensure that you are understanding the material."

   "comments": [
    "Yes! It's a great science credit, there's a lot of help available, and it's fun\/funny a lot of the time.",
    "Yes I would recommend as this class is very interesting and is taught really well. If a student has any interest in space and astronomy I would recommend it.",
    "Yes. Astronomy is fun!",
    "YES. Take this if you are not a QR or science person. You learn so much, and it actually is very interesting! I never would have imagined that I would take a class here on this particular topic, but I'm so glad I did. You really learn about incredible aspects of our universe, and that is very valuable to me.",
    "If you're a humanities person who wants to understand science and the universe, I definitely recommend this course! It's not a gut, it does take work and effort, but its pretty hard not to do well and if you put in work it will pay off.",
    "Yes, this course is perfect for non-majors and I left with a very solid understanding of a very complex subject.",
    "If youre a STeM major, the math is easy and this is a great class even maybe a gut. Idk about non-stem You have to show up to class though... that sucked",
    "If you want a science credit or really want to learn the basic of the topics covered, it is great for that. I don't think it gets you to a place of being able to fully understand the real science done by scientists on these topics, but it definitely gives you a great background in super-crazy material!",
    "Absolutely! This is a fantastic course. If you have any intro physics knowledge it'll be a gut and even if not it isn't difficult at all. Bailyn also does everything in his power to make sure you get a good grade, so don't worry about the grade at all. Honestly this is probably my favorite class I've taken at Yale so far.",
    "If you're interested in astrophysics and want to engage with topics in this field without much math or physics, then take this course. It's not too much work and the lectures are pretty engaging. Dr. Bailyn does a great job explaining complex physics without a need for much complex math and physics.",
    "Yes, if you're not a stem student, but you're interested in relativity.",
    "Yes! Though the content is difficult to wrap your head around because of the massive scale of it all, there are several ways to make the information more accessible and the professor and TA and ULAs are very helpful.",
    "Yes, but be wary of grading. It's better to ask him to regrade things than to suffer the worse grade. Professor Bailyn is remarkably receptive to all this, it's just a shame that you have to do it at all.",
    "Intro to astro without a deep dove",
    "I would recommend this course to someone who is willing to work hard.",
    "The professor is extremely knowledgeable in his field and fosters a curiosity about astrophysics to students who have not been exposed to this field before.",
    "It depends on what youre looking for. If youre a non-stem student looking for a QR, this is a good choice: youll do very little math and most of it will be plug and chug. If youre a math student (as I was) looking to actually learn a lot of relativity, the class will be disappointing. Its certainly a class on astronomy, but I would say its closer to a history of relativity course than a physics course. If that sounds appealing, then take it. Otherwise, look elsewhere for a science credit.",
    "Absolutely, especially if you have any interest in space, relativity, black holes, etc. It's intended for non-majors astro\/physics\/astrophysics majors so the math in the course is not bad (not even calculus is used). The tricky things are the concepts: once you truly start to wrestle with things like non-linear space and time, seemingly simple ideas have layers you have to explote to truly understand them. Prof Bailyn does a great job with helping you understand these and presents them in ways that are easy to understand (especially by introducing them then touching on them for several other classes to help solidify it). This has been my favorite course at Yale.",
    "Yes! Very interesting material",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to other students! I learned interesting material in a setting that seemed to be engineered for student success. If someone is even marginally interested in the material they should definitely take this course.",
    "I LOVED THIS CLASS SO MUCH. take it! do not be afraid!",
    "Yes, I think the class is really good for students who are non-stem majors but still enjoy taking science classes.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone whos interested in learning more about generally physics, not just the quantitative side, but also the history and philosophy of science.",
    "I would recommend this course to students who are comfortable with a math-heavy science credit, who are willing to put in a considerable amount of work, and who have a genuine interest in the content. This class is a gut in that the content is made more accessible than it really is, but it is NOT a gut in terms of workload. I am grateful that this course allowed me to learn so much more about a topic that I previously thought would go way over my head.",
    "Yes, definitely! Great science credit, great introduction to astrophysics, but it's not a gut class.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student willing to work hard to achieve both intellectual pursuits as well as a science\/QR credit. It definitely wasn't as easy as advertised on the syllabus, but still was highly engaging and interesting in the course material, specifically the lectures that were more on the history and philosophy of astronomy.",
    "It was a good introduction to learning about special relativity and general relativity and what those terms actually mean and apply in astronomy. But beware, this is not a gut course.",
    "This class wasn't as good as I hoped. It wasn't very much work, but I also found it boring, especially after we went through the relativity material and moved on to black holes. The science part of the class was okay, but the \"learn more about the philosophy and history of science\" parts kind of felt like a very enthusiastic but not well executed attempt at creating a well-rounded class.",
    "Yes but not without a warning.",
    "Yes. though it was difficult.",
    "I will only recommend this class if the person is interested in astronomy and physics.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. The topics covered are extremely interesting as well as relevant to astrophysics today--that is, the class explores fields that are changing even today. During the course, new discoveries regarding black holes were published, which the Professor seamlessly incorporated into the class. It's an exciting field in STEM today, so it is definitely worth learning more about it through this engaging class.",
    "I would recommend this course for those interested in Relativity and astronomy\/astrophysics."
