    "I would highly recommend this class! It is a really interesting, wonky examination of the world of food in a classroom filled with extremely knowledgeable and interesting students. I think it helps to come with some experience in food or sustainability. We spent the last three weeks outside on the two Yale farms, which was so, so fun and interesting. The class dinners with various high profile figures in food were particularly wonderful.",
    "This was a great overview and critical analysis of what's going on in the world of food and ag. I would definitely recommend it! Although the lectures are sometimes odd\/not relevant, you'll learn a lot from this course. just a heads up - what you'll learn is pretty depressing.",
    "Yes! Great comprehensive review of the most pertinent food system topics. Mark is an entertaining, articulate, and brilliant teacher. First half of class is a prepared presentation by Mark and the second half is student presentations and student-led discussion. Mark's presentations were always very interesting. Going to the Yale Farm and West Campus Farm were also definitely highlights of the class. Anyone interested in studying food through the lens of academia definitely needs to take this.",
    "Take it only if you are really interested in the theories behind sustainable agriculture.",
    "Take this class if you want to really get into the study of food, but have an open mind, a critical eye, do the reading, and have at least a baseline knowledge of today's popular food literature (everyone should by now IMHO), and you'll get so much out of it. The project is an excuse to have fun or do something you wouldn't otherwise do but still learn from.",
    "Absolutely- this course will force you to rethink food systems you thought you understood",
    "This is an interesting course that addresses many of the nuanced issues facing the sustainable food system across the globe. it does a good job surveying the issues and presenting varied approaches but it involves some irritating components. Specifically Mark is too heavily invested in details and an online blog becomes rather tedious. Other than that the course is eye opening and does work to change perspectives. I recommend it to anyone interested in the subject matter.",
    "If you are at all interested in a more just food system, TAKE THIS CLASS! Know that it is not a class for beginners (which I was), most students in the class already knew and were expected to know a LOT about food and food systems. I LEARNED SO MUCH. I learned to think critically about food and went way beyond critiquing the dominant discourse or targeting industrial agriculture to really gaining a nuanced understanding of 4 different approaches to feed the world and all the problems\/implications that come along with them. Also, Prof. Bomford KNOWS EVERYTHING. He knows so much about food that it's almost unsettling. Every point has a counterpoint, every solution a series of problems that come along with it. Bomford's lectures, though somewhat dense and a little bit too fast for me at times, are really excellent. The effort that was put into making this class really shows!!! We had trips to the farm (which were amazing!) guest speakers and dinners, and a really really well thought out reading list, and wonderful continuous blog discussions. While I sometimes felt that our discussions were a little weird or seemed to reach dead-ends, it was only because the material was so complex\/nuanced that it was difficult to talk about. This class really did change my life and I want to go on to work for a better, more just food system.",
    "To begin: Bomford is an incredible professor. A true treat who deeply respects both student input and the nuance involved in studying and working in food systems. Calls for greater complexity, rigor, and critical thinking at almost every corner of his educational process, and if he doesn't know something (which seems to be rare) knows what direction to point students towards. His presence and approach to teaching are certainly rare at a place like Yale. That said, at points, especially early on in the course, it felt as if the classroom discussion were a bit unorganized or were not guided by a culture of mutual respect or learning. Whether this is a fault of the students or the instructor is to be determined, but Mark's lecture's certainly could have used a bit more direction. It may be the case, however, that his teaching style is reflective of the complexity and subjectivity that guides how we interact with our food systems and how our food systems are structured. If this is the case, then it holds that Bomford's pedagogy seeks to reflect the confusion and general messiness of both democratic process, knowledge creation, and truth legitimization. Simply put: Mark knows what the fuck he is talking about, and realizes that food, as with most things, is deeply personal. He makes room for the personal and the experiential in the classroom setting, while also providing some literature that may (or may not) be useful in contextualizing how our own food narratives fit into larger systems of power and macro socio-political architectures. I would like to qualify, too, though, that I am student who is interested in food, in agriculture, in globalization (and its contents\/discontents), in poetry, in political processes, and in materiality. Mark's teaching styles (and perhaps subject matter) appeals to a certain kind of student, and may completely put off another kind. He doesn't allow for easy, totalizing answers. Rather, he calls for a myth of least harm. By far, this course was the most realistic, grounded, and honest course I have taken at Yale.",
    "Mark opened CSBK 320 with the statement that the class would depress us, and for me, he was right. The class explores everything that's wrong with what we usually think of as 'solutions' to the food crisis - organic food, local food, high-tech food, etc. The class includes a lot of really interesting readings, but I found that I learned the most from my peers during the in-class discussions. If you're interested in food and ag, this is a must-take.",
    "If you're interested in a critical approach to food systems, this is the course to take. I felt like I considered many new ideas in this course and was constantly challenging and reevaluating what my beliefs were. I really do think my biggest takeaway from the class is the need for more personal, critical reflection on one's motivations and convictions. This doesn't necessarily come from any of the particular \"approaches to sustainable food & agriculture\" that we discussed, but rather was something I felt was emergent from the course of the term. The course has really let me appreciate how food can serve as a vehicle for thinking about larger questions of how we assign value to things, make meaning from life. Note: while we discuss a fair amount of food policy, it's by no means the focus of the course. Questions you'll tackle are more like \"Is Wendell Berry's sense of local food exclusionary or not?\" than \"What standards should the federal government set for organic food labeling?\"",
    "This course is very hard to describe. If you are expecting to come out of this course with practical knowledge or any answers to these issues, you will be disappointed. This course shatters nearly every hope held by the sustainable food movement for solving issues related to the food system, and then leaves you with very little in terms of potential solutions. It was a very interesting course, and Mark is a great person to get to know (he knows everything about this stuff), but I'm hesitant to give a ringing endorsement for the course overall. Also, the grading is not easy. In fact, at times I thought it was a little unfair. The workload is manageable but certainly not light lots of reading, high standards for class participation both in seminar and on the blog, several 500-word blog posts, a presentation, and a final paper. Also, Mark expects all students to come in with a pretty high level of knowledge about this stuff already, so unless you're really into food issues, I would not recommend. Overall, I have mixed feelings about this course, and food is my main academic interest. If you're passionate and very knowledgeable about this stuff, I would take it."
