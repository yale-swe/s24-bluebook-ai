    "I recommend this class highly to anyone with interest in performing in musical theatre.",
    "This is basically a musical theater acting workshop, where every other week or so you get to get up and perform and then have Annette and the rest of the class critique you for a while; then you get to try part or all of the song over several times to try to add in the advice that others gave you. Annette was extremely helpful in picking out our bad habits and issues as actors and giving us constructive ways to improve. I definitely felt as though there were bad natural tendencies that I had that she made me aware of and helped me begin to eliminate. I just wish that we would have always been able to sing through the whole song a second time every time we performed--sometimes we got critiqued and then started from the beginning again and thenworked on certain parts of the song over and over again until it worked, and then the next person went up and we never got the chance to try the whole song again to see if we could make it work the whole way through. It was essentially a class that gave you a solid foundation to work off of for each song, but you'd have to then continue practicing on your own to keep improving each individual song. The dynamic of the class probably depends a good deal on the people in it; this semester we really gelled as a group and Annette said that we were probably the most ensemble-y group she's had, which was really nice because the class felt a lot more friendly. But I would certainly recommend this class to anyone who wants the chance to get up there and sing whatever they want for a supportive group of people and improve their musical theater abilities.",
    "this is the best class i took all semester. if you love musical theater or want to learn more about it, then i definitely recommend your taking it. however, its a different teacher each semester. ive only taken the course with annette jolles who is super scary at first but is a great director.there isnt a lot of work for this class, except to prepare songs. if you arent singing a particular week, you dont have to do anything. but the readings are really interesting.it just sucks that it meets for 3 hours.",
    "This is a great class for performers if you can handle 3 hours on a Friday afternoon. But I took it as a director, and I don't know that I'd necessarily recommend it. It's fun and fairly easy, a good 5th credit. But I don't feel like I learned a lot about how to direct a real show -- just directing out-of-context scenes and songs. That said, Annette (or probably whoever is teaching it) can teach you a lot about the business, which is good to know.",
    "A great class in which you get the chance to work on performance and song\/scene analysis. Great beginning look into Musical Theater acting.",
    "My favorite class so far at Yale. Lots of hands-on, in-class work as well as easy and enjoyable reading outside. Every other week is a performance; what else could anyone ask for?",
    "It is a great excuse to perform on a weekly basis. Peer review is one of the best ways to improve in this area and this class gives a great deal of peer review. If you have space for the class and are interested in performing take it."
