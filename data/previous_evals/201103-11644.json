   "comments": [
    "Take this course if you really are interested in German. If not, then keeping up with the work will be all the more difficult. If you want an easy A, take czech or indonesian.",
    "Yes! New languages are fun!",
    "This is a GREAT language program! Nadine isn't teaching again, so you'll be missing out, but I've heard all the other instructors are great, too. The class starts out relatively fast, but as the semester progresses, it slows down. If you're trying to figure out which new language to take, I have no reservations in recommending German.",
    "Nadine Schwakopf is God's gift to the world. If you can take it with her, there is no reason to pass up the opportunity. She was the highlight of my educational experience at Yale so far. Everyone in our section thinks she is the best person to ever walk to the earth, but that's only because she is. I got really sick for a week or so during the middle of the semester. Not only did she excuse me from all work and the test that week, but she checked in on me on a regular basis to make sure I was okay. I can't think of many Yalies in other German sections or language programs overall who have had a similar experience. I looked forward to class every day. Everyone in my section did.",
    "German is a tough language to learn -- don't let anyone tell you otherwise. It will require patience and dedication to get the top mark, and there are a lot of tricky rules and grammatical exceptions that can trip you up on exams. However, the department and instructors are incredibly reasonable with their expectations, and they absolutely look to make the experience as enjoyable for students as possible. I also appreciated the cultural and historical materials presented, as theydon't fall into the awful \"fake\" stuff one often finds in other language offerings. On the whole, a good language to study at Yale."
