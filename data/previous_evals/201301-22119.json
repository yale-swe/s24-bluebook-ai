   "comments": [
    "This was a very interesting class, but it is a lot of work and is fairly rigorous. As a result, I would recommend it to engineering and APHY majors only.",
    "It's a decent class. The material at the beginning is very easy and Devoret went a little slow for my taste. However, towards the end of the class, the material became very difficult very quickly. The final project is very fun, and the demos are enjoyable.",
    "Yes, I would recommend. Don't know what the PHYS department counterpart is like, but APHY 322 is a solid course. Not terribly difficult midterm, problem sets will require a bit of work, and final presentations rather than exam.",
    "You are most likely choosing between PHYS 430 and APHY 322.APHY 322 covers more practical applications and you get to learn about how cables and transmission lines work. The class is also smaller (7 people - mostly ABET electrical engineers and Applied Physics majors) and I loved it because you could stop the professor and clarify points in a way you couldn't back in the days of PHYS 200\/201 or PHYS 260\/261. The smaller class also promotes a lot more collaboration. There was a midterm which was fair and also a final project. I built a 180 degree hybrid from scratch with the TA (It combines and reverses microwave signals) and presented how it works for the final project which was a lot of fun and a great way to put theory to practice.I highly suggest you look at PHYS 430 and APHY 322 and just pick the one you feel good about. Both class teach off of the Griffiths textbook. I had Prof. Devoret and I've never met a professor more willing to help undergraduates than him before during my time at Yale. He was so helpful and willing tomeet outside of office hours (even on Friday night when the PSET was due) and I learnt so much from him this way!"
