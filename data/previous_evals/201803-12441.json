   "comments": [
    "I learned about the challenges and tensions inherent to journalism (in history and today), about civic responsibility and what upholds liberal-democratic public spheres, and about trends today. This class is advertised as much as a class on J, L, and D as it is about citizenship in general. He illustrates the sort of civic responsibility that people should take on as citizens, as business owners, as journalists, etc.",
    "This class does not teach you how to be a journalist. It's mainly about how the intersection of a wide array of disciplines, including political theory, social science, economics, and a little bit of history can deepen our understanding of current issues in civil society. We address issues of democratic deliberation, nationalism, globalism, the digitalization and capitalization of media, and how journalism fits into each of these themes.",
    "This course gives you a broad survey of the challenges facing our democracy today. From declining news institutions to social media bubbles, this class discusses issues crucial to the future of journalism and our nation.",
    "You read interesting texts in this class.",
    "This course teaches students about the civic values and about why journalism is an essential institution for democracies. The course starts with rigorous philosophical foundations on which to build the arguments explored over the course of the semester. Taking the class was a fascinating ride and offered deeply valuable insights into what nations are, what forces corrupt democratic practices, and a framework for how to think about the future of American journalism.",
    "Prof Sleeper frames this class as a citizenship course, and you'll learn to interrogate the foundations of democracy and the importance of journalism to the pursuit of this ideal,. The readings for this class were excellent, and they help clarify the critical affinity that democracy as a political ideology has with journalism. You'll learn to synthesize the insights provided by readings from different genres and perspectives, and form your own vision and perspective for the role of journalism to our democracy today."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Professor Sleeper provides a terrific reading list and he is always up for back and forth via email and in class. Make the most of it! He has read and thought carefully about everything he teaches.",
    "The reading list for this course is very strong and includes a lot of ideas that are applicable\/important in other subjects. The topics we discuss in the seminar feel very relevant to current events, and the contributions of your classmates are interesting and insightful. Professor Sleeper is also a huge asset. Sometimes discussion could get a little lecture-y, but Professor Sleeper's dedication and commitment to his students always encouraged people to be invested.",
    "This class had a very tight-knit seminar structure which I really appreciated. The readings and following discussions every class were incredibly interesting, making this course my favorite I've taken at Yale so far. Prof. Sleeper is extremely well versed and experienced in the field of journalism and ethics, and I would recommend this course to anyone who's interested in delving into what's plaguing our modern liberal democracy. The guest lecturers are also very interesting. In terms of improvement, I have very little. One suggestion could be bringing in a person of color, woman, or both for a guest lecture. Also, the final exam (a triple in-class essay in three hours) was very intense. This isn't a con necessarily (because it's the most effective way of testing our synthetic understanding of the several writers\/thinkers\/topics, and the pride you feel post-completion is unparalleled!), but rather just something to keep in mind for those who are interested in what the final exam might look like.",
    "The readings are interesting. The seminars themselves, however, are 2-hour monologues from the professor. These monologues rarely are grounded in the readings but are about the professor's perceived importance of the class. There are no opportunities to discuss the readings with other seminar members.",
    "The strengths are that the readings are insightful and offer great background and insights into the practice of journalism. The weakness is that the quality of class discussions may vary, and Prof Sleeper may end up taking some portion of the discussion time elaborating on (and repeating on occasion) his view on how to safeguard democracy and the public sphere."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "I would absolutely recommend it. It doesn't teach journalism (though you do learn about journalism from someone with experience in the field). It teaches you about politics in general and about self-sacrifice. It teaches you about trends and what it takes to uphold democracy.",
    "I recommend this class if you're looking to get a broad understanding of some modern challenges confronting Western society in an intimate seminar setting. We don't delve too deep into any single author, and the reading doesn't take too long. We do survey the ideas of a number of influential modern theorists and authors like Lippmann, Dewey, Soros, Wiebe, Chanda, Huntington, Benhabib, etc., and I found each week's readings quite interesting. I've also never had a professor as dedicated to his students as Prof. Sleeper. He has his opinions, and sometimes he dominates discussion a little bit too much, but he's also very much interested in his students' own ideas about all these issues. A very caring and energetic guy.",
    "I got a lot out of this course and it was my favorite class this semester! Professor Sleeper is remarkably dedicated to his students and I always enjoyed class discussion. There is a lot to get out of the material we discussed and I find myself talking about topics from JLD frequently.",
    "Yes. It opened a whole new world of inquiry for me, and was the most worthwhile course I've taken at Yale. I also think the combination of students in my class was excellent.",
    "If you are interested in journalism and want a low-workload course with some interesting readings, consider taking this course. But know that you will rarely have opportunities to discuss those readings. The seminars are 2-hour monologues from the professor. These monologues rarely are grounded in the readings but are about how important the professor thinks this course is.",
    "Yes, I definitely recommend this class to other students. Taking the class was a fascinating ride and offered deeply valuable insights into what nations are, what forces corrupt democratic practices, and a framework for how to think about the future of American journalism.",
    "Take this course if you'd like to explore democracy from the level of civil engagement and the public sphere. You'll learn how journalism presents political and philosophical problems to the pursuit of a democracy, and figure out why exactly journalism today has degenerated into a destabilizing force in the public sphere, and what a possible solution may look like. More importantly, you'll learn to consider your personal role in a democracy, as well as a macro perspective of how liberal-democratic states should ideally function, and why they fail to do so."
