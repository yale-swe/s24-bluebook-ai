   "comments": [
    "It's a good course for those who are interested in improving their Chinese, who are able to self-study, who like Su Wei and his stories' contents. It is not a must take by any means, though.",
    "This is a good class for building up your Chinese vocabulary. Unlike the Chinese 162 class offered in the fall, the vocab and lessons in 163 all deal with very serious topics like China's economy and environmental issues. This class focuses heavily on improving reading skills but won't do much for your speaking or writing skills.",
    "It's a panoramic view of big issues facing the modern Chinese society. This view shows the issue's history, its progress, and its current state. Highly recommended."
