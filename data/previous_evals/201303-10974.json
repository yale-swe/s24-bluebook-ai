   "comments": [
    "Yes worth the skill sets",
    "I would not recommend it because there are better things you could do with a Yale credit and the course material can be learned out of the textbook. If you think taking the class will motivate you to actually learn the dry material, it won't.",
    "Material is not the most exciting, but still an important topic",
    "It's important to understand the basics (statements, transaction analysis, etc) if you want go into finance but if you don't have an interest in finance absolutely do not take it",
    "Important to know",
    "Take it if you want to go into any business related field. One of the most practical classes you will take at Yale and accounting is a very important skill to have. Not too hard if you understand and follow the main concepts. Only spent 2 hours\/week on the class.",
    "Be prepared to teach yourself the class. You can put in a minimal amount of effort and get away with it or put in an average amount of effort and be able to get a good grade.",
    "It's a crucial course for anyone going into any field \/ life in general - take it even if you take it Credit D",
    "The class provides a basic overview of accounting. The textbook is great and the online system provides many opportunities for practice. There are weekly cases and multiple choice questions. There is one midterm exam and a final exam. I would recommend this course as long as the professor can commit to holding class. The fact that he cancelled seven classes during the semester negatively impacted the learning experience.",
    "Yes. It gives a great basic understanding of accounting.",
    "I would NOT take this class. This has by far been my worst experience at Yale. First, the lectures are extremely boring as the professor shows little enthusiasm for the subject (plus they are mandatory attendance). Secondly, the class requires you to do homework exercises before the material is taught in class, so you have to teach yourself the material. Between the poor teaching and the homework exercises, you end up having to teach yourself all of the material. So, I recommend just learning the material on your own. Buy the textbook, set aside some time, and go through it; accounting is pretty straightforward and the textbook does a good job at explaining things.Odds are most of you are considering taking this class to prepare for job interviews\/ future jobs. I definitely agree that it is crucial to understand accounting for most jobs in the business world. However, since you are going to have to teach yourself this material anyway, you mind as well take another class. There are so many other incredible classes at Yale and you have a limited time here - DON'T WASTE A CREDIT TAKING THIS CLASS.",
    "Eh, probably not. It's just not worth it. You won't learn too much because schiffres will probably never be there.",
    "The sad thing is, people don't take this class because it's one of those treasures at Yale - they take it because it will help them get a job. So any interested students should come prepared with that mentality. I would try searching at SOM to see if you can get a comparable course instead.Professor Schiffres is not the best professor. It is not that is not knowledgeable of the field, but that I think he didn't put very much effort and time into the class. All of his lectures come STRAIGHT from the textbook author - he didn't even bother updating the typos, college name, or years. If he wants to be a good professor, he has to try.Also, to get into the class, you have to sign up right as sections open - spots filled up in the first 30 seconds this year - they fill up faster than Beyonce and T-Swift concert tickets - no joke. Use some kind of exact atomic clock with a second hand - one mistake and it will cost you.This class is pretty simply structured - midterm, final exams; weekly chapter questions from the book, and an online module - so if you work diligently you will do well in the class. Treat like you would a high school class.",
    "Eh. The textbook is good so you should take it if you want to say you've taken it in finance intervews, and you can learn useful, practical material from the textbook. Just not so much form the teacher\/class itself.",
    "Yes and no. Some good information to learn for real world purposes, but it is not presented well at all.",
    "I'd recommend it for anyone who wants to learn practical real world knowledge about financial statements and reporting financials. It's not too difficult if you keep up and you learn a lot.",
    "Very relevant course. Valuable information. Could be more interactive. Slightly boring.",
    "Obviously, this class looks good on your transcript if you're trying to get an accounting or finance job, so do it for that reason. But don't do it because you want to learn more about accounting for the sake of accounting. Take a week out of your summer and cover the material on your own. You will encounter more, retain more, and sustain a better attitude towards the discipline of accounting than if you took Schiffres's class. It's not worth your time or energy. It's only worth it if you need the title of accounting on your transcript.",
    "In this course you learn everything entirely from the textbook. It is all very straightforward though you do cover quite a bit of material.",
    "The course is easy and does not require regular work. I would recommend it as a fifth credit to someone interested in banking or consulting. The first half of the course can be useful for interviews, the second half is too technical to be useful to anyone who is not planning to be an accountant.",
    "You know the drill. Take this if you need to learn this stuff. Not too much work. Don't underestimate the difficulty of the final, though.",
    "Important and useful information if you intend on doing anything in finance or business. Lectures can be dry, but if you read the textbook and understand the concepts on the practice exams, you will be fine.",
    "This course taught horribly, though the material is quite important. The professor was very ill during the semester and canceled many of the lectures. When he was in class, he read off power point slides verbatim. Nothing new was imparted during the 9am lecture, though it was mandatory to attend. This course really needs a new professor ASAP!",
    "Dry, but practical.",
    "This is far and away the worst course I have ever taken - not simply at Yale, but at any level of my education. Presentations were copied from a professor at Ithaca College. Homework exercises were not marked. Exams were simplified multiple-choice nonsense, with the result that the whole class scored ridiculously highly, making the curve a product of chance rather than competence.I am aware that the professor was unwell for much of the term. However, Yale's reaction to this was unacceptable - several weeks of classes were cancelled, and no replacement was brought in even though it was very clearly necessary. Considering the cost of tuition at this university, students have a right to feel short-changed. I would have franky learned far more accounting through buying a good textbook and reading it.Perhaps the worst aspect of this charade is that there is an excellent accounting professor at the School of Management, who was keen to teach undergraduates and had some places in his class; of course, the administration - as ever addicted to their romanticized vision of Yale's 'liberal arts education' - prevented this from taking place. In doing so they forced students to take this third-rate course for no reason whatsoever. Let's stop pretending that these people care about education when it's clear that they put bureaucracy, not students, first.",
    "I would! its a great life skills class if you can get up at 9am",
    "I learned everything needed for this class from reading the textbook. The professor is a nice guy, but he cancelled class half of the time due to health reasons. Also, the lectures are extremely boring as he reads off the power point presentation written by and for Ithaca College. The professor clearly takes very few thoughts into preparing for this course. It should be taught by someone else in the future.",
    "This class wasn't bad at all. It is accounting so is not the most enjoyable class you will take at Yale but gives you the foundations and is not much work at all."
