    "Would recommend anyone interested in starting a new language at Yale. This class is 1.5 credits, and the workload reflects this. Expect 20-60min of assigned homework each night. Additionally, spreading out vocabulary practice into small chunks is the best way to prepare for the tests. It's a lot of material to get a handle over, and practicing is the only way to get it down. Take advantage of the student language tutors that are available, it's a great way to work on actually speaking Spanish, which is important. Professor Sab is excellent and will not let you fall behind. Definitely take it with her!",
    "I would highly recommend this course.",
    "You get what you come for with Spanish L1. It's an elementary language course that meets everyday. Though there is nightly homework, it's usually easy and not very time intensive, and it's a nice break from the other homework you might typically get. If you take this course, I highly recommend taking it with Lourdes Sabe! She's enthusiastic, organized, and explains the materially clearly and thoroughly.",
    "Lot of busy work but fun too. You get close with the other kids in the class",
    "Very good introductory language course",
    "Would Recommend if you want to get a basic understanding of Spanish. I learned so much more than I anticipated this semester."
