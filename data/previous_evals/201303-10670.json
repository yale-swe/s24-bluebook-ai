   "comments": [
    "Take it if you're interested in the study of aid! The course is very comprehensive and interesting, and the workload is very manageable.",
    "This was a class of epiphanies. I had several and they happened during class discussions.It was good, it means the class made me relate the material taught and discussed with my life goals (or what I thought were my life goals).",
    "Generally interesting if you want to know more about development aid and how it's conducted. The course doesn't really dig into the details, but remains at a macro level. It's sort of a survey course on how the US conducts aid.",
    "Great overview of current issues in international development.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to those who want to better understand the different aspects of development assistance. The readings were very interesting and film screening at the end was a great way to conclude the course. The workload is very manageable and Professor Simon is great.",
    "Definitely take this class. It is not too much work and yet you leave the class knowing so much more than you did before the semester.",
    "lots of books and articles about foreign aid. nothing that revolutionary.",
    "Great seminar, I learned a lot about development assistance.",
    "A great look at foreign aid as a system. While you will not necessarily get deep into the specifics of, say, conditional cash transfers, you will learn a lot about the different actors, motives, and theories behind aid. Definitely recommend it if you are interested in the field academically or professionally!",
    "I would recommend taking this course even if you have never bothered to learn much about the politics of development aid. There is a low prior knowledge threshold, and even if you feel lost at the beginning it's very easy to do a little background research and get a good idea of what's going on. Some students come in with heavy-hitting backgrounds and have strong opinions from day one, but the atmosphere is encouraging for everyone to pitch in. The assignments are not too bad and are good ways of synthesizing what's been covered in class, and I actually had fun writing the essays.",
    "Yes, you should take this class. It's a great overview of the topic and covers a lot of ground. Professor Simon is great, the workload is manageable and the readings are generally very good.",
    "I would absolutely recommend taking this class. Professor Simon is the best and I really learned so much about aid and its implications. The workload of three papers is not bad at all, and Swiller's \"The Unheard\" is a great book (and also one on which you write a paper). I looked forward to this class every week, take it.",
    "I would highly recommend this class to anyone who wants to know more about International Development Aid. While the discussion is broad, it does help provide a great overview of the aid apparatus. You also have a chance to participate in great discussion in class, and writes your own research paper for the final project."
