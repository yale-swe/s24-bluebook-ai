    "Every week you have a new assignment with a set of guidelines and suggestions, and you bring in a 3-4 minute theater piece with the goal of making it as as incredible and powerful as possible with the limited resources you have. The whole class goes weekly and then we all discuss each other's work. You learn as much, if not more, from each other as you do from your own work.I would recommend this course to any student, theater or not. I think it is ESSENTIAL for any actor, director, designer, or writer to expand their creative abilities. No class at Yale will push them to grow like this.",
    "YES. Take it. A must take class at Yale. I'm probably going to leave this place happier that I took this class than any other. I could gush on for pages but I'll keep it short. Basically if you're considering it you should already be doing it.",
    "Only take this class if you are willing to put the time and work into it. It is an incredible course, but you're creating a new piece every week, and by the end of the semester you feel drained. There is no rest for this course.But yes, do take it! You learn so much about yourself as a creator, and it expands the horizons of theater-making.",
    "Take this class if any of the following apply to you:you want to make art, at all, in general;you want to make theater professionally;you haven't yet decided ifyou want to make a life in the theater, but you need creative outlets, or you need more creative outlets;you crave artistic challenges;you want a new perspective on performance---experimental, professional, or otherwise;you are thinking about it, but are hesitating because of practical concerns---time, actors, weekly assignments, etc.The practical challenge of the class will become the clockwork of your weekly schedule (some students spend an hour in rehearsal, others arrange 4 hours of rehearsal: it can be good to try a whole range of rehearsal\/direction habits over the course of the semester). Work with friends from different backgrounds and share resources with classmates; we had a pretty solid system of communication about what we needed from each other in terms of props, technical elements, and performers.I recommend approaching the class as a work-out regimen: you have to make a piece every week, whether or not inspiration strikes, it is simply a way to keep in shape and, hopefully, get more flexible in the way you think about and make theater. Prof. Woodruff has incredible perspective, humor, insight, and interest in students' work.",
    "Since this class meets only once a week, it's easy to let the assignments sneak up on you; don't do that. This class requires the creation of a roughly 4-minute-long piece every week, and Woodruff can be intimidating. At the end of the day, take this class for the practice, but know what you're getting into.",
    "Pretty exhausting, often terrifying, and positively one of the most useful classes any Theater major can take. Woodruff is a genius and shocking encouraging amidst his vibe of unceasing cool. I will undoubtedly make better art after taking this class, as will basically everyone I studied with in Composition. This should actually be a required class for all TS majors, and maybe all visual artists. Don't doubt yourself - take this class, especially as a junior or senior.Woodruff is astounding and totally unlike any other professor in the department. It's a blessing and a gift that he continues to teach and advise undergraduates. No excuses, no BS - make good art that matters to you."
