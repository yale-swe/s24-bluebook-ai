   "comments": [
    "a lot of work; yes if they want to learn the language, but it's pretty intensive",
    "It's hard, but worth it.",
    "I would definitely recommend it. I would tell a prospective student to be prepared for the amount of work and commitment necessary but learning Chinese, and learning it in this manner, is definitely effective.",
    "If you've already take 110 then you should probably take this one too, otherwise your credit x 1.5 from the first semester won't count.This course is wonderful. Enjoy the escapedes of Wang Peng and Li You! And also the more subtle one of Gao Wen Zhong and Bai Ying Ai!",
    "This is a great course. The instructors are friendly, helpful, and always will acknowledge you outside of class. Though the course is a lot of work, it definitely is worth it, considering how much you learn.",
    "If you took L1 and liked it, it's the same and you go fast and learn lots and yay!",
    "Chinese 120 is a course that requires lots of outside studying and practice, but it is definitely easily manageable if you put in the time. Studying and preparing every day isn't that hard to do. I'd definitely recommend it. The instructors teach the course incredibly well.",
    "A continuation of L1, obviously harder, but equally as structured. You have to take it, but at least you know it'll be pretty much exactly like L1, except before tests you have a review day which is nice and relaxing.",
    "I highly recommend CHNS 120. If you took CHNS 110, you know it's a lot of work, but the professors are great. Second semester is a lot like first semester, but really manageable.",
    "\u8981\u662f\u4f60\u89c9\u5f97\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b66\u671f\u7684\u4e2d\u6587\u597d\uff0c\u4f60\u5f53\u7136\u5f97\u53bb\u7b2c\u4e8c\u4e2a\u5b66\u671f\uff01",
    "Chinese 120 is a continuation of the well-designed program in Chinese 110. While the class requires discipline to do well, it is fun and effective (even if repetitive at times).",
    "CHNS 120 is a very rewarding course however be prepared for the workload. If you went through CHNS 110 you know what to expect, the class is in a similar format. However if you didn't like CHNS 110 then it will just get worse with CHNS 120.Also be prepared to go abroad for a summer or term and to continue learning. L2 Chinese really doesn't give you enough skill to honestly be able to communicate effectively due to the complexity of the language.",
    "Fantastic course! You have to work really hard but you get so much out of it. The Teachers are fantastic and very dedicated.",
    "Yes I would recommend this course if you are prepared for the work load",
    "More of what you see in 110...more lessons, more vocab, more chinese. Excellent teaching, very organized, and interesting. As long as you do what your professors tell you to do, you're likely to do well. Chinese at Yale is awesome!",
    "If you're reading this, you've probably already taken L1. If you loved L1, then know that L2 is like twice as good. The workload is also more manageable.",
    "A comprehensive L2 Chinese course.",
    "I would totally recommend this because it's such a good cornerstone in your Chinese study and may ignite your interest in Chinese history and culture. The workload is not that bad and you learn a lot after just one year.",
    "Just a continuation of the awesomeness that is Elementary Chinese at Yale. You should have absolutely no hesitation in taking this course if you took Chinese last semester. The teachers are amazing, the TA's are perfect and the work, though difficult, is engaging and interesting.",
    "Fantastic course! Definitely recommend L1\/L2 Chinese here at Yale.",
    "It is very difficult, but very rewarding. It is harder than L1 and takes some getting used to.",
    "Good if you want to actually learn a language. Not good if you're not willing to put in the work.",
    "Chinese 120 is the continuation of Chinese in the Fall. If you have taken Chinese before you know that it is a hard language to begin with. Chinese 110 prepares you for the hard and constant work that Chinese 120 has. It definitely got easier at Chinese 120 since by then we knew the basic rules and vocabulary. If you want to learn an awesome language and culture and you are up for a slight challenge, I totally recommend you take Chinese 120!",
    "It's a lot of work but if you love learning the language you'll have fun.",
    "I would recommend Chinese 120 to another student, but warn them to stay on top of their work and that Chinese is a large time commitment",
    "A great class--second semester is much harder, but still fun!",
    "Yes I would if they're interested in learning an East Asian language.",
    "This is one of the best classes you can take at Yale. It will be a ton of work, but I think this is probably one of the best Chinese programs anywhere.",
    "Overall a great class! You're probably here if you've already taken 110... The classes are very similar, with the one exception being that the teachers have a general day of review before each exam second semester. Other than that the class format is the same, and you learn a whole lot of interesting grammar and vocabulary second semester. Take this class!",
    "Chinese 120 is a great introduction to Chinese. Youhave to take Chinese if you want to be a globally participating citizen of the 21st citizen, and well, if you want to be successful at all. It is definitely the course to be in and will help you make very basic conversations with Chinese people. The amount of information we cover in the introduction course is expansive, from directions to introductions to shopping to ordering food to even dating. It is a terrific course, perfect curriculum, with amazing professors.DONT MISS OUT ON YOUR ONLY OPPORTUNITY TO LEARN CHINESE IN YOUR LIFE!!!",
    "Your grade in this class directly reflects the work you put into it. The work assigned every night varies - translations tend to take the most time. I spent anywhere from half an hour to two hours each night doing the homework and studying for the next day's quiz. Keep in mind that I did not have music, Facebook or Gmail on as I did them.Quizzes and homework are 10% and 20% of your grade, respectively, so doing badly on a couple of them will likely not affect your final grade, considering that you get them daily. Likewise, there are 5 tests over the course of the semester, each one 5% of your grade. If you do badly on one, it's not the end of the world. The final is 15% of your grade, which is a relief, unlike other classes where the final is the determining factor in your grade. The final is essentially twice the length of a in-class test so you have plenty of time to finish and if you've been doing well on the regular tests, this final shouldn't be too stress-inducing.Each class has about ten people and, although it depends a lot on which students you end up with, you become very close with your fellow students. In fact, most of my Chinese classmates from last and this semester will be in Beijing this summer on the Light Fellowship and to say we're excited to take on China together is an understatement.The downside to small classes is that truancy is obvious, obviously. It is not in your best interest to skip any classes. If you really have to, email the teachers beforehand. They are very understanding and you may be able to work something out as opposed to if you straight up skip.",
    "Chinese is challenging, but the program is outstanding, which is a testament to the quality of the teachers and its overall structure. The difficulty and workload increases (as it is a daily language course - so this is to be expected) for L2 Chinese, but it is well worth sticking with it. If you took L1, you should definitely stick with it. You know what you are getting into.",
    "Overall one of the best language programs at Yale. There is daily homework and a quiz every class, but this only encourages you to stay on top of your work, which is really manageable if you don't fall behind. The tests won't be at all difficult if you review material often",
    "I would highly recommend Chinese to anyone interested in taking a new foreign language at Yale, because it has been extremely well taught for the most part and I've learned an unbelievable amount just this semester. The teachers are incredibly nice, the grading is fairly forgiving, and most assignments are pretty useful, with the exception of online true\/false quizzes. It's very difficult starting out, but it gets easier to memorize characters and the language begins to feel much more natural as time goes on. Having a good class makes all the difference, so during shopping period, try to find a section with kids you know actually enjoy it. They sometimes shift around sections to balance things out anyway, but it's worth a try to get into the one you want. I don't regret taking Chinese a bit, and I can't wait to continue my study of the language in China this summer.",
    "CHNS 120 is a continuation of CHNS 110 with the same lovable teachers. You go through Part 2 of the textbook from CHNS 110, and the structure is very similar to CHNS 110. The Chinese program here at Yale is just generally very strong. Even though I had studied French for four years, I believe my ability to speak Chinese right now is better than my ability to speak French. The class can get tedious with the daily homework assignments and having to study for the daily quizzes, but at the same time, it's the daily studying that brings you to fluency.",
    "Chinese L2 became a lot more rigorous than L1 was because it was hard from the very first week, whereas L1 only got difficult around the middle of the semester. You need to keep on top of your homework and character-learning in order to have success in the class. But as long as you work hard, you can do well and the teachers are great. It's the one class of the day I am always awake and attentive in. But, like I said, it's a lot of work every night and don't just try to cram and memorize character strokes the night before each exam because you'll never retain them, that was my biggest mistake that I sometimes made.",
    "Chinese 120 is rigorous. That cannot be denied. However, the correlation between the amount of work that one puts into the class and the grade is very clearly direct. The knowledge of Chinese that will be gained after completing this course is incredible, and if anything, the course is a great lesson in self-discipline.",
    "If you did L1, you might as well do L2. With that said, it's definitely a great course to take. The teachers and system are the same, so it seems a bit easier after you're used to having it in your life for a semester. You learn a whole lot of Chinese; after L2, it seems like many basic conversations are automatic. Definitely take it -- it might feel grueling in the process, but it's worth it for sure.",
    "Glad I stuck with Chinese second semester! By the end of the semester, you get really close with the teachers and your classmates. It's a lot of hard work, but definitely worth it.",
    "You need to work hard everyday! Yes, I'd recommend the class!",
    "It's great. If you took 110, there's no reason not to continue.",
    "Interested in doing a lot of work, but learning a lot of Chinese? Well, this class is for you.",
    "Chinese 120 is very helpful if one is trying to become proficient in Chinese. The teaching staff are very approachable and helpful and there is a lot of support for this class. The material is useful in that it is things that one would want to know so that they could be functional in a place where Chinese is spoken. For this I would recommend the class.",
    "Continuation of Chinese 110 -- exactly what you expect.",
    "It is brilliantly taught, but it is not easy. If you want to learn Chinese because you expect it to be useful, Yale is one of the best places to do so. If you just want to fulfill the language requirement, do not choose Chinese. It has about 2 hours of homework a night.If you take it, I'd recommend using the language table, using office hours if you are feeling behind, and finding out which of your friends speak Chinese so that, if they are willing, you can practice with them. (There are a surprisingly large number of Yale students who speak Chinese.)",
    "If you are considering Chinese 120, it means that you probably took Chinese 110. I strongly advise to take this class. First, you wont get credit if you decide not to. Second, the class is super fun! Professors are amazing. TAKE IT, TAKE IT, TAKE IT!",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in learning the language. I would warn that it requires a lot of effort, dedication, and time. The constancy of the practice is heavily enforced, but it is important and effective for true learning of the language.",
    "Since Chinese 120 is a continuation of Chinese 110, you're probably going to have to take it. Luckily it is a good class that is taught well. Just be careful not to get behind and study for the daily quizzes. Also plan to spend every night before tests memorizing characters...and then forgetting them right after the test.",
    "I would definitely recommend Chinese to another student. I have learned an incredible amount of Chinese in only one year, and languages do not come easily to me. While I have struggled grades-wise (this is not a language for somebody who just wants to fulfill the requirement, take it only if you really want to learn it), I still feel like I know a substantial amount of Chinese."
