   "comments": [
    "I think one strength of the course was the films themselves, which were all very different and also dealt with different issues. I think this led to many varied discussions, which were all quite interesting. However, I think it would have been nice to get background readings on these more general problems of guilt, memory, ...etc at the beginning of the course. That way we would have had a greater knowledge of the underlying topics before we got into discussions about them. Most of these readings were posted at the end of the course, so they were useful for papers but unfortunately too late for discussion. The reading responses every week were a bit tedious at times, but they did make sure you were up on the reading. They also provided lots of opportunity for feedback, which was nice. I liked having the responses and only two papers.",
    "Extremely engaging course with a clear objective and course plan. Could be improved with more student-led discussions, though there was a great improvement in this aspect towards the end of the semester.",
    "The class is super small, which is both a strength in that I got to know everyone really well and when conversation was flowing it was amazing and a weakness in that when certain scenes or topics weren't immediately interesting to anyone the room could be a tad quiet. That being said, by the end of the semester that didn't really happen.",
    "I think perhaps the course could have been a little bit better organized. It felt like there were a lot of small deadlines that were hard to keep up with. It also had a very heavy workload- the films were very long and the expectations for the weekly response were high, in addition to a huge amount of reading that we very rarely ended up discussing in class. I felt like it might have been a stronger class if we had each chosen 5 films to write a response to, and if we had been assigned fewer readings each week so that we could have used them more in our discussions."

    "This course was amazing and completely unique. Our class sessions were engaging, fun, and student-led. With a really small class where everyone, including Professor Hagens, was extremely engaged in the project of the course, it was a perfect seminar experience. It's hard to imagine we could have gotten as much done with more people. The structure of the course helped to facilitate a great conversation over the course of the semester about moral and filmic issues. The weekly responses especially are a really good tool. Professor Hagens is amazing, and he put in a ton of work to make the course work as well as it does and feel like a collaborative experience. Also, the films are incredible, and I would never have seen almost any of them if it hadnt been for this course. I recommend this course wholeheartedly.",
    "Great course, would definitely recommend if you are at all interested in the issues of guilt, memory, and depicting extreme horrors in general. Professor Hagens is very open to feedback and a really nice guy. He definitely wants to see his students do well, which is very refreshing. He even asks to meet all his students just to have an introductory chat and get to know each other. Throughout the course, you watch 13 very different films that deal with a range of different topics that plague postwar Germany. And don't worry; I knew almost nothing of Germany or German before I came in, and I still became quite interested in the topic. Workload is more than you might expect from the initial syllabus-- but fair. The reading responses every week were a bit tedious at times, but they did make sure you were up on the reading. They also provided lots of opportunity for feedback, which was nice. I liked having the responses and only two papers. Take this course if you want to explore an extremely difficult problem of guilt and memory through some great films (and some weird ones). Just a warning, some of the films are very, very strange and others are very, very tough to watch. But it is well worth exploring them and taking the course.",
    "Yes!",
    "Yea, definitely take it if you're interested in German history or film or even literature. It was a super super interesting class. The professor is German which adds another element to the discussion that was invaluable. Since the class was pretty small I got to know my classmates pretty well which made conversation flow really nicely. Don't worry if you don't have any film experience, you don't need it. I felt like my literature\/English background was perfectly suited for the class. The workload isn't much. You have to watch a movie every week. Sometimes the movies are long and mad boring but those are the minority not the majority. You can watch the films during the designated time or, thank god, you can watch them on your own time in the film studies center. This was a #blessing on Monday nights when I really just wanted to do anything but watch a 2 1\/2 hour film in German. Each week you have a page long film response which isn't too bad either. It's even double spaced. There's a midterm and final paper but they can be on any movie we watched the whole semester so it doesn't feel suffocating. You can literally just avoid talking about the movies you hated. Lastly, there are weekly readings but if you just skim the boring ones and read the interesting ones, it'll be all good in lecture. The rest of the class did the exact same thing and the conversation always turns to the least boring reading and pretty much stays there. So yea, pretty good class. 9\/10 would recommend."
