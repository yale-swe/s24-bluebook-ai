   "comments": [
    "I would 100% recommend this class to any fellow students, no matter their background discipline. I found it incredibly useful in helping the development of my own opinions and understandings around such an important and complex range of topics. The class was well run, with a wonderful group of students taking part, and never failed to ignite fiery and fruitful debate.",
    "A worthwhile class, though you have to be prepared for a lot of reading and writing.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. It's a great course for stimulating critical thinking skills and understanding how different issues intersect. Even if none of the topics -health, gender\/sexuality, or human rights- are your specific focus of interest, this is a course that will show you how interrelated everything is and how important it is to think outside of your own particular focus."

   "question_text": "How did this course deepen your knowledge of your discipline\/profession? To what extent did this course contribute to your dissertation\/research?",
   "comments": [
    "Lying largely outside of my MA requirements, the course was much more useful for me in looking to the future and to a career path beyond my time at Yale next year. The balance between studying academic texts and advocacy cases made it a good course in thinking about the links between studying\/research and real work action that I hope to delve into next year.",
    "This course was technically outside of my official 'discipline' but throughout the course, and particularly with the final paper, I was able to explore the intersections of the course topics with my disciplinary interests. This course was invaluable to my understanding of my own discipline and may have influenced how I approach future research and continue my career."
