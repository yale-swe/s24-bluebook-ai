    "A+",
    "Strengths - interesting subject matter, not a heavy workload with a good deal of exposure to various topics in public health ethics.Weaknesses - Small class (10 students?) lends itself to a great opportunity for a discussion-based course, but professor seldom encouraged\/solicited discussion. Instead, the course was primarily lecture-based. Professor seemed to underestimate the intelligence of students and repeated subject matter over and over, when we were ready to move on to new topics. Only one or two times did the professor incorporate multi-media (short video clip, and one power-point presentation) into the classroom, when in fact more could be tapped into to make the class more interesting and facilitate exposure to different perspectives.",
    "Strengths--the readings are a nice variety of all the relevant aspects in public health ethics. The Hard Times assignment was a nice change from other papers and tests from other classes.Weaknesses--there was no clear guidance for the final paper. There were no power point presentations for each class and the professor did not seem to follow a particular agenda for each day. He repeated the main ideas over and over. Professor was not available for regular office hours since he just came to New Haven to teach the course.To improve--better guidance for all the assignments.",
    "very enlightening course",
    "I'm torn on how to rate this course because I'm not a YSPH student. Having a considerable amount of exposure to ethical theory, the course was fairly easy for me. I learned new material, but its application did not present much of a challenge. For others in the class, particularly those who have no philosophy background, the course seemed to be difficult.That being said, this course should have been more rigorous. Regardless of educational background and training, this is Yale, there should be certain expectations for graduate and professional students.",
    "Excellent course. In the future, consider adding more public health examples\/applications in lieu of some of the historical\/theoretical content. Assignments were very reasonable and relevant and the instructor provided detailed feedback."

    "Instructor: Bruce Jennings \u00a0A+ excellent lectures and discussions. highly engaging",
    "Instructor: Bruce Jennings \u00a0See comments above. Professor did not do a good job of facilitating class discussion. When one student expressed an idea or view, he would respond to it himself and then move onto something else, rather than asking others in the class what they thought about it. Students would have to seemingly cut the professor off in order to express an idea or opinion about something, instead of being encouraged to do so. In an environment in which people are not encouraged to speak up, some students will decide to never speak up and remain quiet the entire semester, when in fact they may have interesting ideas and perspectives to share.",
    "Instructor: Bruce Jennings \u00a0He is really knowledgeable about the topic and has a great command of the different theories and authors. However, he does not seem to care about his students. We were only 10 students in the class and he never referred to us by ournames. I doubt he ever learned who was who. For such a controversial subject, he did not encourage classroom discussions. When students participated he rarely provided feedback. He is a great lecturer, but not a great professor because he does not seem concerned about inspiring us to learn and think for ourselves.",
    "Instructor: Bruce Jennings \u00a0I really liked Dr. Jennings - the class was long, but he tried to keep us engaged. I felt like I learned a lot from him. He's knowledgeable and an effective instructor - overall he's a very very nice guy, too.",
    "Instructor: Bruce Jennings \u00a0I found some of the lectures to be repetitive, and again, this may go back to my comment concerning the educational background of these students. I'm not sure if Professor Jennings repeated content or moved slowly through lectures to help students who weren't familiar with some of these ideas and theories.Professor Jennings' feedback on paper topics and on submitted papers was thorough and insightful, very accessible and willing to provide suggestions. He really cares what students have to say and whats to engage in critical conversations during lectures and outside of class.As he's regarded as a key opinion leader in the field, I would have loved for him to share more of his experiences and positions on certain topics.",
    "Instructor: Bruce Jennings \u00a0The instructor was very knowledgeable about the subject matter and integrated theoretical ethics with public health applications very well."

   "comments": [
    "Take it. Great stuff right here",
    "Interesting overview of PH Ethics, but too much emphasis on the foundations of the course (Utilitarian\/Rights-Based\/Deontological Theory) and not enough practical application into a variety of scenarios that would apply to our future work as PH professionals.",
    "Provides an overview of the main ethical theories in public health. It briefly touches upon the main ethical issues in public health, but does not go in depth. I would not recommend the course. I think if you get the readings and do them by yourself it would be enough.",
    "This was an excellent course that gives the student a number of ways of understanding the ethical implications of public health. The course provides a background in the ethical frameworks and class discussions of the applications to public health. I would recommend this course to future students."
