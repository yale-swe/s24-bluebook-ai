    "Yesif you're looking for a not too rigorous fiction\/writing class",
    "100% recommend this class. If you are offered a spot, you absolutely have to take it.",
    "This is a course in which you'll learn various techniques and useful methods to creative writing. you'll then workshop your own work.",
    "Hi, You might be reading this if you're shopping Professor Cunningham's section English 134. It's a great course and you'd probably really enjoy it. When I was reading the evaluations of the course however, I was looking for information about getting into it. So I'll tell you what it was like for mevery intimidating. The first section, a lot of people show up and Professor Cunningham asks general questions about fiction to the room. Get there fairly early if it's convenient for you, but that's not a big deal. You raise your hand, hope he calls on you, and try to impress him with what you say. You also fill out a sheet telling him who you are, why you want to take the class, etc. He will email you letting you know whether or not you're in. I really enjoyed the class. That said, I would have had a fine semester without it. If you can take the class, do, but what you'll get out of it isn't necessarily proportional to how competitive it is to get in.",
    "Definitely take it if you get in!!!",
    "Reading Fiction for Craft is mostly reading a bunch of incredible stories and talking about how they utilize specific techniques (structure, character, voice). Then you ease into writing a full story with shorter assignments focusing on these techniques. I would absolutely recommend this class. The reading list is incredible and Cunningham is a mind-blowing teacher.",
    "This was a phenomenal course - absolutely take it!! I learned so much both about both looking at elements of short fiction (we read so many breathtaking stories!) as well as applying these ideas to my own writing. Professor Cunningham was so wonderful - he was very friendly to students and willing to meet with them for conferences outside of class, and approached discussing both others' stories and our own with such a great eye. His comments on our stories were incredibly helpful and constructive, both looking at our stories where they were and thinking about how to move them forward. We also just had such a close-knit class and an open, positive workshop environment - I feel like I got to know everyone really well through both their writing and our class discussions. I will miss this class!",
    "This is an into course to fiction writing, but we had people with many levels of experience and they all got something out of the course.",
    "ABSOLUTELY. You would be a fool to pass up the chance to take this class. It's not over-hyped. Professor Cunningham really is such a gift to Yale and to the literary world. Even if you don't ultimately want to keep writing, your appreciation for and understanding of good fiction will grow incredibly. I can't recommend this class enough. Get there early the first day, be your passionate self (but be yourself!), and pray that Professor Cunningham graces you with the opportunity to study fiction with him and a class full of motivated, engaged friends. This is a must.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student. While there is less writing than I had hoped, the syllabus is truly astounding. You are exposed to so many incredible writers, working TODAY. And the writing assignments are very original and imaginative.",
    "I would recommend ENGL 134 to a fellow student interested in fiction and particularly writing fiction. It is an excellent introductory course for the writing and the community of writers at Yale."
