    "I am so glad I took this class. This is a relaxed but informative survey of the who's, what's, and why's behind everything from copyright law to Shakespearean ways of seeing. The class started out slow and I was a bit scared it wouldn't be engaging, but within a week after shopping period, the pace picked up and I haven't regretted the class since. Professor Graham is extremely kind and a great instructor. She taught us how to write and gave us a launching point for a hybridized study of humanities and sciences. I feel that I took so much away from this class, improved on each paper, and, most importantly, produced pieces that I can be proud of as a freshman.",
    "The course is very well-taught, but I didn't find the topic too interesting to me. The teacher is not that passionate, but she is surely knowledgeable and can tell many insider jokes people won't laugh until given clues.",
    "Nice class.",
    "I would recommend it, I feel I improved my writing skills. Professor Graham's comments were always helpful. I also liked the fact that I had a good amount of liberty for what I wanted to write about in my essays and research paper.",
    "English 114 05 is a course that describes the complex relationship existing between Science, Technology, and the Humanities. One learns about the influences that the different disciplines have on each other, how they positively and negatively affect one another. This is a class that prospective engineering and science majors must take as it provides an education on how their work is intertwined with the humanities. Contrary to the common way of thinking, science and the humanities coexist in way that our generation is not really exposed to early on; hence, it is important to understand how the two fields affect each other in order to have a more complete comprehension of the way in which the science and humanities affect one another.",
    "This course was a great overview of the interaction between science and the humanities throughout various time periods. The professor is exceedingly knowledgeable and the readings were generally very interesting. The only workload for this course involves reading articles\/discussing them and take-home essays, so get good at those. Professor Graham taught us many useful tips for writing which, unlike most other English classes I've taken, has actually improved my papers. Overall, an excellent class.",
    "a lot of reading, really fun classes and a great teacher",
    "Interesting class for those interested in how technology affects us.",
    "Great class, TAKE IT. Professor Graham is an amazing teacher: her classes are fun and very interesting. My writing skills have improved this semester much more than I expected. Besides, I have also learned a lot about the topic of the class itself.Professor Graham is really flexible when it comes to assignments; she is fine with you writing about anything you find interesting even if it doesn't really answer the question."
