   "comments": [
    "It's an intermediate language course. Speaks for itself. Diaz does a good job of making it pretty good though.",
    "This class is a nice laid-back language requirement. While it can sometimes be stressful (I took two years off of Spanish before resuming it with this class at Yale), the workload is totally manageable and the grading isn't too bad. But the online workbook sucks. I hate it - it doesn't accurately reflect your skill at all.",
    "Students practice grammar usage and answer questions about various essays and short films. Two oral presentations.No, you might not improve your Spanish that much if you don't do extra practice outside of the rather monotonous activities.",
    "I would DEFINITELY recommend this course! It's a great course to develop your speaking and writing skills and learn about latinamerica at the same time, and it's not high-stress. Sebastian is the nicest teacher I've had so far; his enthusiasm is infectious and he is a friend to everyone. If you are willing to really speak Spanish at all times in class, then you will see significant improvement.",
    "This class is a great class either to continue into from Span 130 or to start your Yale Spanish career. It will teach you grammar and understanding, as well as prep your for conversation.",
    "It's a great spanish class. It's every day, but it's not much work at all. It can be a chore to wake up and get to class every morning, but once you get there, it's actually pretty fun. Most of the class is speaking activities with partners or in groups, and the written assignments are minimal. All the teachers are pretty good, but Sebastian Diaz is the nicest man in the universe, and a fantastic professor. He will always help you out. He really wants all of his students to succeed.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. It's requirements\/tasks, homeworks etc are all consistent and reasonable. Prof Diaz is great, and I actually do feel I gained a much stronger grasp of the language; I'm planning to continue with L5 and summer abroad study now.",
    "Mostly a review of grammar with some new vocab, movies and reading.",
    "Yes I would recommend this course for students who want to pursue L5.",
    "If you are taking it, it is either because you are a spanish major or trying to fulfill the language requirement. I don't think anyone would take a 5 day a week class (with a strict attendance policy) with faily homework out of pure enjoyment. It sucks, but you will get through it."
