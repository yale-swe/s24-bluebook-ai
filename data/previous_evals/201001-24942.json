    "If you enjoy learning new math and associated abstractions (perhaps planning on doing math research or a mathematical graduate degree) or are in fact a first year math phd student at yale, this class with a suitable instructor is worth taking depending on your particular interests and who the instructor will be.",
    "Take this class if you want to learn commutative algebra. Borisov is a nice and friendly teacher who unfortunately will be leaving Yale. Eisenbud is a next text, yeah.",
    "If you're reading this at all, you've probably taken the first semester of the course and know what it's like to take a grad level algebra course. Commutative Algebra is run at the same level, but imo the material is much cooler. Take it if you like algebra, no question."
