   "comments": [
    "The readings are long but taking them seriously is fundamental to enjoying this class. There are no reading responses which is excellent but you need to be dedicated to do the work. I would absolutely recommend this class, one of the best I've taken.",
    "I would highly recommend this class. A very incisive reading list that makes you think in a very critical way about the relationship of the U.S. and the \"West\" to Islam. Particular emphasis is placed on understanding various discussions\/discourses both internal and external to the Islamic world and seeing how those intersect\/clash\/or don't speak to eachother at all. I had taken courses on Islam before at undergrad level...one a terrorism course where we read material like Huntington and Lewis; the other an Islamic Philosophy\/Religion course where we read Al Ghazali, Ibn Rushd, Karen Armstrong and others. This class by far, broadened my horizons and made me question and interrogate \"Western\" discourses about Islam, and relationships of power in new and exciting ways.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this class to another student. The class is a lot of work - about 200 pages of reading a week - but the majority of it is not too dense. If you are looking to critique Western approaches to Islam while learning more about internal discussions within Muslim-majority countries about \"hot button\" issues (like suicide bombing, gender, education etc.), this is a great class. At the same time, this course does cover a broad range of subjects. I would suggest looking carefully at the reading list to make sure all of the books interest you.Also, note that your grade is almost entirely determined by the final paper (20-25 pages) at the end of the semester, so plan your course work accordingly.",
    "Interrogating the \"Crisis\" of Islam is a challenging and intense look at various religious debates in Islam today, in the context of traditional and new sources of authority. It really forces one to reconsider one's initial judgments about Islam and to go deeper into the historical and cultural fabric. I think it's an excellent course as it stands."

   "comments": [
    "Anyone with an interest in Islam, the West, politics or religious studies should take this class. It is completely invaluable.",
    "This course is outside of the discipline of American History; but in very real ways it contributed to my own research interests. I was particularly struck by the ways in which American Religious History and Islamic Studies seem very disconnected from each other. Taking this class along with my other more traditional coursework helped me to see connections that I hadn't thought of before.",
    "This course really helped me gain a better understanding of traditional Islamic sources of authority, as well as of the way that the stereotypical West perceives Islam."
