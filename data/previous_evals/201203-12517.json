   "comments": [
    "I don't know if there is any point in taking this class. I did the readings and went to lecture but the professor is just terribly boring. It was like eating a candy bar with no chocolate, sugar or sweetener.",
    "Bio Anthro was a reasonably good class. It could be memorization heavy at times and was an unbelievably boring lecture, but section was well run (get Jessamy if you can). Midterm was harder than expected.",
    "I expected this to be a super-gut science credit. It was not: the readings were boring and lecture was dull. Still, VERY low stress. And David Watts' enthusiasm is infectious, so you'll find yourself caring about at least one of the many topics covered in the course.",
    "A fascinating course! Really, this course made me more interested in the study of evolution and anthropology, and the interest given by Professor Watts can be seen. The strengths would be the method of teaching where professor Watts provided us with his slide notes and at the same time, he didn't simply read off slides, which is always a plus. Sections were also interesting. If you are interested in human evolution as I am, you will definitely find the material worth learning.",
    "I would recommend it with reservations. I think the content is great. The way it is presented not so great. The homework and sections are pretty easy but the tests, at least the midterm, definitely require some work.",
    "Yes, it's a good class, not too grueling.",
    "It is an enjoyable class. Take it to expand your worldview.",
    "I took this class for a science credit thinking it would be more manageable than a hard science, but it was honestly more frustrating than I think Chem would have been. After taking AP chem in high school but not having any desire to go into the Sciences, I thought I wanted to find more humanities-based science credits. Those turn out to be textbook bio classes (this one and Issues Approach to Bio). If you're looking for an easy way out of your SC, think again. \"Easy\" and \"less work\" don't always go hand in hand.The labs were fun, the problem sets weren't bad, and the material can be interesting if you make it interesting for yourself. But Professor Watts is one of the hardest lecturers to sit through, especially with this lecture being a 75-minute one. I had to try MANY different techniques to get myself to focus, but realized 3\/4 of the way through the class that I could be more productive with my time by reading the slides on my own and doing other homework during lecture.... This is NEVER the ideal situation.",
    "I would recommend it to someone looking for an interesting So credit and doesn't want to enter into the ECON field. It's pretty interesting material and definitely worth knowing (especially the 2nd part of the semester where we start talking about modern human behavior and such)",
    "Solid course, especially if you want to get a science credit without descending into the miserable underworld of physics and chemistry. Material is, for the most part, interesting and clearly presented. Lectures can get boring, but the sections are quite good. Prof. Watts and the TAs make themselves very accessible. Not a lot of work--there are short weekly problem sets in addition to the midterm and final.",
    "This course covers a great deal of information about the origins of humans and primates. It was great to get a better understanding of where we as humans came from and how our behaviors and habits are rooted in evolution. However, the lectures can be very, very dry. I would only recommend taking this class if you are genuinely interested in the material and have the self discipline to attend the lectures and make yourself pay attention. You can get by without going to class, but you will not get as much out of the course.",
    "The content of the course is super interesting, lab is awesome. Class itself can be a bit dry but Prof Watts REALLY knows his stuff and when he shows footage that he took it's really cool. Great choice for a Sci credit--- not hard if you do the work.",
    "Not too much work, but tons of material to learn for the tests. Watch out.",
    "Good course, covers everything in enough, but not too much detail. Good overview of the topic and a normal amount of work.",
    "I would recommend ANTH 116 for people looking for easy science credits AND have interest in human evolution. The subject matter is great (though it does cover a vast amount of information) and the material is presented in a straightforward way. Section\/lab is required. Go to section, skip lecture, review the very helpful study guides that Professor Watts sends out for the midterm and final, and you'll be fine.",
    "If you need a science or social science credit I think this would be a great choice. but do not expect it to be too easy if you are not going to put in some work.",
    "Yes, I recommend it. It's not too hard and it's also interesting material.",
    "Many (most?) people take this course because it's an easy science credit, and that is somewhat true. The course is pretty accessible even to those who aren't good at science, but I would warn you that the tests can be difficult if you aren't prepared for them; many people got a nasty surprise on the first mid-term. Of particular note are the multiple choice questions, found on both mid-term and final, which are of the format A), B), C), A&B), or A&C).\" They are made in a way such that it's obvious one of the choices is correct, but it's not clear if there's also another correct answer; some of them are quite tricky and tend to trip people up. I took this class for the science credit but ended up learning some interesting things anyway, which was pleasantly surprising. Lectures are what you would expect in such a large class, but are decently interesting. During section you examine fossil replicas and write down observations about them, which is pretty low stress. Overall, a solid class with a light workload; you might get something extra out of it if you put in extra work, but there's really no requirement to do that if you don't want to.",
    "A great science credit for non-sciency people. Take it if you need a science credit and are any bit interested in the evolution of the human race!",
    "I would say that this class was an interesting class with a manageable workload that is great for non-science majors.",
    "Yes I would recommend it. I would say that the reading seems very heavy, but it isn't exactly necessary. I would say that it is a class that it is easy to fall behind in the class if you don't pay attention to the lecture, but it is very interesting and the workload is quite managable.",
    "If you just really need an easy science credit (or if you find the material interesting), go for it. Just a warning: the lectures really are that boring.",
    "Barely any work except for the midterm and final, but those are hard so STUDY",
    "The class is a good science credit, but I would recommend going to lecture in order to do well in the class. Unfortunately, the lectures are really boring and disorganized and if that is going to annoy you don't take the course.",
    "While ANTH 116 may not be as \"easy\" as it might have been a couple of years ago, it is still a nice science credit for non-science majors. There isn't too much work (just one short problem set a week, and the questions are pretty easy) and a midterm and final. It really is important to go to lecture, as all the material on the psets\/midterm\/final are from his lectures, not the book, and his powerpoints aren't always self-explanatory, so it's good to hear Professor Watts go over them. The lectures can be boring at times, but overall it's not a bad class and Watts\/the TAs are all very nice and understanding.",
    "I would recommend this to someone who needs a science or social science credit. The workload is considerably less than most other classes, but just be prepared for some potentially boring lectures. Also, if you want to do well on the tests, you have to study and go back through the power points or your notes because it's basically rote memorization of specific facts.",
    "I thought it was interesting. I just took it for the science credit, and it ended up being a lot harder than I thought it would be. The midterm was very difficult. I am grateful that I learned this material though, I think it will stick with me and was really interesting. The problem sets and section are easy.",
    "Yes, if you're interested in what the class covers. Don't take it for a gut Sci.",
    "It's a decent class with an interesting topic but boring lectures.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student because it was very enjoyable and the material that we went over was fascinating",
    "Good",
    "This course is basically high-school level and involved a lot of memorization. I took it because it's a requirement for the Anthro major and a science credit. Pretty minimal amount of work, but the midterm and final were not super easy. You have to know the material. Overall, there are definitely much more engaging science credits out there, so I wouldn't recommend it to a non-science major in need of a science credit unless you have a genuine interest in the material, some of which is actually pretty interesting if you're into primates and early hominids.",
    "The lectures tend to be boring as the professor isn't that good of a lecturer. This class also weigh heavily in the midterm and the final, but overall there's not much work to do.",
    "Do not take this class. If you are looking for a science credit, take anything else - even the more challenging biological anthro classes. If you are an anthro major trying to fulfill your requirements, there are other bio classes you can take that are better. There is little reason to take this class unless you are going to concentrate specifically in Biological Anthropology.",
    "Anthropology 116 is an okay class. The material is interesting and the labs\/problem sets make the information easier to remember.",
    "I'm repeating the comment I made in answer to the other question above:So the deal with this course is that it's extremely easy but teaches you some mildly interesting and useful information about the biology and behavior of humans and our ancestors. So that part is great. If you get frustrated by lectures that cover material excruciatingly slowly (or by things like counting the molars on ancient skulls every week in lab), then this isn't for you. I try not to take guts, but I suppose that's what this is. The material is serious and geared toward majors as much as non-majors, though. It's just that it's not hard to do well on the midterm (haven't gotten final results back yet) without doing any reading and only paying a sort of sleepy, intermittent attention in lecture. I looked forward to going to lecture every week, actually - if you're interested in hearing, in a low-stress environment, about how our ancestors lived, then this might be a good choice."
