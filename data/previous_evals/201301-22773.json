   "comments": [
    "This was arguably the hardest class in the MENG curriculum. You learn a lot about fluids and thermodynamics, and mainly about scientific writing and data processing. I enjoyed it, but if you're not a MechE ABET major, you probably don't want to kill yourself with this class.",
    "you have to take it for ME. get through it. the day you hand in your last lab will feel incredible. but it could be worse i think. some of the labs are pretty interesting and you get the feel for reports pretty quickly.",
    "It's (unsurprisingly) just \"Applied Fluid Mechanics and Thermodynamics\". MechE's have to take it, but if you did not like Fluid Mechanics, I would not recommend taking this if you don't have to.",
    "Odds are that you are taking this course because you have to. This class is a lot of work but it really is worth it as you will develop skills in writing scientific reports. You really just have to muscle through the course as it can be very time consuming. Try to stay on track in terms of turning in the reports on time. Professor Ouellette is very helpful so talk to him ahead of time if you have any questions about the lab.",
    "A lot of work. I would probably not have taken it were it not required, but the engine analysis experiments and some of the other ones gave me a chance to learn about classic engineering topics I hadn't encountered in my classes in any practical sense.",
    "I would recommend this class to ABET majors. It is a TON of work, so be ready for that, but you'll learn a lot through it.",
    "The workload is enormous. There are lab reports due every week that can take upwards of 20-25 hours. It is a writing credit for a reason. It can be extremely frustrating to work with the data because it is often bad, but it is very rewarding when things work out. This course will definitely improve your understanding of fluid mechanics, but less so with thermodynamics. Professor Ouellette was very helpful and approachable, which made understanding the labs much easier. If you have a choice of professor (which you probably don't), take it with Ouellette."
