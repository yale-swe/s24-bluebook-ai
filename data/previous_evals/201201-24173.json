   "comments": [
    "ENGL127 was a super fun approach to American literature through a really fantastic syllabus. It wasn't necessarily a survey course per say - as a lot of the works didn't connect all that well to others - but it was enjoyable nonetheless. Tom was a fantastic teacher; he's also a pretty reasonable grader and with the way class is structured (really in-depth close readings of a few selected passages) it's fairly easy to get away with not doing the reading if you ever have to.",
    "Absolutely take this class if the reading list sounds at all interesting to you, if you like reading at all, or if you're interested in anything related to America, American history, politics, etc. If you can take it with Koenigs, DO IT. He is amazing and will make your life 20 times better. The writing load isn't bad at all for a WR credit, but you don't get a lot of hand-holding for the writing process unless you seek it out. This class is definitely mostly valuable for the reading and for the amazing class discussions in which you will inevitably engage. Moby Dick is kind of annoying and you'll spend AGES on it (whereas you spend maybe one day on the Great Gatsby), but when the heck else are you going to read it? Never. So just do it now and you'll be a better person for it. I promise.",
    "I definitely would. It is a great course that covers a wide range of topics and genres, though I do think that some things we read were far superior to others.",
    "Discussion-based class. There are only 3 short assignments and 3 papers. The reading load is manageable. Some of the books are great. The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao andThe Great Gatsby. Moby Dick was so-so. We spent 3 weeks on it, and by the end, I was ready for the book to be over. Koenigs is a great instructor - he's very nice and understanding.",
    "Yes, this class was a great way for me to obtain a solid writing credit. I felt that my writing improved and I was able to read some of the staple texts of American literature.",
    "The reading list is really fantastic, and I found Professor Koenigs to be a greatprofessor. A fair amount of reading, but it's not an overwhelming amount."
