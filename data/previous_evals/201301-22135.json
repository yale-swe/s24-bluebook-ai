    "If you're at this point in your Russian studying, you have to take this class - but you'll never once regret it.",
    "Very good class. If you're in 4th Year II you probably know what to expect at this point. The focus of the class is on building listening, reading, writing, and speaking skill, as well as grammar mastery and vocabulary acquisition.",
    "It's more of what you've had in Russian over the past three years. Except you're branching out even more into readings, complicated vocabulary, etc.",
    "Yes! If you've gotten this far in your study of Russian at Yale, this class is a good way to keep it up. Credit\/D it if you want to reduce the stress.",
    "An excellent course for improving one's practical Russian skills in all areas (reading, writing, listening, and speaking).",
    "I would highly recommend it."
