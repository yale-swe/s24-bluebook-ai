    "Component course to CHEM 220. Only take this if you are also taking orgo. Be willing to dedicate time each week to writing experimental plans and lab reports (every few weeks)",
    "It's a good lab and it goes well with the Orgo lecture.",
    "Take it if you have to or if you have a unique desire to learn the intricate details of TLC and IR. Otherwise, why bother?",
    "If you're looking at this course, you probably have to take it...",
    "Chem 222l is actually a pretty cool course. Definitely worth taking with orgo lecture if you can fit it because it helps reinforce a lot of the concepts (particularly with spectroscopy and it'll probably help your GPA a little too",
    "The lab is an enhancer for the organic chemistry lecture. I would recommend it to anyone in the lecture who wants a better understanding of the material.",
    "yes, it's a very good way to reinforce teachings of organic chemistry",
    "This was a nice, relaxed introduction to organic chemistry laboratory techniques. The labs are admittedly long (expect to be there until 4:30 most days) and do not correlate well to what is learned in class, but I have heard that the second semester changes both.Since there are so many kids in the class, I did not see very much of Dr. DiMeglio, but she did make her rounds and was very warm aboutasking how things were going and giving tips.Most interaction in the class is with your TA, who explains and monitors every lab and does all the grading. Of course, it is the luck of the draw who you get, but they seem to be mostly very good.Expect to work significantly more than half of an average Yale class, but that seems to be true for most labs anyway.",
    "Taking CHEM222L will definitely help you get comfortable working with organic lab equipment and procedures, which is the point of the lab. Obviously, if you want to learn more about the science behind the experiments, you should take this with CHEM220.",
    "I would recommend the class to a student who wanted to build independence in organic lab techniques. Lab can be really frustrating, but if you approach the class with the right mindset, those two to four hours of weekly experimentation can actually be a sort of meditative period.",
    "It is a small workload, since they assume youre taking the lecture alongside the lab, but it is fun and helps you gain insight in how chemistry research is actually done.",
    "If you're taking this lab, it's probably because you have to. I promise it's not as bad as gen chem, and way less work lab report wise. Also, no prelab quizzes, YAY!",
    "It is an interesting lab without too much work. As a freshman without too much previous lab experience, it was a little overwhelming at first, but Christine DiMegglio and my TA were awesome and helped me get to the point where I felt totally comfortable in the lab.",
    "A very relaxed lab that teaches you a lot. You're probably only taking it because you're pre-med or a chem or engineering major, but if orgo is a demon, then orgo lab is its harmless little sibling that you might actually enjoy spending time with sometimes if you didn't have the demon looming over you all the time. Also, they play music in lab, so that's a serious bonus.",
    "The labs were fairly straightforward and supported organic chemistry classwork. The grading was very nit-picky.",
    "Orgo lab is great! Dr. DiMeglio was awesome and always checked in with everyone before each lab. The workload was really fair: an EP every week (they get routine very quickly), 3 post-labs, and a final. The labs themselves are cool and you don't get penalized for a low yield, so no reason to stress. I am going to miss lab next semester!",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class. While the concepts themselves might be difficult to learn, in conjunction with the lecture it really really solidifies the material, and I found it to be taught in a much more approachable manner with Professor DiMeglio and my TF. The instructors of this course are also the prime example of instructors making or breaking a class, and as they were wonderful and so approachable, I found this class to be really amazing. I absolutely loved this class, and think anyone else who took it would as well.",
    "I would definitely recommend Orgo Chem Lab. It is a rewarding experience in and of itself to synthesize, separate, and analyze organic chemicals. You feel very professional when you're doing it.",
    "Useful for learning basic, common lab techniques and a good supplement for organic chem lecture. Yes, I would recommend it.",
    "I would recommend this class. It is a lot of fun to perform the synthesis and purification labs, a major step up from intro chemistry lab.",
    "Very good lab course. Take it!",
    "Take the lab if you are required to. It is one of the better labs that I've taken thus far at Yale.",
    "As good a lab class as you'll find. Weekly assignments were very manageable once you got use to them and lab reports (3) were all fair.",
    "Far more enjoyable than gen chem lab, Dr. DiMeglio is a star!",
    "Definitely! It was a really fun class and a great learning experience for those interested in labwork!",
    "Absolutely take this, it won't hurt at all.",
    "Very relaxed lab that's quite enjoyable. The radio plays in the background and everyone is very friendly. I rarely had to stay more than 2.5 hours. Experiments can be quite interesting. Only two or three lab reports all semester and those were pretty short. Only work is a pre-lab report for each lab but those aren't hard at all. Overall very enjoyable",
    "Take it, you have to anyway. It's a relaxing lab and you learn some good techniques.",
    "This lab is much more pleasant than Chem 116L (gen chem lab). There are only a few lab reports throughout the whole semester, and they are completely manageable.",
    "Chem 222L is a good lab class - you never have to write a full lab report, and most of the labs do not take the allotted 4 hours. If you're taking organic chemistry, take this lab along with it - it will be easier to understand some of the science behind the labs if you're in organic chemistry at the same time.",
    "Chemistry 222L is a standard chemistry lab to accompany the first semester of organic chemistry lecture. Most of the labs focus on the different techniques that will be needed for more advanced syntheses and procedures in the second semester. I would definitely recommend this lab. Dr. DiMeglio is exceptionally kind and helpful, and she makes an effort to get to know all of her students. The class feels like a lot of work, and it is, for only a half credit, but it is much less work than the general chemistry labs; you have to do EPs every week, but there were only four or five postlab assignments over the course of the semester, and none of them were full lab reports. There is a multiple choice lab exam at the end of the course, but the course pack has questions that generally prepare you for the test. I recommend actually going through the questions after each lab, so you do not have to do all of them the weekend before the exam; doing them each week is an easy way to have to avoid studying a lot at the end of the semester. Overall, this lab is probably one of the better ones.",
    "I would definitely recommend it to another student, for chem lab helps put a few things into perspective, although it doesn't really line up to what we're learning in class, except for the last few labs, on Sn2 and E2 reactions.",
    "The labs themselves are tedious and long, and at first, they are physically and mentally painful to complete. However, they get much better as time goes along. Everything in the first few labs is taught with the goal of preparing you to do actual synthesis labs, so once you get through the first few, you won't have much difficulty. Thankfully, most labs don't take the full 4 hours, but even when they do, they go by pretty quickly.",
    "Orgo lab was actually pretty fun, and the write ups weren't too bad at all. The grading was very reasonable, too, though that sort of hinges on the individual TA.",
    "This lab is pretty straightforward, but it can be draining, especially during the longer experiments. I would recommend this lab, but only if you have to take it. If you didn't have to take lab, then I would not recommend this as an extra half-credit course.",
    "I have already recommended chem 222L to some of my fellow students! I tell them that it was \"the first lab I ever took where doing the lab actually clarified lecture material and made lecture more meaningful.\"",
    "Overall, i really like the lab.",
    "A breeze compared to gen chem lab! Christine DiMeglio is the nicest, most helpful person ever. Your experience will likely depend on the TA you get. But in general the labs were fairly simple, and you're not graded on percent yield, so it's very low pressure. Experimental plans were somewhat time consuming but I got used to them. Post-lab assignments were long, but there were only a few. The final exam was doable but required a lot of studying.",
    "Yes! It's lot of fun and not too hard.",
    "I would recommend the class to other students because it is interesting and manageable. I would also recommend taking the class at the same time as Organic Chemistry because it reinforces many of the concepts that were studied in Organic Chemistry.",
    "Take it if you have to, as with every lab course.",
    "I would not recommend it unless it is a requirement. It was an okay class, but I would spend my time doing other things if I had a choice.",
    "Chemistry 222L was the laboratory course in connection with the first half of organic chemistry. I would recommend this course to another student because you learn a lot about laboratory skills and organic chemistry.",
    "It's not as long as other labs, which is the best thing that can be said for it. Well, you do pretty cool experiments and learn techniques, but the process is grueling and for me, it was wholly unenjoyable. Also, based on my answer to Question 5, I think it should definitely count as a full credit.",
    "Take it if you have to.",
    "Less work than gen chem lab. Only a few full lab reports and an easy, short, multiple-choice final exam.",
    "Much more relaxed than Gen Chem lab, but still takes up quite a bit of time. You are really only going to be taking this class if your major requires it or you are premed.",
    "CHEM 222L is a great lab. The experiments are a balance between experiments intended to teach us techniques and experiments intended to further our understanding of organic chemistry. However, they're all fairly straightforward. The goal of the lab is not to get the best results or yield, but rather to understand the chemistry and techniques. It's a very fun and relaxed lab environment, which makes the time go byfast.",
    "It's not that much work, just give your time to it and it will all work out.",
    "As far as lab courses go, this one is probably one of the easiest and less involved. That being said, you still learn a lot and have to put in a couple hours of work a week. Take it if you must, and also take it if you have a general interest in synthesizing really cool things.",
    "WAY BETTER THAN GEN CHEM LAB! Dr. D is really nice and accessible and you almost always have more than enough time to complete the assignments. You won't have many lab reports and overall the atmosphere is very relaxed. For me I really enjoyed lab and it was one of my favorite courses for the semester.",
    "It's a great lab course that goes along great with organic chem lecture",
    "Yes, it's the lab to take to supplement orgo!",
    "Definitely a much more pleasant experience than GenChem lab. DiMeglio is great, super nice and enthusiastic and helpful. The vibe of lab is chill (music in the background? Hell yeah!) and there's not a ton of work to do outside of lab. Definitely recommend taking this along with lecture.",
    "I would recommend taking this course if you need it. It is a lot of work because you have to write experimental plans, post lab assignments, lab notes etc. But if you like doing experiments you will like it.",
    "Better than gen chem lab. There were only 3-4 lab reports due the whole semester (although they're more involved than the gen chem ones). There's more independence in doing the lab (not every single step is laid out for you), but it's pretty laid back and helpful to take with 220.",
    "Definitely take chem 222L with orgo, it's so much more relaxing than gen chem lab and you learn a lot more. There is only one final lab report and a bunch of experimental procedures (EPs) that take significantly less time. Just make sure to actually review for the lab final (which is a multiple choice test, not a practical. Pretty awesome).I would definitely recommend taking this with the class.",
    "If you loathe lab like I do, this course is bearable, and it gets more so as the semester continues.",
    "If you are in CHEM220 then you probably have to take CHEM22L for your requirements (pre-med, science, etc.). It is what it is, but organic chemistry lab is actually a lot more relaxed than general chemistry labs. You have to do experimental plans before lab days, and then post-labs, so there is never any stress for this class, and you can just enjoy spending times with some classmates doing reactions. You do learn a lot about techniques and the basis behind them, so this class does a good job of making it understandable to those just starting out in organic chemistry. Your TA also explains a lot of stuff to you, so they are super important! Scott is a cool TA. Beware though, of the final exam for it composes a large chunk of your grade. Good thing is that it is multiple choice and not too difficult.",
    "Chem 222 was honestly one of my favorite courses of the semester. Unlike general chemistry lab, orgo lab is NOT a useless course. The reactions we did in this class followed the course material (in chem 220) quite well and it helped to teach us procedures such as IR better, which helped for the lecture course. I would absolutely recommend this class to anyone who needs to take it, wants to take it, or needs a lab credit. It's super low-stress, high-reward and will have you feeling like you certainly learned something at the end of the term. Take it!",
    "It's definitely a better lab than gen chem, so if you have a choice, orgo lab is the way to go! However, be warned: the final test is not a lab practical, as you would expect--it's a written multiple choice test. And it is very difficult. I thought I understood chemistry pretty well, but this final showed me that I still have a lot of learning to do.",
    "Good lab course! Pretty fun and interesting labs during the course.",
    "MUCH less stressful than Physics lab. You learn about different techniques, but don't expect Orgo lab to reinforce your understanding of Organic Chemistry. The write-ups are not difficult.",
    "Yeah, this course is really good. It has a decent amount of work, but it's nothing crazy and it corresponds really well with orgo so i would take them the same semester.",
    "Chemistry 222L is definitely not as bad as some people make it out to be. HOWEVER, I would advise whoever takes this class to a) take the pre-labs seriously, as they help with understanding the lab itself, b) if you're slow (like I was), there's never any shame in coming to lab 20 minutes early to set everything up, and c) DO THE EXAM PREP QUESTIONS WHILE THE SEMESTER GOES ON instead of waiting until the last minute to cram and memorize them right before the final exam.",
    "Chem 222L is an introductory lab course for organic chemistry, and introduces you to techniques used in a lab setting.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. The structure of the course really makes sense, as it parallels and compliments the organic chemistry courses. We also learn the techniques before using them in the synthesis labs. Unlike other labs, we always finish quite early and the workload is also not bad at all.",
    "Better than Gen Chem lab, the workload is doable but still more than a half-credit's worth.",
    "Chem 222L is a fair lab course. From the beginning of the term, you are given a syllabus of when all assignments will be due, and the course follows that syllabus very accurately. The Course Packet also does a good job outlining the labs and all expectations for lab reports. One weakness of Chem 222L is that the concepts of the labs are not explained as thoroughly as they could be, and there is not much of an effort put in the pre-lab lectures, such that you might go the term without knowing what exactly you're doing and why the procedures work conceptually. This makes it more difficult to study for the final exam.Note: It's very important to study the questions in the end of each lab to study for the final exam, especially the reaction mechanisms for the last couple of labs, including knowing which molecules are electrophiles and nucleophiles, etc.Overall, I think this was a fair course.",
    "If you have to take it, then it really isn't anything to worry about! Professor DiMeglio is extremely nice and reasonable. The lab is a lot more relaxed than Gen Chem lab, which made it more enjoyable. The TAs typically grade for the more general stuff as opposed to specific\/nit-picky things like in Gen Chem.",
    "You're taking this probably because you have to. But do not fear, because this lab is much better and more enjoyable than gen chem lab. Try to find a TA that gives good lab lectures. This will help you for the final. DiMeglio is awesome - it is so apparent that she loves what she does. I really appreciated that she would stop by every single lab station each week and ask how we were doing and if wehad any questions. She answered her emails very promptly and is highly organized.",
    "Definitely the best lab at Yale I have taken so far. Making one thing out of another is one of the best feelings, especially when the reactants smell awful and the product smells wonderful!",
    "Personally, I dislike labs (four hours a week as well as weekly experimental plans and three post-lab write-ups). However, if you're taking this class it is probably because you are a pre-med or need it for your major. Rest assured that the class itself is not at all difficult- just tedious and a bit tiresome. Fortunately, you are not graded on your percent yield\/ percent recovery (unlike the general chemistry labs). If you put in the effort you will definitely be able to do well in the class.",
    "A good class to go along with organic chemistry and is not extremely taxing.",
    "CHEM 222 is a good orgo lab. Take it if you have to for premed requirements or for major requirements. The class does a good job of integrating the CHEM 220 material in with lab techniques. Some of the labs are tedious and lab reports are a pain, but you will definitely learn about orgo lab in this course. It will help with the lecture class too as there is significant material overlap.",
    "Orgo lab: much easier than orgo lecture. Have fun.",
    "Good course, very relaxed environment makes it easier to learn. Don't let that make you drop your guard though, it's like any other science course at Yale and is graded on a curve. Considering it's a class full of pre-meds, you still got to be on top of your game to get a good grade in this class",
    "Take it with an orgo class because it reinforces all the things you've learned in class. Even though the workload can equal that of a one-credit class, it is a viable 0.5 credit option.",
    "CHEM 222L is a great, fun and very do-able organic chemistry lab course. Compared to the horribleness of general chemistry lab, orgo lab was a joy and I felt as though I learned a lot throughout the course of the semester. It is a course that demands a lot of time and hard work, but the actual lab is very fun and the experiments and techniques learned are so interesting and applicable. I would definitely recommend this course to another student (and for all the students who have to take this course as a requirement: it is a great and enjoyable lab course).",
    "Strongly recommend taking this class for other students. I learned a lot.",
    "It's a great way to see some of the organic chemistry principles in real life and to get familiar with chemistry lab techniques. The only bad thing about the class is that it's super long and that the grading for post lab assignments can be a bit picky. There's also alot of stuff you have to do like EPs, post labs, lab notes and stuff. Otherwise, it's a great class to take and I would definitely take it.",
    "Very time consuming, but necessary if you're premed. If you take time to read the course packet and each experiment, you'll be fine.",
    "I would definitely recommend 222L for anyone who enjoys lab work. The atmosphere is very chill, the workload is very manageable, and the TA's are very nice.",
    "Not nearly as bad as gen chem labs. There is minimal prep work for each lab. The EPs don't take long once you get the hang of it. Overall, not a bad lab. If you're taking orgo than go ahead and take the lab it doesn't take too much effort.",
    "This lab course goes along with organic chemistry, but I found it to be an overall enjoyable class. It is a good supplement for the lecture as it reinforces several key concepts, and it teaches an number of useful lab procedures. I appreciated how we'd have individual labs to learn a certain technique, and then we would combine several techniques all in one lab to carry out an interesting synthesis. The grading tends to be harsh, but you learn the right way to complete assignments very quickly because of it. I would recommend the class to another science student.",
    "Chem 222L is a solid lab course. Professor DiMeglio is a happy to answer any questions, and the labs themselves are interesting.",
    "Yes!",
    "Chem 222L is definitely better than genchem lab but it still isn't fun because it is a lab. I would recommend taking it if you have to fulfill premed or major requirements, but other than that it definitely won't be that useful later on in life. The work load isn't too demanding but the lab-final at the end is tough and nothing in the labs really can prepare you for it. It's pretty unfair I would say that it is worth such alarge percentage of your grade.",
    "Definitely take this lab! It is such a fun lab and you really learn a lot. The grading is fair and the reports are graded not for yield which takes the pressure off when performing the labs by a lot. I really enjoyed being in lab, even on Friday afternoons.",
    "Definitely better than general chemistry lab. Days seem to move by quicker and labs are generally more interesting and less repetitive. Not a particularly difficult lab, so I would take it again.",
    "A great class; not a huge time commitment in terms of outside work, and the labs themselves are pretty fun. Learned a lot; might as well take it.",
    "DO NOT TAKE.",
    "To be honest, you're probably only taking this class because you have to, for major or pre-med requirements. But it's actually kind of fun.",
    "Not much to recommend, it's a lab, it's basically what you make it to be",
    "Chem 222L is a good introduction to organic chemistry and a good complement to the lecture. Lab techniques and the science behind them are well-explained. The course has been organized to be efficient and well-tuned to the student experience. Christine DiMeglio is really nice and helpful.",
    "It is one of the best chem lab classes at Yale. If you need to take it, it is a great class.",
    "It's a very laid back and rewarding course. Work load is completely doable.",
    "This is a good introduction to lab for Organic Chemistry.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. It's really interesting and most of the experiments are straightforward and fun. It's basically an introduction to organic chemistry lab techniques. Allows you to apply some of the knowledge you learn in Orgo I but you don't necessarily need to take the course to understand what is going on. The TAs are great for the most part and DeMiglio is great too.",
    "Take this course if you have to. Christine DiMeglio is a really nice professor and she takes the time to get to know almost all the students. The workload isn't bad and the grading is fair. It shouldn't be difficult to do well in this course. Much easier than gen chem lab.",
    "I would recommend this class for other students, especially if you are taking the lecture course.",
    "TAke it if you have to!",
    "CHEM 222L was a great lab because not every experiment was followed by a post lab assignment, and the experiments tended to build off each other well, so you were constantly improving on certain skills and techniques. Be aware of the end of lab questions in the manual, so you understand each lab, which helps for the post labs and the final.",
    "Orgo Lab I is an enjoyable lab and Professor DiMeglio does not demand an unreasonable workload. She makes it fairly painless.",
    "Sequence of nine organic chemistry labs that provide a very good introduction to syntheses and common analytical techniques in organic chemistry. By the end, you will not be able to forget most of them. Would recommend as supplement to orgo.",
    "Good lab to pair with Orgo as it is not a lot of work and most labs are pretty short.",
    "This is a great lab for anyone who is new to the lab or wants to learn how organic chemistry reactions take place under various conditions.",
    "Only take this if you need it for a requirement.",
    "Better than gen chem lab in the same way that massive head trauma is better than torture. Neither cause a lot of joy, but at least 3.5 hours of orgo lab will only deprive you of your higher reasoning skills, and not the will to live.Don't buy the textbook.",
    "Great lab. Teaches interesting, very valuable lab skills in organic chemistry. Is well- organized and not too much work.",
    "Better than most lab courses, but still. There's a lot of work, and the grading is harsh. Take it only if you need to for the major or for pre-med.",
    "Yeah, take it! It's better than general chem lab for sure. There's music and the labs are way funner. Make sure you follow every single specific detail outlined as a requirement for the lab reports. You could get points off for not even putting the date of the experiment.",
    "Orgo lab is a well designed and generally well taught course. It's easier and more relaxed than gen chem lab, but you'll need to spend more time preparing for and learning the experiments each week. The final exam is pretty challenging\u00e2\u0080\u0094make sure you keep up with the post-lab review questions and things so that you're prepared!",
    "A good way to learn basic lab skills. Not much work.",
    "Yes, take it with the lecture. You probably have to anyway.",
    "222L is a great intro lab that teaches you important techniques. I would recommend it. It was decently easy and fun.",
    "A good accompanying lab to orgo 1. Take it if you are taking orgo.",
    "Chem 222L gives students the opportunity to apply the concepts they have learned in organic chemistry lecture. Hands-on experimentation really solidifies some concepts that are introduced in the lecture. The course may get repetitive at times, and you may find yourself writing the same thing twice or even three times just as a \"busy work\" requirement, but the time you spend in the actual lab is very rewarding and fun.",
    "I would recommend this lab! It was great!",
    "It's a basic course detailing some of the practical techniques needed for organic chemistry. I'd definitely recommend it, although you probably need to take it anyways. It's not too much work, Dr. DiMeglio is quite nice, and, at least for me, my TA was very helpful. It's not too difficult, as long as you are good with detail (always be careful), and it meshes fairly well with Chem 220. I'd certainly recommend taking them concurrently. It's not very stressful, unlike regular chemistry lab, and some of the labs are fun and interesting.",
    "Much better than 117L. You learn good techniques in a relaxed atmosphere. Overall good course.",
    "Do your reading.",
    "good course that is not too much work. I would reccommend this class to someone who is interested in learning about organic chemistry in an hands on approach or someone needed to take it as a requirement",
    "Great lab, very relaxed and informative",
    "I would definitely recommend Chem 222L to another student. It was so informative and overall just a great lab.",
    "As long as you do what you are asked to do, CHEM 222 will not be a terribly tough class. Just make sure to get prepared each time before going to the lab. The lab gets better and better as the semester goes!",
    "It's required if you're pre-med, but even if you aren't pre-med, any chem student should take this course because its graded nicely, and doesn't require a ton of work. Don't get me wrong though, it still requires effort.",
    "Like most lab courses at Yale, this class isn't going to change your life. It gives good basic insights into the practice of organic chemistry, and cuts a LOT of the pointless \"B.S.\" out of the lab (as compared to, say, gen chem lab). I found myself looking forward to lab on occasion, and found it to be pretty relaxing. They played super fun music the whole time, and the vibe of the laboratory was relatively enjoyable.",
    "Alternates between fun and dreary. Most labs are technique labs. Probably one of the better labs since you are not graded on product purity\/recovery rate, it's not really time pressured, and there are postlabs maybe every other week.",
    "Much better than general chemistry lab. Organic chemistry lab was also paired well with the lecture course. Professor DiMeglio was wonderfully relaxed and thoughtful in her instruction. I found it amazing how she tried to find time for all thirty or so students in my particular lab section. Each experiment was thoughtfully laid out and highlighted concepts and procedures very well. I learned quite a bit. The final was fair.",
    "I really enjoyed this lab, I thought the experiments were interesting in general, although some of them involved a lot of wait time.",
    "Chem 222L is a fantastic introduction to lab techniques and processes, and is quite helpful whether you already have lab experience or are just beginning. It also gives a practical significance to the topics from lecture.I would definitely recommend Chem 222L. For the above reasons. It's a good lab.",
    "It is a lab you have to take with orgo 1. Follows the class well, easy as far as labs go",
    "Gen Chem Lab might've been strenuous, but Orgo Lab is actually something you might actually look forward to.Makes the trip up science hill worthwhile.",
    "I think yes. It is a lot of fun, which I hadn't expected, and it helps elucidate the concepts.",
    "Yes, definitely. You'll learn a lot of hands-on and practical knowledge that solidifies the lecture concepts very well.",
    "CHEM 222L was a great introduction to organic chemistry lab techniques and experiments. The workload was very fair, the instructors very accessible and helpful, and the experiments themselves enjoyable. Definitely had a great time and am looking forward to the continuation lab.",
    "It's not a bad lab course. It's more relaxed than general chemistry. You're most likely in as a requirement but it's definitely manageable. Make sure you review for the lab final.",
    "I would recommend Chem 222L to another student."
