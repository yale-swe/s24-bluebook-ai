    "Turkish is a beautiful language, and this class will open up a lot of opportunities for you - you'll learn a lot about Turkish culture with Etem, and you'll definitely have summer fellowships and programs lined up for further learning and immersion, which is really the only way to learn a language. Etem doesn't assign a lot of work, but you'll really only get anything out of the class if you actually engage and put in the time it deserves - it's not an easy language, but it's so worth it!",
    "10\/10 language class. Etem is an amazing teacher, very funny and knowledgeable. No real complaints for this class, we have learned a lot and had ongoing feedback the whole time. Etem even organised an outing to a Turkish market and restaurant, and was always upfront about opportunities to study abroad. Would recommend to anyone considering taking up a language here in Yale.",
    "This class is great! Etem always keeps things interesting, and while the workload is very manageable we did learn a fair bit of Turkish.",
    "Turkish is a solid course. Etem is a good professor - occasionally abrasive, but is invested in his course and his students. I'm not one for foreign languages, but I've enjoyed fulfilling my requirement with this class.",
    "TKSH 110 is an introductory Turkish class that is all about learning the Turkish language and we often times dip into culture, geography, history, and cuisine. It's a straightforward and fun class, and I have already recommended it to people. Plus, anyone who has been following the news in Turkey would probably realize that Turkey is going to become a more important nation and culture to consider as time goes on."
