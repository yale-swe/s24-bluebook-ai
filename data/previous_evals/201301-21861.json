    "Gman 160 is a German cultural history course that focused on the periods before and after WWII. We began with the Weimar Republic, then progressed to post war Germany and finally spent some time talking about the 60s and 70s. We read several novels and watched numerous films from or about these time periods. The great part about the course is that the students had a great influence on the direction of the course. When we got bored with the Weimar Republic, we could move on to the new German cinema, and then on to the extremist student movements of the 70s.",
    "It's a great view of German history and culture and Frau Gehlker said she'd be adding a grammar section next year, so it'll be a great class! I'd definitely recommend it.",
    "MG assigns a lot of work, and you should do it, because it's pretty obvious when you don't--there won't be too many people. Luckily, the work is pretty fun for the most part. Lots of movies and more contemporary literature than most other German classes here offer.",
    "Absolutely take it! A great overview of German culture and history, as well as everyday life. Taught by a native speaker, may be tough at times and requires a lot of effort, but you will definitely feel your German improve while learning a lot about the country and the culture!"
