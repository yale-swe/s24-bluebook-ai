   "comments": [
    "Definitely recommend it. It's like a history class with a twist.",
    "American Cultural Landscapes is a great introduction to the history of the built environment. I hadn't taken a social sciences course before, so part of the work of the class for me was figuring out how to balance the various history, theory, and design elements involved. I think I learned a lot from connecting spatial and conceptual patterns in these new ways. I would say that the ideas from the class will stay with me and continue to influence the way I think about the subject matter of other courses and the way I approach the landscape in general. I would highly recommend it.",
    "It's a history of cities and suburban growth. If you're into that, you'll like the class. I'd recommend it absolutely, but I had been wanting to take the class for a while and it only fit into my schedule this semester. Don't be daunted by the first assignment; it's easier than you think. The readings are by and large interesting as well, and Hayden knows everything.",
    "Yes, interesting writing credit without too long of a term paper to hand in at the end.",
    "Definitely take it if you are interested in how we live in this country",
    "If you want to understand why the US landscape (suburbs, highways, cities) looks the way it does today, take this class! It raises one's awareness about our environment and surroundings",
    "I would recommend this class for anyone interested in the development of the landscape of the US. At times the material could get a little dense, or seem unrelated but Professor Hayden would later connect it to a theme in the course and it all would make sense.",
    "Great class! American history through the perspective of changes in the landscape. Interesting readings, engaging lecturers, flexible final paper.",
    "Yes yes yes",
    "I would recommend this class whole-heartedly. I took the class on a whim because the syllabus sounded interesting and now I'm going to be an American studies major. The class is amazing because you can see what you learn about all around you: the way roads were built, why shopping malls are where they are, the effects of public transportation. It really is a perspective-altering class. You gain a whole new lens through which to view America.",
    "Overall, a good survey of the urban and suburban history of America. I wouldn't say it will \"change the way you look at everything!\" like some other reviews have, but it definitely gives you a new perspective on some specific aspects of the urban and suburban landscapes as covered in the course. I'd recommend taking it if you're doing urban studies or architecture as part of your larger course of study. But if this isn't your usual area of study and you're just looking for something interesting, a different survey course like New Haven and the American City might be more up your alley.Not too much work. If you keep up with the readings, you'll be totally fine. Both papers are pretty open-ended in terms of what you can write about, so you can choose something that interests you.",
    "I would recommend the class; It gives a good overview of the development of the American Landscape. I would stress it as an overview, however, in that the main goal of the course was to grasp overall concepts and trends, rather than looking extremely in depth into any one time period.",
    "I do recommend this class if you want a unique perspective of American history from the perspective of a very knowledgeable, and interesting professor.",
    "I highly recommend this class",
    "If you find the material in the syllabus interesting, then you should take this class. I really learned a lot about the built environment of America, and I think about the information we learned in class a lot whenever I travel and pass by neighborhoods and cities. The class is a lot of image analysis, and it was more visual than I expected. Its a good writing credit - you have to write one short paper and one longer research paper on a topic of your choosing. The class really tries to structure the writing process so you complete the paper in steps, and this forces you to start early and not procrastinate. It was actually a pretty enjoyable writing process, and there are tons of interesting topics to choose from.",
    "Take it if you are interested in the material. It was definitely my favorite class of the semester. A lot of assignments, but they are spaced out evenly so you never feel too overwhelmed.",
    "I really enjoyed this class. Its a great introductionto major themes in American Studies. Professor Hayden does a great job linking her lectures to the readings, and also with choosing readings that are so important to whatever field they are in that they are cross-referenced by other texts within the syllabus. Taught in this class is a new form of primary source analysis (of images) that had never been a focus of any of my history classes before, but I can see the usefulness and originality that it creates now. Overall, this course comes highly recommended",
    "This was an amazing class and I wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone. Professor Hayden is an amazing lecturer and the material is really interesting. All of the readings are relevant and I learned so many cool stories and facts. This is probably one of the best classes I've taken at Yale, and while I didn't take it to get a writing credit, this was better than some of the WR classes I've taken. The entire class is over and you will have a grade by the middle of reading period - as a student in the middle of reading period right now, I can assure you that is a godsend. While the final paper is due before Thanksgiving and that is slightly stressful if you don't plan right, having that extra week to not worry about another class is amazing. Take this class! So interesting.",
    "Yes, I'd recommend it. I wouldn't call it unmissable, but the readings are interesting, lecture is pretty alright, if repetitive, and it wasn't too much work. A good 5th class.",
    "Professor Hayden delivers a history of the evolution of the American built environment with a focus on the evolution of suburbs. The readings are great, the early and middle lectures can be a bit patchy at times, but the workload is just about ideal in that you can push yourself with the assignments if you so wish and have a good deal of good reading available but it's not a large amount of required work that will create undue stress. If you want a good survey of the history of America's built environment, take this class. I hope they make it a history credit by the time you take it.",
    "I would recommend the class. For me it was a fantastic crash course in American history through the lens of the built environment. It really helped me to begin to understand spatial politics.",
    "American Cultural Landscape is a great course and was probably my favorite of the semester. I have always been interested in issues of development and transportation, and this class did a great job covering these topics to show how the American built landscape has changed over the last few centuries. Dolores Hayden is an engaging lecturer with good anecdotes to share from her own research. She's one of the foremost names in the study of sprawl and the suburbs, so you're learning from someone very knowledgable about the subject. You also read her book, which is an accessible read and directly connects to the lectures. Between a short paper, a long final paper, and two midterms, the workload is by no means small but the assignments are well-paced and the exams are very fair. The weekly readings are occasionally too long but are usually not necessary to do well and contribute in section, although most of them are interesting. Definitely take this class if you have a chance.",
    "American Cultural landscapes is a great class\u0097definitely take it if you want to know more about why the built environment looks the way it does. It was my favorite class this semester. The paper is very open-ended so you can write about something that is interesting to you. Also, for a writing credit, there is not that much writing\u0097you have to submit a rough draft for the paper, but that is ultimately pretty useful. Professor Hayden keeps you interested with her fast-paced lectures and the variety of visuals that accompany her narration. You'll look at old illustrations, advertisements, films clips, maps, and photographs. You'll also look at the world around you in a new way.",
    "Yes, absolutely take this class if it sounds at all interesting to you. Professor Hayden is a great lecturer and discuss the history of communities and cities in America through a cultural lens. Starts off a little slow, but picks up and makes for a great interesting class.",
    "AMST 207 is a good course if you're interested in the development of the physical landscape of the United States and the effects individuals, groups, corporations, and politics have had on it. Even if you're not particularly interested in the material, the course is very informative and enlightening. If you've already taken a course that covers similar material, however, go ahead and skip this one. I found that most of the stuff I was learning was repetitive, and Professor Hayden isn't the most captivating speaker. The course wasn't too hard, though, and is a good was to earn a writing credit.",
    "Poorly organized lectures with a boring professor. If you're really interested in the subject, I suggest getting \"Building Suburbia\" by Dolores Hayden from the bookstore and reading it in your free time. Sections are a torture, lectures repeat readings word by word, the course is one constant frustration."
