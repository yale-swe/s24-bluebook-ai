    "French 160 is a good French course for a student who already feels comfortable with French grammar and wants to simply become more comfortable speaking French conversationally and be able to understand the language's country of origin and it's function in the modern world better. I would definitely recommend it.",
    "An intensive class that provides a lot of practice in conversation and listening, in addition to providing a great overview of French cultural\/political history. Considerable workload. Make sure to browse classes to find a good professor.",
    "This is a great class if you want to improve your conversational skills. You'll be forced to talk a lot, even though it's only 3 times a week there's still quite a bit of work to do, usually about 1 to 2 hours per session.",
    "I would recommend it to anyone who wants to improve his or her speaking ability and\/or expand his or her knowledge of French culture.",
    "French 160 is a good consolidation of French language abilities. It also serves as a good introduction to current events and contemporary culture. There's a lot of time to practice speaking in class (my section and the ones I shopped were all small) as well as listening, reading, and writing in assignments. The workload is reasonable. I would estimate that I spent about 2-6 hours\/week on homework and studying.I'd recommend it to someone who has the level. You definitely don't want to take it if you're unsure of your language because you won't get nearly as much out of it if you're struggling too much with the basics of understanding what's being discussed. If are already familiar with contemporary francophone culture\/issues, you might want to look at different courses, but this one does have some interesting material.Fanny is a good instructor. She grades fairly, and is always thorough with feedback.",
    "Yes--it was beneficial to learn French cultural idiosyncrasies through typical media channels."
