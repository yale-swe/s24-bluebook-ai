   "comments": [
    "A very relaxed and fun Spanish class - a great way to get that language requirement out of the way if you don't want to spend so much time writing papers and feel a bit shaky on grammar. We spend most of the time just talking, with a few written, paragraph-long assignments (the workload overall is pretty manageable). Grading on oral exams and other spoken tests can be a bit tough - you do have to be careful not to make too many grammatical errors, which can be hard when you're speaking. But overall the class is very fun, and Prof. Seymour is very kind and helps to create an atmosphere where you're not afraid to speak up, even if your grammar is wrong. I'd definitely recommend it to people who aren't looking to major in Spanish or take a very intense course - and it really does help to improve your conversational skills!",
    "Spanish 150 is a worthwhile course. If you're looking to improve your speaking and conversational skills, definitely take it. Just be warned that there is a very heavy emphasis on speaking and active participation. The workload is very reasonable although the activities and oral exams can at times be somewhat stressful. Additionally, Professor Seymour was excellent: she was always very helpful, approachable, and caring.",
    "Spanish 150 is useful to maintain Spanish knowledge\/grammar\/vocab and to practice conversing. I would recommend it for another student.",
    "I highly recommend SPAN 150, especially with Prof Seymour. I took AP Spanish in HS but could not speak comfortably because all I did was reading \/ writing -- the class really helps your verbal fluency because you speak for almost the whole hour+ every class. I did not like language in high school but this class was incredibly interesting -- we had debates about euthanasia, read interesting (but difficult) novels, learned about indigenous rights, etc. I never imagined myself being able to do all this in Spanish. Homework is fairly time consuming, especially if you don't have much vocab, because you're going to have to look up a few words every sentence. However, it's generally a very interesting reading. There is some written homework occasionally, but not too much. The class environment is great, you really get to know your classmates because it's a small class (~15 people), and Prof Seymour creates a comfortable environment where you can speak freely and make mistakes, etc.",
    "Spanish 150 01 does not have any surprises. The class does not emphasize grammar, but rather makes you comfortable with the language if you have been away from it for a long time.",
    "Span 150 is great for a distributional requirement and is fairly enjoyable. There are no tests (only 3 vocab quizzes and oral exams) and the content of the class is unobjectionable. You get to watch some interesting movies and read some interesting literature. If your sole goal is to learn Spanish, though, you'd be better off finding a fluent friend and hanging out a lot more.",
    "Don't take it unless you want to get your L5 req out of the way. Your spanish will improve A LOT, but it will not be an enjoyable process.",
    "This is a great class if you haven't taken spanish in a while and want to become a more fluid speaker. If you're feeling apprehensive abut starting at L5, definitely take this class.",
    "Doesn't really help.",
    "Advanced Conversational Spanish was difficult and intimidating at times but was greatly rewarding. I strongly recommend this course for the quality of its teaching and the leaps and bounds in speaking and comprehension ability that it teaches.",
    "Spanish 150 is an intensive course that requires analytical readings and more or less well-developed conversational skills. As a heritage speaker who hadn't taken a Spanish course in over two years, I was actually quite challenged by the material at hand, and I'd suggest taking a grammatically-focused course before this one. I'd definitely recommend it to another student who wishes to fine-tune their conversational Spanish skills in a warm, intimate atmosphere.",
    "Spanish 150 is a great intermediate course that allows students with different backgrounds in Spanish to all better their speaking skills at their own pace. Since conversation is usually the discipline that is least stressed at the high school level, this course helps the student to bring their speaking skills up to or past the level of their writing and reading abilities.The workload is very manageable, with usually only a small bit of reading to prepare for discussion each class. The in-class discussions are mostly low-key, except for the panel discussions and debates, which are more formal but also really fun."
