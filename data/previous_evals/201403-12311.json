   "comments": [
    "Good survey of current events, very feasible work load, interesting lectures",
    "Great IR survey course. The workload is very light. Take it!",
    "International Challenges was an interesting course, especially after taking Intro to International Relations with Professor Howorth as well. Rather than being focused on theory, we discusses challenges facing the international community that are of great importance. I would recommend the class to any student who wishes to know more about the world that we live in because it helps to give students insights on a wide range of topics. Overall, the class can help make you a more informed citizen not only of this country, but also of the world.",
    "A forgettable fifth class. Use it wisely, in times of need.",
    "The class is very little work and you do not have to go to section. The material is pretty straightforward and not especially challenging, but I do not feel that I learned a lot from the class.",
    "Easy. I never went to lecture, nor did I read any of the readings, and still did really well on the midterm. The paper does not require that you do the readings either, so if you have a good bank of BS and some basic knowledge, take this course and get yourself that well-deserved A- or A.",
    "I would recommend it as an introductory course.",
    "Its pretty straightforward, after the midterm just show up to class and appreciate the lectures and listen for anything interesting because you wont need notes anymore just to prepare your research paper. Midterm was very fair, overall its not the greatest lecture but a good overview for anyone interested in Poli Sci",
    "Take this class if you wish to have a brief understanding of issues around the world for dinner conversations but don't expect to be an expert in these issues unless you pursue them separately!",
    "I would recommend this course to other students interested in the challenges we face in the 21st century. The work load was very light too, so that's a bonus.",
    "PLSC 143, or International Challenges of the 21st Century, is a class that addresses today global conflicts and issues, from water to cyber war.It's a lecture with little outside work other than readings, with a midterm written exam and final paper. I would recommend it, though be prepared to fight the desire to skip lecture, knowing that there really won't be any consequences. When you go, it's a good class,at least giving some exposure to modern day issues.",
    "good solid overview of global challenges. learned a bit, especially from the final paper",
    "Interesting lectures that do not necessarily build on one another -- walk away with a better though superficial understanding on each topic. There is certainly room through section, additional reAdings and final paper to explore a topic more thoroughly.",
    "Yes i would definitely recommend -- 1 midterm, section participation and a final 15 page essay, readings are all PDFs uploaded to classesv2 and not too much reading every week",
    "Great class! Every lecture covers a different international challenge - fracking, climate change, middle east etc. Midterm for 30% final paper(10 pages on one of the issues) 50% and 20% section participation",
    "Low work and you don't have to go to class to be prepared for section.",
    "A gut class. Discussions and grading depend on TA. Don't take this class if you expect to have insightful and deep conversations about the state of the world.",
    "Good class. interesting. not a lot of work. TAs make a big difference.",
    "Great class. This is more of a case-based and example-based class on international relations rather than theory-based, which I really liked. Note that the \"take home final exam\" is actually a final essay.",
    "YES!!! It's a great class where you will leave a ton about the world today! It will only scratch the surface and further frustrate you if you actually want to understand how the world works--so complicating and intricate! But great professor, very light workload and you'll learn a lot simply by going to lectures, skimming the readings and attending section!",
    "If you do not read the newspaper regularly, then this class is a good substitute for that if you want to become better aware of the major issues going on in the world today. If you do, however, then you may find yourself wishing that we dove deeper into the particular topics, since many of these topics could potentially have an entire semester devoted to them. Therefore, how much you get out of this class will depend on your prior knowledge. Professor Howorth is a good lecturer, section is interesting, and the workload is relatively light with a midterm and final paper. Overall, the class is pretty chill and I would recommend it.",
    "Yes",
    "I feel pretty neutral about this course. You can definitely get a lot out of it, but it involves putting in the work on your own and lucking out with your TA. The lectures themselves were not exceptional.",
    "Yes, it was an interesting class and pretty chill.",
    "Great survey course of the major modern international challenges. Good for an overview, although you often don't go too in depth because you're trying to cover so many topics. I suppose that's what the final paper is for. Work load was also very manageable.",
    "Yes - keeps you up to date with what is going on in the world",
    "I would absolutely recommend PLSC 143 to another student. It was a unique, effective way to gain a better understanding of the wide array of issues confronting the global community.",
    "This is somewhat of a gut course and is great if you are interested in poli sci but want a course with a small course load. Professor Howorth is a fun lecturer who summarizes large topics in small hourlong lectures. It allows you to really get a handle on issues facing the world in the coming decades. That being said, the discussion sections are not really intellectually engaging, which is unfortunate.",
    "Depends if you read the news and are a well informed person. If you're a regular Economist reader or other similar publication this won't be all that informative to you.",
    "This is a class that touches on a lot of international issues, and since so many issues are covered, not all of them are covered with incredible depth. It's definitely a very interesting class, as each week\/lecture you are introduced to a new part of the world or political order and you gain insight as to some of the biggest sticking points in international policy. I would recommend this class to students interested in international relations and current events regarding war, energy, the environment, or any global issue really.",
    "Great survey on Intl topics. I recommend this to plsc and non-plsc majors alike",
    "Take this class.",
    "Fantastic class- very relevant material and easy. Each lecture is a different global issue, and you will therefore learn so much about incredibly relevant problems. Sections are essentially talking about the news. Workload is low- just an exam and a final paper (though I suspect those will be flopped in the future to incentivize going to lecture). This was a perfect class.",
    "Take this class",
    "Take it if it genuinely interests you. Otherwise, there may be better IR\/political theory classes out there.",
    "This class is relatively easy but not the most interesting class ever. I learned a lot from doing the research for the final paper, but the lectures were kind of shallow and didn't cover the topics as in depth as they needed to be understood. Overall I'd say it was a good class but not amazing.",
    "Take International Challenges! Keep in mind that it is a survey course, so if you are knowledgeable about more than half of the topics listed in the syllabus, you might find it to be a bit redundant. That being said, the readings do allow you to go more in depth if you want to. Professor Howorth is a funny and charismatic lecture. The class consists of a fair midterm, section participation grade and a take home final essay of about 15 pages. Not bad at all. Definitely recommend!",
    "You don't learn that much",
    "I would recommend this class because it is a great way to learn about the world and the challenges we are currently facing.",
    "A good class to take if you want to learn more about current affairs and global challenges. The structure of midterm and final paper means that the class requires effectively no effort after the midterm.",
    "I would recommend it. I really enjoyed it, and it was very nice to not have stressful tests all throughout the year. The readings were interesting and fun to read, too.",
    "To be honest, it's a pretty weak and disjointed class - one of my classmates nicknamed it 'CNN' and I can't entirely disagree. I think that the concept is a good one; there are a lot of issues confronting us in the 21st century and the idea of learning about their causes and interconnections is appealing. But I'm upset that I learned everything I needed to know for the midterm and for the final paper without going to class for the last half of the semester - I think that lectures have a responsibility to enhance the readings and Powerpoints, and it felt like the Powerpoints contained the bulk of the information. To some this might be good, a gut that'll let you take it easy. Can't say I'm not grateful for that, but still. Bummer.",
    "I recommended the course and it helps give the bigger picture of international challenges.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It was a great medium for learning about current issues and histories on a deeper level.",
    "Good course with a light work load.",
    "Interesting class that allows you to know more about international relations. I would recommend this class to another student due to the information provided and the knowledge learned.",
    "A generally enjoyable course. Take it if you want a general overview of a lot of the issues in the world and don't already know much about this. Or if you need a social science credit. There isn't much work at all, but the grades vary pretty widely with TAs, with some much more willing to hand out As than others.",
    "This class is pretty easy, so if you're looking for a class to get a social science credit, try to grab it up as quickly as you can.",
    "A good introduction class to Political Science. Not a lot of work but definitely very interesting.",
    "PLSC 143 is a great introduction to global challenges and crises. It's extremely topical and taught by an incredible professor.",
    "I'm not a political science major and just took this course for funa nd to catch up on current issues, it was a perfect course for that.",
    "Take this class! Absolutely great class",
    "This class is a useful overview of current challenges and trends taking place in the world, why they exist, and the potential implications that they have for the future. These topics include: changing demographic trends, global climate change, the rise of non-state actors, the changing balance of powers between nations, the purpose of global or regional organizations, and much more. Take this in order to build a better understanding of the background behind current events. Professor Howorth, without a doubt, has done his research regarding geopolitical challenges, as well as how they relate each other, and will explain it in a comprehensive manner. One thing that I would have liked to see is the the Professor commenting on how different media sources are portraying these events.",
    "Take it!",
    "I would recommend it because you learn about current events and problems going on around the world.",
    "TAKE IT",
    "Must take. Midterm was easy, section is good, and paper isn't too bad.",
    "The title of the course \"International Challenges of the 21st Century\" is very accurate. If you are interested in learning about global politics, conflicts, and everything in between, then this would be a great course to take.",
    "Yes, I would recommend it as a survey course.",
    "Definitely recommend. Easy class, interesting material, manageable workload... Get a good grade and be able to speak intelligently about the world around you. What's not to like?",
    "Lots of information to cover. Class has interesting topics.",
    "Definite yes for those seeking a Political Science credit and a broad view of current world affairs.",
    "Interesting but gutty. The class serves as a great high level overview of some of the biggest issues of our generation. The midterm was disgustingly straightforward but, BE WARNED, your grade is almost entirely dependent on which TA you have because he or she grades your exam. Some TAs gave out multiple hundreds, others, well, did not. Find a good TA and you'll be laughing all the way to the bank. Find a bad TA and your GPA could lose a few pounds. May the odds be ever in your favor.",
    "Great class",
    "Take this course if you are interested in learning about the world that you live in. I think that a course of this kind should be required for every Yale student, as you explore many aspects of the pressing challenges facing the world today. It is a good fifth class, since you just have to go to lectures and there is not much work involved outside of class. There are lengthy readings, but only a few of them are truly important and insightful ones that you need to read. Basically, if you're looking for an extra course, take this!",
    "Highly recommend.",
    "General overview of the history behind and present day information about current events.",
    "Absolutely. Interesting course, not a heavy workload. I left the class feeling like I took away something useful.",
    "This class has no work and as long as you can study a bit for the midterm your fine. It seems potentially interesting but it is a boring class.",
    "This course is a great overview of the many challenges in the world today. While the topics are broad, a vast majority are covered.",
    "Take this class! I learned a lot about IR even though it's not my favorite. The workload is light so it's a great fifth class, and the lectures were engaging. You can miss one and not miss a beat, and it's a great survey of a lot of material without being too overwhelming. Take this!",
    "Int'l Challenges covered a LOT of material, and thus barely scraped the surface of any of them. The readings are pretty interesting - mostly just news articles that are good to read anyways. You walk away from the class with a vague understanding of the important topics at hand, but not fully understanding them. Definitely a good and interesting overview, but don't expect to be an expert by any means. Not that much work if you're looking for a fifth class, but grading depends heavily on TA.",
    "I would recommend it because you learn so much about the world you live in in just one semester so it is very eye-opening.",
    "An easy class that provides a good overview of current events. Interesting enough, and quite light work.",
    "Eh, a broad overview of things you probably should know about. As an American Studies major I am a little embarrassingly ignorant of some of the issues that international community faces. Now I can have cocktail conversation on almost anything, which is nice. As much work as what you put into it--you can learn a LOT if you do all the reading and show up to lecture. A very solid 5th class. Your TF makes a HUGE difference in what you learn, so shop if possible. The \"final take-home exam\" is NOT a test, it's an essay and it's harder than you think because it asks you basically answer the questions world leaders are asking based on 50 minutes of lecture material and your own research. In the end I thought the class was rewarding but I wish I had a better sense of what I was getting myself into when I registered for it.",
    "A very good survey of current issues and topics related w\/ development, security, foreign affairs, etc. One midterm and final paper, not bad at all. Unless you're versed in all areas of the world, there's setting for everyone.",
    "Good poli sci lecture. Good as a 5th class or low-stress class.",
    "Yes, I really enjoyed it.",
    "I would say it was interesting and manageable",
    "It was an interesting and valuable class for me because I didn't know much about the issues discussed in the class and had never taken a PLSC class before. It is definitely more of an introductory-style class, so you would be bored if you are a senior or junior PLSC major. But Howorth is great and I think everyone should know about the issues discussed in the class to be a truly educated global citizen.",
    "This is a class that has issues in modern day that range all over from the Ukraine crisis to global environmental problems. I have already recommended it to a friend.",
    "Absolutely take the class! It is a great way to figure out which areas of political science interest you most, and also a great way to learn about subject areas you might not otherwise study in a course.",
    "This course does a great job of surveying a wide range of international challenges. They are put into thematic categories to make them digestible. However, the strength of this class is also its weakness. Because there are so many different topics, you don't go in depth with any of them, so you only know a bit from many of the international challenges.",
    "It's an incredibly compelling course. Every lecture was different and interesting. However, this was also its weakness. No topic was ever given proper depth because we had such limited time for it. This is not necessarily bad; it allows you to learn the essentials about a vast number of topics in a limited time, which I really enjoyed. Just go into the class knowing what it is: a starting point for deeper research.",
    "Good class. Very engaging. Manageable workload.",
    "Yes it is a great class that I learned a lot more about current global issues.",
    "A very simple and easy class with some interesting material.",
    "The course was extremely interesting and pertinent for any student aspiring to be involved in a career involving politics, foreign policy, the military, and I would also add for anyone that would like to be a better informed citizen of the world. I would strongly recommend this course for any student to help them make better informed voting decisions throughout their life.",
    "Light workload and a good 5th class if the general topic of international challenges and politics interests you. The time put into this class is quite flexible. What you get out of this class depends on what you put in (whether you do the readings, participate in section, ask questions, etc.) and having a good TA.",
    "Straightforward and easy course that includes some really interesting material. Great for non-political science majors and those who want a surface level understanding of a lot of current issues around the world. There is the chance to delve deeply into one specific issue for the final essay\/exam."
