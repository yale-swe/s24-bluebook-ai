   "comments": [
    "The course offered me a chance to extrapolate key lessons in leadership from historical cases and readings and apply them to real life situations.",
    "This class walked the line well between philosophy, morality, and concrete skill-building. I leave the class knowing more about both successful leadership and myself.",
    "I genuinely think I became a better leader. This class was life changing, the best at yale",
    "I found this to be an incredibly instructive and thoughtful study in American leadership. Our philosophical conversations about leadership, its boundaries, methods, case studies, and role in our individual lives as students was enlightening.",
    "Through reading the historical case studies, interacting with classmates, and observing how Stan and Chris conduct the class, I think I got a good sense for what effective leadership looks like. I also think that the reflective component of the course was very valuable in that it allowed me to step back from my experiences and think about how I should try to lead going forward.",
    "This course taught me a lot about myself, my personal leadership style, and helped me establish frameworks to understand the leadership styles of prominent historic figures.",
    "Leadership with Stan McChrystal and Chris Fussell was a mind-blowing course. It revolutionized the ways in which I think about leadership and reflect upon my own experiences as a leader. I cannot say enough good things about this course -- truly the opportunity of a lifetime.",
    "Self-reflection, key capabilities of a leader, approaches to crisis management and principles in building a team",
    "This course helps develop a deeper understanding of how organizations function, how leadership decisions affect others, and how an individual leader should approach complex problems.",
    "Personal reflection on instances of leadership in my life and how I would like to improve on them in the future",
    "I learned to think better about how to perceive myself. I am more thoughtful about how I can exude trust, and inspire confidence in others."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "As a seminar course, there was a lot of exchange of ideas and knowledge in the course that shaped my perspective on managing and leading people.",
    "I look forward to amending the diversity class, but the structure and makeup of the class were especially strong.",
    "Engaging, life changing, cant think of a weakness",
    "Outstanding course. It is rich in content and strikes a strong balance between classroom academics, reading, written assignments, presentations, and class trips. The class size is perfect, although I think more people would benefit from having the opportunity to take this class.",
    "Stan and Chris both come from a military leadership background. They are very transparent about the inherent weaknesses from that limitation. That being said, they design classes around universal (from what I can tell) leadership themes. The student body is always diverse and represents a really fascinating set of demographics and experiences.",
    "I believe the biggest weakness of the course to be its schedule, particularly not meeting on a normal weekly schedule. Its greatest strengths are the instructors themselves. Stan and Chris clearly put a lot of work into the development of the syllabus and are passionate about the subject they are teaching. You can tell they actually care about each individual student and make an effort to get to know everybody outside of class.",
    "I wish we would have read more classics for this class and then base our discussion on those texts.",
    "The course is one of the few at Yale that requires complete commitment to every reading assignment and discussion. This emphasis on personal responsibility was refreshing. The subject matter forces each student to make a genuine examination of his\/her beliefs and assumptions.",
    "I appreciate that the Course Assistants were constantly open to feedback and asking for how to improve the course.",
    "The course instructors are superb. Very little needs to be said about this. However, it would maybe be wise to try to advertise what the course will be about to get a wider pool of applicants."

    "Yes, absolutely. One of the best courses I have taken at Yale. It is also a great experience interacting with a diverse group of students.",
    "If you have the chance to take this class, don't miss it.",
    "Yes, it is the best course I have taken at Yale.",
    "For sure, do all the readings and come prepared. Stan and Chris are amazing. This class will change your life",
    "Absolutely, one of the best classes you will take at Yale. I found this to be an incredibly instructive and thoughtful study in American leadership. Our philosophical conversations about leadership, its boundaries, methods, case studies, and role in our individual lives as students was enlightening. Stan and Chris are earnest, honest, engaging, and have a wealth of experience and knowledge to share. Phenomenal course.",
    "Definitely. One of the best courses I've taken at Yale. I really enjoyed the reading list and seminar sessions. Stan, Chris, Lissa and Justin all did a great job at making sure that the course was well organized and structured.",
    "Absolutely. This is, without a doubt, the best course I have taken throughout all of my academic experience, both at Yale and at Princeton. The readings, assignments, classes, and instructors all complement each other perfectly to create a personalized educational experience which helps the student become a better leader and person, while creating a network that will last long beyond the class.",
    "I wish that every single student at Yale took this course. With the privileges that come from being a Yale student, we all assume a leadership obligation and responsibility whether we realize it or not. This course forces everyone to examine what that entails, how one will inevitably fail, and how to forge a vision for future growth. An absolute must-take course.",
    "Absolutely. I have already recommended the course to several people. It has been my best course at Yale so far.",
    "Yes, this is a very different course to those offered at Yale, but it is a very. good experience overall",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to any student at Yale. The caliber of instruction and student interaction is unparalleled.",
    "Definitely would recommend, it is one of the best courses I have taken here.",
    "Absolutely. I consider this course to be a sound investment in my future."
