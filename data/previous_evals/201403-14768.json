    "I would like to especially recommend this to female students who are just as intrigued about the ways our body systems work. Professor Valeggia is simply amazing.",
    "I almost hesitate to write how truly wonderful this course is, in fear that the course will be in such high demand that it'll expand into a large lecture, but in truth being a member of this course was a blessing. Professor Valeggia is the most inspiring, caring professor I've ever had. Every class began with ten minutes of meditation, which is representative of the degree to which Professor Valeggia cares about her students' well being. More importantly, the material is absolutely fascinating; I had no idea how little I knew about my own biology before taking this class. Professor Valeggia is a dynamic and personable lecturer, and if you're lucky enough to have a class as small as ours was (15 people), she'll go out of her way to get to know each person in the room. Take this class for the fabulous professor, but also to learn about yourself, your own biology, and how to best practice self-care.",
    "Arguably the most important class I've taken at Yale. I learned so much about a side of biology that is neglected from other courses. Prof. Valeggia is amazing and I cannot recommend the class enough. Seriously, take it.",
    "ANTH 230 has been by far my favorite class at Yale. You study women's health from a biocultural and evolutionary perspective. The information you learn is applicable to so many facets of daily life- from how to make better informed medical choices to how to have happier relationships. A great class for both men AND women!",
    "FANTASTIC. I cannot recommend this class enough. The material is absolutely fascinating, and the professor is incredible. Take this class if you have even a slight interest in evolution, anthropology, social structures or women's health.",
    "TAKE. THIS. CLASS. It's brilliant, it's fun, its exciting and it's SUCH IMPORTANT MATERIAL. We all (male and female) need to understand the female body and its capacities. We all need to understand how reproduction shapes our society. We all need to learn about evolution's role in our understanding of reproduction! TAKE THIS CLASS.",
    "AWESOME. Great prof, relevant and fascinating material, great classroom environment.",
    "Incredible professor- such a gem! Yale is very lucky to have her. Very engaging lecturer, well-organized material, appropriate level of difficulty. Fair tests that accurately assessed knowledge of the material, and compelling writing assignments. Professor was always willing to meet with students, give feedback on papers, etc. She even had us all over to her house during reading period for hot chocolate and great conversation! Really could not be happier! I would ABSOLUTELY recommend this class to a fellow student. Anyone really, but especially anthro majors, pre-meds, anyone interested in women's health\/ public health. Work consists of weekly readings (very interesting!), two midterms (non-cumulative, and no final), 2 short papers, and a ten page final paper of a topic of your choice. Very reasonable work load. Our class was basically seminar style, which was really great, but even as a larger lecture (as I anticipate it will be in years to come due to its success this year), it would be an excellent class- mostly due to the wonderful professor!!",
    "YOU NEED TO TAKE THIS CLASS. Reasons why: 1) It is basically a feminist consciousness raising group (boys, don't be scared away, because you can be feminists too), 2) It is a science credit that is accessible but also really interesting 3) Claudia is the best professor in the world, 4) You start every class with a 5-minute meditation, which I thought was silly at first but which turned out to be really really good for focusing on the lectures and just generally enjoying my day, 5) YOU WILL LEARN A LOT OF THINGS THAT ARE ACTUALLY RELEVANT TO YOUR LIFE, 6) You want to hang out with all the other people taking the class. I cannot recommend this class highly enough. We were lucky to have such a small group, but it will probably get a lot bigger once word gets out how awesome this class is.",
    "Absolutely talked this course! The professor is fantastic and the material is really interesting. Expect more of a seminar teaching style where you can always interact and interject during class.",
    "Yes!! I recommend this class to women because it is freaking amazing what the female body is capable of. I was always happy to be a woman but this class gave me a whole new level of approciation. It is also important for premeds and anth majors and public health people to take it. Valeggia is great at providing a history of why medicine and public health and anth has certain biases like being doctor centric (therefore male centric since doctors have been mostly men before women were allowed into the field) another one is scientific research has been recorded and done in modern times in western society it carries inherent bias for european decent women. So in short YES",
    "My friends called this my \"birth class.\" It was hard to discuss with people who weren't taking it, because they didn't understand what was so exciting about women's reproductive systems (and they also just didn't want to watch birth videos with me). This class was an excellent introduction to the world of biological anthropology. I would recommend it as a way to learn more about women in different cultures."
