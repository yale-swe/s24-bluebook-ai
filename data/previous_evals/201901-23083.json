    "Awesome course - I have an awesome teacher so for me it can't be improved.",
    "Strengths: Lessons for credit is a hallmark of the Yale experience for many undergraduate musicians. I'm so grateful that this course exists. Weaknesses: Richard Gard, though a nice guy, is wholly incompetent as the lessons-for-credit coordinator.",
    "strengths: -direct engagement, high accountability, immediate results, related to tangible performance requirements weaknesses: -lacks structure at times",
    "I think the greatest strength of this course is getting to meet your professor one on one every week for lessons. You get so much support from your professor and your studio. Lessons and studio classes promote a lot of growth. I have learned so much musically, and I get so much life advice from my professor. I don't think there are any weaknesses to this course.",
    "No weaknesses, Prof. Wei-Yi has been dear and insightful, very accommodating and reactive to what I have to bring to lessons."

   "comments": [
    "Yes - if you can take it then you're probably taking it because you know how great this opportunity is.",
    "Yes. I'm very glad I've been able to take lessons at Yale as part of my curriculum for the past four years. It has changed my life. Only at Yale could I major in a non-music discipline but still get enough music performance education to gain admission to graduate conservatory as a senior. I'm deeply grateful that this course exists.",
    "-yes, if they play an instrument",
    "I definitely would recommend this course. If you qualify to take lessons for credit, you probably have been taking music lessons your whole life, so I would recommend continuing. Lessons really enrich your life, and you gain a sense of community and advice. Also, there is a sense of independence because you have a say in what repertoire you will be learning during the year.",
    "If pursuing music, absolutely."
