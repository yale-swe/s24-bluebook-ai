    "The topic speaks for itself. If you're not going to do the reading, don't bother taking the course. Someone else will.",
    "Radical California-- you study how Radical California is \"radical\" in three different interpretations: on the fringes of things, in the center of things (\"radius\"), and awesome. You'll study race relations, skateboarding, conservatism (conservative party politics), radical environmentalism, Hollywood, sexuality, music, and more. Our year (spring 2010), a couple students led the discussion each week, and we had a final group project at the end of the semester. There was also a 15-page paper (which was a bit tough). Overall, an excellent class taught by an even better professor.",
    "Radical California was my favorite class of the semester by far! It's an awesome course that covers a really broad range of issues that are really intriguing. Whether you're from California or not, everything we talked about in this seminar was engaging and relevant. There's a lot of reading and having it once a week for two hours was kind of intense but totally worth it. Pitti's great; he was able to step in and guide the conversation when it slumped which meant that, for the most part, there were no awkward lulls in the discussion. The open-ended paper was long, but really allowed everyone to investigate issues that were important\/interesting to them.",
    "One of the most unique courses you will take, featuring most material you've ever wanted to cover if you're into radical things. Definitely recommend, especially if you haven't taken similar classes.",
    "Yes, definitely. The class atmosphere was pretty laid back, we read some great essays. I really felt as though I learned a lot about the state. Professor Pitti is great and super approachable.",
    "I would definitely take the class, but if you're not an American Studies or ERM major, I would suggest taking it Credit\/D. I come from a very different academic background, so I'm not familiar with the particular lingo and concepts of these majors (we talked a lot about \"negotiating space and place,\" which left me a bit slackjawed and confused). That said, not having to stress out about not \"getting\" some of these concepts and being able to focus more on the \"big picture\" led to a great experience.",
    "I highly recommend this class to anyone interested in U.S. history and culture.",
    "Radical California is a great class on really interesting materials and Master Pitti is of course an amazing professor. It's a good amount of work, but all worth it. Beyond the great discussions, take it just to take a seminar with Pitti. The final paper is flexible and you end up doing research on some really interesting topics - ranging from Prop 187 to sex work in California. Take this class (if you can get in!)",
    "Yes, take it. It's excellent if you do the reading and have something to say in class.",
    "Take it you will not regret it!",
    "It was quite scattered. I didn't understand how the weeks related to each other, and the readings in a single week didn't always make sense towards a single theme. That being said, Yale doesn't offer many classes on California, and if you already have a good background in California culture and history, you'll enjoy this class.",
    "It was very good! I highly recommend classes with Stephen Pitti, particularly of the seminar variety (haven't taken his lectures). He actually works to make worthwhile discussion happen, though sometimes he gets a little grad-class-y and has students lead the seminar, with mixed results. The reading and other material is chosen extremely well, and the papers are totally up to you (as comes fairly standard in AMST).",
    "This class was great, but be prepared to do a lot of reading and lead seminar once."
