    "I thought the way in which student projects were integrated into the syllabus was the course's greatest strength, but I also found myself wishing the course addressed a more diverse set of precedents and that topics were covered in lectures prior to hearing about students' research.",
    "i think the course is great in that it caters to people from many different backgrounds, and allows students to explore their own topics of interest. however, I also think it can be hard to bring everyone onto the same page in class, such as perhaps grad arch students are feeling less challenged and first year undergrads might be a little overwhelmed. but I do think the course did a good job of offering a lot of information and then letting people take as much as they would like from it depending on what level they were at with the topic and material, which I do think is what makes this course very strong."

    "Yes, absolutely. A great class, not just for architecture students.",
    "yeah, if you have any interest in religion or architecture, it's a course that melds together these topics to ask things like \"what makes a space sacred, if there even needs to be a space at all?\" Karla is a fantastic professor and is very patient and willing to work with students from all backgrounds. most of the course is spent presenting and listening to your classmates' research projects, which is a cool opportunity to learn from what other people are doing. the first half is mostly lecture though, which acts as a foundation to help approach some topics you might be exploring in your own research. I think it would be a great course both with someone with no architecture experience and someone who has been doing it for years -- both types of students will get a lot from this course."
