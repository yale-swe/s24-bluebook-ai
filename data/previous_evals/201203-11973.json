   "comments": [
    "Yes, if you are looking to improve your French in a challenging environment.",
    "It is a pretty classic French class in terms of things covered. It is a lot of work, but most of the work is kind of busy work, other than writing papers.",
    "Fren 150 helped me improve my French greatly, and I enjoyed it more than I did Fren 130 and 140. I think the is a lot of variety in the books and movies we cover in class, which made the class very interesting. The class is hard though, and there is a lot of work.",
    "This course is not for the idle student. It includes 5 written essays (about 3 pages each), 4 tests, and a lot of homework. If you want to move on to more literary French classes, but want to brush up on grammar, this course is for you. It's a bit of a French lit\/grammar fusion class.",
    "French 150 is a great class that will significantly improve your writing and speaking. Take it with Madame Schneider if possible; she is super dynamic, and class is always fun and engaging. The workload is heavy, but you get out what you put in to the class. There is a focus on grammatical accuracy and vocabulary acquisition, both of which are critical if you are trying to achieve fluency.",
    "French 150 is a class conducted fully in French that is intended to improve all areas of a student\u00e2\u0080\u0099s French\u00e2\u0080\u0094speaking, comprehension, writing, reading and grammar. Of these, however, writing\/reading\/grammar are the true focus, though you will pick up some good speaking practice along the way. The work in this class is more than I thought it would be, but never really excessive. I overall recommend this course to the student looking to become better at French, and especially the student that has placed into L5 but whose former experience with French is iffy.",
    "I would recommend it if you are willing to work hard to improve your french.",
    "This is a great class! Take it with Mme Schneider if possible because she is the best! She can be very rigorous, which is why you must spend like 2 hours to work for each class of the week, but you end up being very well prepared for the tests and the exams. She is also very kind and gentille, and very understanding, contrary to your first impressions of her."
