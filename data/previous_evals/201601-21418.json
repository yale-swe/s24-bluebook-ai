    "MATH 305 is a brilliant first course in real analysis that I would highly recommend both to any math major, and anyone interested in a first exposure to higher mathematics.",
    "I would recommend it, especially if Professor Minsky is teaching it. Having taken now a fair share of math courses here, I'm pretty sure Professor Minsky is the best professor in the department. He is incredibly knowledgeable and helpful, and is a master at lecturing--just an all-around great guy. The class goes over Lebesgue measure and integration on the real line, dabbling into Lp (just 1 and 2) spaces and Fourier series, before giving a taste of miscellaneous topics, like ergodic theory, general measure theory, Hausdorff dimension, etc. Homework was fairly chill: they take just a few hours a week, though one or two of the problems could definitely be challenging. One in-class midterm which was quite fair, then a take-home midterm and final that are pretty tough, but still fair and actually kind of fun. The final is a bit annoying though because it is during reading week. Beals, the textbook, isn't the best, but honestly isn't that bad. All in all, amazing course.",
    "Together with Math 370, this class was a highlight of my semester. You should definitely take it not only because the material (Lebesgue measure, Lebesgue integration, Fourier analysis, and Hausdorff measure) is interesting and important, but also because the class is very well-taught. Minsky is a very clear lecturer, and he explains every single detail in the proof as well as the significance of any hypothesis that we're using which is super helpful. I took this class straight after Math 250 without doing 301, and despite some problems at the beginning I was able to succeed it, so if you don't want to have a class Peter Jones, don't hesitate to skip it and take 305.",
    "The lecture is great; Prof. Minsky is organized and clear, excellent at motivating the material. Problem sets are challenging, but doable probably about 8 hours each. A handful of questions from the Beals textbook and then two or three of his own. An in-class midterm, a (rather difficult) take-home midterm, and a take-home final. If you can, take this course with Minsky.",
    "This is a good class, especially when taught by Minsky. It thoroughly covers Lebesgue measure and integration, then going into Fourier series, then more general measure theory. Through this class, I have a newfound appreciation of the real numbers and their intricacies. The workload is quite reasonable, lower than some other core math major classes (350, 370), but still take several hours. Minsk does a very good job teaching, he is a clear lecturer, doing a good job explaining the intuition behind things. He also engages the class more than any other math professor I've had, asking us questions and for ideas as to how to prove things. This still is certainly a lecture course, but a comparatively interactive one. There is one in-class midterm, a take-home midterm, and a final. The take-home ones are time consuming and difficult, but quite doable.",
    "Lectures are great and psets are hard and time-consuming, but a definite must-take for math majors.",
    "I was skeptical of analysis before this class, but Minsky makes it a really beautiful, coherent theory. Fourier Series was actually super cool, which was surprising given my original experience of it in physics classes.",
    "Take this class if Yair Minsky is teaching it! It was easily my favorite math class at Yale. Minsky is an incredible math teacher, and he doesnt rush through the material as many teachers do. Instead he slows down the pace a bit and makes sure that what he is teaching extremely clear and understandable. You still get a nice sense of challenge and accomplishment because the homeworks and take-home exams are challenge, but if you put the time and effort in they are definitely doable. I loved the homeworks and take home exam questions because they are the type of Math questions that make you feel like you are really smart and give you a strong sense of accomplishment once you solve them, but they are not impossible to solve if you put in the time and effort. Also this class has only one in class exam worth 20% of your grade and the rest of your grade is based on homeworks and take-homes so if you dislike in class exams or final exams this class may appeal to you even more.",
    "Math 305 was an excellent math course. Professor Minsky is by far the best professor in the math department (clear, smart, reasonable expectations, very helpful to students in a very kind way-I felt comfortable asking him questions even when I was confused and he never made me feel like I wasn't talented or wasn't smart just because I got stuck). This course covers interesting material and lectures are very engaging since professor Minsky expects students will participate actively in lecture. He also has interesting problem sets. The one caveat I would say is this course IS a lot of work. It gets less work reviews than other math classes since 1) Professor Minsky is very clear with expectations for assignments and there are usually not mistakes and 2) compared to other courses in the math department it doesn't feel quite as much like a race to give as much work as possible. However, the Problem Sets, even though well thought out and constructed, are still quite time consuming some weeks. Additionally, while having take-home exams for the second two is a far better way in my opinion to test math aptitude than in class tests, these tests both took up all of my time while I was doing them since they are difficult. That being said, just don't be deceived by the work reviews; it is still a lot, just in a better and more friendly way than most math classes (I really enjoyed doing all the work).",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend I really enjoyed the course and would rate it as one of the best math classes I have taken. I found the material very interesting (measure theory, Lebesgue integration, Fourier series, etc.), class very engaging, and the homework, while challenging and rather time-consuming, manageable if begun in advance and very helpful in reinforcing the material. Pace and content of the lectures was excellent, and I found Professor Minskys style of teaching by motivating most of what we covered with examples, guiding questions, and overarching concepts very engaging. Professor Minsky is also extremely approachable with questions and clear and engaging during class. This year, two of the three-exams were take-home, which I am undecided on how I feel about: while it allowed for testing more challenging problems with much more time, they were also very time-consuming, which is difficult to fit around other responsibilities, especially during midterm and finals periods. I also felt the exams were weighted too heavily relative to homework (only 20%) in the final grade, but overall I really enjoyed the course."
