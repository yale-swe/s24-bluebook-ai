   "comments": [
    "This class gave me a great general overview of the major works in Latin American literature from the 19th and 20th centuries. I know feel like I could have a dinner conversation about this literature, and throughout the class, I learned a great deal about Latin America's history which is of invaluable use to me. I also strengthened my Spanish reading skills.",
    "This class is good if you're looking for a strong foundation in the big names of Latin American literature, as is probably obvious from the title. Professor Echevarra is certainly a force, and he is interesting to listen to both because of his personal involvement with the authors that you read and the long-studied theories he has about their work. It does get a little frustrating if you're trying to really learn the language, because there are few opportunities to speak outside of section. It's also not a great environment to make you a better writer in Spanish if you aren't willing to go in to office hours.",
    "I read a lot of great works of Latin American literature",
    "I became much more familiar with Important Latin American texts as well as the historical contexts. I think I got better at reading Spanish, but my speaking skills didn't improve very much.",
    "Learned about an array of authors from the Latin American literary canon from the 19th and 20th centuries.",
    "My Spanish reading comprehension improved and I learned to analyze literary texts in the context of Latin American literary history.",
    "I grew a lot in my understanding of Latin American literature and culture in the nineteenth and twentieth century."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The strengths of this course are that Professor Gonzalez Echevarria is very knowledgeable in the field of Latin American literature, and his historical contextualization at the beginning of each semester helped me to understand each of the works better. I enjoyed the assignments because they let me focus in on and interact with a few pieces that I now feel particularly comfortable with and feel like I could talk about at great length. The weakness of this course is that it is a semester long. I felt that we went very quickly through the works when just one could have been discussed throughout an entire semester. Also, the sections were helpful in terms of preparing us for the tests, but not really in discussing the greater ideas of the course. I would have enjoyed more discussion-based sections.",
    "It is so hard to be engaged in class. Basically the professor lectures to class about the authors, context to reading, etc. There are NO slides\/powerpoints, hardly any handouts, etc. It basically is a lecture because there are hardly any opportunities for students to say anything. And there is a TA with \"optional\" section that is NOT optional because your participation grade depends on it. If you want a seminar this is definitely not the class for you. It is a lecture with less people in it. If you want to improve your Spanish speaking abilities, this is also not the class for you. Your reading ability grows but that is it. You are expected to be fluent by the time you get to class.",
    "I found it hard to participate because it was more of a lecture than seminar. We were graded on participation, but it seemed like we were expected to just chime in rather than answer questions which I struggled with a bit. Overall I really liked the class.",
    "Good selection of literature, although a little light on female authors especially since there were more female authors in the 20th century.",
    "You will get better at Spanish in not already fluent. You will read brilliant moving gorgeous important stuff. But! It will be fragments from across one and a half centuries (a survey course...).",
    "RGE is a great lecturer and brings a deep passion for the class material. It would have been helpful to incorporate more chances to speak - class discussions and presentations - to keep class fresh and give students the opportunity to practice speaking.",
    "The course was well-designed. I enjoyed going to lectures and found the sections very helpful.",
    "I really enjoyed all the readings, and Professor Gonzalez clearly has a deep knowledge of and passion for the material. I wish that the class had had more of a seminar component, though, because there wasn't much opportunity to practice Spanish or discuss the things we read."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, especially if you are interested in Latin American history and literature in general. So much of Latin American literature is rooted in politics that this oftentimes felt like a history class for me. Apart from introducing me to some great texts, this class ultimately gave me a base of LA history from which I plan to expand my understanding.",
    "If you aren't fluent, don't take this class. If you want a seminar, don't take this class. If you want to practice speaking, don't take this class. If you want light workload, don't take this class. If you don't want section, don't take this class. If you are not a huge humanities person, don't take this class. If you want an engaging class with student input, don't take this class.",
    "A solid language credit. It's more of a historical\/cultural overview of major Latin American works than anything. Don't expect much analysis or critical thinking, but definitely a cool and enjoyable course to take.",
    "Yes! It was a great class. Sometimes the reading was a lot, but I enjoyed most of them. Two essays, a midterm, and a final.",
    "This is a good lecture style course to complete the L5 language requirement. If you want to practice speaking, then this is not the right course for you, but if you want to read and write, this is a good course.",
    "Yes",
    "Yes! RGE is HILARIOUS and a world expert. Lecture is pretty intimate. Our TA was rad. I got so much better at Spanish. And only two papers! Not bad!",
    "A great intro to contemporary Latin American literature from a professor with deep knowledge of the texts discussed in class. Every class has the same format so things can get a bit dry, but the lectures and section will give you a new appreciation for literary traditions and movements. There are many opportunities to improve your reading and listening comprehension, but few chances to work on speaking."
