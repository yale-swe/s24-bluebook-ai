    "Very interesting class that really challenges your ability to think strategically, though not an easy class to do well in.",
    "Definitely recommend it.",
    "I would recommend this to any math-oriented econ major looking to learn about an interesting application of logic to economics. I was deciding between this and Econ 351, and this turned out to be much less work while also being challenging enough for the semester. If you have lots of room in your schedule, you might want to try 351, but this class definitely fit my needs.",
    "I had apprehensions about taking this class given the reviews of its past iteration, but I'm really glad that I decided to take it. The material itself is interesting, but I particularly enjoyed taking the course with Prof. Nalebuff. He says from the beginning that the goal of the class is to change the way you think (or at least to give you the ability to do so), and it definitely happens. It's not just the course material, but it's Prof. Nalebuff himself. He thinks and teaches in a different way from all other professors I've had at Yale. He may not be the most pleasant person on a superficial level, since he's not afraid to flat out tell you that you're wrong when you are, but he's genuinely invested in teaching his students, and he's willing to push you. Also be prepared to be wrong, because he cold-calls in class. He's also straight up crazy smart and remarkably successful. Not everyone's gonna like him, but if you try to understand why he does what he does, you'll learn a lot. It's definitely a class worth taking, but I'd also recommend taking it Credit\/D. Problem sets cover material that you're only about to take in class, so not having to worry about your grade really lets you enjoy the material. Great class, but take it Credit\/D, and be ready to learn in a way different from how you learn in other classes.",
    "Game Theory with Barry Nalebuff. I am using this course evaluation to get a semester of stress and anxiety off my chest. This the hardest class I have taken at Yale. The material is inherently difficult, but the professor Nalebuffs teaching style made it so much worse. Dont get me wrong, Nalebuff is a genius and a master of Game Theory. But hes not a good teacher for an introductory Game Theory class. Some students in the class already have a strong Game Theory background, and they did fine in the class. Those us of who only know prisoners dilemma and tit for tat from Intro Micro Econ, really struggled. Game Theory questions are essentially word problems that require a strong background in math. I havent done calculus since high school, but you need to be able to do first order derivatives, integrals, etc. A recurring issue for me with Game Theory is that I have no idea how to solve a problem on my own. When Nalebuff or the TA shows me how to solve it, then I understand. But each question is so unique, and the course doesnt provide you any clear cut methodology for tackling pset and exam questions. I understand the concepts but the actual math behind solving games is lost on me. Im going to list off some things that really made this class suck. In class: Slides are full of typos and math errors. Nalebuff goes through slides far too quickly and assumes everyone understands everything. If you ask questions, Nalebuffs responses are terse, impatient, convoluted, and reeking of intelligence. Occasionally, Nalebuff will use the white board to write proofs to demonstrate that a theory or something works. He spends several minutes going through the proof, but it doesnt teach us anything about how to solve pset or exam questions. Problem Sets: Nalebuff has this idea that students should have to tackle problems before ever learning how to solve them. So well have a problem set about Mixed Strategies, or Auctions for example, and then the next day Nalebuff will teach us what a Mixed Strategy actually is. Cold Calling: In lecture, Nalebuff will ask a question and then pick a student randomly to answer. When you dont know the answer and Nalebuff calls on you, he makes you think through the problem out loud in front of the whole class, and its really embarrassing for everyone. Nalebuffs examples in lecture mostly come straight from his book, The Art of Strategy. If you want to learn some Game Theory without all the math and stress, just read his book. Or you can take the class, get stressed out by the extremely difficult psets, and then listen to Nalebuff speak his book.",
    "This class is a great journey. In the beginning, Professor Nalebuff will scare off all those who are uncommitted, but he soon softens up and becomes an involved and caring teacher. The concepts you learn will fundamentally change how you see the world around you, particularly your interactions with other people. Definitely a highly recommended course.",
    "Definitely recommend. It's a tough class, but totally worthwhile. And I think Nalebuff is one of the coolest professors you'll have the opportunity to learn from at Yale. The course is demanding, but if you put in the effort to understand the important core concepts (backward induction, negotiating with a \"pie\", mixed strategy and simultaneous game strategy solutions, etc) - and he and our TF were great resources, especially one on one - everything is doable. He designs the course knowing that it is hard, and compensates for this with several grading policies that do not over-penalize. Prepare hard for exams because the time constraints on those are, in my opinion, unreasonable, but if you know right away what to look for and what strategy to use, you will have better intuition on how to solve the problems when you read them.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone who is remotely interested in game theory. As long as you have the patience this can easily be one of the most enjoyable classes at Yale.",
    "A great social science if you enjoy mathematics. You get out what you put in, so you can either skim by, or delve deep, or some combination of the two. Try to look for applications of the material outside of class, you might find it fun like I did!"
