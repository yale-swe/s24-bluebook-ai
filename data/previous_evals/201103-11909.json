   "comments": [
    "This is a great class for someone interested in the traditional literature of India, China, and Japan (or really, even any single one of those three), as the title would suggest. Chinese non-Buddhist philosophy is confusing as all hell, but it's worth plodding through that for the great readings (Genji and Heike for Japan; Mahabharata and Ramayana for India [plus other stuff, of course]; Analects, Mencius, etc for China). The workload is on the lighter side - a 5-7 page midterm paper on India; a 5-7 page final paper on China and Japan; and 1-2 page reading responses every week. Personally, I find Yale's love affair with the Greco-Roman tradition (ugh DS) rather silly; this class gives you a great opportunity to get another perspective on the world.",
    "This was a wonderful class. Great reading material; the books are just incredible. If you're like me and did DS, you'll find it's a very useful counterpoint to what we did last year -- not so much to show contrasts between East\/West, but more to really appreciate another philosophical\/literary tradition and see how similar sorts of questions can be considered in ways that are at once very different and very much the same. Regardless of whether you did DS, though, the books are still just works that really take your breath away.The teachers are both great and work very well together. The workload's pretty reasonable as well, although the reading can sometimes pile up, and the pace is sometimes a bit too fast to really be satisfying.",
    "I would most definitely recommend EALL 202 to another student. I feel like my reading and writing level has grown quite a bit. In addition the exposure to Eastern cultures through religious and cultural texts has enabled me to appreciate the cultures in a multifaceted way.",
    "This class is UNBELIEVABLY AWESOME. It's exactly the kind of class I hoped to take at Yale; it covers a wide range of traditions, but by no means sacrifices depth for breadth. You can only take 4 or 5 courses per semester, and this one is more like 3 courses than one--it's unbelievable.It's a lot of work, so be prepared to do a lot of (sometimes quite challenging) reading. That's what classes like this are for, though--to give you an excuse to read widely. The books are fantastic, too; I started procrastinating for other classes by doing the readings for this class.",
    "Amazing material! A good foundation to understanding more about traditional literature in these regions, and the seminar is always interactive and engaging. Professors Granoff and Shinohara are very learned and welcoming, which makes the class even more enjoyable. Be prepared for the reading (100-200 pages\/week), which may sometimes be opaque, but it gets better. I would recommend this course to anyone who wishes to learn more about the traditional cultures and religions in this part of the world.",
    "As a former DS student, I found this course to be a great introduction to non-Western traditions, and I would definitely recommend it to anyone interested in Indian and East Asian thought even if not very knowledgeable about the subject. The course is structured in a very interesting way and we are encouraged to explore the many connections between the texts we read. The amount of work is manageable, we have 1-2 page weekly reading responses and two 5-7 page papers which enable us to delve in more deeply into something we find intriguing (we pick the topic). However, there is also plenty of reading, which is actually very interesting, and it is kind of pointless to go to the discussions if you don't them. You just have to be careful not to fall behind, because they can be quite heavy sometimes.",
    "Definitely recommended. This course, as advertised, is a broad survey of texts from India, China, and japan. The course mixes literature, philosophy, and religious texts in an attempt to present a broad picture of the tradition. The texts were also fascinating, and all clearly fundamental to the traditions in these countries. Professor Granoff and Shinohara are both in the religious studies department, and so the course is more focused on religion than other course may be. The course is certainly not a religious studies course, though, as the focus is on the texts as literature and ideas, and only deals with the religions briefly. Discussions were well lead, and generally well focused on the texts. Both Professor Granoff and Shinohara provide their notes on the texts, and began each class with a help 15-20 minute lecture. The rest of the period was relatively freeform dicussion, but the professors tried hard to keep it organized. They are both extremely nice, and clearly care about the course a lot."
