    "I learned so much about how psychology influence the legal system. Lots of really interesting topics.",
    "How psychology intersects with the law, insanity defense, eye witness testimony, racial injustice in the justice system, death qualified juries, felony murders, etc. Cool information",
    "This course has very interesting material. I learned SO much about the law and the criminal justice system, having had no prior experience in this field.",
    "Great intro to a diversity of psych experiments and their implication on the justice system. Definitely developed my understanding of both disciplines.",
    "I loved learning about the content and found it incredibly interesting.",
    "I learned about the flaws that exist within the criminal justice system.",
    "I learned about different court cases that were related to psychology or social science in general. We learned a lot about factors and biases that influence different systems within the criminal justice system (jury selection, sentencing biases, etc.)",
    "In this class we learned a lot about psychology that comes into play in the criminal justice system. In many ways we could see how taking psychology into account may actually make the system more just however many of the biases we learned about that are ignored or go unaccounted for do a significant amount of harm and contribute to the injustice we see within that system."

   "comments": [
    "I do not understand how the grading works in this class. There is a startling amount of work, little to no feedback, and the grading system is massively unclear. She is not good at answering student questions.",
    "Strengths: material was so interesting and Prof. Lockhart made sure to draw connections between the material and current events\/social issues. I really liked how the workload was spaced out (longer reading-response type writing assignments each week and a final) because it was different from my other classes which made my entire semester more manageable. This was one of those classes where I just could not stop talking about what I was learning to my friends outside of class. Weaknesses: I guess if I could change one thing it would be a little more attention to language\/implications of the way people talk about those involved with the legal system. I think especially when looking at the environmental associations w\/ incarceration I felt like sometimes (mostly in this one unit) the language used reduced people to just a crime they committed. It felt weird to me to just refer to people as \"criminals\" or predisposed to \"criminality\", especially knowing the prevalence of racial bias\/police misconduct\/false confessions\/wrongful convictions. I thought the class was amazing and so influential and so informative but thought this unit didn't have the same structural awareness as some of the others.",
    "The weekly thought questions were very helpful in getting us to synthesize the material across lectures and readings. On the other hand, the final exam 1) required too much material for a 3-hour exam, as most people were unable to finish within the 3-hour allotted time slot and 2) seemed to emphasize memorization over understanding the material. In the future, I would recommend taking half of the materials\/questions from the final exam and administering them as a midterm instead.",
    "Strengths are that the information itself is interesting and the thought questions are cool ways to apply the information we are learning Weaknesses: lecture is incredibly boring, it is very difficult to engage in class, the final is also a ton. An essay would be better but the final is during finals period and is over so much information, includes so much writing and memorization it is not fun",
    "Strengths: interesting material and the weekly problem sets are actually very engaging and equally interesting. Weaknesses: lectures could get a bit dry and the final was a LOT of material to cover at a fairly high level of specificity.",
    "The material was interesting but I wish that the class encouraged more student participation and engagement with the material. Questions were rarely encouraged, as most of the class was a lecture. I think that having one lecture class and one discussion class a week would improve the course. There was no test until the final, which was a lot of material and required rote memorization more than critical thinking. I would have preferred two non-cumulative exams, as I think I would have learned and retained more.",
    "The content of the class is super interesting, but unfortunately it is very hard to stay focused and engaged in lecture. Professor Lockhart really knows her stuff, but sometimes it seems like an information dump. I honestly got more out of the readings than lecture.",
    "Strengths - super interesting material Weaknesses - rushed at times (but mostly great pacing)",
    "We got a little behind on some material towards the end. Some of the examples in class were uncomfortable, awkward, or confusing. The course also constantly casually runs through horrendous crimes without acknowledging how terrible they are. It is just off putting and can distract from learning. The course also presents a lot of information about the racial biases in the justice system but does not take any steps to criticize them. It would be helpful to just have blunt statements of criticism regarding the racial issues in the system.",
    "The strengths were in the material and the course engagement. I enjoyed writing responses every week so that I was on top of the material. The weaknesses were that the lectures felt like they were just read off of the slides.",
    "Amazing course. Very interesting and well taught. Kristi is an angel.",
    "I thought the thought questions were a good way of encouraging students to engage with the material. I think it would have helped if each day had a theme, it seemed hard to discern a start-point and endpoint of each section.",
    "The content of this class was definitely a strength of the class. The court cases are interesting and the psychological principles relating to the criminal justice system are worth learning about. The response questions were interesting, thought provoking, etc. and I learned a ton studying for the final. Unfortunately, I think that a main weakness of this course was Professor Lockhart's teaching style. While the content of the class incredible and interesting, the lectures were extremely ineffective and boring. I felt like Prof. Lockhart didnt really prioritize the development of our critical thinking skills or analytical abilities related to the topics and more so expected us to read her mind and regurgitate the answers she wanted. In regards to the thought questions while the prompts were clear I felt like she would take points off for missing small points that were unclear she would have expected us to write about in the first place.",
    "We learned a lot of information in this class but often times things became chaotic because the professor was trying to rush through to cover all of the material and seldom if ever looked up to acknowledge a raised hand or answer a question. It was taught like a lecture on high speed, which I can understand to a degree, however, there were moments for pause when the professor could have interacted with the class. But when it comes to places for improvement this is not the most important thing on the list. The way that some of the very gruesome, serious and difficult material was approached was discomforting in many ways. When discussing murders, rapes or innocent young black boys receiving the death penalty, I do not think it is appropriate for the professor to be laughing or presenting such material in a very dismissive way. The instances being discussed impacted real people and in other courses that classmates and I have taken that cover very similar material there has been much more respect shown in this regard. In a class like this there were multiple chances to point out where flaws and biases that we had discussed overlap or come into play contributing to the racial disparities seen in the US prison system, but I think that this was done poorly and could use development. I think that it is important to discuss racial bias and it should not be left out of the curriculum but I think that this section needs to be better researched, better presented and better integrated. Part of the research should be reflected in teaching technique because in many instances, the way that the material itself was being taught was reinforcing the very biases that it was teaching about. Several psychological studies have looked at how exposure to information framed in a specific way can impact implicit and explicit bias, one (that I can think of off of the top of my head) going so far as to look specifically at the way that material being presented in a classroom. I learned a lot in this class but I think there was a failure to push us to think critically about certain concepts, as so much felt unfinished in lecture and often comments were made or examples were used that were insensitive to say the least. Though it seems that the professor tries at times to get a pulse on the class it is never productive and seems to always fall flat. I think if these questions were taken more seriously by the professor and actually integrated into the curriculum it would be beneficial. I also do not think it is necessary to ask a classroom which black man looks more criminal and force them to choose using a clicker or to have exam questions that frame the issue as YOU being the person trying to fill a prison with immigrants. I think there are better ways to get the same answer\/ have students use the same knowledge or grasp the same concepts without doing exercises like these. Overall I had been very excited to take this class but because of the way the class was taught it really fell flat. I enjoyed the TQs every week and I did learn a lot in this class but it felt as though the individual learning was the most fulfilling and the frantic chaotic scrambling to get notes in class trying to follow the sometimes slightly circuitous lecture could be rather frustrating (especially when there were problematic elements in the lectures that were never addressed or simply tossed to the side as cursory\/ unimportant). In all honesty I expected more after waiting so long to be able to take this class. I think that if it is going to be taught like a lecture then it should just be a lecture. Finally I also believe the exam was far too long. Every person in the class left with a bad taste in their mouths because it did not really feel as though the exam gave us ample time space and opportunity to demonstrate all that we had learned. The exam was roughly 27 pages long, the multiple choice questions were not all formatted the same way and it was chaotic just like the class."

    "I would definitely recommend this course! I learned SO much and it was so engaging. I really liked the thought question\/exam setup because it balanced my workload nicely. Professor Lockhart is very cool and interesting. Loved the incorporation of in-class activities.",
    "It is an interesting class but be prepared to be really bored during lecture and to have to take a horrible written final. I would take this class but be wary of the final.",
    "I would because the material is extremely interesting and applicable, but just know that it can be a bit difficult to listen in lecture and that studying for the final is a grind.",
    "I might recommend it to another student, depending on what they want out of the class. It was less engaging than I had hoped, but I thought that the content itself was interesting. As a science student, I learned a lot about the law which was interesting.",
    "Yes - super interesting, not just for psych students.",
    "Yes! Loved the material.",
    "1000%. This is an awesome class. You learn so much about the legal system through a psych lens. Its just a page long reading response every week (which are easy) and a final which is a ton of material but not too bad. Kristi is an awesome teacher and does a great job lecturing. If you have any interest in psych or the law, this is a must-take.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. I think it is a great way to learn about how the legal system could improve using psychological principles.",
    "No, I would not. I would recommend other psych classes or bioethics if someone is interested in learning about court cases. While the content of the course was incredible, the textbook readings were interesting, and the thought questions were provoking, I think that Prof. Lockhart's teaching style was overwhelming, confusing, and difficult to follow her lectures. The final was extremely overwhelming and I felt like it expected us to memorize and regurgitate information rather than use our critical thinking skills. The review session was extremely overwhelming. There was a question on the final that also made me uncomfortable and I believe other students as well. It poked fun at McKinsey and asked us to take the role of Prisons Inc. and effectively assign the etiology of criminality to immigrant families to encourage them to end up in prison. We could give them anything adding up to $500 to help them land in prison. While the question was aiming to test the biological, genetic, and environmental factors of the etiology of criminality, it felt a bit inappropriate and like it was almost supposed to be funny but was uncomfortable instead.",
    "I would recommend it for the material but with the caveat that things need to change as far as presentation and organization. I urge the professor to reflect on how she presents the material."
