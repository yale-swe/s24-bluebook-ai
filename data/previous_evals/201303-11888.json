    "One of the best Chemical Engineering classes I've taken. A control design project caps off the course, which is difficult and very time consuming, but you truly learn a ton of skills from it that you WILL use in your future and can even talk about during job interviews. Difficult class, but important and rewarding. If you are thinking of doing ChemE later on this is the class to pay attention in.Most likely, you have to take the class.TIPS for success:-I know it is difficult to get started early on the design project (separations, electives, job interviews, etc.) but START EARLY and ASK ALTMAN for help and clarification. You will save a ton of time by doing the right task to start off with. Trust me, it is not fun to derive all the transfer functions to find out you did not have to do all that work in the first place.-Don't be afraid to ask questions (everyone is struggling with the difficult topic, believe me).-He will like you if you can make it to class on time, think of it as extra credit!",
    "This is a challenging but rewarding class. Professor Altman is very thorough and well organized. He was remarkably accessible while we were working on our final projects, answering emails and meeting with students at just about all times of day. The material can become a bit overwhelming, but when you start on the final project it begins to make a lot more sense.",
    "START THE FINAL PROJECT RIGHT NOW.\u00e2\u0080\u00a6But actually, follow the deadlines Altman gives, and ask as many questions as you need to because he is really nice and doesn't want the project to make you mad. Everything takes longer than you think it will so START EARLY. And STICK TOGETHER. You're all in this together.Also, read the textbook. I realized after the first midterm that I understood nothing, so I devoted a weekend to reading the textbook and going through all the examples. It makes so much more sense if you start with chapter one and read all the way through. Most effective weekend I spent all semester."
