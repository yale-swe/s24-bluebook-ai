    "Sooooo fun! Not too much work. Major project is a blast.",
    "Yes, I would absolutely recommend Health Psychology to another student! This class is amazing. I'm a psychology major and this is easily one of my favorite psych courses I have taken here. Professor Toll is a great teacher and truly cares about this subject so much, which becomes apparent immediately. The health change papers are a helpful way to understand the processes involved in health psychology. Also, the each class covers an important topic in the field, and due to the discussion based nature of the class, the hour and 15 minute period would always seem to fly by.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class! Not very academically challenging (in that you are spending hours in the library) but still useful skills are learned.AND of course the health change is really challenging (probably one of the hardest things I've ever done) but SO beneficial!",
    "Take it!",
    "Take it. You can learn as much as you put into it. Midterms can be pretty challenging if you don't pay attention.",
    "You will probably get the most out of it if you are interested in clinical psychology, especially regarding therapist and patient interactions, and a variety of life problems.",
    "Good class! It's pretty repetitive but not too hard. However - it is INTENSELY focused on actually teaching people how to become clinical psychologists - so if that's what you want to do, it's great. if not you might be bored.",
    "Pretty easy class with interesting material. The self-change project is nice and the topics covered are extremely relevant. It gives you a good sense of what applied psychology is like. Take it!",
    "This is a great class for anyone thinking about going into the health professions because it provides an opportunity to learn important techniques for talking to patients, especially those with health practices that can be changed. It is a small class and the discussion is lively."
