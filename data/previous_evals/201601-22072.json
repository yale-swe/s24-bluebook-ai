   "comments": [
    "A class on abnormal psychology. Probably some \"triggering\" stuff in there somewhere. Idk.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student, though it is much more work than you may think. There is a lot of information and details covered, and you need to really master the material to score well on exams. There are 2 exams (non-cumulative) and an essay, so the workload is definitely manageable but you need to study really hard for the exams. It is quite fascinating material though! And the textbook is top-notch.",
    "Jutta is the best! Took this class as a second semester senior and thought it provided a great overview of mental illness.",
    "I would recommend this class to students who are interested in learning about specific disorders. If you are genuinely interested in abnormal psychology then the material during lecture might not be so dry, but if you are on the fence then the lectures may be a little hard to focus through. But overall I would recommend this course to student who are interested in disorders and diagnoses.",
    "Yes - interesting material and straightforward requirements.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to a fellow student, especially if he\/she wants to understand more about psychopathology!",
    "If you want to learn about the etiology of, treatments for, and symptoms of various disorders and have a better understanding of why certain individuals with mental illnesses behave in the manners that they do, take this course.",
    "2 decently easy exams and a laughably easy essay. A perfect class to Credit\/D, whether or not attendance counts toward your final grade. Can't say I learned much, but hey, you gotta do senior spring right.",
    "Super interesting and easy class about different psychopathologies.",
    "This class goes through many disorders of the mind in a very boring, textbook fashion. The lectures are monotonous do not stimulate any appeal to learn the material. I do not recommend this course. You can probably get a greater appreciation for this field of psychology through doing personal research and watching YouTube videos",
    "Yes!",
    "Yes, I think the information is very important, especially for individuals going into psychiatry or the medical field in general. The class is very manageable and would work well as a fifth class.",
    "Take it! It's not too much work (one midterm, one in-class final and one 5-page paper) and the material is fascinating. Professor Joormann is open to discussion and obviously cares about the material and her students. Sometimes it got a little dry when we were discussing specific symptom checklists, but overall a great class.",
    "Abnormal Psychology is a basic understanding of various mental disorders -- highly recommend!",
    "This class gives a comprehensive overview of various mental disorders. The material was engaging but not overly challenging. The lectures were all posted online and class attendance was made extra credit a couple of weeks in.",
    "This is a great and interesting course. I would highly recommend it and the professor.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. I learned a lot and loved learning about mental disorders.",
    "Abnormal psych is a solid intro-level psychology class focused largely on various forms of psychopathology. It covers epidemiology, etiology, pathophysiology, symptomatology, and treatment of nearly every group of disorders in the DSM. There are two non-cumulative midterms and no final exam, as well as one 5-page paper analyzing the course of a disorder experienced by a character in one of several selected books or movies. Overall, I found the course to be fairly easy, but I still feel like I learned a lot about the material. Additionally, it sets students up for later classes in the realm of clinical psychology and helps pre-meds with their future psych rotations. It did meet at 9 AM, but I found it interesting enough to get me up in the mornings. Take it if you're looking for a cool last class that will teach you a lot while requiring very little of you.",
    "I think Abnormal Psychology is a good Credit D class but if you're interested in this type of material there are better courses in the psychology department for you to learn about mental health.",
    "Interesting, fun, doesn't require much studying or work outside of class if you pay attention in lecture! And Jutta is a great lecturer.",
    "Amazing! If you are interested at all in psychology, you must take this class!",
    "I would say that it is a survey course looking into abnormal psychology through a set of different disorders and lines. I would recommend this class to anyone interested in the topic.",
    "This is a really interesting class with a light workload. It is a great fifth class to take, and you don't necessarily need to be a psych major to enjoy it. Lectures are somewhat dry, but otherwise would recommend.",
    "A great indepth course looking at the generalities of abnormal psychology. It takes mental illnesses and is able to present them in a purely academic way. I would absolutely recommend this course to any and everyone who is looking to better understand mental illness.",
    "YES! great 5th class and very cool material",
    "Very interesting material! The Professor basically based everything in her lectures off the textbook, so there wasn't much novel in what she presented that I couldn't glean directly from the book. That being said, she is very knowledgable in the field since she always supplemented topics with her own first-hand vignettes. I feel like I learned a TON in the field of abnormal psychology, though, which is pretty awesome bc now I have a non-stigmatized, informed view of something that is very prevalent in our society!",
    "PSYCH 180 is a survey course about the different categories and types of psychological disorders, their etiologies, and their symptoms. I would not recommend PSYCH 180 unless a student was really fascinated by pscyhological disorders, as the material was not that stimulating.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to someone who is interested in psychology. It covers a wide range of topics, but we definitely learn and understand them well by the end of the course. The workload is also manageable and fair.",
    "A good elective for anyone looking to get into psychology or get a social sciences credit.",
    "This class is a relaxing psychology class to take. The material is engaging, the professor is good and the course load is fairly minimal.",
    "I really enjoyed this class. The professor was great, the content interesting, and it was not very work intensive. Between the slides and the textbook I was able to be successful in the class and took a lot away from it. I looked forward to going (rare since it was at 9 am). I recommend this class as it is fascinating content on a subject that people know but don't actually KNOW.",
    "I would recommend PSYC 180 to anyone who is interested in going into clinical psychology. It was a great overview of psychopathology, and it definitely wasn't too much work (a midterm, non-cumulative final, and a book review). You get out of it what you put into it: I feel like I learned a lot because I'm really interested in the subject and did all of the readings, but I could see how it would be easy to slack off and not get that much out of the course.",
    "Applicable information for everyday life and not hard to understand.",
    "The material has great information and the course load isn't bad.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. Not a gut, but one of the easier classes I have taken at Yale. Read the slides every week and use the textbook. Professor Joormann was fantastic at teaching this class. I hope she teaches it next year.",
    "Abnormal psychology covers a variety of mental disorders, which were fascinating to learn about. The class itself followed closely to the textbook. Professor Joormann followed very closely with the slides which made studying, although it sometimes made the lectures dry.",
    "Great class for those who are interested in this branch of psychology especially, and in psychology more broadly.",
    "A pretty standard, run-of-the-mill, information-dense and memorization-based psychology lecture. If you're a psych major, you probably have already had several like this. It feels a lot like intro psychology, but definitely easier. Exams were very easy, and the \"paper\" is a book or movie review, which takes like no time at all. Very low workload overall, but you do learn some pretty cool stuff, and if you don't have a lot of background in the topic, you might find this class really enjoyable and interesting. I did have a lot of background already, however, and found the course to be quite repetitive and boring, which I suppose is at least partly my own fault. Pros: not much work, generally interesting material. Cons: gets very repetitive over the course of the semester, material doesn't go into much depth, tests are memorization-based and don't test your actual understanding very much at all, and the book\/movie review paper is silly and feels like a waste of time.",
    "Good non psych major class",
    "This is the perfect credit\/D class, or if you are interested in psych I'd also recommend it. It can get boring though",
    "PSYC 180 is an incredible course focused on abnormal psychology (mental disorders) and I would recommend to students from all backgrounds. It is a great combination of the science and medical background and also the social components.",
    "This class is like shooting fish in a barrel with a goddamn fusion bomb. This class is HGH for your GPA, if you don't get an A you wouldn't make it as a tequila major at Q Pac.",
    "A comprehensive overview of mental disorders, causal factors, treatment, and some current research. Take if you're interested in the subject!",
    "Really easy, p engaging, I liked it",
    "I would recommend PSYC 180 to a fellow student if he\/she showed any interest in psychology.",
    "A must for all psych majors. Highly recommend.",
    "You learn a lot, and at times it is challenging, but also very fair and rewarding.",
    "I wouldn't recommend it. I love psychology and abnormal psychology but the material was presented in a very dry manner. I could never pay attention.",
    "This class is fine as a brief survey into a multitude of different mental disorders. However, you really don't get to discuss much more than what a simple Google search would tell you about any one of these disorders. The textbook is written at a relatively low level for college students in my opinion. The first couple of lecture were very interesting. However, as we went on, I became increasingly less enthusiastic about the course. The manner in which PowerPoints were dully presented during a large lecture at 9 in the morning was not the best in my opinion. Additionally, the methods of assessment were not fair in my opinion. There were only 3 major sources of assessment (2 of them were texams), each being worth a huge amount, the policies were rectified many times throughout the course and not everyone was aware about all the new changes being made. Furthermore, it was never quite clear how much material from the book was important to know, particularly for exams. The importance of book material was often stressed but unique questions from the text were seriously lacking on all exams. The course lacked in clarity, organization and excitement but you can do well and fulfill a requirement with this if you want.",
    "The course is very helpful, regardless of whether you are a psychology major. A lot of the disorders come up in everyday life, and this course teaches how to identify, treat, and manage these issues. The class was very interesting and I would definitely recommend it to another student.",
    "Take it. Abnormal Psych is really fascinating, especially if the sound of the title intrigues you. The work is really manageable, the subject will leave you engrossed, and the staff is top notch. The one caveat I have to include is this: there is a lack of engagement in the course because there are no discussion sections. Make sure you have the discipline to keep on top of the reading and to come to lecture, otherwise you'll quickly fall behind and begin to dislike the course.",
    "Very interesting course that is not too difficult. Definitely take if you're a psych major and even take if you're not! Fun class.",
    "I would recommend this class if you're interested in psychiatry\/clinical psych and treating mental disorders in some way. Or even if you're not going to pursue it as a career, it's still interesting to know more about mental illness. You do learn a lot in this class, but it did feel like a lot of bland symptoms, statistics, causes, stuff like that just being read off of powerpoint. It's a pretty easy class tbh. I would recommend showing up to class, but I found that reading was really not necessary. The slides were more than sufficient for the tests.",
    "Take it! You learn a lot and you have amazing extra credit by simply coming to class and participating.",
    "It's a pretty basic course, so it should be understandable to everyone, so sure.",
    "Yes I would recommend it.",
    "The content is really interesting, and these things are so incredibly important to know about and to (try to) understand.",
    "Yes, definitely! It's a comprehensive overview of psychopathology.",
    "I would recommend the class to any student, regardless of their major. Learning about mental health disorders is very important, and this course allows one to gain a better understanding of the topic.",
    "I would not recommend this class to anyone, unless you are looking to get an easy A in a class that you don't have to go to. I tried to get a bad grade because I took the class credit D, but it didn't end up working and I got a pretty good grade.",
    "PSYC 180 is a great course. Be warned that it does have a bit of a slow start, but ends up being very fulfilling and interesting.",
    "If you're considering a career in clinical psychology or are just interested in learning more about mental illness, which affects so many of us, take this class! It is engaging and well-taught.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class as an easy fifth class.",
    "study of mental illness",
    "I would absolutely recommend psych 180 to another student!! We covered a wide range of mental illnesses, all of which were interesting and very relevant to what is going on around me. this class is excellent for anyone who wants to learn about a very interesting topic, learn from an interesting and engaging professor, and learn more about what is going on in he world around them! This class would be amazing for both psych and non-psych majors!!",
    "take it! and go! it's super intesting",
    "I would recommend this course to both psychology majors and non-psychology majors as an easy way to familiarize yourself with major mental illnesses and the history behind them. It's very manageable and easy to understand.",
    "It was an overall interesting class focusing on different mental illnesses, their symptoms, causes, and treatments.",
    "Take this course!!! The workload is very light and the material is pretty interesting. Try to come to class because it helps make the material click more. However, if you did miss a class once in a while then you will be fine because almost all material can be found in the textbook! Professor Joormann is awesome and often shares solid examples about her patients' experiences relevant to the topics being covered.",
    "This is probably a good background on abnormal psych. or a good prereq if you need to fulfill that but if your point is to really gain a deep understanding of the subject I would recommend another class.",
    "good",
    "PSYC 180 was a decently interesting class about an extremely interesting subject. I definitely am more knowledgeable about different disorders and the DSM after taking this class, but felt for such an interesting topic the lectures were rather formulaic\/ a regurgitation of the textbook. The most engaging part of the course was our paper using books\/movies to diagnose a character; unfortunately it was one of the only times we had practical application of the information learned.",
    "If you want an interesting psychology course, definitely take it.",
    "Good survey course if you've taken Intro Psych and thought that the abnormal section was cool.",
    "This was a good class overall, especially if you are interested in mental illness in any capacity. The exams are fair and straightforward, and the paper can be decently enjoyable. Overall an easy class workload wise, but you could definitely get as much out of this class as you wanted to put in.",
    "If you like psychology you must take this class.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course not only for psych majors but for all students. The work load is definitely bearable and I found the course extremely interesting. One of my favorite psychology classes thus far!",
    "yes, it is an informative, interesting class",
    "Fairly interesting class that dispelled lots of incorrect notions about psychological disorders",
    "Going to the lectures at 9 am suck but the material is interesting and helpful. You can pretty much study for the exams just a few days before.",
    "Yes. Great course especially for potential psychology majors. Or anyone interested in psychopathology at all.",
    "Pretty gutty but also pretty interesting. It was better than I thought it would be, but it's really one of those classes I only took as a 5th credit that doesn't have a section to work in my schedule. Jutta Joorman seems really sweet and fair and willing to do what's best for her students. I'm not sure I would have taken it if I didn't have to find a slightly easier 5th class, but I'm glad I ended up choosing it!",
    "This was an incredibly interesting course related to mental disorders. Not too hard, not too easy.",
    "Take this class if you get a chance. It's one of the easiest classes I have taken at Yale. The professor and the TAs were wondeful! The exams were pretty easy. And the disorders we covered were really interesting.",
    "This course is good for Psychology majors who want to learn more in depth about specific mental illnesses. The course is organized so that we learned about different disorders within different larger categories throughout the semester. The workload is extremely manageable, with a midterm, in-class final, and final paper covering a movie or book. Professor Joormann is very kind and thoughtful. However, the lectures do tend to be a bit dry and repetitive, especially for a 9am class. The lectures usually covered content straight from the textbook. The exams are very objective, depending on memorization of the lectures and the textbook. While I felt I learned a good bit about different mental illnesses and controversies within the DSM, I could see students who aren't interested in Psychology and mental health being very disinterested in this course. Overall, I think this is a good, manageable course for people interested in learning more about mental health.",
    "Content is solid - pretty much out of a textbook. But going to class was tough. Great Credit D class. Be prepared to teach yourself.",
    "I would definitely take this class if you are looking for a chill SO credit. This was the first year it was offered, so it is entirely possible they will change it next year, but class was not mandatory. The material is very interesting, as you will definitely learn something about the way in which psychological disorders are treated.",
    "Basically an overview of the disorders in the DSM as well as treatment methods. Not quite what I expected, but it was interesting.",
    "This course was overall not fantastic. I would not recommend this class to another student because it was not interesting. I thought the topic was very interesting, but the delivery was not.",
    "If you're looking for a low work credit d, take it. Otherwise probably not.",
    "Good class, can get a little boring even though the material is interesting because lecture is long and can drag on, but reasonable workload and fair tests. One midterm, a final, and a 5 page paper about a book or movie. Extra points for attendance. Definitely a good one to take.",
    "You will learn a lot about abnormal psychology. Definitely a class I'm glad I took, but it does get a bit hard to sit through.",
    "I enjoyed this class a lot, because I feel like the disorders that we discussed are so prevalent that it was very interesting and relevant to learn more about their diagnoses and symptoms. I would recommend this class to another student who has any interest in human behavior or psychology.",
    "This is a class would be very interesting to people who are looking into going into clinical psychology.",
    "I would highly recommend this course for anyone who is interested in pursuing a career in mental health or to anyone who knows somebody with a mental illness.",
    "They assume you have some experience with psych so if you are non-psych you might have a little catching up to do.",
    "Interesting, broad, and enjoyable introduction to mental illnesses\/disorders, causes, and treatment. It was my favorite class; not too intense or time consuming but I learned a lot. Would recommend."
