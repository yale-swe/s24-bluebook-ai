    "The point of this class is that it's a non-traditional introduction to art history, in the sense that modern Western culture prizes painting and sculpture above all but decorative arts have long been the most important art form in much of the world. Even in the West, people like Henry VIII had tapestries worth 10,000 times as much as his fanciest paintings (something I learned in this class). I found the lectures fascinating, although you do have to learn about techniques of decorative art for the first half of the class before you can really delve into the cultural and historical contexts of decorative art in the second half of the class. There's a midterm, final, four short museum labels, and one longer catalogue entry, but all told there's really not much work and the class is really enjoyable. Section is in the YUAG, handling pieces from their collections, and it's incredible to be able hold and analyze things like Greek vases from 450BC. Take this class if you're looking for a fun class that's something different from what you usually would consider! I'm a STEM major and I loved it",
    "Take this class!! The lectures are good, the readings are manageable, but most importantly, section is the bomb! This class forces you to visit the YUAG often and that place is awesome! Section consists of observing, handling, and discussing some really cool pieces of art from the gallery. It is a really rare experience to be able to touch pieces from a museum but you can do it in this class. Very fun, great way to learn about objects and gain a new appreciation for art in a new context.",
    "The course is a great introduction to the form, function, and aesthetic evolution of textile, metalwork, ceramic, and furniture. It not only teaches students to have a working evaluative vocabulary, but also builds on that basic knowledge to explain how trade and interchange affected art history and the world. I would recommend this course highly to another student, because it is a very rewarding course for both art history majors and those who are merely interested.",
    "It's less of an art class and more of an everyday objects class. Don't take it if you want to learn about how history is connected to the cultural expressions of the time, because it's mostly talking about how different kinds of pots are made.",
    "It's a great class and I enjoyed it a lot more than I originally thought I would. The history of objects ties into so many other areas, like materials science, economic history, geopolitical stuff... you name it, and objects reflect it. Professor Cooke is a really good lecturer and always animates the objects he discusses. The labels are straightforward, but because they were so short, I have no clue what sort of grade I'm looking at in the class. The midterm was also straightforward, but the essay questions on the final ended up being questions that were hard to prepare for. In short, it's a fun class and it's not overly difficult. It's a great HU if you're interested in materials science or economics.",
    "This is an interesting course, in that the subject is quite different than any other class I've taken. It's an examination of material culture in world history in a broad sense. The first half (pre-midterm) deals with familiarizing you with various types of materials from which objects are made \u2014 wood, metal, ceramics, textiles, etc. \u2014 as well as the artistic and technological techniques used by different cultures to create objects out of these materials. The second half of the course (post-midterm) is more thematic, and examines objects in terms of trade and global circulation, iconography, the role of objects in \"mediating\" political and social interactions, etc. If you're looking for an art history course that does not focus exclusively on paintings and sculpture, and very thematic, almost anthropological, then you will enjoy it!",
    "Encourage you to be aware of the objects in your life",
    "One of the hidden gems within art history. Everyone goes for the famous survey courses of European paintings and sculptures but I think decorative arts is something that is easily overlooked even though it is relevant to our daily lives. Definitely shop it and see if you like the first lecture. The first half of the course gets you up to speed on the types of materials and methods used to produce a wide range of works while the second half is more thematic and forces you to think about how objects have a life of their own. Professor Cooke lectures in a way that even connects with people who are not familiar with art history and his background knowledge on India, China and Japan is impressive. The sections in the art gallery are the most interesting discussion sections you\u2019ll have.",
    "Yes, I definitely would! It's a great class to fulfill the Hu credit or even to learn the basics about material art and the different themes of trade and interchange that come along with it. Workload is very manageable and the museum object labels actually become pretty fun\/rewarding to write!",
    "Overal a pretty good class. Lecture is not especially interesting (or necessary to be successful in the class) but section was really great. It was always held in either the gallery or the object study rooms, so you got to look at, touch and pick up the pieces that were being discussed in lecture. You don't have to do much if any of the reading, but a lot of it is actually very interesting and fun to do. The label assignments can be tricky (grading is harder than you might expect), but the midterm and final are very straightforward, you just have to study the fairly short list of terms and images professor cooke gives you, and skim a couple of the readings.",
    "great intro to decorative arts. Really gets into the nitty gritty of how materials\/mediums such as textile, ceramics, metals, and wood are made. Then focuses on how it is traded around the world\/cultural aspects of the objects.",
    "Fantastic. Take it.",
    "This is a great course as an introduction to the decorative arts. It is refreshingly global and I have left with a greater appreciation for a number of different materials. Section is great, you get to look at objects from the YUAG.",
    "Take this class. One of the best classes that I've taken at Yale. We go over many interesting topics, and you get to handle objects from the art gallery.",
    "So if you are vaguely interested in decorative arts or material culture, take this class. Professor Cooke is great and super kind and thoughtful. However, he is not the most engaging lecturer and it could be a bit difficult to pay attention once we were over 30 minutes in. The first half of the course is structured around materials: you learn about different kinds of clay and how ceramics are made, etc. Then Professor Cooke takes the material in a more theoretical direction as we discuss trade, iconography, and objects' modes of agency. Be warned that the midterm and final are A LOT of memorization of images and terms. And there are four short written assignments. Section meets in the art gallery and is a lot of fun. You handle textiles, ceramics, metal work, etc. While the reading is unnecessary, I wouldn't call the course a gut.",
    "A really great angle from which to approach an intro to art history course, Ned is a wonderful lecturer and it's lots of fun to be able to have hands-on section in the gallery every week.",
    "Yes. Decorative arts aren't necessarily glorified, but their historical trajectory is just as important as the fine arts. In today's world, where materials are so disposable, it's interesting to gain knowledge in their evolution. I found that even the simplest plastic cup is interesting to me now. The lectures were engaging. The section was awesome because I actually got to handle the objects we talked about in lecture. I got a lot out of it without too much work. The museum label assignment was fun once I got the hang of it, and the catalogue entry was essentially a longer version of that. The midterms were not easy, but they were totally doable as long as you allowed yourself the time to review.",
    "I would definitely recommend it to another student who is looking for a course that offers fresh perspectives and is taught by a great professor. However, i would warn that if you come in thinking that this course will teach you about the different time periods in art - gothic, renaissance, etc, this class will not teach you that.",
    "ive never taken an art history class before, and i loved loved loved this. you have to take it if youve ever wondered anything about the objects surrounding you\u2014or even if you havent. cooke is such a good lecturer, he comes to sections and he makes it clear that you can have valuable insight even if youre really really new to this. so good.",
    "Lectures from the first half of the course focused mostly on materials and modes of production (ex. metals, wood, textiles, etc.), which was not as interesting as the second half of the course, which explored more complex themes such as function, the diffusion of iconography, and trade. The midterm and final were very fair, and allowed students to demonstrate knowledge of both specific objects and of broader themes. The object labels were really rewarding assignments, and the catalog entry felt like a great way to show everything that I had learned throughout the term. I would definitely recommend this class to another student because it changed the way I look at and interact with the objects that I interact with everyday.",
    "I would highly recommend this class, particularly if you're looking to reexamine the way we conventionally think about art value judgements and hierarchies. It gave me a new, deeper understanding of the material culture in which we live and interact with, consciously and subconsciously. Professor Cooke is brilliant and so kind!"
