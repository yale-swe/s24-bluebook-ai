    "Yes, I will recommend.",

    "Very high-level theory course. I would highly recommend to theorists - it is very interesting material - but if an experimentalist could avoid doing it, you probably should. I would even recommend taking Stat Mech II for your upper-level theory course requirement instead (though Leonid Glazman also teaches that, so it might be similarly inaccessible).",
    "I would recommend the course to those who are interested in the many-body phenomena in solid state systems.",
    "I would recommend the course but I would tell the student to be prepared to spend some time every week thinking about the topics and doing the assignments. It is not a course that you can take and just cruise through. This is also one reason why the course is so valuable too.",
    "The course is challenging but very rewarding. You get what you put into it.",
    "Yes, I will definitely recommend it.",
    "Highly recommended. Any physics student should take it!"

   "comments": [
    "very helpful",
    "Although most of the material was already known from earlier courses, it was a good reminder and some examples like BCS theory and Josephson-Junctions made the theory more concrete.",
    "Somewhat - it gave me a deeper appreciation for the amount of theory I do not know and how simplified the formulas and equations I actually use are. Very few of the techniques will be useful to me in the future, except perhaps being able to communicate effectively when collaborating with theorists who actually do these things.",
    "The course introduced me into many topics of condensed matter physics. I am much more comfortable reading literature on this topic then I was prior to taking the course. I feel this was the best course I have taken at Yale thus far.",
    "Helps me understand the rules of many body physics."
