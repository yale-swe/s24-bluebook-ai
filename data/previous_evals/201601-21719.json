    "A few things to keep in mind as you're considering this course a) Being funny consistently is much harder than you think it is b) A paper and a humor challenge due ~every week~ is a lot of work c) Writing is very different than improv or stand up (any type of humor that relies on physicality to land punch lines) That being said, this class had by far the most enjoyable reading of any course I've taken. It didn't feel like work. I spent an entire semester laughing over Onion articles, Sedaris essays, and McSweeney's parodies. I made close friendships with the comedy community at Yale and went to a number of stand up shows. There's a great spread of writers sophomore-senior, and a diversity of academic interests. We had English majors but also computer scientists and physicists. More than anything, my ability to write humorously, (and my talent as an essayist in general) has improved considerably. Prof. Wepler is excellent at parsing specific elements of successful humor writing and allowing each writer to champion their particular senses of humor. Classes are ridiculous, whimsical, and incredibly incredibly profane. Even if you don't think you've become funnier, your writing will have improved from the simple fact that you're writing 2-5 pages a week. And you will have deeply enjoyed the process. I'm very glad I had the opportunity to take this class my final semester at Yale. Take it!!",
    "Definitely take it if you can get in. ENGL 255 was really fun and helpful and I came away with writing that I was really proud of. We also got to know each other as writers and as people within the seminar. Writing humor on a regular basis is very challenging, though, so make sure you can devote the time to it.",
    "You get to read humorous essays and use techniques from them in your own writing. You write a lot in this class, though. Be prepared.",
    "This class is brilliant! You write a lot. You laugh a lot. You learn how to make things funny.",
    "Writing Humor was a pleasure to take. I'm a Physics major and loved that the course was a fairly intensive writing course (starting out with a piece or two due each week) with a moderate amount of reading (30 minutes to an hour-ish per seminar if you're slow like me) that still remained accessible to those outside of, or for me, very far away from the English major. I learned a lot from the class, from each lecture, from other students, and from my own writing. Wepler's organization of the syllabus was great, the class dynamic was great, the assignments were great, the feedback was great, and the workload was great. Great all around.",
    "It's a great class to take, especially if you've never had the opportunity to write non-academic essays at Yale. It's a lot of reading and writing, but not a particularly difficult or unmanageable load.",
    "Absolutely amazing course. I cannot recommend it highly enough. Work is constant but manageable, and the assignments are usually fun(ny).",
    "If you get in, TAKE IT!!",
    "You'll write a lot and read a lot, and your writing will get more polished structurally and stylistically.",
    "This was one of the best classes I've taken at Yale--Professor Wepler gives great feedback on essays, and because the class is so writing-focused, it forces you to produce a lot of content on a weekly basis. Another great part of the class was the workshops, where everyone wrote each other response letters. Highly recommend taking this class if you get in!!",
    "This class is fantastic. Lots of short, open-ended assignments that force you to be funny. The workshops (2 per person!) really help your writing and contribute to an overall bond between people in the class. Most of the class was juniors and seniors, but any shopper has a chance of getting in--there's a questionnaire you fill out at the end of the first class.",
    "This class will actually make you a dramatically better humor writer. You may think you're funny now, but taking this class will really tap a talent within you you didn't know you had. The readings, class discussions, and (admittedly very frequent) writing assignments are all so much fun. Your work is reviewed often by Ryan and your peers, which is invaluable. Just be prepared for a constant (albeit extremely fulfilling) workload! In any event, TAKE this if you're lucky enough to get in."
