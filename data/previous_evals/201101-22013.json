   "comments": [
    "Yeah, if you need a refresher on AP Physics, this is the perfect course.",
    "Yes, physics is important.",
    "If you have to take Physics, might as well take 201. Tipton's really awesome (he's extremely interesting to listen to) (and so darn cool) and the homework's really not that bad. The more math you know, the better off you'll be -- calc is essential of course (either some multi or just really good single-variable along with the ability to use the word \"curl\" like you know what you're talking about), but differential equations and linear algebra helps a lot -- and, you know, a good Physics C high school class wouldn't be too amiss either, but even without a strong background the class is totally doable. Tests are pretty tricksy, but, well, as I said, Tipton's awesome, and you can't go wrong with an awesome professor.",
    "Go to lecture and do the readings beforehand. It's the only way you'll do well in this course.",
    "I would recommend P201 to anyone with enough math, as I really enjoyed it. The material gets tough and some people didn't like Tipton's lecturing style, but overall it was a great course. You'll be very good at all sorts of integrals and have a thorough understanding of E&M.",
    "If you want an easy course with easy problem sets, don't take it. But if you want a course with interesting material that is comfortable for someone who has taken multivariable, it's fine. The lectures, though not outstanding, are solid and the lecture notes and textbook are helpful.",
    "If you aren't required to take this course, I wouldn't recommend it. The content is more difficult than Physics 200 and some of problem sets were very tedious. Teaching is done primarily with computer slides, but Professor Tipton did do more problems on the blackboard than he did in Physics 200.",
    "If Tipton is teaching and you can drop to 181, DO SO!",
    "Phys201 is a good intermediate introductory physics course. The material covered is interesting and presented at a reasonable pace, especially quantum mechanics. Professor Tipton did a great job of integrating applicable math throughout the semester, without overwhelming us. Problem sets were quite fair, preparing us well for the midterms and final. The TA's this semester were exceptional (Larry Lee and XiaoXio).If you're trying to decide between 180, 200 and 260, here are some things you should know:For 200, it's best to have had prior experience with calculus based physics (ap physics c, or a rigorous calculus course, if separate).We had three study halls, sunday, monday and tuesday night 8-10pm (psets due wednesday), staffed by TA's (180 also has this, 260 does not--they have one shorter problem session a week, on friday this year, but that may change).200 is the best mix of survey course and depth of physics. 180 covers much less quantum mechanics and special relativity and 260 goes crazy with advanced topics.",
    "Great class; take it if you have the chance. Talk to Professor Tipton if you have any doubts\/problems and he will help you out.",
    "Physics 201 was my hardest course this semester by far. Physics 200 was a good class, not too bad, but 201 was death. The problem sets were so hard and the tests were difficult. About aquarter of the class got this class somewhat easily and got almost perfect scores on the tests. Another quater were completely lost throughout the semester. And the rest of us struggled through, studying our asses off try to get by. Professor Tipton is a great guy, and very helpful, the material is just awful. From what I have heard 261 is much better, if you have the background to take it.",
    "I would probably not recommend this course to another student. First of all, the material is extremely difficult. It's the kind of course material that requires a great professor to explain such advanced topics as quantum mechanics. In my opinion, Tipton did not live up to this ideal. I really did not learn much in lectures and mainly taught myself everything by just reading the textbook. Students were extremely competitive and the tests were generally tricky and impossible to do well on. Only take the course if you think you are a genius in physics and have an very strong background in calculus based physics.",
    "Definitely a class worth taking. The material can get pretty complicated, but it is very rewarding once it is understood. The tests are fairly straightforward, and the problem sets almost always boost your grade (They're worth 30%). Tipton is a very good teacher who understands the material he is teaching very well.",
    "Phys 201 is good but not great. Tipton is incredibly intelligent but hislectures are rather dull. He's definitely very nice and open to suggestions, though. The best part about this class is that it goes through the boring stuff pretty quickly, so the last 1\/3 of the course focuses on quantum\/cosmology\/relativity\/etc. If you took 200, take 201. Dropping down to 181 would be a mistake.",
    "I would recommend it of the introductory phsyics courses, since Tipton style makes it easy to know what to expect, his exams are reasonable, usually easier than the problem sets. He's a great person, but not the greatest lecturer however. Be prepared to understand the material by reading hte book.",
    "This is a course in electricity and magnetism, a couple lectures on optics, 2-3 weeks on quantum mechanics, and a lecture on cosmology. I would definitely recommend this course, assuming one had AP Physics B or C in high school. Tipton's lecture notes are quite good, the workload isn't too bad, and the tests are fair. He even touches briefly on topics like relativistic quantum mechanics, so you get a taste of what advanced physics is like.",
    "I would definitely recommend Physics 201. If you put in the time and energy, this class can teach you a lot.",
    "I took Physics 201 after taking 200 in the first semester. I found it manageable, having been accustomed to Professor Tipton's teaching style (go to lecture, be confused by his long notes, read the textbook, try the problems, go to study hall, talk with the TAs and then finally understand what's going on). I did have more trouble though than most students because I was taking multivariable calculus at the same time (it's supposed to be a pre-req). Professor Tipton did technically explain all the math, but you really only learn the applications after a lot of practice and talking with the TAs. I would still recommend the course, though, to anyone in Physics or Engineering (who doesn't have an insane background and can place into 260). The curriculum is solid, well-organized and covers the essentials of what you need to know, even if it's not the most inspiring; the problem sets are rarely more than 8 problems and are certainly not odious, and his tests are very fair. If you didn't have calc BC in high school and have to take math 115\/120 concurrently like I did, it's doable but expect to spend a bit more time in study hall. Overall, I'm happy I took.",
    "It's a good introductory course, in that it covers a very broad range of material. But it is also a bit of work, and if you're not genuinely interested in physics, it might get tedious.",
    "I recommend this course if you are interested in physics, math or engineering.",
    "Physics 201 is great. I took 260 in the fall semester and was lost mathematically and conceptually but the grades were so cushioned I was still fine. The Grading in 201 is a bit harder and the psets are longer but you don't have to do general relativity like in 260 and you learn optics and more of Quantum which is cool. I really enjoyed the class though overall I would say that having only had AP Physics B in High School I should have taken 180 instead. Tipton is a great guy and a pretty good prof, though he his confusing at times -but I think that's mainly because the subject matter is a little confusing.",
    "This is a continuation of physics 200. It's about the same difficulty as physics 200. Professor Tipton is a fine and fair teacher.",
    "Excellent introductory physics course that gets to some really cool material (GR, cosmology, particle physics) at the end. Recommended to pre-meds who are looking to learn something while fulfilling their requirements. Professor Tipton truly cares about his students and there are a lot of resources available to anyone struggling, so don't be too intimated by the slightly tougher crowd than in 200.",
    "I found 201 to be significantly harder than 200, maybe just because I hadn't done as much E&M in high school as mechanics. As the professor himself put it, the people getting 100s in this class aren't the ones getting 100s in 200...It's also a pretty dull class in my opinion, quantum can get a little funky but generally I found it pretty uninspiring.Still, if you're willing to put in the work and you survived 200 ok, this shouldn't be a problem.",
    "Don't take it unless it is a prereq for your major, you learn cool things about quantum, but it's not an amazing class. It is somehow rewarding if you do well on the exams.",
    "I would highly recommend physics 201. It isn't as hard as 260\/261, and provides a challenging but highly do-able introduction to physics. The only necessary work is a problem set a week, and this can take anywhere between one and six hours. The exams aren't very difficult, and with a decent amount of studying can even be quite easy and straightforward. Anyone looking for a not-too-easy but not-too-hard intro physics class should love this course.",
    "Physics 201 is a great introductory physics course. I would definitely recommend it to another student, especially one who wants to study engineering or science. You will learn a lot and the class is great.",
    "Physics 201 is a comprehensive class that is a great introduction to modern physics. It is a natural progression from Physics 200, while still providing challenging material. I would definitely recommend this class to students interested in physics or engineering, who want to challenge themselves, but who don't have the math background sufficient enough to take PHYS 260.",
    "Physics 201 is a good class to develop a solid foundation in physics. Some students in the higher intro physics class have said that 201 is more challenging.",
    "It's a comprehensive course that is still challenging even if you've taken physics before. I would recommend it because it's a good class.",
    "Yeah. It's much better than those 1xx courses, and is fairly easy. It's great course that covers electricity and magnetism, as well as selected topics such as optics, quantum mechanics, and cosmology. The lecture slides are very well organized and useful.",
    "If you don't like physics it's not really going to change your mind (quantum was fun but wasn't too well taught). Tipton focuses too much on deriving formulas that most of us just get lost in it. He tells good stories about physicists so that's a plus point. Class had a bunch of crazy physics students who'd ace every single exam so beware of that. If you've taken PHY 200 and liked it take this as quantum mechanics is very interesting. And he does try to go into the big picture of the future of physics in the last lecture.",
    "I would recommend physics 201 to anyone looking for a solid foundation in electromagnetism and quantum mechanics. We didn't cover as much as 260, but what we did cover, we covered well.",
    "Only take this if you have taken Physics C Mechanics and E&M. Otherwise, don't. It's extremely hard if the material is new to you. Also, definitely take Multivariable Calculus BEFORE this course (not concurrently). It would make a big difference, especially in having the mathematical techniques to solve problems.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who has taken AP Physics B, or honors level, if they would like a higher level physics course. Premeds should take this physics over 171\/181",
    "Better than 180\/181. There's a lot of overlap with differential equations, so I'd recommend taking that at the same time. Don't take it as an elective though.",
    "good physics course if you have a strong physics background",
    "It was great! I came in with very little physics background and felt like I learned so SO much! It was definitely worth taking over 180 or 170, and Professor Tipton was amazing! The study halls and TAs were super helpful, and Professor Tipton was so open to students and held regular office hours for help. Definitely take it, you will NOT regret it : )",
    "This course continues in the same style as PHYS 200, focusing on electricity, magnetism, and quantum mechanics. The workload is also very similar, though the problem sets and tests are somewhat more difficult, mostly because some of the material is not as intuitive as classical mechanics was. Professor Tipton also seems somewhat less organized with this material, sometimes rushing through complex parts of lectures and spending too long on simple parts. Overall, though, if you\u0092ve already taken 200, or if you thought 180 was too easy, this is a good course to take. You\u0092ll learn some interesting quantum mechanics without sacrificing fundamental electricity and magnetism principles."
