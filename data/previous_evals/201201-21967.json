    "yes",
    "Easy, super super fun class. Lecture is one of the most entertaining ones I've taken, purely because of Professor Thompson and his antics",
    "DEF Recommended. It will change your view of the world for the better. Often times classes are so westernized and focused on the classic, this class is a refreshing look at civilizations that the American educational system (and no other educational system) teaches. It is taught with love and enthusiasm, which is also refreshing.",
    "An introduction into all African cultures. Master T is hysterical and its not to hard if you go in for extra help withy our TA and show them that you care.",
    "I would recommend it highly.",
    "I would recommend it to everyone. Take it! It isn't difficult or time consuming.",
    "I loved the material but I did not particularly like the class. I would not recommend it.",
    "Yes- it is a easy and fun humanities credit.",
    "It is a great out of the box class that is very interesting and good way to open your eyes Abt other cultures",
    "hard to understand Prof Thompson, but he tries to be lively and engaging. I guess it's a worth the class grade\/extra A... hopefully, we'll see. You shouldn't have any problems, everyone just wings it, but enjoys themselves fully and learns a lot by the end actually - without the painful amounts of work.",
    "Take it - good survey course on black history and easy at that.",
    "Yup",
    "Great class, Master T is awesome, and the material isn't difficult to grasp.",
    "It's a great class, it teaches you a lot about west african traditions and you see a lot of west african influences after going to lecture in your everyday life. It's really cool. The exams are pretty straightforward, he tells you what you need to study and there isn't as much memorizing in this class as one would expect in an art history class.",
    "Great class - easy to study for tests, light workload. Take it!",
    "TAKE IT. HOWEVER, START IT CREDIT\/D...YOUR GRADE IS DEPENDENT ON YOUR T.A.",
    "Definitely recommend this course. Just two one-hour tests and a very manageable paper",
    "I would recommend this Class to anyone interested in art history, and who wants a unique topic that's focused on sculpture, music, and dance from Africa.",
    "Great class, highly recommend it",
    "AMAZING. I somehow got 100% on the midterm after studying for two hours the night before. Plus, class is generally hilarious. Take it.",
    "Not a lot of work, RFT tells you the sections of books that are necessary to read--very interesting if you pay attention. Only midterm, paper, and final. Easy workload. Necessary class to take.",
    "Must take this class. Master T is the man. Two hour long tests and a ten page paper, but you can be really creative with it.",
    "This class is great for those who are interested in african cultures.",
    "Yes.",
    "Weird, Bizarre, at times boring. Could bite you in the ass if you can't write competently or cram for tests competently. Still a fun and different 5th credit.",
    "Yes I would definitely recommend it. You have to take a class with Master T",
    "interesting and fun--Professor Thompson is the man and always entertaining",
    "Yes. It's a nice course to take and I think it's part of the Yale experience.",
    "Definitely take it.",
    "Definitely take this. Prof Thompson is a legend.",
    "Amazing.",
    "Super easy, no section, you don't have to go to class.",
    "In speaking with a friend of mine, he said that this course is one of the few at Yale that has altered his way of viewing the world. I stopped and realized that Professor Thompson's course had the same influence upon me. Take this course and go to every class, if not to take notes and be prepared for midterms, but to be in the presence of Master T and have your world rocked with information on the African Diaspora and how it influences us today.",
    "It's a quick look at some major African civilizations (Yoruba, Kongo, etc.), their art, and how the art influences fashion and styles today. If you want an easy, entertaining class, take this one.",
    "I would recommend it if you're looking for a class you never have to attend and don't mind cramming for an exam. Don't expect to receive an A unless you luck out with a TA that's a more tolerant grader",
    "Take the class if you are interested in Black Art",
    "Easy Humanities course. Pretty interesting.",
    "Honestly, I felt the whole class was frankly a mess. It's such a well-known joke that maybe 20% of the class, at most, showed up to lectures. The lectures themselves were confusing and disorganized and hard to follow (tons of foreign-language words but no way to know how to spell them, for example), and the exams were silly but were graded as if we actually were expected to know what we were talking about - expectations that certainly weren't set by the class or the test format. The TAs actually had to warn people several times in the exam to stop cheating (copying off one another's papers) which, for a Yale class, is embarrassing and shows you the quality and caliber of the particular students who choose to take BAVT.",
    "Yes, great class",
    "Pretty Interesting material, you get as much out as you put in.",
    "I would recommend it, but you won't learn that much. Very chill, and the material is actually fascinating if you want to do the readings, although the material he selects is often dry and dense",
    "I would recommend it to everyone. It's a course that introduces you to a few African cultures and follows those cultures to North America.",
    "Great class. Fun lectures. Master T is the man. Very little work.",
    "Yes",
    "You have to take a class with Master T before you graduate. Take this or Mambo (or both)",
    "Take this class, the material is interesting and Master T is the man.",
    "This course has a reputation as a \"gut,\" and while it has a relatively light workload, the lectures are amazing and you'll actually come out of the class having learned a lot. I definitely recommend it. You'll love Master T, too.",
    "The lectures were not organized very well (though interesting, most of the time) and it could be difficult to prepare for tests unless you collaborated with others and shared notes.",
    "Take this class if you dont mind learning very little at the end of the semester and want a good grade without too much work. If you are looking to academically challenge yourself, this is not the class for you.",
    "Interesting.",
    "Take it. It's easy",
    "Shop the class and see what you think of Professor Thompson. I thought he was hilarious and an entertaining lecturer. He clearly loves the material that he presents and makes an effort to keep class interesting. But the middle of the semester, most people stop going to class which is a shame. Work wise this class is definitely on the easy side because there is no day to day work until you have to study for the two exams and write a 10-12 research paper. Other than that I just went to lecture and enjoyed Professor Thompson's jokes and antidotes. Something to keep in mind, however, is that the exams and the research paper are not graded easily. So this class is easy in terms of workload but it is not an easy A. You do have to study and put in the work to get above a B on the exams.",
    "Master T is a fascinating character who is deeply involved in the subject of this class and has a great passion for sharing it with other people. I will say it is hard to follow his train of thought at times and the lectures aren't very structured if you're looking for things that connect every idea together. The paper was difficult at first but ended up forcing me to learn through research. The two \"one hour tests\" are pretty easy, but you should do some preparation. The book list is actually pretty interesting so I'd suggest getting them even if you finish reading them after the class. It was eye opening, but I wish I could have been a little more engaged with the material- I really didn't know what I was supposed to be reading most of the time. All told the reading isn't that necessary though. This is a gut class, but Master T is really into it. Give it a try!",
    "Yes if you want a credit tha is on the easier side",
    "Take it! Its not too difficult, and the material is really interesting!",
    "It was a great class and I would recommend it to a fellow student.",
    "Yes, it was a fun class",
    "African American Studies 178 01 is definitely a fun, engaging class. It allows students to learn not just about West African art and how it connects to art in the Americas, but also about the traditions and customs that connect the two areas of the world. I would recommend it to another student because it balances out classes that may be more structured; it is a class where you are never really sure what will happen in lecture which is fun!",
    "I would definitely reccomend the class to a fellow student. It is an opportunity to learn about material that we don't get the chance to learn about often. It's also an opportunity to learn from an awesome professor.",
    "easy course, kind of confusing, go to review sessions and study a lot for tests",
    "I strongly recommend this class. It should be required for all students. African history is not taught in American schools--not in elementary, middle, or high school. At best, students might be taught about Africa's stateless societies, uncivilized nomads, or destitute poverty. This class was a breath of fresh air because it shows that Africa is a vast continent of several rich civilizations, many of which were more advanced than their European counterparts during the era of exploration. It was great to learn about the contributions of Africans to popular Western culture. Too often, Africans are portrayed as the recipients of Western aid. You never learn about the strong influence of different African cultures that permeate our everyday life in the U.S. and several other countries.Unfortunately, there are many students who see the class as a joke. Nonetheless, if you take the course material seriously you will realize that Master T is teaching about a lot of things that writers of most history books prefer to ignore."
