    "Amazing class - Dean B is the best ever, you learn about an important topic, the seminar is friendly and relaxed.",
    "Genocide and Ethnic conflict is not for the faint of heart, the readings and film are tough and sometimes its difficult to get through them. At the same time its a very important topic that Dean Besirevic handles very well. Her own experience in Bosnia gives her really interesting insight into an actual genocide which is quite differnt than just reading in a book. Any one interested in human rights, the U.N or even the human condition should consider taking this course.",
    "A strong intro course that develops both a theoretical framework and uses effective case studies to understand genocide and ethnic conflict. The course bring in multiple perspectives from sociology, IR, global affairs, as well as women and gender studies to understand the causes and effects, as well as ability to prevent, genocide. If you can get in, it is worth it if you don't already have exposure to genocide studies. Definitely an intro \/ survey course. Fun and worthwhile. Not too much work 6 reading responses, reading & participation weekly, one 15-20 page paper and presentation!",
    "Difficult content, but amazing course. Dean B is a brilliant and lovely professor. It was a privilege to take this class.",
    "Take it! It is a wonderful course that will push you to think critically about situations that are typically only glossed in history courses.",
    "Overall a very interesting course. The class is definitely influenced by who is in it, which in this case was a good thing, as we had an interesting mix of people. Some weeks have a lot of a reading, others less so, but overall not a terrible amount of work. The readings are all fascinating, and for better or worse, and Dean B is very enthusiastic about the subject.",
    "This is an excellent class. Dean B. is phenomenal not only because she is incredibly knowledgable, particularly about the Bosnian genocide, but also because she facilitates excellent discussion. She is really great at starting an interesting discussion, but does not need to intervene much from there, as her questions keep the conversation moving. Readings are interesting, and the final paper is basically the only assignment (aside from reading responses). It's 15-20 pages, but is on a topic of your choice, so very interesting.",
    "Yes! It is worth the work."
