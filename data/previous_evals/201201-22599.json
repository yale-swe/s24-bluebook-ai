    "Absolutely take this class! Prof. Lee is the best",
    "A great intermediate class for heritage learners.",
    "Wonderful course that I enjoyed every day. Definitely take it if you place into it or are continuing from 132. Professor Lee-Smith is the nicest person you will ever meet, and she teaches extremely well. The curriculum is all her own design, so it can be flexible according to students' needs.",
    "Korean 142 is a wonderful way to learn Korean and the pace, lesson materials, and diverse range of topics covered truly made learning a great experience. It is challenging course but Professor Lee-Smith is extremely kind, helpful and capable that you will never feel lost or frustrated throughout the course.",
    "YES YES YES YES! for anyone who wants to become better at korean definitely take the class. it's not a lot of work, just memorizing vocab"
