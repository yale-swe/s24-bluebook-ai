    "I took this class as a non-major and I found it pretty interesting. Only take it if you're interested in the math and physics behind the phenomena in the title.",
    "The class is summarized pretty much in its title: it's about mantle dynamics (and thus plate tectonics), earthquakes, and volcanoes. I would recommend it, especially if you want to learn about more of why plate tectonics works and why continental crust was formed. It also has a lab portion in which you learn MatLab, which was quite handy.",
    "Mantle Dynamics covers some of the most important elements of Solid Earth geophysics, and gives you a better idea of interior Earth processes by studying the thermodynamics of mantle convection, kinematics and dynamics of plate tectonics, interior Earth structure with seismology, mantle geochemistry from volcanoes, and early Earth evolution. These are important concepts, but they\u0092re really more about Mantle Dynamics than much about earthquakes or volcanoes. The workload for the class is light \u0096 optional supplementary weekly readings, a few MATLAB-based lab assignments (there is a weekly two-hour lab that tries to teach you MATLAB basics), a midterm (people didn\u0092t do great, so we got \u00bd points back if we did corrections), and a (take home this year) final. Overall, the premise for this class is good, and necessary especially for Solid Earth concentrators. Korenaga has received many accolades for his own research in geophysics. However, as it is currently taught, I can\u0092t recommend this class to another student. The primary problem is the inaccuracy of the prerequisites (this year, Math 120 and Physics 180). Given what we covered in class, you should also have taken linear algebra and differential equations, as well as have some experience with MATLAB or other computer programming. Since I possessed none of the above, I really struggled with the material in this class. When dealing with a question like \u0093how does the mantle convect?\u0094 Korenaga would expend only two sentences of words, and then jump into two lectures worth of differential equations and complex figures from journal articles to answer the question. Because I don\u0092t speak math and this is my first geophysics class, I never got clear answers to so many questions I\u0092ve been very curious about since beginning to study geology. Maybe I should have put more work into the class, but perhaps Korenaga should have changed his lectures when he found out that a good number of us did not have the background needed to follow him. When we had to do those few problem sets, I found I possessed neither the conceptual understanding nor the programming skills necessary to do them. I like to thinkthat as a Yale student, if I spend HOURS trying to figure something out, I will be able to do so, but this class sadly proved me wrong. I will grant that Korenaga was extremely nice and always ready to help if we needed it. However, with his problem set assistance and his lenient grading policies, Korenaga proved himself to be more of a helper than a teacher. If he were a more effective teacher in bringing the material alive for intro students, he wouldn\u0092t need to help when we\u0092re lost. Bottom line: this is an interesting class if you have the preparation I described above. If you don\u0092t, wait until you do, or hope that Korenaga tones things down a bit, or hope that another professor better suited to the introductory levels will take it over."
