   "comments": [
    "DS Literature is a fantastic overview of some of the greatest things ever written. That's both a good and a bad thing--you get through a lot, but you go so quickly you often miss the details. That said, I definitely recommend this class to another student. You learn so much so quickly and class discussions are invariably interesting. Just plan on rereading anything you especially liked over the summer or taking a class on it the next year!",
    "I would recommend this course! If you are serious about engaging with literature, this is a perfect course for you. Be ready to do all the reading and come to class with thoughts. We discuss character and theme in class, and are expected to do close reading\/analysis on the papers. You will grow as a thinker, reader, and writer.",
    "Yes, it's incredible and especially with Professor Bauer! You will not regret it and you can handle the workload even if you think you cannot.",
    "YES!!! great teachers, good books, and awesome students :)",
    "If this is your second semester, you already know what to expect. Make sure to get a head start on Don Quixote and War and Peace of winter and spring break respectively, but the workload otherwise is basically the same. Professor Bauer is an intense professor but don't get scared off. He is kind and willing to help out, and also a fair grader.",
    "Second semester Directed Studies literature, especially with Professor Bauer, is a lot of work. That being said, I think it is entirely worth it. The works, though sometimes excessively long, are beautiful and the discussions that follow them are wonderful. Now, when I read anything, I see hints of the influence of the works we discussed in class.Discussion pushed us to say intelligent things, and forced us to prepare before class, but I found that it became easier as the semester went on. This is because the class taught me how to pick up on important themes\/passages when I was reading by myself so that I was already thinking about the things we would discuss in class.Take this class and take it with Bauer. Not because it will be easy - it won't be, and the beginning of the semester will require adjustment - but because you will learn a lot and read some wonderful things and have some wonderful discussions.",
    "Spring lit has a great reading list, but try to find another professor to take it with.",
    "I think that DS is the best possible springboard into your future at Yale. No matter what you decide to study, this class will give you an incredibly rich vantage point from which to explore any field in literature and beyond. Personally, I preferred the material covered in second semester to the material covered in the first. If you enjoyed the program first semester, stick with it!",
    "TAKE IT. Bauer expects a great deal from his class, but coming from one who was highly inconsistent with readings, it is still doable, and certainly enriches things. His grading is also fair. The thing you will find with Bauer is that his passion to help his students grow in the their understanding and as a writer is unparalleled; he goes out of his way to make sure you meet with him one on one more than once to discuss writing, works, etc.",
    "My guess is that someone considering taking this course already knows what they're getting himself into, having already taken a term of DS. This is a very good introductory course, but it is just that--introductory. Though you cover a lot of material, you definitely sacrifice depth for breadth.",
    "The pace of this class is faster than the pace of the first semester Directed Studies literature course, but this allowed us to cover the wide range of material Directed Studies is famous for. I greatly enjoyed the course and would highly recommend it to any Freshman looking to improve their writing or to get a better conception of the classical canon of literature."
