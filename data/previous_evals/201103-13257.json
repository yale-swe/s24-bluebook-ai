    "This course should be mandatory for MPH candidates - we discussed incredibly important issues, relevant to the field of public health.",
    "This course has a LOT of reading, and Shelley expects students to do it all (and will find you if you don't.) This makes it a completely excellent course--I've gotten more out of this course than most of my other courses at Yale, mostly because the expectations were so high that I really felt challenged to try my hardest and really engage with the material. Shelley is also a great moderator and it's obvious that her heart is in this work. This course would be difficult if a student was taking 4-5 other courses; as a part-time student it was perfect for me.",
    "shelley geballe is AMAZING! great insights&resources",
    "The course was great in teaching about health disparities. It was VERY reading intensive and became burdensome at times but the reading material was very interesting and high relevant. It is very discussion-based which is good but would have liked more lecture-like classes.",
    "Strengths: (1) an exceptional chance to study a topic in depth and begin to get close to a command of the unanswered as well as the answered questions. (2) A real discussion-based class, where I learnt a lot from the other students as well as from the instructor. (3) The instructor allowed us to draw our own conclusions from the reading materials Cutting edge material (readings were being added during the class as they were published!Weaknesses: (1) Really difficult to do such a class justice with four other classes to take at the same time. It should be at least a 1.5 credit class (yes, I know, 'Dream on'!) (2) The changing syllabus as readings were added and deleted, combined with the 'clunky' user-unfriendly Classes V2 interface and the huge volume of reading materials, made the class an administrative nightmare at times. I tried the 'Download multiple items' function on Classes V2 and found the downloaded materials were in folders still labelled with last year's class dates (even though folder labels on classes V2 itself had been updated). This function works fine for other classes and saves a lot of time, so let's hope the upgrade to Classes V2 will make the downloading easier next year. (3) The workload and discussion would have been easier with a slightly smaller class.",
    "Excellent! One of the best classes offered at YSPH. The class discusses the structural determinants of health from a variety of perspectives, the readings are unique and challenging, and the class discussions were always enlightening and engaging. The strengths of the course were certainly the readings, the content of the course and the instructor.",
    "Strengths- a plethora of reading, opportunity to hear about experiences from classmatesWeaknesses- too much reading, at beginning, there was more talk about experiences than material from classmates.Ways in which it may be improved- more \"wrapping up\" or summarizing at the end of class; hold students accountable to readings (it was at times easy to just talk about personal experiences on the overall topic than to discuss readings in depth).",
    "This is by far my favorite course at YSPH. Prof Geballe is truly an expert in the field and her passion shows every single week. She is an inspiration to us all.",
    "This is quite possibly one of the best courses I've ever taken. It provides a wide array of viewpoints, materials, and is an excellent venue for discussion.",
    "This is a very packed class- we covered a huge amount of information, and while it was all really interesting and important, it was an intense amount of stuff to learn. I think the format of a real discussion was good, and I learned a lot- more than I thought I might. It was a great experience, and I always looked forward to this class.",
    "Great reading materials - covers whole gamut of issues",
    "I enjoyed the Health Disparities course. Shelley comes at the issues of Health Disparities from a much different approach than I am used to encountering the issues. While my experience has primarily been downstream, this course taught me to appreciate the upstream determinants of health. Prior to this class, I really did \"get\" the concept of upstream factors. I know it's a key concept in the field of Public Health and I've heard the arguments , but I always got lost when it could only be backed up with \"soft science.\" Now I appreciate this as a very real phenomenon. So, I really learned something here. Perhaps, the intensive reading, writing, and discussion format helped me to achieve that.In terms of a suggestion.... This could be a mis-guided, but if I were to teach the course I would probably start with \"down-stream\" determinants and move upstream so as to conclude the course with refined wisdom having noted the flaws of downstream considerations along the way. That might be worth trying as an experiment. On the other hand, I learned from it in the current format -- if it's not broken, don't fix it....",
    "The range of readings was so vast - I really appreciate this. It was often difficult to complete all of them on time. The class discussions were extremely engaging, and class feedback was excellent."

   "comments": [
    "Instructor: Shelley Geballe \u00a0Prof Geballe led course discussion wonderfully, providing insightful feedback, and drawing from her extensive law and public health experiences in CT. She is inspirational and I enjoyed learning from her.",
    "Instructor: Shelley Geballe \u00a0See above. Shelley manages to combine nurturing support with high expectations in a way that really pushed me to give this class my best. She's one of the best professors I've experienced at YSPH.",
    "Instructor: Shelley Geballe \u00a0great professor; so helpful; very knowledgable; very very willing to help",
    "Instructor: Shelley Geballe \u00a0Shelley is a great instructor who really knows and understands health disparities for the most part. Although she sometimes comes off as terse, she cares about her students and provides great feedback.",
    "Instructor: Shelley Geballe \u00a0Wow, what a bundle of energy! It felt like a bit of a contest at times, trying to work out what we were 'supposed' to think, but once I decided that what I think is my problem and not Shelley's it got easier. I'm not sure we quite agreed about everything by the end of the class, but the communication was excellent.",
    "Instructor: Shelley Geballe \u00a0By far the best instructor at YSPH. Prof. Geballe is highly dedicated to the course as well as every single student - it shows through the amount she shares with us in class, as well as the personal feedback she provides throughout the course.She acts as more than a professor and takes on a mentorship role throughout her course.",
    "Instructor: Shelley Geballe \u00a0The other day we had a potluck and there were at least 4-6 people in the room who have taken a course with Shelley. We spent the majority of the potluck singing her praises and sharing how thankful we were that Yale the privilege of having professors like her.Shelley is both a teacher and student at the same time and this makes her classroom environment both inviting and engaging. You feel comfortable to speak up, but at the same time, you know that you can't just say ANYTHING on your mind because Shelley has no problem correcting you, but in the nicest way possible.I would give more voice to other perspectives on HDs; at times I felt that conversations consisted of like-minded people just building up one another's egos\/ideas on HDs. I applaud our free-market advocate for sticking through it all.",
    "Instructor: Shelley Geballe \u00a0Same as above. Most amazing, caring, passionate, successful professor I have had. She gave detailed line-by-line feedback on final papers which I have not received from any other instrustor. She truly cares abou ther students and their mastery and understanding of the topic.",
    "Instructor: Shelley Geballe \u00a0I feel honored to have taken a course with Shelley Geballe and am very impressed with the way that she facilitates discussion and provides a variety of facets to each topic.",
    "Instructor: Shelley Geballe \u00a0Shelley is so great- not only does she have a ton of experience in this area, but she is also good at facilitating discussion and guiding us while we learn. I think she did a great job of getting people to participate and creating an atmosphere where people felt really comfortable talking about some fairly sensitive topics. She provided great feedback on our assignments as well. Finally, I also felt that she was just really nice and approachable; you could tell that she took time to send us good feedback, and several times provided us, individually, with information about events that she thought we would enjoy.",
    "Instructor: Shelley Geballe \u00a0I wouldn't change anything!",
    "Instructor: Shelley Geballe \u00a0Shelley was a great instructor. She taught the class in what seemed to be a PhD format. She has really mastered the technique of cultivating a learning community that enables students to learn from each other through engaging discussion rather than a \"lecture\" format. She was insightful and informative as well.Also, I've never had a Professor\/teacher invite a class over to their house for a dinner before. I thought that was pretty unique and very nice. I don't think other Professors should be expected to, but that was truly a first in my academic career. I think it helps make a personal bond; you almost feel like you'd be welcome to get back in touch after the course if you had a reason to do so.The School of Public Health is fortunate to have Shelley!",
    "Instructor: Shelley Geballe \u00a0Wonderful instructor! She did such a good job giving us so many many perspectives on health disparities. It seems as if she left no stone unturned. She did an amazing job."

   "comments": [
    "A seminar style course discussing issues of health disparities, focusing on the US and looking at CT in particular. Discussion of law, medicine, economics, etc. and how it relates to public health.",
    "This class helps students to develop a comprehensive understanding of the nature and political\/social history of race and class disparities in health. The class relies upon students completing the extensive readings, completing weekly reading reflections, and then sharing in class. A really excellent class to take to gain a much deeper understanding of the social determinants of health and the state of the literature on this topic.",
    "amazing class. learned so much",
    "The course is a great look at health disparities that I would recommend every student to take. It is unfortunate that many public health students are unaware of health disparities.",
    "This is a tough but life-changing class dealing with some of the most important over-arching issues we will have to handle in the future. If you're doing policy, you need this class, but make sure your other classes have lighter loads than this one or it will take over. And be prepared to be asked to think (and stand up for what you think).",
    "Absolutely - there is no other course at YSPH that can be substituted for this course. It is a course that is incredibly challenging, that is demanding, and that you learn so much in. It is perfect for second years and it is something that allows students to apply every aspect of the curriculum into. Would recommend that every student at YSPH takes this course.",
    "I summarize the course as previous students did for me: \"It's a lot of work but I guarantee you that Shelley makes it all worth it.\"",
    "This course will broaden your understanding of the state of the state and where and how public health can creat change. I absolutelyrecommend this course and the instructor. Should be a mandatory class for all MPH students.",
    "It is an overview of health disparities in the context of the United States and provides a unique look at social determinants of health and the legal system that creates or attempts to fix them.",
    "This class is an in depth look at how disparities affect health. I think everyone should take it- it's a unique perspective, and an important one.",
    "Critical course for anyone in the public health field. I would absolutely recommend it.",
    "The summary on the syllabus and\/or the one available at registration was fine.",
    "Comprehensive course in domestic health disparities that can inform many areas of public health and health policy formation. I recommend this class to everyone."
