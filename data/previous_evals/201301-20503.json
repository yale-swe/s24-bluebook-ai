    "Film Studies 641 is a workshop for beginner ethnographic filmmakers. Students have an opportunity to learn different skills from week to week and will see examples of different styles of filmmaking. At the end of the class, each student will present a final media product based on field research.I would recommend this course, because it is interesting and the skill gained have been useful for other areas of my education.",
    "Karen is amazing",
    "I would highly recommend the course, but only for a student looking for a unique experience. The student must be highly motivated to learn multimedia recording techniques and editing software. The term-long project will take much more time than almost any other course. The upsideis that it is not the mentally straining reading\/writing\/analytical work required in most courses; rather, it is a bit repetitive, and maybe even meditative. It requires a good deal of creativity and artistic thought. Be prepared to log many, many hours!"

   "comments": [
    "This course was an elective; however, I believe I will use the skills learned for future research endeavors.",
    "Karen is revolutionary.",
    "This was my first course in visual anthropology, so it was an intense introduction to the theoretical and ethical aspects of ethnographic multimedia production. All of my prior experience has been in ethnographic fieldwork and writing, so this was a totally new angle on the discipline. I feel it contributed greatly to my long-term academic and non-academic plans, and it has certainly inspired me to continue practicing film production as a personal interest."
