   "question_text": "Looking back on this course, what is your overall assessment of the course:  What are its strengths and weaknesses, and in what ways might it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This course essentially became a glorified speaker series. There was also the sentiment amongst students that the professors were trying to punish students that were not in class.",
    "The content was very interesting and unlike many of my other courses, but the way in which it was delivered could have been improved. I would absolutely recommend NOT beginning the course with the exposure assessment lecture. It was very dry and put me in a negative mindset entering the course.",
    "This course has really interesting topics, and I really enjoyed some of the guest speakers. That being said, way too many of the classes were given by guest lecturers, which made it hard to know what the important points were on the exams. I really enjoyed when Professor Stowe lectured; she was engaging and made the material very interesting. Unfortunately, she only taught 2 or 3 times. The assignments that needed to be turned in during the discussion group also changed frequently during the semester, which was frustrating and hard to keep track of. Overall, this course could be great, but it was highly unorganized.",
    "The TA sessions were enjoyable. The amount of weekly work was fine until weekly write-ups were required. There were a lot of questions, none of which felt like it gave me more insight into the article. Just the discussion of the article was sufficient.",
    "useless, too broad, the exam sucks",
    "A general overview of existing environmental concerns, with a few studies about new international instances.Strengths: Discussion groups were very open and at times, engaging for debate.Weaknesses: Low class attendance and hesitance for participation. Felt bad for certain guest lecturers that had to speak in a sparsely attended lecture, perhaps host the class in a smaller classroom? Textbook seemed to go beyond the scope of this course.",
    "I did not enjoy this course at all. I thought it was a waste of time and didn't know what were the main concepts I'm getting out of the course. Each class has a speaker come to talk about a certain environmental topic, but there was no linkage between the topics. There was too many information thrown at us and no one to say what are the important points in each lecture. I thought the midterm was poorly written (ie fill in the blank). It would be very helpful to have a previous midterm\/ test to look back on to study. That way, at least I know what I can expect on the tests. Without that, I feel like I basically have to memorize all the powerpoints and readings.",
    "Strengths:A diversity of knowledge and interests. I like that the course covered topics from sustainable living and waste management to silver nanoparticles and epigenetics. I loved the outside speakers they brought in, because I feel like they had great expertise in their respective fields.Weaknesses:The instructors\/TAs could have come at a few of the topics from a more general background; lectures on hormones, epigenetics, and biomarkers were difficult for me to grasp given I have no background in public health\/biology. The readings were extremely difficult and I felt I got no help (especially in section, when I expected it) trying to understand them. I HATED that section was not in fact a place to discuss the lecture and readings; due to time constraints, we were basically just listening to student presentations all the time. I felt these presentations, while on interesting topics, did not tie in well with the class. Section felt so disjointed from lecture. I wish the presentation topics could have been lectured on, and we could use section as a place to discuss these topics and others, along with the readings.Also, although I enjoyed the outside speakers, instructors should work to tie them in with the general curriculum and make their lectures fit smoothly into what we've been doing the whole semester.",
    "Ways to improve the course:- Review required textbook readings in class because there was an inconsistency among the TAs with reviewing that material- Post the slides on v2 before class- Put less text on the slides- If you are going to skip over slides during class and say it is not important, it would be helpful if they were removed from the deck because it presents confusion when studying the material later-Also, take out repeat slides (for example, the same deck had a slide called \"7 Principles of risk communication\" and a slide called \"7 Cardinal rules of risk communication\" which listed the same exact thing)- The class could use more structure in terms of topics and what to expect- Although several of the guest speakers were extremely interesting, it almost felt like there were too many guest speakers and not enough consistency with class structure- If you are not going to post an answer key to the midterm, it would be helpful to review the answers when we have our tests back (not while the TAs are putting them in our mailboxes)",
    "This class may be the worse I have taken in 1.5 years at YSPH. The course consisted of random topics thrown together in no particular order. No skills were taught. If you read the same subject matter online it would have made no difference. The exams were also the worst I have had here. Exams legitimately had matching on them, MATCHING! They focused on straight memorization of topics and no discussion or application of skills was required. I'm certain that I will forget everything taught in this class in the next 3 months because it is all memory based.",
    "I think the course lacked fluidity and organization. The subject matter is really interesting, I just wish it was delivered better.",
    "It's not that well connected. It's hard to do so but there's a greater need to do that. Also the guest speakers need to be better and more engaging.",
    "Lectures were very disorganized and learning objectives were very unclear. The only way to prepare for the midterm and the final was memorize as much of the lecture slides, required articles, and book material as possible, with no way of being able to tell what information was more or less important. Lecture and article material ranged from extremely broad common sense information to extremely specific scientific concepts that were inadequately explained. Creating the journal article outline for the weekly assigned readings was useful in analyzing the articles, but the newspaper article summary was less helpful since it did not help reinforce any of the concepts presented in the lecture or journal articles.",
    "Overall good. Honestly wasn't too excited about taking the course. Was a major requirement. I can say I learned some interesting things, though I did not always agree with the information provided by the instructor",
    "Disorganized.",
    "This was probably one of my least favorite classes I have ever taken. It is unfortunate because the material for the most part was very interesting. The way the class was structured, the copious amount of reading\/busy work, and the exam structure made me to not appreciate the class. The class needs more structure (less guest lecturers) and needs to focus on less topics. There were so many topics that were all fair game for the exams so it was very difficult to study for the exams. There also needs to be less busy-work outside class (i.e., weekly article summaries, 5-10 articles to read, etc). If the class was more focused, had fewer readings (only had readings with true value), and more meaningful work, I would have appreciated it a lot more.",
    "This could be the worst class I've taken at Yale. We had guest speakers for nearly every class meeting, making it seem very disjointed. The powerpoints were boring, the class was not interactive, and I barely learned a thing. The midterm was unfair, given the instructor's great lack of care for the class. It should be a small, case-based class with passionate, interesting instructors. The instructors also didn't seem to communicate much and often seemed at odds with each other.There were way too many readings for each week, often too scientific in nature and lengthy, which dissuaded me from even bothering. I would have read them if there were only a couple, thoughtfully-chosen ones. Pick just a few, and do what practically every other instructor does for students on v2 - post the readings (especially since they are journal articles), not just a Word document with citations listed.",
    "This class is completely disjointed. Guest lecturers are great, but should only be utilized once a firm foundation in a field has been established by the course's instructor. The lack of a strong primary professor presence caused the course to feel jumbled, disorganized, and incoherent. I would recommend the first third to half of the course be taught by one professor, and guest lecturers be brought in only towards the end.",
    "This was the worst course I have taken at Yale, I was very disappointed. The course felt like it was directed to a high-school audience, some of the material was so basic, and there was virtually no theory incorporated into the lectures. The lectures were predominantly a description of current issues in environmental health. The textbook discussed risk assessment, definitions, and field methods, but this was never explained or emphasized in class. The assignments changed all the time from what was on the syllabus, the discussion section was completely pointless, and the first exam was like a high school exam with matching, fill in the blank, and short answer. I didn't come away from the course feeling like I learned very much.",
    "It is not well structured, there is no continuity between lectures. Also, I did not find the textbook helpful. Even a more outdated, but easier to read book would have been better.",
    "The strength of this course is the possibility for rich discussion and great topic of study. However, their were more guest lecturers than lectures by the professors and the powerpoint slides were extremely busy and unhelpful.",
    "Strengths: very, very broad overview of VERY general topics.Weaknesses: those general topics could have as easily been learned from reading the NYTimes. Midterm was so poorly written and did not reflect the true heart of the course or the title. Final exam was much, much better. Practical application of ideas and principles is much more educational than memorization of random toxicology definitions.",
    "this is a really mediocre look at cont. issues in environmental health. the professors put little to no effort into class, outsourcing most of the lectures to other speakers who didn't appear to be practiced lecturers. this format led to a disjointed class that did little to provide a cohesive background in the subject. the readings, especially those from the textbook, did not align with the lectures (in their scientific lean moreso than anything else). the lectures given by the class's professors were basic and did little to challenge the sort of information most students in the class probably held from reading the newspaper or being engaged citizens of the world.",
    "I understand that the course is an overview course, but the topics were so scattered and I felt like we were thrown a lot of random facts without having a holistic picture of what the topic was about. This was more of a memorization class. I walked away feeling like I didn't learn as much as I should have because there was a lack of structure and emphasis on what we should take away from the course.",
    "The class should be organized better. The topics should be discussed more in depth.",
    "Terrible... Do not take... no cohesion of the topics and what is stressed",
    "interesting topics but the content are not as well organized",
    "I felt it was a good survey of a lot of issues in environmental health however there wasn't enough conversation between the two instructors leading to discordance in teaching as well as a textbook that was too technical for the class.",
    "The class was a true disappointment and I detested attending sessions more and more. Firstly, the \"who's coming to dinner\" class sessions were not effective to learning the material. The guest speakers were often poor communicators and materials were too dense for one class session. The slides for the course were poor and grammatically incorrect. The lab discussion was often a lot better than the class, but the assignments for that class were ridiculous. Weekly paragraph summary about an article was childish and below the caliber of this class and quite frankly the institution. One of the professors would fall asleep in the class! If that's not a clear indication that the class was a major fail, I don't know what is.",
    "This class is definitely taught as a survey course but I think it could have had a bit more focus and emphasis put on important themes and ideas instead of more specific limited concepts.",
    "This was the worst class I've taken at YSPH, which was sad because it should have been one of the best. The subject material was interesting, but it was presented in such an erratic and non-cohesive manner that I didn't get anything out of it.In addition, the teaching was terrible. I didn't mind having guest lecturers, but it was almost impossible to know what was on the tests since the instructors seemed to draw randomly from the guest presenters. I'm sure it was what they thought was most important, but as new students to environmental health you would have to be a mind reader to have any idea what the instructors were going to think was important.Additionally, the teacher-student culture was characterized by a lack of respect on the part of the instructors (Meredith in particular). It felt like they were trying to trick the students and\/or wanted them to fail.The TAs were universally great but their helpfulness was limited by the fact that they had no idea what was going to be on the tests. The comprehensive study guides were thus pretty useless.In the future, the TAs should absolutely be involved in test design. At the very least, they should be told what will be on it so that they can provide guidance that is at least somewhat helpful.",
    "I found the class connected the public health topics and environmental health. One weakness was the fact that topics ranged from general ideas on climate change to very detailed-oriented biomarker information. Also, the exams were poorly constructed.",
    "Very generic overview of environmental health issues. A broad range of issues were covered so it is difficult to go very deep. The presentation in discussion section was good. Enjoyed most of the guest speakers. Busy work increased as the semester wore on.",
    "This course was not well structured. The learning goals and objectives were vague, the midterm exam was not reflective of overall learning goals or class material, and the required assignments changed midway through the semester."

    "Instructor: Kathleen Mary McCarty \u00a0Professor McCarty was not as engaging in lecture, and she often seemed to be disappointed in us for not reading the material before lecture or not asking questions of the guest speakers. I think that if the course had been taught by the instructors more often and had been better organized, the students would have been more involved and interested.",
    "Instructor: Kathleen Mary McCarty \u00a0Both instructors gave the impression that they did not respect us as students. Although the topics were interesting, this made the class in general discouraging (we were all very unmotivated).Here are three specific examples:(1) Did not post the powerpoint class slides until AFTER class. They explained they believed this would encourage people to come to class. They are wrong! EVERY CLASS POSTS SLIDES BEFORE. By doing this, it actually PUNISHES students like me who take notes directly onto the powerpoint. Their method really discouraged me from coming to class, as I felt it was absolutely inefficient to take notes in a word document (which you couldn't do because there was SO MUCH MATERIAL ON EVERY SLIDE) and compare with the powerpoint after class.(2) Required us to outline our class readings (haven't had to do this in a SINGLE class in my 2 years at YSPH, in fact, haven't had to do this since elementary school).(3) Designed a test so that students WOULD fail with nitpicky detail (rather than themes of the class). The real world doesn't have \"four ways of XYZ\" or \"two methods of ABC\" and we shouldn't be tested ONLY on straight memorization.Best part of the class was having guest lecturers and the TAs.",

    "Instructor: Kathleen Mary McCarty \u00a0please take more responsibility to organize the course!!!",
    "Instructor: Kathleen Mary McCarty \u00a0Katie is nice and approachable, but she speaks too softly. She is expecting too much from the students without giving them the tools to get to that level.",
    "Instructor: Kathleen Mary McCarty \u00a0It's sometimes hard to understand from her lectures what the bigger picture is. She's so focused on details and covering every little topic that I feel she never steps back to tell us, OK bottom line is this.",
    "Instructor: Kathleen Mary McCarty \u00a0Katie is very passionate about the class, but needs to speak louder and slower. Also, her slides need to have less text on them.",
    "Instructor: Kathleen Mary McCarty \u00a0Not impressed. Professor McCarty showed no command of the subject matter, brought no interesting incites based upon her own work and provided no novel information. She basically conveyed that arsenic is bad for you, which I learned when I read \"Arsenic and Old Lace\" some 12 years ago.",
    "Instructor: Kathleen Mary McCarty \u00a0Dr. McCarty is very nice and approachable. Similar to Dr. Stowe, I'm not sure I was able to get to know her because of the overwhelming number of guest speakers.",
    "Instructor: Kathleen Mary McCarty \u00a0She's a good teacher.",
    "Instructor: Kathleen Mary McCarty \u00a0Professor McCarty provided information to the class that was inconsistent and confusing, such as not needing to prepare a certain lecture for the midterm exam and then including questions from that lecture on the midterm. Her lectures were informative, but again did not tie back into the underlying concepts of exposure assessment and did provide learning objectives.",
    "Instructor: Kathleen Mary McCarty \u00a0the instructor for this course was clearly enthusiatic about the material. Cannot honestly say anything bad besides that fact that I didn't agree with Dr. McCarty on some of the information put forth on the food lecture.",

    "Instructor: Kathleen Mary McCarty \u00a0Kathleen could stand to be more assertive in class. She speaks very quietly and is difficult to hear. Her expectations were not clear, nor did they seem consistent.",
    "Instructor: Kathleen Mary McCarty \u00a0She spoke really quickly when she lectured, it was hard to take notes and keep up",

    "Instructor: Kathleen Mary McCarty \u00a0Dr. McCarty would always talk extremely fast and quiet, making the classes both hard to hear and follow. There were frequently repeat slides between lectures and too many slides in the first place. I think she has important knowledge to share, but the feeling like she was always in a rush and saying we have the slides online made it feel like there was no need to come to class.",
    "Instructor: Kathleen Mary McCarty \u00a0it seemed like prof. mccarthy had a chip on her shoulder from the outset of class.though the class was disorganized, she was defensive when critiqued (esp. in terms of class assignments and the composition of the midterm, which was poorly written to test students' understanding of the general thrust of the course materials). furthermore, her lectures did little to inform students and she was generally an unapproachable figure for the class.",

    "Instructor: Kathleen Mary McCarty \u00a0knowledgeable and interesting",
    "Instructor: Kathleen Mary McCarty \u00a0There were two instructors and it was obvious that they couldn't communicate well between each other and each had different goals for the class.I felt there was a disconnect between the class and this instructor. She wanted it to be more of a discussion based class and with 60 people in the class that becomes difficult. She would also fly through slides and then say that we would cover it later and wouldn't or would say it is all on the slide so we can read it later. I appreciated her enthusiasm for the subject but it was obviously geared toward her specific interests in bangladesh and water contamination.",
    "Instructor: Kathleen Mary McCarty \u00a0Themain reason the class failed was because of Kathleen. See above.",
    "Instructor: Kathleen Mary McCarty \u00a0Kathleen was present at most classes but not always lecturing so did not get as good of a feel for her teaching style. However when she did lecture her power-point slides were very dense and hard to really delve into the sections of great importance.",

However, I felt that this instructor was not so concerned with students' learning as with incentivizing students to attend class, through placing obscure questions mentioned in passing in lecture on to tests.

    "Ray Serrano is a great TA. His strengths are that he is very understanding of students, very approachable, and a good communicator\/liaison between the professors and us the students. I feel like his one weakness is that he didn't seem to have much knowledge on some of the topics, and when we asked questions, he couldn't clarify.",
    "Elizabeth Claydon was a wonderful TA. She was extremely nice and willing to listen to feedback from our section. She did a good job engaging the section, specifically to discuss the required articles and our weekly news stories. One thing that may have improved the section was to include review about the reading from the textbook in her slides.",
    "Liz- Excellent all around. really grasps the concepts of the course and helps people to understand better over the course of discussions.",
    "The TA's might have been the saving graces of this course. The section actually facilitated some discussion on the topics and allowed us to voice concerns and\/or dissent with the opinions presented in class.",
    "Liz Claydon was a great TA. She made sure we covered all of the bases in discussion, but also made the material fun and interesting. She was great at involving the other students in discussion. She was always very helpful and available if we had questions.",
    "Kalina was a great TA. I really enjoyed the sections for this class.",
    "Katie Richardson - Katie Richardson was a helpful and engaging TA who facilitated stimulating discussions. It would have been very helpful for material reinforcement if the TAs were able to know more about the format of and content on the final exam.",
    "Kalina Duncan - Kalina was a great TA, she led discussions very well. She created an open environment where all students felt comfortable contributing.",
    "TAs were great! My TA was Kalina. It is often difficult to facilitate a discussion section. kalina made everyone feel comfortable yielding a great, never dull\/quiet,discussion section",
    "My TA, Katie, was fine.",
    "Ray Serrano was a great TA. He understood our concerns with the course and did his best to make things easier for us. He also explained topics that were difficult.",
    "Elizabeth Claydon - very nice, interactive, passionate and understanding",
    "Elizabeth Clayton was a wonderful TA. Although I didn't like the course, I felt like I learned a lot in section.",
    "The TA was enthusiastic and responsive to questions and emails. always well prepared for class with power points and emailed handouts.",
    "Liz was great at running section and clearly interested in the material.",
    "Ray Serano. Ray really helped us organize the information presented in class and assigned us working groups to synthesize the necessary material. He was well prepared with slides and notes at every discussion and faithfully sent out the article summaries for review.",
    "Kalina was AWESOME. Best TA to lead an early Friday AM section. So thankful that she was our TA. She was super helpful and sincere.",
    "elizabeth claydon--great TA. did her best to make sense of a disorganized class, and was very understanding and helpful to her students.",
    "Katie Richardson is good at engaging discussion and encouraging participation.",

    "Ray is a great TA. he always tries to help",
    "Ray was a fantastic TA and really helped keep the course grounded and sift out what was relevant and important. He cared greatly for his session and made every effort to make it a good experience.",

    "Liz was great.",
    "My TA (Katie) worked well in trying to cover the week's topics and news articles that students present.",

   "comments": [
    "A good overview of environmental health issues. I found myself applying things I had learned to my own life which is always a good sign. I would recommend it to someone else looking for a surface-level understanding of the issues but who does not want to specialize in environmental health.",
    "Although I did not enjoy this class very much, it seems like the best option when fulfilling the EHS requirement. It was more frustrating than it was difficult.",
    "DON'T TAKE IT UNLESS YOU HAVE TO. THEY TREAT YOU LIKE YOU ARE BACK IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL (ASK YOU TO OUTLINE CLASS READINGS AND SUBMIT THIS OUTLINE, TEST ON MEMORIZATION INSTEAD OF ON CONCEPTS, WON'T GIVE YOU THE POWERPOINT UNTIL AFTER CLASS)",
    "Only if Env Health and reading academic journals are issues you're unfamiliar with.",
    "not to recommend!",
    "I do not recommend this course.",
    "I would definitely recommend it to a fellow student. I feel i learned a lot about a very important topic (env health problems), but also about the processes\/biology of toxicology and epidemiology.",
    "It is a fine course to get a basic knowledge of many topics in environmental health. However, the class felt rather disheveled and not structured enough for my liking. Taking another one of the environmental health classes for my core requirement that fit my learning style better may have been a better choice.",
    "It is a requirement to graduate.",
    "This class amounts to a freshman year in high school course. We had incoherent, disjointed lectures with ill-prepared slides and were asked to memorize for the exams. It really was a 9th grade class except this class cost $3000 dollars (more with interest) and kept me from taking a course that I wanted to take.",
    "This course introduces basic concepts of environmental science and how it impacts health.",
    "It;s all about the contemporary issues and concerns in EHS",
    "Because the class was so disorganized without any clear learning objectives, I felt that I was ultimately was not able to fully get a sense of both the general elements of environmental health or the scope of contemporary issues.",
    "Seminar course on environmental health. Broad overview of various topics. Exams don't always focus on \"important information\".",
    "Don't recommend to take the course. Actually, it is tragic that there are few options among environmental health requirements in the school.",
    "I would not recommend this course for a fellow student unless its structure is changed.",
    "Don't take it if you don't have to. You won't learn anything and it is quite boring and disjointed. Most people decided not to show up (although I did). If you need to fulfill an EHS course and want to pass easily, then take it, but if you want to come away knowing anything about EHS, do not take it.",
    "I would recommend it as a fairly easy, interesting elective. If a student is looking for a rigorous course, however, I would not recommend this one.",
    "It's rather easy, but the mandatory friday section is inconvenient.",
    "This is a good course to take if you have never been exposed to environmental science, otherwise chose another course.",
    "I would not currently recommend this course because I didn't learn anything really exciting and new like I had expected to. I think this course has a lot of potential, and with some re-formatting has the ability to provide students with a baseline of the important and pressing issues in environmental health.",
    "i would not recommend this course to a fellow student. it is disorganized, poorly composed, and, frustratingly, often a waste of time.",
    "I would not recommend this class. I did not learn much in this class.",
    "Terrible.... However, if you want to learn nothing but take a fairly easy class that only requires busy work then I would recommend",
    "attend lectures and do the readings",
    "A good overview of relevant issues in environmental health but at times inconsistent from broad to very specific.",
    "Fail. True fail.",
    "I would say that this course is a great introduction into the field of environmental science but it could still use some improvements and consistency between the two professors teaching styles.",
    "I would recommend this course with reservations, but the limitations of the class can be easily improved.",
    "Good introduction to environmental issues to non-EHS students. I would recommend a student take this in favor of Toxicology, especially if simultaneously taking SBS and Health Policy",
    "I recommend some revisions, but it can be an overall great course."
