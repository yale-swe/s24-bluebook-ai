    "The class was well designed. The special lecturers who came to give lectures were very frank and we could deal with everything about the organizations, which was very helpful to understand conservation strategies.",

   "comments": [
    "the opportunity for small lunches with the speakers was amazing! i was able to access people from the big NGOs that i had read about, and finally had a chance to understand the operations from their perspective. i felt like one of the best parts of the course was the personal network i made, as well as an excellent overview of the key issues conservationists have struggled with, particularly since the mid90s, particularly in regards to protected areas. and i actually really appreciated the readings.",
    "The speakers were by and large fantastic.",
    "Getting to work on a project for an organization. Applying some of the more general concepts I had read about in a specific project helped me relate to them better and understand their real-life function.",
    "Guest speakers, lunches with the speakers, and a wonderful instructor!",
    "great lectures in part 1 of the course",
    "Ability to talk to a lot of professionals in the field, get some real world contacts, and keep up to date on current issues in conservation.Adaptive management sessions were useful, and there should be more participatory activities for the class (field trip?).",
    "Covering topics that are otherwise neglected by the FES curriculum - both in terms of themes, and geographies (i.e. the tropics).",
    "Being exposed to many practitioners and going beyond theory.",
    "The open format for assignments. There was lots of freedom about how we could complete assignments."

    "some of the speakers weren't amazing. i was really excited to have the foundations of success folks come; now i know, unequivocally, that i have no interest in taking any courses they teach, which i suppose is good knowledge--but disappointing. similarly i thought the course was dominated by the big ngos. which was great for me, as i've had a left coast, grassroots-groups perspective, but i'd think it could be good to get someone from cultural survival, maybe some other smaller groups that often find themselves on the other side of the divide. in fact, getting one or two panels for the classes that will be a bit controversial, rather than one perspective, could be valuable, too. but largely i don't think much needs to be changed. i really enjoyed the ega person, but i'm not sure others did.also, the response papers probably could have been structured in a better way. i didn't think the format, with select students intending to kick off the conversation, functioned very well.",
    "The course needs to attract a wider range of students.",
    "the \"foundations of success\" modules were painful to sit through",
    "Need to shorten the number and length of presentations a little bit, and maybe gear the course more toward the projects. Make students pick a project more quickly, and concentrate on fewer but more cross-cutting and group work. Encourage guest lecturers to go outside of their comfort zone a bit, instead of just talking about what they do on a daily basis in their office.It was not acceptable to have 9 hours of mandatory class time during reading and finals week. For a couple of the topics, two speakers could definitely be consolidated into one, and the presentations should just take place during the last normal class period.Marina should have felt more free to take control of class sessions, share more about her Rainforest Alliance work, and push discussion a bit more.",
    "Some (2-3) of the speakers were just really unengaging and uninteresting, and made for rather wearisome 3 hour classes.",
    "Fewer guest speakers, and instead have instructor lead more lectures and discussions.",
    "Maintaining a clear conceptual momentum and pace with a class with mostly guest speakers can be challenging."
