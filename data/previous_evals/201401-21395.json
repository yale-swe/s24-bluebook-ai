    "This class was AMAZING. Fantastic readings, generative and thoughtful discussions, and you get to work with lots of different types of narratives -- visual art, film, literature, and theory! It's a LOT of work (the reading responses are very long), but definitely worth it. Definitely, definitely take this class if you're interested in art, literature, race, gender, or colonialism\/postcolonial studies.",
    "Amazing class - one of the best I've taken at Yale. Everyone's very serious about reading very important and difficult texts, not to mention Professor Carby is always spot-on with her contributions. Lots of work but totally worth it!",
    "Caribbean Diasporic Literature is an intense, amazing class. Professor Carby is intimidatingly intelligent while also being welcoming and encouraging. The reading list is phenomenal and so, so affecting. Take this class, but be prepared for your fellow students to impact it greatly and to do a lot of long reading responses on entire books. So worth it though.",
    "I loved this course! Very interesting texts with so much variety; I know I wouldn't have had the opportunity to read them otherwise. I'm so happy to have had the opportunity to engage with this class!",
    "Caribbean Diasporic Lit was a really wonderful course. Professor Carby has though carefully about the themes of the course, and has crafted a syllabus that feels cohesive without being totalizing or deterministic. Class discussion was always varied and provocative, and weekly student presentations always raised challenging questions. I very much looked forward to our weekly readings and discussion; this was my favorite class this semester. Workload is to read some sort of written work per week, weekly blog post, presentation, 10-15 page final paper."
