    "One of my favorite classes I've taken in 4 years at Yale. It's hard to go wrong with reading Merrill's work, of course, but this was such a fantastic opportunity to learn from a professor that knows almost everything about a poet's life and work, and on top of that the class this term was made up of a wonderful group that was very engaged and always had compelling things to say. Add to that the oppotunities to visit Merrill's house, meet people he knew, and explore documents and artifacts, plus Professor Hammer's relaxed butstill rigorous teaching style, and you have the best kind of seminar I can imagine.In order to enjoy this class, though, you have to enjoy and appreciate poetry, puns, sometimes obscure references (often made with a sense of humor, not with pretensiousness), and be willing to engage in discussion and analysis based heavily on biography (not solely on textual analysis). But if you like those things, then take this!",
    "Yes! Take this class! You get to focus on one American poet, James Merrill, for an entire semester and read close to all of his works (prose and poems). And there is a class field trip to Merrill's house in Stonington, CT.",
    "Lanny Hammer is a dream. This class was one of the best English seminars I've taken at Yale - there was a really high standard for participation, and Prof. Hammer is a master at facilitating discussion. Plus Merrill turned out to be awesome too. Just take it.",
    "It's a class about James Merrill's poetry that also covers his life, the poets and artists who influenced him, and the places and times he wrote about. When I started, I thought the emphasis on biography would be annoying, but in fact, it's hard to understand what Merrill is talking about even superficially without knowing something about his life, since he wrote very personal poems about his friends and lovers. It was my first time reading anything by Merrill, and now I think he was a genius. His poems are understated and reserved, yet virtuosic and intensely technical. I'm very glad I took the course.",
    "Yes if you want a better than average seminar but if you can shop and find something better take it instead. You're not missing much.",
    "A really excellent course. The syllabus was designed, successfully, to provide an overview of Merrill's work. To read every single one of Merrill's poems, which are densely layered with meaning, would not have been doable, but Professor Hammer was tremendously thoughtful in emphasizing which readings to focus on. He led the discussions with panache, knowing when to lecture and when to guide, and has that rare skill of being able to provide discreet, non-judgmental feedback in the moment. The supplements to Merrill's poems---guests, prose readings, Ouija night, a trip to Merrill's house in Connecticut---were well-curated and helpful. Professor Hammer's comments on essays showed great care and perceptiveness.",
    "This is a fantastic seminar. The chance to learn about an unusual, enigmatic, and immensely interesting poet from the poet's biographer is an incredible opportunity. We went to James Merrill's home, looked at some of his belongings in the Beinecke, had the opportunity to meet and talk to Merrill's close family members and dearest friends, and had engaging discussions about the poetry itself. It was a fun way to get to know him.",
    "Take a class on an amazing poet from his BIOGRAPHER! Duh. But be prepared to be surrounded by suffocatingly eurocentric english majors with moleskin note books.",
    "This is a fantastic seminar on the life and work of a formative American poet. However, the structure of the course allows for exploration in any number of related fields. However, the class is not easy and shouldn't be undertaken lightly.",
    "Merrill is a difficult poet, but after taking this class he is one of my favorites. His greatest work The Changing Light at Sandover is still beyond my understanding but this class is a great start. For any poets, a must take. Professor Hammer is the leading expert on Merrill and makes a fun class."
