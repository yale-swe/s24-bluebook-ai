   "comments": [
    "Of course! It's a great class where one is able to read some great literature that is largely excluded from northeastern schools like Yale for no good reason. It's also a great class for an English major like me to take to read some more contemporary works and to have a class with lots of people who generally really care about the subject.",
    "Take this if you are interested in learning more about literature and would find it interesting and engaging to see it contextualized in a socioeconomic environment.",
    "Definitely take the course, even if you are an Anglo-male, like me.",
    "YES! If you are at all interested in the Chicano movement, or even if you're not, you have something to gain from this class. If you're just looking for a relaxing literature class with a great reading list, this is also the class for you.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student as long as they're interested in the material. Even if you don't know any spanish, you can still get something out of this course.",
    "The reading list is great. The reading is a bit heavy, but if you keep up with it and don't let yourself get behind it will be manageable. The topics for both midterm and final papers are all great, so I'm sure you'll find a topic that you are interested in writing about. Her paper expectations are high, so just make sure to give yourself plenty of time, organize the paper well, and you'll be fine. Overall, I liked the class, my fellow peers, the professor, and the readings. Take this class if you can! :)",
    "Latino Lit is one of the best seminars I've taken at Yale. Finally, a class where the reading is incredibly engaging (every word mattered), but manageable enough so that I WANTED to read, I WANTED to finish each book. In class, I wished we had done more close reading together, really picking apart passages versus trying to cover everything. I also expected more student-directed discussion, our professor definitely facilitated discussion well, but at times it seemed like there was so much to fit that toward the end she often talked for a long time. I feel that this will change over time \/ depending on the class though. The reading list also felt very well thought out in terms of the order and related ideas. The papers were short, but because we were asked to do deep analysis and write WELL, I felt I learned more about my own writing process because I was not worried about churning out a crappy 20-page paper. I'm glad we had to do the presentations \/ reading responses -- I almost always felt on top of what I needed to learn. Take this class if you want an awesome reading list\/discussions\/papers\/friends.",
    "Yes! Take this course! Brander Rasmussen is an amazing professor, and the readings for this class are very enjoyable. The workload is manageable, so you really get to enjoy everything you are doing without having to stress about it. About one novel a week along with a reading response. And then two essays (4-6pg and 5-7pgs) and one group presentation. Take this if you can get it!",
    "This class is awesome. The books we read are, if not relatable, enjoyable. Professor Brander Rasmussen is really encouraging and exciting. Take this class.",
    "This was a good course. The readings had a good amount of variety and were interesting and the workload was light (one presentation, two papers, and a weekly response on the reading that you have to read anyway to participate in class). It might be improved by bringing a greater variety of Latino literature, rather than Chicano, into the syllabus. Writers from Guatemalan or Argentinean or Cuban descent would have a much different feel from the Puerto Rican and Mexican authors we focused on. Professor Rasmussen lead the course well but not spectacularly. I would have preferred less lecturing in class -- many of the people in the course had a personal or educational familiarity with Latino history and I feel like we could have benefited from more in depth discussions of the texts themselves.",
    "Great class, great readings. Really enjoyable to be doing what I would consider pleasure reading for a class. Not a lot of work--two really short papers. I took the class Cr\/D\/F, which was great, because then I didn't have to give much thought to those papers."
