   "comments": [
    "Yes, all music students should take this course because it is foundational to all the research we do.",
    "The course was based around various materials relevant to music research -- paper, bindings, inks, prints, recordings, and so on. Theoretical seminar-based discussions were interspersed with visits to various conservation departments and\/or archives in Yale libraries, which enabled a practical engagement with sources whose utility is typically overlooked; the seminar made clear how important a critical awareness of the materiality of historical sources really is. I would wholeheartedly recommend this course to another student.",
    "This course is an introduction to the various materials with which music scholars can interact, and the methods commonly used with them.",
    "This seminar develops insight into the workings of libraries and archives, especially as to the capacities in which these institutions serve scholars of music. It also incorporates some recent theoretical\/philosophical work on how to think about materials and their contexts, agencies, etc. As such, the seminar involved a number of field visits to various archiving\/preservation sites in Yale's libraries as well as more traditional seminar days in which readings are discussed. During seminar days, students can expect to handle a number of carefully curated selections from the library's rare books and manuscripts holdings in order to survey how the philosophical approaches we covered were relevant to encountering materials as working researchers. I would recommend this seminar to other students for the insight it gives into the workings of the library system, how to take advantage of it, the ample dose of philosophical and otherwise interdisciplinary thinking, and the instructor's willingness to adapt the seminar and take it in the directions to which it developed. I found the instructor to be especially gracious with incorporating insight into the history of the discipline as well as developing highly useful career advice for seminar members."

   "comments": [
    "It is the kind of course that will impact all future research.",
    "There was a significant element of meta-disciplinary discussion in the seminars, in that Prof. Ahrendt frequently foregrounded the way in which musicology has grappled (whether positively or negatively) with material sources; this was exceedingly useful in that it turned our thoughts towards our own place within the discipline at this point in time. This will certainly play a part in how I determine my eventual dissertation topic, and it will hopefully underpin the progress of the dissertation as I research and write it.",
    "As stated above, this was a great introduction to resources at Yale and materials research.",
    "Due to the instructor's willingness to discuss aspects of the history of the discipline, and her willingness to make the seminar relevant to our careers, I found the seminar to be rich with valuable knowledge about the discipline and how to relate myself to it as a member of it. I am not yet sure how the seminar will impact my future dissertation research but anyone will find the insight into the library system that developed in this course to be of high potential value."
