   "comments": [
    "Less focus on readings and vocab",
    "I think the strength is the amount of material that it goes through - we covered a lot of material, especially grammar, but it never felt like too much. The weakness is how little reading\/engagement there was, especially how trivial the writing assignments are. I think there could have been analytical writing about the reading we did. It was too structured around specific grammar structures and specific ways of speaking.",
    "The grading is structured in a strict manner. This is a reflection of L3, not necessarily the Professor. Quizzes and tests are almost worth the same amount. Not only that, it is incredibly easy to lose points.",
    "The reading of Relato de un Nufrago was a little bit too fast. Also, sometimes there were too many assessments all at once.",
    "The readings and the novel used in class were covered minimally and at an excessively fast pace.",
    "One strength of the course was that it met every day, but I felt that we should have communicated in Spanish at all times for a more immersive experience.",
    "The strength of this course is that it meets every day. Weakness is excessive work that just gets annoying and makes me lose the fun of learning the language."

    "Yes. It's good to learn all the grammar and vocab before doing L4.",
    "Yes because I got a lot out of the course and feel much more comfortable speaking Spanish.",
    "Yes, as long as they are willing to put in a considerable amount of effort in order to improve their Spanish.",
    "Yes if they want to learn a new language. You just have to suck it up and commit to it."
