    "research for credit. either you like research or you are doing it for the credit.",
    "Yes, do it. If you're working in a lab, might as well get credit for it.",
    "Take research for credit if you want to better familiarize yourself in a lab setting and lab protocols\/techniques.",
    "This is a research course where you conduct research in a lab. It is pretty straightforward. Most of the work (that is not the actual lab research) occurs at the end of the semester when you have to write a 10-12 page research report.If you are using this to fulfill your senior requirement, then you also have to get a powerpoint presentation and present at the MCDB poster presentation, but overall there is not much outside work.",
    "Research for credit is a wonderful independent study course. It is a great way to gain research experience before the senior project. I do like that it is unstructured for most of the semester, with the exception of the final report, which allows for a truly independent project based on what the PI assigns. The quality of the experience depends on your Principle Investigator, postdocs, and whoever else you work with in the lab. My PI, Dr. Wajapeyee, was very interested in teaching; he'd give short, one-on-one lectures at the whiteboard, which most PI's do not do. I learned a lot of techniques as well as the theory behind them.",
    "Not much to say about this class since it really just depends on the lab you work in and your own PI, but you do have to pass in a proposal at the beginning of the semester and a paper by the last day of classes (which can be stressful if you have a lot of things the last week of class so just be warned in advance)."
