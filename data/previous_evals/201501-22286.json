    "I really liked History of Japan; Prof. Botsman is a funny, succinct, and interesting lecturer and the courseload is not difficult (almost entirely based on one short essay, a midterm, and a final). As a history major, it has definitely been one of the most cohesive and well-taught classes I've taken.",
    "A very fun and low-stress survey of Bakumatsu and Meiji Japan, with an emphasis on understanding how Japan was able to transform itself in less than half a century from an largely agrarian nation into a world power. Professor Botsman is a great lecturer (his humor and Australian accent never get old) and the subject matter was completely new for me. There are two papers, both due before the midterm, and a midterm and final. A great class if you're looking for a survey of a period of history you probably don't know a ton about.",
    "Chill class, Botsman's a good lecturer, take it as a really cool fifth class to learn a lot about something that you probably know little about.",
    "I am not a history major, and the only reason I was searching history courses was because I needed a humanities credit. I accidentally stumbled upon the positive reviews of Professor Botsman's class and decided to give the class a try. I am so, so glad I did. I enjoyed going to every lecture, because Professor Botsman managed to make Japanese history (a subject I had never had any prior interest in) engaging. The class is definitely front-loaded, so be aware of that when you sign up, but after the midterm it's very easy in terms of work, which is nice when other classes are becoming heavier in workload. Seriously, take it. You will know a ton of random Japanese history that's fascinating in the context of WWI\/WWII.",
    "If you're interested in Japanese history, take this class! Botsman is a great lecturer, and there's not too much work--a short paper, a midterm, and a pretty easy final. It goes from around 1600 to the early 1900's, with most of the focus on the 1868 Meiji Restoration and the following few decades. Really cool material!",
    "As an East Asian Studies major interested primarily in history, this was the perfect outside-country credit. This course, although slow at times, greatly boosted my understanding of the region. Also, Botsman is a entertaining lecturer that will make you want to keep coming to class.",
    "Botsman is a thug. That's a compliment. Lecture was always a blast and Botsman unashamed lets fly a barrage of dad jokes that keep you awkwardly chuckling for most of lecture. He took a subject I found intriguing and made it one I found fascinating. My TA unfortunately could not teach my section for the last month of class, but Botsman subbed and despite his protests, everyone agreed he was a fantastic section leader. Take the class if its offered!",
    "This is a GREAT rest-of-world credit! You end up learning a lot about something you never really knew you cared about.",
    "Overall a great course. Professor Botsman is very eloquent and is easily followed during lecture. Lecture material is entertaining and Professor Botsman very skillfully transitions from one point to another. The lectures form a sort of narrative which unfolds like a story, which is great. Workload is fair but front heavy. Very strange topic for the historiography paper though. Exams were fair. A great class to take whether you're a history major or not! Took it for my humanities credit and loved it.",
    "I would definitely suggest this for any student. If you area history major and looking for a relatively easy rest of the world credit definitely take this. I think this is much better than most of the more well known lecture courses.",
    "Yes, I recommend this to anyone with a remote interest in history. Very straight-forward and engaging lectures. It might feel like a rush at times to take notes on everything Professor Botsman says, but it is not boring so it is easy to keep up. The assignments were also pretty clear cut. I highly recommend taking this if you are actually going to attend the lectures as they were the most helpful in terms of studying for the exams.",
    "A wonderful course that traces the comparative rise of the East in relation to the West in modern times. Japanese history is so important and relevant to the region and should be understood in this time of American rebalancing towards the East.",
    "A great class to take. It's interesting and not too much work. The second essay is on a pretty esoteric book, and the readings can be quite long, but all in all a great class. Do recommend.",
    "100% take it, such a good course and really interesting material",
    "A really interesting course on Japanese history that gives important background for understanding Japan's part in world history in the 20th century. I would absolutely recommend this class.",
    "Absolutely take this class. You'll learn so much about some really cool stuff in a way that feels really natural. This is how a history class should be taught.",
    "This is a great course that will not destroy you with work and gives a fascinating perspective on one of the most understudied but important \"revolutions\" in modern history.",
    "A would recommend HIST 303 to anyone who is interested in how Japan gradually transformed from a samurai-hierarchical society to a more Western society. The workload is not high and the content is interesting throughout the term.",
    "Yes, I certainly would. It makes for a lovely and relatively easy rest-of-the-world History credit for Western-focused History majors.",
    "Take it! Not even as a way to fill a ROW credit (though those don't really exist anymore). Botsman is such a nice guy and all the TAs are really invested in the topic. The papers aren't the easiest things to do but the midterm\/final are very doable. Know what to expect. But great class, great background into a side of the world not many people know about but that everyone should know at least a bit about.",
    "Definitely would recommend. Super interesting class.",
    "An in depth survey of Japan in the feudalistic Tokugawa period and progressive Meiji period taught by a dynamic professor. I would highly recommend this class because of the interesting and highly applicable lectures, the awesome professor and TF team, and manageable and well spaced-out assignments.",
    "I'd definitely recommend the course to another student. If someone wants to break into Asian history, Japan's Modern Revolution would be the perfect class. It uses chronology to its advantage in explaining very methodically what is a vast and complex national transition.",
    "This is a great class. If you have any interest in Japan or in taking a history class, this is definitely one to take. Prof. Botsman is awesome and a great lecturer. 2 papers: 2 pages, and 5 pages, midterm, final, and section. The papers are due earlier in the semester which makes lightens the workload at the end of the semester. The readings and lectures are really interesting. I knew nothing about Japan or its history beforehand, but I learned a ton in this class. Definitely take it if you're a history major or if you just want to take a well-taught, well-organized class.",
    "This course is excellent! Professor Botsman is an amazing and funny person. All his lectures were interesting and easy going. It was a really good time taking this class.",
    "A great history lecture on a topic that most people do not often have a background in. Would highly recommend to anyone no matter major or interests!",
    "Great class! Lectures are really interesting and clear. Botsman is awesome and so kind.",
    "Japan's Modern Revolution is a history course that looks at Japan's transformation through the Tokugawa period and into the Meji period, looking at the Meiji Restoration of 1868 and whether or not it was any sort of revolution or just a change in Japan's perspective.",
    "A solid survey course on modern Japanese history (surrounding the Meiji Restoration). Be prepared for a lot of content-heavy lectures, though Professor Botsman makes them engaging as well as informative. Be sure to keep up with the names and the terms (if you don't speak Japanese) throughout the semester!",
    "This is a great, entertaining lecture class. Professor Botsman is funny and friendly, the lectures are fast-paced, and the readings are mostly brief but rich primary sources. Definitely recommend.",
    "Great class, I learned so much and became very interested in a region and time period that I never expected to care so much about.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS! I took it for a rest-of-the-world credit and fell in love. Not too hard but full of fascinating stories and solid historical evidence. Just all around great!",
    "Take it. Good fifth class. I'm not a History major and I have nothing to do with Japan, but Prof Botsman makes this class worth it."
