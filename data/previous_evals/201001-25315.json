   "comments": [
    "Absolutely, Professor Estrella certainly makes you think outside the box but it is amazing what you walk away with. It is certainly a uniquely taught and structured class, but very enjoyable!",
    "Lay back Spanish class, you will become more comfortable with poetry but don't expect to acquire a lot of concrete knowledge.",
    "Yes!",
    "Take this class if you need a fifth or sixth course. The workload is very light and the material we read is interesting. Be prepared to read poetry in a way you have never read it before. If you are looking to read poetry that can easily be explained and defined, then this is not the class for you. We read very difficult, abstract peices that could never be resolved or analyzed. This class was a nice change of pace, however, from my other Yale classes. It is a very relaxed atmosphere, with everyone talking about what they think is going on in the works we read (no one really every was sure what was going on, but that was ok) and Professor Estrella making jokes and talking about how there is no right way to read a poem.",
    "I think that everyone at Yale should take Spanish 306. Spanish 306 taught me a great deal of Spanish and linked Spanish to other fields of study (music, art, etc.). It was a great deal of fun and taught me great skills as a thinker and a student.",
    "Poetry classes with Estrella are always an adventure, but they are totally worth taking.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this class to another Spanish-speaking student. It's an easy class with minimal work, but isn't boring."
