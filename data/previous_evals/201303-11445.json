    "Yes I'd reccommend it if you want an introduction to the material .",
    "This is course will make you start noticing the ocean right around you in New England, and you will meet all sorts of characters along the way- it is really fun, but it is also an enormous amount of work, that piles up towards the end of the semester. The small labs are in fact big projects. Expect to write about 40 pages single spaced.",
    "Coastal Environments in a Changing World was one of the best classes that I have taken at Yale. I am so glad that I decided to step out of my comfort zone and take this SCience course! Mary Beth was always patient with us non-science majors and was very approachable in regards to outside class time help. Mary Beth allowed us to interrupt her mid-thought to ask questions which most times prompted a discussion of the students to try to answer the question. It was an amazing way to learn science! Much better and more interactive than most Yale science lectures where the professor speaks at you the entire time. I hope to take another course with her in the future, she makes science fun for the humanities students while not 'dumbing' it down for the science majors. I would definitely recommend any student to take this course! They would not be disappointed!!",
    "This is one of the most interdisciplinary and hands-on classes you'll get to take at Yale. I would definitely recommend the class to anyone who wants to understand coastal environments by spending time in them and who shares a deep interest for the ocean, because you will get to meet like-minded people.",
    "Take the class, tell your friends about it and enjoy the coastal environments and, especially, protect them!",
    "This was a really good class. It's definitely not aimed at science majors, but gives a good overview of the scientific process and several different fields associated with coastal processes."
