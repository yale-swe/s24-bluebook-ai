    "Although French L1 is a rigorous course and the time commitment required is definitely on the slightly heavier side, it is 100% effective if you do the work. The method of using a story to teach a language is a time tested one and definitely helps in remembering vocabulary and language structures. It is a completely immersive course where French is spoken from day 1 and English is used rarely. This may seem daunting at start, but definitely helps you get a better hang of the language. Although at times the course load got hard to keep up with, the instructors were kind enough to notice this and lower the pace to give us time to catch up. The vocabulary was also not too demanding if one paid attention to the weekly videos and the emphasis on certain vocabulary in class. The only complaint I had was that it required a lot of commitment during reading period and finals week, as we had a quiz, a skit and a final all in the span of one week.",
    "This course could be improved by focussing on what is relevant to a specific weeks exam, rather than deviating from the material in the workbook.",
    "I believe this class is not friendly towards true language beginners. The atmosphere is extremely stressful due to sheer course work load and weekly tests. The tests are not always a reflection of what was learned in the class that week. I believe an overhaul of the curriculum and tests would be necessary for me to recommend the french 110 to anyone that was a true beginner."

    "If you are looking to learn French, and I mean really learn it, this is definitely the way to do it. You have to be willing to keep up with the work and actually pay attention to the language, but if you do this will be super effective. All the instructors are really great and super helpful and will go out of their way to help you with any problems you come across!",
    "Yes, fun yet engaging.",
    "No. The pace is too fast for people that have never seen french before. The tests are not reflective of material covered in class. The atmosphere is stressful due to the amount of tests and material needed to be covered. I would not recommend Fren 110 if you had not taken 2+ years in highschool.",
