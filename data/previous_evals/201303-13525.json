    "Kristin Morico is amazing. She's brilliant and nice and brings you free dinner.",
    "It would have been better for a bit more structure - the instructor knows a lot but tends to jump around and be all over the places during the class.",
    "Each lecture of this course was basically like a Q&A with the professor about her professional experience and with an overarching theme (e.g. career development\/HR, communicating effectively, etc.). Lectures were not clearly organized or outlined; the setting was extremely informal. I think most students liked that this course provided free dinner and for many hearing about the professor's professional experience was probably interesting. The professor is very likeable and personable. However, I got very little out of this course that will aid my intellectual \/ professional development.",
    "Kris was an excellent and passionate lecturer. I very much enjoyed the course.",
    "Morrico is a wonderful instructor, very open and engaging.",
    "This was a very loosely structured class. Although it was interesting to hear about the professor's career path, there was no clear thread to each lecture. There was also little focus on either the theoretical background of the subject or practical skill acquisition."

    "The subject material became very vague, with a lack of depth. And it turned out it was a course on Environment, Health, and Safety perspectives, not Env. Leadership as a whole.",
    "See Q13",
    "The course may benefit from a bit more structure or specific goals.",
    "Much more content and substance.",
    "Pretty much everything. The course and the lectures need more structure, and learning objectives have tobe made more clear.",
    "It needs more focused topic for each class, clear objectives this course should achieve for students.",
    "I think this class's description was misleading and the curriculum should be re-worked. This was primarily focused on corporate sustainability, not general \"leadership\". I come from a background in environmental consulting and was familiar with many of the experiences Kris shared about workplace dynamics. I would like to see this class turned into something that is focused on building tangible skills such as interviewing, managing employees, and company analysis. Kris has all these abilities but most of class turned into a storytelling session that tended to wander and get off topic as we all chimed in on similar experiences. I would have liked to see it more structured as a long-term TSM class. Kris is a great resource for FES students and I would have like to walk away with more tangible skills to show for the class.",
    "Maybe a little more topical structure with each week's discussion.",
    "If this class is designed to be a practicum on environmental leadership and management, it would be useful to more clearly focus on specific skills or leadership techniques. For example, if week 1 is focused on communication, the professor could (1) provide a brief theoretical background (or assign readings with this background), (2) give examples of her own communication style and when it was worked\/not worked, and (3) provide a structured activity for students to apply\/practice communication techniques.",
    "Following a more structured syllabus would be helpful. Though class had a nice open discussion format.",
    "The class discussions could be a bit more structured and stay on topic a bit more. It would be nice to have more time to do the group project."
