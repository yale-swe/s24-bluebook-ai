    "Knowledge of the development of Western philosophy, important figures such as Descartes, Hume, and Kant, academic and philosophic writing skills, comparative analysis.",
    "Philosophy really develops your critical thinking skills and challenges you to ponder the unanswerable questions. I really love the unique arguments that stem from this course.",
    "I gained a much greater understanding of the progression of philosophy as it developed from the renaissance to the modern era, as well as an understanding of how the respective philosophers influence each other.",
    "Directed Studies Philosophy is an incredibly valuable courseparticularly second semester. The philosophers in the second semester course are unquestionably more difficult than first semester. However, when you make it to the end, you will have grasped an incredible understanding of western philosophy. At the end of this course, you wont understand all of the arguments or ideas. However, you will gain a confidence in attempting to understand these arguments, reconstruct, and evaluate them.",
    "An overview of philosophy from Descartes to Murdoch.",
    "I developed critical reading, careful analysis, and writing skills."

   "comments": [
    "The subject matter is admittedly difficult to understand, even more so when the workload of the other DS classes are considered. Students are expected to keep many thinkers with their distinct philosophies straight. The course does an excellent job putting the authors in conversation with one another.",
    "This course has a great structure. Beginning with Descartes, all of the philosophers were either responding or adding on to his philosophy.",
    "I personally was not a fan of the metaphysical discussions on the nature of existence and the like, and really enjoyed the moral philosophy, but that's honestly just personal preference. The course was very very strong in drilling concepts in, but perhaps could be geared a little more towards getting a better handle on how to read philosophers in general, since I still have a bit of trouble with that.",
    "The breadth and speed of this course is, for me, the biggest strength and weakness. The speed and breadth allows you to cover an amazing scope of ideas. I think that the scope of DS as a whole is one of its most valuable qualities. However, that speed doesnt come without its difficulties.",
    "I liked the involvement of discussions. Sometimes there was a lag in the class when no one would speak.",
    "Because the course covers so many works in such little time, the emails that are sent out before every seminar are extremely helpful. The emails include questions that are pretty broad but do direct our thoughts so that we know what important, foundational parts of the reading to look out for and understand."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course to other students based on interest in philosophy and history and willingness to put the necessary time into close reading.",
    "DS is such a great foundation for any student, so I would most definitely recommend it.",
    "This course was part of DS, and I would strongly recommend DS as a whole to any student who doesn't want to bury themselves in a lab for the rest of their lives. It was an incredible tour through the most prominent elements of the Western Canon, and really really helped impress just how interconnected everything is",
    "I would 100% recommend this course to another student. If you enjoyed first semester, the second semester course is more challenging and, due to that, more exciting and rewarding. This course is unique in its combination of breadth and intensity. Additionally, ending with Iris Murdoch, is a perfect ending to DS as a whole with her return to Plato. I would highly encourage anyone who enjoyed the first semester of DS, to continue on with the second one.",
    "Yes - Philosophy was the most enlightening, challenging, and exciting of the DS tracks for me and I am delighted to have taken it.",
    "Yes, the reading was challenging but rewarding and the discussion was free and enjoyable.",
    "I do! This course has really pushed my limits as a student and, in general, as a human inhabiting this world. It has taught me the questions asked over and over again throughout human history and the many approaches people have tackled them over time. It has taught me how to analyze different arguments and realize that there is no one answer that has absolute truth. In short, it has taught me to re-think thinking, to question and doubt, and to continually examine all the things I have accepted as true or false by habit\/custom."
