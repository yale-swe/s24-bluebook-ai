    "This course taught me all about bones! To be honest, I was never much of a bony anatomy kind of guy, and I still don't consider myself to be. However, this course really taught me how to be discerning when I look at bones, what features to look for to distinguish different taxa, and how to describe and identify those things. I was surprised by how much I enjoyed this class, given that it was mostly about bony anatomy, and I'm very happy with the skills I developed.",
    "I learned about mammals and what distinguishes different orders and families and unique mammalian traits.",
    "I learned a lot about mammal diversity and evolution, and got a lot of hands on experience with museum specimens.",
    "I got to learn more about the classifications of mammals and what makes them different\/similar from each other. I was able to recognize distinctions in physiology like teeth and body modifications.",
    "I learned how to taxonomically identify over 100 different families of mammals, looking at skins, skulls, and post cranial bone structures. I also learned about mammalian evolutionary radiation, the dietary habits, geographic range, social behavior, and phylogeny of different mammals as well.",
    "I learned how to look closely at animal skulls to identify them.",
    "I learned a ton about mammal classification and taxonomy as well as phylogenetic trees and the history of mammalian evolution and diversity",
    "Identification of mammals by osteological traits, some evolutionary concepts, limited distribution of mammal families",
    "I learned a great deal about the diversity and evolution of mammals, but more importantly, I learned the basics of osteology and how to identify animals by skull characteristics.",
    "Evolutionary origins of mammals, taxonomy, anatomical features of groups",
    "(1) I can now recognize many awesome mammals by their skulls! (2) I know cool traits for large groups of mammals :) (3) I have a better understanding of specific skeletal features that are useful for identification or give insight into organismal lifestyle."

   "comments": [
    "I liked this course a lot! My one critique is that I wish the we would have had the lectures before the labs for the second half of the course. I know it scheduling makes that difficult, but I really think that the switch meant that I got a lot less out of the labs the second half of the semester. So if there's any way at all to address that, even maybe squeezing two lectures into one class before that switch happens, it'd be lit.",
    "You really learn a lot about the mammals especially from a phylogenetic and anatomical sense. I wish we would learn more about their unique features and what makes them really cool.",
    "It is very comprehensive but also goes fast at times. This is unavoidable due to the nature of the class.",
    "Having the lab portion in the course is definitely helpful; we were able to see and touch specimens ourselves and pinpoint features we learned about in lecture. Though the lab manual could be useful sometimes, I found that it didn't really help me all that much. For one, it was outdated in certain areas, and secondly, it could be way too detailed about the species. I didn't really find myself needing it to study.",
    "Best part of this course is the lab section. Actually getting to see so many different mammal specimens is kind of a once-in-a-lifetime experience. I think that the class would be improved if more guidance was given in the lab portion of the course, especially in the first couple weeks and in the last half of the class when the lecture comes after the lab. By guidance, I mean more direct clues as to what are important features to look for in each family. I personally would also prefer less phylogenic discussion of the mammal families and more insight into animal behavior, like diet, predatory habits, life cycles, sociality, mating, etc.",
    "I prefer to have the lecture on Tuesday and lab on Thursday, so that there isn't a large time gap between the two.",
    "Lab was super fun and cool to see all the specimens. In lecture, I wish we spent more time focusing on behavior\/characteristics, rather than solely looking at taxonomy\/identification\/evolutionary history",
    "Strengths- working with specimens and identifying mammals through bony traits Weaknesses- no focus on behavioral traits, nothing on non-bony traits, no general overview of mammal evolutionary relationships, class ends with a lot of questions and no major takeaways. The lab quizzes are worth a good chunk of the grade but I found myself taking the lab quizzes and looking for arbitrary traits. If we were taught more actual features to look for, I would feel better coming out of this course.",
    "This was a really fun course with straightforward evaluations. The lab was exciting and incredibly revealing into what unifies and what differentiates mammals. I sort of wished there had been a bit more talk on the ecology of mammals, but I realized early on that this course is meant to be an overview of diversity (order by order), and an intro to skull identification (at the family level). Ecology and behavior is covered but pretty secondary.",
    "So much information crammed into each lecture, not sure how this could be fixed. Really helpful to have open lab hours the Monday before lab quizzes.",
    "I wouldn't change a thing about this course. Thank you Professor Sargis!"

    "I would HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend this course, for bio and non-bio majors alike. This course was super fun, super interesting, and super chill. There was a great dynamic, and the material was super interesting. However, it can feel a little rushed at times, but such is the nature of the beast with these organismal diversity courses.",
    "Yes, this is a great interactive course where you learn about mammals you may have never heard of and some cool features that mammals have and how their anatomy makes them the creatures we know of casually.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone interested in evolutionary biology -- I found the material super interesting, but it can also be hard if you don't have a background in the subject.",
    "This is a really cool class if you're interested in learning more about mammals and seeing\/touching museum specimens. The combination of lab plus lecture really helps in learning, and the workload is very manageable; there's no real homework, just to study for tests and quizzes.",
    "Do you religiously watch animal planet? Are you a big enough animal nerd that you bought those $30 animal backpacks on Amazon? Did you know what a Tapir looked like before you saw a picture of Donald Trump's face on a billboard? If you answered yes to any of the above, you should absolutely, positively, most-definitely, unquestionably do everything in your power to take this course. If you answered no, you should take it anyway.",
    "I would recommend this class if you are interested in mammals. The lab can sometimes be challenging, but the professor and the TA will help you.",
    "So much fun and such a unique experience to get to see all the amazing specimens that the Peabody has to offer. If you like animals, take this class",
    "Since this class is essentially restricted to EEB and ANTH majors, you might expect it to be like many of the other biological diversity courses. It is not. Since half the course is the lab, there is a large focus on osteology. If you don't like bones, don't take this course. If you prefer behavior and soft tissue features, don't take this course.",
    "This labs of this course are sick. You get to handle the skulls of nearly every family of mammal over the course of a semester, and learn to identify them. Occasionally there's a skin as well, which makes for some great snapchat stories. Lectures, the other half of the course, are decent but they really are just meant to set you up for the lab. Sargis is an awesome professor but if you're looking for a new perspective on mammal ecology and behavior this isn't really the way you're going to get it. It's more of an overview of mammal diversity mixed with an intro osteology course. Don't expect to get in if this course doesn't count for your major.",
    "This one credit class is split into lab and lecture with each meeting once a week for the normal class time of 75 minutes. I took it Credit D and really enjoyed it. There is sooooo much information presented for this class so taking it Credit D alleviated a lot of the stress of the course. Lab is really neat when you get to see cool skulls like rhino, whale, elephant. Rodent skulls are boring and tedious. The last two lab quizzes are skull identification to family and you get to bring in one sheet of notes double-sided to help you ID the skull. The lectures quiz and exam asks mostly about common features that unite families, habitats of groups, and some really specific fact recitation for one or two points like where was the first mammal fossil found etc.",
    "Fantastic course. You should be aware that this overview of mammals is taught with a focus on identification using skeletal features. Tuesdays we have a lab with skulls from different mammal families that you can take notes on or pictures of. Thursdays we have a lecture on corresponding mammal families, giving some evolutionary background, behavioral characteristics, and soft and physiological characteristics - but also often focusing on important skeletal features pertinent to identifying skulls in the lab. There are three lab quizzes based on identifying skeletal features and mammal families based on the skull, and then two lecture quizzes covering evolution, taxonomy, and characteristics grouping different families. This class was definitely enjoyable to me, as someone that thrives on hands-on learning."
