    "Learn riboswitches, prof. Breaker loves them. First half of the class is easier than second half. Second half is pure memorization. It helps to write all the mechanisms by hand repeatedly until you know them by heart.",
    "Very interesting material. First half is concept based, second half is reactions and mechanisms. Second half was definitely much more difficult, but the material was also extremely interesting, especially if you like reaction based chemistry.",
    "MCDB 300 covers a bunch of topics in biochemistry, all jammed into one semester. If you don't need biochem for a requirement, there is absolutely no need for you to take this class. It was great not having problem sets to turn in and no final (just 4 non-cumulative midterms), but the material was very fast-paced and conceptually difficult. Be prepared to memorize a ton of structures and reaction pathways, though it is pretty interesting to see how everything fits together in the end. That being said, if you can keep up with the reading, pay attention in lecture, and are willing to put in the time to study the whole weekend before the midterms, you should be fine.",
    "I would recommend this course simply for Breaker and Engelman's lectures which were as useful as they were entertaining, that being said prepare as far in advance as possible for the metabolic pathway exams which cover quite a bit.",
    "MCDB 300 started out wonderfully with Professor Breaker but became one of my least favorite classes of all time when Professor Clay took over. Professor Breaker was a clear and approachable professor. He spoke at the perfect pace, making lectures very easy to follow. He also did a great job of highlighting key points and then testing on those points, making his midterms very manageable. Professor Clay, on the other hand, spoke with her back to the class, mumbled, made frequent mistakes in her lectures, and was incredibly unresponsive to student feedback. Her midterms tested on nitty-gritty details that she did not cover in lecture and offered very little opportunity for partial credit. She failed to adequately communicate the \"big picture\" of the concepts that we were studying. I loved biochemistry with Professor Breaker, but I despised it with Professor Clay. I hope that she is never allowed to teach another course at Yale.",
    "Take it if you must.",
    "I would recommend the other Biochemistry class.This class was fairly painful and involved a lot of memorization and regurgitation. Students who took the other class seem to have fond memories of learning interesting applications and understanding main concepts as opposed to memorizing.",
    "Take this if you have to. If you don't have to then don't take it unless they change the course structure or at least get rid of Nicole Clay. Anyone who tries to claim that you learn in this course is lying. You don't learn much of anything that you couldn't look up in 5 minutes in a biochem textbook or on wikipedia. Instead you are supposed to become the repository of all of that knowledge for the test yourself and then reproduce it.",
    "The first two profs, Engelman and Breaker, are very fair. Their lectures are well taught, and the tests are decently written. Nicole Clay is another story. Think consecutive all-nighters before every one of her midterms (i.e. murders). Expect to feel like you're on a trivia show when you're taking her tests, and to be able to pull out structures of entire vitamins and constants physics majors don't even have to memorize out of the photographic memory she expects you to devote to memorizing every single compound on every single pathway on every single one of her lecture slides. Her expectations are inhuman. She also demarcated herself very clearly from the ranks of lowly students and TAs. She made it very clear that if we had questions, we were to ask the TAs and only the TAs (oh, and the professor as a side thought). Although, in reality, she was very speedy and thorough in her email responses, the tone she struck in class made her seem unreachable. She\u0092s also prone to starting class five minutes early and going over time so much the TAs have to stop her. The worst, though, is that every lecture\u0092s slides were chock-full of errors. She would confuse herself in the middle of talking, realize the reduction labeled on the slide was actually an oxidation, turn around and trail off talking to the board. And spend a good part of next lecture correcting last lecture\u0092s mistakes. Every lecture. At a school like this, you\u0092d expect better-quality instruction. Although, it is her first year teaching, so next year\u0092s instruction will improve.Nonetheless. The course material itself I enjoyed thoroughly, but that's because I loved orgo. The first half of the course is a lot of rote memorization of facts. The second is more rote memorization, but of pathways and structures, and uses a lot of organic chemistry. You should take Andy Phillips\u0092s orgo 2 class before biochem. Having finished orgo 2 the previous semester, it was fascinating to be able to see much of orgo (like SAM, the catalytic triad, transamination) used repeatedly in biochem. Take orgo 2, and you can by yourself come up with mechanisms behind all the metabolic pathways you learn in biochem. And then the laws of nature click into place and the world becomes much, much more beautiful.The field itself of biochem is approached in the wrong way. IMO learning should be about understanding concepts that stay with you forever (much like orgo 2 is taught here), rather than rote memorization of coenzymes and every step in the urea cycle and general facts you will forget as soon as you finish the last midterm. But, anyway.Don't bother buying the book. I didn't open it once.",
    "I would not recommend this course to another student unless they absolutely have to take it for their major or premed requirements. It was not enjoyable science. If you can, try to take the one semester (first semester) of mb and b biochem instead of mcdb biochem. It is probably much better taught.",
    "Take it only if you have to, and if you're taking it for knowledge, don't take it if Nicole Clay is teaching again. Breaker is fantastic, Engelman is pretty good too. Would recommend MB&B instead if Clay is still teaching.",
    "A good, useful class, you do learn a LOT. I was just unhappy with the inconsistency in teaching styles. DONT PUT OFF THE READING (though you dont have to read every single part of the textbook, focus on what is covered in the lectures)! you are only graded on 4 tests so do well on each and every one!",
    "You probably have to take it, so deal with it. It's an okay course - don't take it lightly! The second half (metabolism) is just as hard as orgo, so study!",
    "It's a difficult course, and I'm not really sure how much I got out of it, especially considering the amount of time put into it.If you don't need to take the course for a requirement, I wouldn't suggest it.",
    "take it if necessary for premed or major. stay on top of your stuff",
    "It is a difficult course with some good professors and TAs and some who are not so good. It is good if you are well aware of how much work you are getting yourself in to (a lot) in advance and are willing to take on the challenge. A lot of learning may have to be done on your own with some of the professors.",
    "If you are curious about learning, you should definately take it. It is not as boring and hard as many people think",
    "Unclear how this class will go next year. Breaker and Engelman are gems. Their exams are easy. This was Clay's first year teaching, so it was a bit rough. Exams were secretly fair (sort of like mechanisms for orgo) but totally different in style from the first two exams so everyone freaked out. Try to go to section. Do any psets given.",
    "Watch out if Clay is teaching this again- she was horrible this year!! Otherwise, biochem is really cool, but it's a lot of memorizing- try to stay on top of the material and not leave it all to the last minute!",
    "GREAT course! Then again, take this with a grain of salt as I also loved Orgo. It was similar to orgo except applicable to the human body, which made the material that much more fascinating. I also found it less demanding than Orgo. The lecturers were all great and the slides were very helpful if you attended lecture (I don't know how easy they are to understand if you aren't in lecture since I was never in that position). The four exams spread out throughout the semester I found was better than having a final, even though it required you to be studying every couple of weeks. This was one of my favorite courses I've taken at Yale so far and would definitely recommend it, as long as you're willing to put in some effort in the second half of the semester when you do have to memorize some information (though this depends on whether Prof. Clay restructures her exams, as the exams we took on the material did not require that you memorize metabolic pathways or anything really besides structures of coenzymes). Take it :DIf you're looking for a good TA, Andy Chen is pretty good at giving an overview of the material and Sarah Schreiner is great at responding to emails with helpful answers, so both were good TAs!",
    "No. But if you are MCDB, you obviously need to. The second half was bad as orgo.",
    "Do not take this course unless it is required for your major, you're pre-med or you're actually interested in this boring material (I am none of those things). I've heard the other biochem course in MB&B is better (though two semesters long). These professors are okay, and Professor Breaker in particular is really great and interested in helping his students, but it's not worth it. The course structure is nice though (only four in-class exams, no problem sets, no finals, etc) and it's GREAT if you're taking it CR\/D. But why would you do that?",
    "Yes if you have to but it really depends on who is teaching the second half of the course and how much time you can put into the class.The first half of the class was interesting and straightforward. The second half was a lot more challenging in that it was organic chemistry without electron pushing so it was memorizing a lot of mechanisms without solid background. The second half of the course was extremely difficult because there was just a lot of material to understand all at once.",
    "Take the MB&B version.",
    "Overall, MCDB 300 was an engaging course. The material itself is very interesting to me. The established course material is well organized; the 4 midterm exams were a better alternative to having a final cumulative exam. (But beware if you miss an exam! You have to take a cumulative 1 hour make up exam during finals week). However, there was a sudden transition in the quality of the lecturers, for the worst. Breaker is a wonderful lecturer and very approachable; he really enjoys the material he teaches, which is inspiring. I thoroughly enjoyed the first half of the course. The second half terrible: the worst of the 3 lecturers teaching metabolic pathways- the densest material. But hopefully Clay won't be teaching Biochem next year.It is still a good class overall, with a more forgiving curve than the MB&B Biochem.",
    "A good overview of Biochemistry. Rather interesting and worth it to do in one semester. From what I've heard, it doesn't seem like more work than the two semester class. 4 midterms, no final. The first half of the course with Engelman and Breaker was really good, Clay's tests were not really related and\/or fair, but it seemed like most of the rest of the teachers and TAs noticed this, so it may change for next year.",
    "Course was a very standard biology lecture up until the second half where Nicole Clay took over and did all of metabolism. Her lectures were awful. Her slides were bizarrely overcrowded, the presentations didn't seem to follow any kind of reasonably transparent structure, either within or between lectures, and as a result I learned and retained almost no metabolism. She did not give us a good idea of what was going to be on the tests, and most of us came out of her two exams totally bewildered. The class almost universally hated her lectures. I would recommend that she work on structuring her presentations in a more reasonable way.... say, by dedicating one or two lectures on TCA, and going through the entire loop step-by-step, introducing enzymes and structures along the way, emphasizing important points, interesting connections, etc. Her approach in general was to just kind of throw everything at you at once, and then pick and choose little details to talk about. It did not work in any sense of the word. I hope she improves.",
    "I was deciding between the MCDB and MB&B biochem classes, like a lot of bio majors. I chose this because it honestly seemed a little easier, and I liked the idea of getting a full intro to biochem in one semester. I can't comment on the MB&B class, but in this one I felt like I have a good grasp of what's going on, although possibly not in amazing depth.",
    "I mean, it's alright. I haven't taken the Mb&b one so I don't know how they compare. But this one doesn't have any problem sets so that was really awesome. It also had no final. So basically you just have to make sure you don't fall behind. Didn't like Nicole Clay much, but the other too are great. You learn amino acids and metabolism mostly, and it's all really interesting. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to know more about biochemistry in general, and I guess the lack of outside of class work makes me lean towards recommending it to someone choosing btw this and Mb&b biochem.",
    "It's a lot of information, but it was interesting. Beware of the metabolism units (2nd half of the semester). It is a lot of information and can be really easy to fall behind in!",
    "Only take it if you have to",
    "Biochem is not so bad at all! Breaker and Engelman are great, although Clay definitely takes getting used to. For premeds, it's really great review for the MCAT because it touches on some bio, chemistry, and orgo principles.",
    "A quick way to take Biochemistry. You learn a lot. But it is a lot of memorization.",
    "The first half of the course is probably what you signed up for when you thought about taking biochemistry. Ronald Breaker, Howard Hughes Medical Institute Investigator, discoverer of riboswitches and chair of Yale's MCDB department is, for lack of a better term, a 'G'. He explains things extremely well and cares very much so aboutinstructing undergraduates. He is definitely one of, if not the best, professors I have had at Yale.Then the course becomes a drunken skier on a slick black diamond ski slope; that is to say, it goes downhill fast. Ronald Breaker dubs Nicole Clay as an expert on metabolism. However, judging by the fact that we talked about riboswitches for two lectures, and he never once mentioned that he discovered them, his humility and kindness probably extended to his introduction of Nicole Clay because she was definitely, not even one of, but in fact, THE worst professor I have had at Yale. Take this comment from someone who did very well in this course and has taken a lot of science courses beforehand.Where to begin? Professor Clay's lectures focus on the very detailed and particular. She often confuses herself during lecture, and her problem sets are misleading because the problem sets are all 'big picture' questions, leaving one to wonder what might come up on the exam since the lectures were about the details. Secondly, as a first-time professor, she is extremely stubborn and close-minded to any suggestions or criticism. The TAs approached her many times about how unfair her exams were but even though all the TAs and students thought so, she was unwilling to change. To continue onward, she is downright disrespectful. Most professors carry themselves in the manner of a professor, but her wearing of a 'Navy' sweatshirt to a good portion of her lectures shows her lack of respect for her students and her profession. When she knew the class was going poorly, she thought it was because students weren't asking questions during class, so she made a snide comment about how everyone at Yale was in a cappella so we should have no problem raising our voices and speaking up. Lastly, professors are supposed to be open to receiving questions from students. She told the class she was open to doing so but then apparently told the TAs that she wouldn't respond to students' questions unless they had actually showedup to section.I'm usually the person who writes 'good class' in these evaluations, so this three paragraph essay should express my dissatisfaction with the course. Ronald 'the G' Breaker will put a smile on your face, but Nicole Clay will surely take your happiness away (hey, that rhymed!) . Have fun :)",
    "A tough bio class. But, better taught then the MB&B bio chem (I took it).",
    "Be aware of who is teaching this class. Engelman and Breaker were very good; Clay is new and still needs time to ripen. There's no final or required psets, so that's nice.",
    "Only take this course if you have to. Read the book before lecture and you will be fine. Do not wait until a few days to study for the midterms, you will not have enough time. Keep up with the material! This is not an easy class!",
    "MCDB 300 is a pretty standard class. You learn nucleic acids, amino acids, and metabolism. It is ALOT easier than orgo, so you have something to look forward to. Also, I would recommend this version of Biochem over the MBB version because this one was very straight forward in terms of memorization and for me that was really nice.",
    "Okay, so it wasn't that bad until we got to Nicole Clay, when things just went downhill. Her slides were often wrong, and the material on the exams did not correspond to the things emphasized in lecture.",
    "MCDB 300 is a great course!! I really enjoyed the material and it is not as memorization-based as everyone claims it is. If you take the time to make those little connections between concepts everything really begins to make sense. It was a great course to take along with Cell Bio as the first half of the classes overlapped a lot and I ended up with only a deeper understanding. The course has 4 exams, no final and is really well taught. There is section, but I didn't go due to a time conflict and didn't have any problems with the material. I was choosing between MCDB and MB&B but ended up taking this one due to scheduling conflicts and I am so glad I did.",
    "Take this class! I enjoyed it a lot, but it is a lot of material to understand. The class is competitive (very high averages). It's also helpful for the MCAT. Make sure you attend every class because a lot of material is covered in each lecture. The material is interesting you and you really take away a lot from the class. Despite the difficulty, I truly enjoyed learning the material and this is one of my favorite classes.",
    "The first half was decent, although pretty much stuff you already knew (except for memorizing some structures, which is valuable information). The second half was the single worst classroom experience I've had at Yale (and I'm a second semester senior). Professor Clay's lectures were full of mistakes on the slides and were extremely disorganized, making information basically impossible to follow; studying for the tests was an exercise in frustration, because half the information was either incorrect or presented in a way that made it entirely inaccessible. In addition, the third exam (the first on Professor Clay's portion) focused on truly random minutiae and not at all on the things that should have been really important. Though the subject of biochemistry is fascinating, I felt that my enthusiasm for it was greatly dampened by its presentation in this class, and I think I learned a lot less than I would have had the organization of the material not been so poor.",
    "There were two halves of this course. The first half we learned biochemical concepts, and the second half we memorized the citric acid cycle and other biological processes.The first half was okay enough, but I wish we had written material which better corresponded to what we covered in lecture. Like one exam question's answer was passed over in lecture quickly, not clear in the book, and the internet had no clear stance or explanation :\/The second half (Clay) I had trouble following the lecture. There were always so many new terms and I couldn't keep them straight in my head. It would have been so much better had I been exposed to the terms in any (or many!) ways before lecture. At the end of the previous lecture, or as an assigned homework\/warning. I also might've learned more if we were tested more often, since there was soo much to absorb in such little time. Weekly quizzes like Cell Bio might've helped motivate me to memorize better? Overall I think Clay could be great if she were more in tune with what students do and don't understand. She clearly put a lot of time into her slides, but they so often didn't successfully convey what she was trying to convey :\/The exams (second half) should have covered more of what we studied. Multiple choice questions like in Physio might have been appropriate. With the current random subset, hours and hours of studying are done in vain because so little of the course was tested :\/ (the final exam was more representative than the second-to-last one, but still could only test so much in its current format)",
    "Don't take this class if Nicole Clay is still teaching it. She will literally make your life miserable. Also know that you are really setting yourself up for some really rushed biochemistry (particularly metabolism) if you choose to take this version of biochem.",
    "The MCDB biochemistry course is probably more reasonable than the full-year MB&B course in terms of level of difficulty and information you need to know. However, it is very accelerated and not all the professors are as good as the MB&B professors. Professor Breaker (the head professor) is a great lecturer, and Engelman is fine as well. However, this was Professor Clay's first year teaching, and I could not imagine a more dramatic (literally) conflict between her, the TA's and the students. Her slides are very detailed, but no one knew how she would test the material, and her answers for the first exam were also wrong. Even the TA's had to step in and discuss the exam with her. The plus about this class is that it is great practice for the MCAT. There's also no final exam (for better or for worse), just four midterms.",
    "This course was like night and day. The first halfof the semester was great. The material was quite interesting, the lectures were accessible, and the tests were hard but fair. Ron Breaker was a solid teacher who was clearly engaged and excited to teach the material. The second half of the semester, however, was miserable. Nicole Clay was the worst instructor I have had at Yale. She was simply terrible in every respect: she was exceedingly unclear in lectures, her powerpoint slides were riddled with mistakes and even less clear, and she was condescending and not easy to talk to. She made it endlessly clear that she did not enjoy teaching the class, and even said on her last lecture that \"I'm sure glad this course is over.\" In her tests, she put no emphasis on understanding concepts or even the biological context of cellular reactions. I did fine on her tests, so I am not complaining, but looking back, I learned virtually nothing in the last half of the semester with her as a teacher. Almost every student and TA agreed that Nicole was hard to work with and that her tests were unfair, to the point that during sections we could only laugh and imagine what Nicole might have meant by a certain slide or a certain test question. My recommendation is to take this class only if Nicole Clay is not teaching it again. If she is, stay far away and maybe wait until next year when she is prevented from teaching this course ever again.",
    "Meh, didn't particularly enjoy the class. 9:25 up sci hill was pretty brutal.",
    "Not unless you need to."
