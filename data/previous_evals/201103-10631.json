    "Yes, This course exposes you to a wide variety of topics and also helps to develop critical writing skills",

    "Although I don't feel I gained a huge depth of knowledge in any topic from this class, I do feel I was exposed to a broad range of techniques and approaches to neuroscience that have influenced the way I think about designing experiments.",
    "Most helpful course I have ever taken in deepening knowledge of neuroscience research. The skills I learned to constantly question findings and assumptions were invaluable.I wish this course were preceded by an introductory course to neuroscience, however, so I could be more prepared to take on reading those often dense science papers"
