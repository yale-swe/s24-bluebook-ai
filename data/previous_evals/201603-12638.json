    "I had taken macro and micro but I learned the introductory components of these courses in greater depth before and used calculus to solve equations.",
    "I acquired an important knowledge of microeconomics in one semester. I have now a better understanding of how things work economically speaking.",
    "I feel that I developed a much greater degree of economic intuition, in addition to some of the basic microeconomic quantitative skills.",
    "A basic but solid understanding of microeconomic principles. It has definitely prepared me for macro or another econ course next semester.",
    "Basic understanding of microeconomics and applications to government policies such as taxes and subsidies",
    "While econ has never been my forte, I found this course o be appropriately applicable to policymaking and data analysis.",
    "I did learn quite a lot of things in this course and am glad that I was able to understand issues from a unique \"economic\" perspective. The graphs that I was able to construct and the analytical and strategic skills that I developed will certainly help me going forward.",
    "We learned basic microeconomic theories: market equilibrium, behaviors of consumer & producer, monopoly & duopoly, Nash equilibrium, risk function & insurance, and externalities.",
    "Calculus Understanding of supply and demand basics Quant analysis of healthcare Ability to analyse monopolies and how they operate",
    "Basic microeconomics skills.",
    "Where can I begin? I came into this class not knowing any economics-and I came out with a solid understanding of how markets work, how taxes can impact demand and availability of products, etc. It gave me the tools I need to work in a policy setting."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "It goes without saying that students have a very varied amount of knowledge on this topic coming in.",
    "The course is strong in how it ties in real-world examples into theoretical concepts. The weakness is some of the explanations to go over concepts were unclear, while others were strong.",
    "Strengths: very good course, very good pedagogy, the content was very interesting No weaknesses",
    "It was difficult for Jim and Zach to handle the differences in skills level of the course and I think the course material suffered because of this. Basically it was never challenging for me yet I also could not allow myself to be challenged.",
    "I really appreciated how both Zach and Jim invited all of us as a class into their homes for dinner and a chance to develop a closer learning relationship. I felt that the examinations were fair and thorough.",
    "I could have used a few more opportunities to practice the material, including practice problems. I also enjoyed the real-world case studies and would have liked a couple more of those.",
    "I felt that printed course notes could have been provided so that we could make use of lessons to take down additional notes instead of having to rush to write down the entire lesson content. Although the textbook was useful, there was a lot of additional information which were not covered in class, hence it was difficult to sieve out the learning points which were essential for the course.",
    "Strengths: I loved many of the economic concepts that I learnt and am glad that I can now utilize these concepts in my daily life to get a more in-depth comprehension of issues around me. I do agree that these are essential for everyone wishing to enter the field of global affairs and public policy. Weaknesses: Let me start with a quote from Albert Einstein --\"Everybody is a Genius. But If You Judge a Fish by Its Ability to Climb a Tree, It Will Live Its Whole Life Believing that It is Stupid\". This quote applies to this course in more ways than one. My greatest complaint with economics tutelage in general is the tyrannical insistence on viewing powerful substantive concepts\/ideas through a rigid \"economic\" lens and, subsequently, imposing this perspective on others who might not be comfortable in understanding concepts from such a lens. While the concepts are definitely interesting, the over-reliance on numerous models based on often far-reaching assumptions threatens to delineate a generally \"narrow\" perspective to the view of such concepts which, frankly, is discomforting, ludicrous and even impractical. This approach also tends to be dismissive of other perspectives and, as a consequence, casts unfair judgement (through grades) on the potential of many students with other unique perspectives on such concepts. While I had initially hoped that this class would be taught taking into consideration the aforementioned viewpoint(s), I was very disappointed that this course only served to corroborate the aforementioned viewpoint, thanks in particular to the 2nd professor. This class tends to reward students who are already good at a perspective that the class initially intended to develop throughout the semester, but horribly punishes other students who did not share the aforementioned perspective, even if they tried really hard throughout the semester to develop thou perspective. I also disliked the way this purportedly 'graduate-level' public policy oriented course was taught in a predominantly undergraduate manner. Equally disappointing was the way students were assessed. Instead of relying primarily on exams and problem sets to assess student proficiency of economic concepts - a very undergraduate way of teaching - it would have been far more pragmatic if their was only one exam and a final policy paper where we could have applied our economic concepts to a real-world issue. In an actual public policy\/global affairs environment, it is extremely unrealistic and unlikely to have economic proficiency assessed through a timed test. This is where this econ class should learn from our stats class taught by Lloyd. While I was not good at statistics to begin with, thanks to \"the way\" Lloyd taught the class and assessed student performance, my statistical proficiency and confidence in the field improved dramatically throughout the semester. This is precisely what a course should accomplish and is a sign of good professorship - to not just reward those who are already good at something but to also improve those who weren't good at the subject to begin with. This econ class, as mentioned before, failed to accomplish this and only served to consistently damage my confidence in comprehending economics. It will be really hard for me to take further economics courses going forward thanks to this course. This is just the tip of the iceberg in terms of the numerous complaints I have had of this class, but I will stop now as there is a character limit. I really hope that Jackson takes some serious overarching measures to modify \"the way\" students are taught and assessed in this class. I also hope that, going forward, the 2nd professor dramatically changes the way he teaches this class in order to prevent upsetting future students.",
    "Strength: The professors showed us a broad picture of microeconomics efficiently. Weakness: Some of the questions in the exams and problem sets were strange. I wasn't convinced even after the TA told me the answers.",
    "This was a very good intro to micro course and it handled all the basic concepts well but I think it could have been organized a bit better. Also, I don't think there was enough practice exercises during class. There were many times in which many students struggled with how exactly to do the homework because practice problems were only done once (or not at all) during class.",
    "The course covers a lot of material, but I think it is all very rushed. I understand that there are different levels of economics students in the classroom, but I struggled a bit to keep up.",
    "The course did a really good job explaining basic microeconomics principles in a non-mathematical way. However, it would have benefited from more application to policy problems and case studies.",
    "I think it tried to cater to all levels of econ students and in the end did an average job of getting across all the concepts. A better format for this course could be more policy level analysis, for example discussion on the Affordable Care Act, and how it ties to the concepts that we learnt already. I think if we covered, at least four different relevant and current policy issues across the whole semester, and tied them to economic concepts it would have been very good.",
    "This course was very strong! I'd say that the parts about the ACA may not be relevant this time next year, however. It'd be nice if in the second half of the course we could have a class on the economics of the environment and climate change."
