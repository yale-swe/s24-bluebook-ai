    "This class will be accessible to you if you did very well in AP Virgil or if you are a returning Classics student. The pace of the curriculum is quite brisk, so be prepared to be translating ~150 lines of poetry per session by the end of the semester. If your grasp of Latin grammar is not concrete, you'll have difficulty on the quizzes and I would recommend that you take the bridge class first. On the other hand, this class is immensely rewarding - it's great to read the latter parts of the Aeneid in the original, because Virgil breaks out the Iliadic imagery and scope in a way that is truly underappreciated. The midterms are manageable and the papers are straightforward. Just make sure you have the time to commit to translation, because you'll be expected to reproduce it verbatim (as well as parse any word therein) on the quizzes.",
    "It's a great class -- reading the last four books of the Aeneid. It's a lot of translating, but I found that my reading speed almost tripled through the course of the semester. Prof. Peirano is fantastic -- she can be intimidating at first, but really, she is one of the brightest, most incisive professors I've had, especially when it comes to moderating class discussion or talking about paper ideas. The tests are fair; she is very picky when it comes to quizzes, and she has a high but reasonable standard for papers. Just don't slack off, and you'll enjoy it a lot.",
    "I would recommend this class to a student who is comfortable reading lots of Latin, of who is willing to dedicate most of their time to this class for the semester if their reading skills are a bit below what the course requires."
