   "comments": [
    "This class is basically watching films (mainly gangster, spy, film noir, and a little bit superhero) and then talking about them. There is nothing wrong with the actual material--you'll see lots of films worth seeing--but the instructor never seems to really teach, and will spend considerable time talking about famous people he's met or movies (that were not assigned for homework) that he thinks are good. If you do all of the assignments, the workload will be quite heavy--two or three movies along with a few clips and the occasional article or book version of a film. The two or three primary movies are the real focus every week, though. I would not recommend this course though--you can do the best part (watching the movies) on your own, and skip over uneffectiveness of the instructor.",
    "This class was a breath of fresh air away from the typical areas that I'd studied in school and college thus far. Aside from getting a chance to go through great films and pieces of literature for class, the best thing about the class is that it made me think about why I loved or hated the characters I did in these pieces and see how certain characters fit into various hero\/villain archetypes, while others carved out their own archtypes. I will say that it's rather hefty in terms of work-load, but after the first few classes one should be able to figure out the rhythm of things because it's nowhere near impossible to navigate. At the end of the day, I'd definitely recommend it to everyone whether films are your bread and butter or you just like watching them every now and then.",
    "Absolutely take this class!!! It is a really fun course where your work is literally to watch movies. The Professor is truly wonderful, and you will come away learning a lot, regardless of your background. Very light workload as well, 3 short papers and you get a WR credit",
    "A collection of films and texts are viewed and read before each class, and these works are discussed each week.",
    "Heroes and Villains in American Film and Literature was an extremely interesting and informative class. The films and readings were well selected and provided really interesting discussion for the discussions each week. The essays were varied and interesting. Eddy is a phenomenal teacher, extremely encouraging, insightful, and fun! I learned so much about analyzing genres of film and literature and understanding context. If you get a chance, definitely take the class!"
