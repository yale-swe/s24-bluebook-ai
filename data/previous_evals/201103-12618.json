    "I would definitely recommend this class. Lots of cool reading, excellent experience, looked forward to it every week. Take it if you can get in",
    "It's an awesome class if you can get in. It's a lot of fun, just make sure you're there on time and do all your work. The work flies by because it's all very fun to do.",
    "I would recommend it only because it's the only screenwriting course at Yale. Unfortunately I did not come out with a knowledge of screenwriting that I would have liked to.",
    "It will change how you understand films, for the better. You learn good principles, get to produce an edited and workshopped piece which I'm sure I'll look back on later as a nice momento from college.",
    "A great introduction to screenwriting - you cover all of the basics, like format and stuff. If you don't really have a knack for plot or structure than this class won't help you. There are some really good screenwriting books out there for help with story; but this class mainly focuses on format, and making sure your grammar is correct. A vital first step, however, if you are interested in writing screenplays. Don't want to overlook any of this stuff.",
    "You read scripts, write coverage (REALLY important if you want to go into production or work at an agency in Hollywood), and really think hard about a very short story.You write a 12-page story that has to have a full arc and its a pretty awesome exercise to plan, write, and revise. Lapadula puts you in a group to meet with -if you really want to get something out of this class MEET WITH THEM!",
    "Great intro course with an engaging professor. Appropriate for breaking into screenwriting if you have even the slightest interest. Take it if you can get in.",
    "Take this class if you can and want to learn more about creating and presenting a story."
