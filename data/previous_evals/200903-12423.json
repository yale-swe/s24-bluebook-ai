   "comments": [
    "This is a good way to get a science credit if you're lucky enough to get in. The in-class discussion always seemed interesting, and Lori was really cognoscente of the whole non-science approach. With this in mind, I do believe the course got noticeably harder towards the end because the scientific concepts became more complicated. Overall, I would recommend this course.",
    "This is incredible. If you can possibly get in, TAKE IT. None of the other science-for-nonmajor courses are nearly as interesting or accessible, particularly since this is taught in a seminar format. There are lectures, but they're structured so that you can ask questions and actually understand the material instead of uploading whatever you can.The work is actually at a knowledge-appropriate level for a non-science major. If you are a science major, this class is not the right one for you. You will learn how to handle a crime site, how to perform immunoassays and sample materials. You may even get to identify a criminal through DNA analysis from samples that you manipulate in the lab!Dr. Boulanger is brilliant and an extremely dedicated teacher who has an excellent rapport with her students. Take the course. You won't regret it.",
    "Yes...better than CSI",
    "This is a good course for students who want to take a science course in which they can learn a lot but yet the class is not science intensive. The scientific principles and techniques explored are accessible to a non-science major. The topics are interesting and introduces you to issues in forensic science that you have likely never thought about.",
    "If your looking for a science credit and you're a humanities or social science person, this is a great way to get it. The class is wholly conceptual, and the most difficult part is definitely the DNA section - which is manageable, especially if you've ever had basic high school biology. Lori can be a bit disorganized, but she's extremely nice, flexible, and fair.",
    "Good science course, Professor Boulanger is very accessible and willing to meet with any student who feels he or she is behind until he or she is caught up.",
    "Absolutely-absolutely-ABSOLUTELY take this class! You should really make an effort to get in--so try to write really compelling\/interesting\/unique answers to the survey used to decide the chosen few--because it is the PERFECT science class for the non-science student. The workload is 100% manageable, it only meets twice a week (as opposed to Natural Disasters, an inferior science-for-non-science-students class), and the subject is actually interesting and relevant.Workload: a weekly problem set (usually consisting of about five questions with one-paragraph answers; it only takes about an hour to do, because Lori posts the Power Point lectures onto Classes*v2, which makes things easier), occasional discussion questions (the answers to which are just graded for effort\/completion), a lab report (it's basically a slightly harder problem set; it's a basic DNA thing, not super-scientific), and a five-page paper near the end of the semester (watch an episode of Bones or CSI for forensic factuality; it doesn't take long).Tests: two mid-terms (mostly consisting of short-answer questions; you get a very helpful study guide before each test, so if you study that then it's easy) and a final (same format as the mid-term, also preceded by a very helpful study guide).Professor: Lori is the nicest, coolest, smartest, and overall best professor at Yale. Seriously. You will love her.*** If you're a non-science student, looking to take an easy\/interesting science class to satisfy the distribution requirement, try to take Forensics before you go for anything else. It beats Natural Disasters or Intro to Biological Anthropology by a long shot.",
    "Best possible class you could take! If you're a non-science major with any reason for being interested in forensics science, get in and TAKE IT! Lori is great, the material is totally interesting... this semester was more work than last eval's seemed to suggest (they said it was no work), but it was still doable and a lot of fun. A few problem sets (the easy ones are no biggie, do the harder ones with a friend), two midterms, a paper and a final, but all fun (the paper is about watching CSI!). The textbook is huge and you don't really need to read it after the first couple of weeks.",
    "It's a great way to get a science credit, but worth taking even if you have already fulfilled your distributional requirements. I would definitely recommend it.",
    "This is a great class for anyone to take and even better if you are looking to fulfill a science requirement. Each class is based around a specific area of forensic science and real cases using that science. There is one lab for the class that makes you feel like an actor on the show CSI. The class also provides good knowledge to anyone that may have to do jury duty at some point in their life.",
    "A good survey of techniques in forensic science. Not a gut class but an interesting science credit for non-majors."
