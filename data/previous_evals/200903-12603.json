   "comments": [
    "Take it! The topic is something everyone should be aware of.",
    "I would recommend this course. It's not that hard, the material and readings are super interesting and it will add some interesting tidbits to your understanding of race and sex in the US.",
    "Course that has a lot of interesting readings. With a good combination of engage students the discussion is great but when people have off days\/don't read it is not fun at all because people can't really BS.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. Such an interesting and relevant topic with everything going on today, it was really great to learn the historical background to things like interracial marriage and gay marriage. The readings were excellent and super interesting, and I was exposed to a lot of new ideas and thoughts. The professor was great and very helpful.",
    "Race and Sexual Politics in the Modern U.S. was a great seminar on the history of the intersection of race, gender, and sexuality in 20th century American politics and culture. The readings were dynamic and our discussion were fascinating. In particular, the class did a good job of blending cultural studies with political analysis. Also, the members of the seminar brought different areas of interest to the course, which was very enlightening and made the class more exciting.",
    "This is a very challenging course but definitely worth it if you really want to delve in this subject.I would recommend it.",
    "Very interesting material. Typical American Studies\/WGSS focus on 'soft' issues i.e. individual experiences of race, gender, sexuality instead of 'hard' issues i.e. policy, legislation, etc. Gives you a great understanding of the immense relation between race, gender, and sexuality. Really a class not to be missed if you are an AMST, WGSS, HIST, AFAM major! No other class I have taken has given me quite an understanding of the importance of race, gender, and sexuality in the 20th century US.",
    "The subject material was really interesting, and is super important to anyone's understanding of American History I think. Professor Stewart-Winter is still kind of getting his teaching legs in terms of discussion leading, but he really improved throughout the semester and I'm sure he'll only be better when you take a class with him. So I would say if you are interested in what's being taught, this is a great way to get exposure to some cool\/important material that isn't really the focus of other classes here.",
    "take it--it's just a really great class.",
    "I definitely recommend this class. The reading list was phenomenal, and the discussions were great.",
    "This is an excellent class with a professor who is very invested in having a real class discussion about some very interesting readings. If it sounds like something you would be interested, it probably is. Very relaxed atmosphere, not a stressful class to come to each week--always an interesting discussion. The readings are not all that heavy--very well chosen to stimulate discussion.If shopping period is awkward, I would give some benefit of the doubt. It got much better the year I took it."
