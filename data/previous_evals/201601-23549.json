   "comments": [
    "Intro to Spanish, taken due to Yale's language requirement and not exactly due to a love of Spanish. It's not horrible, but it's also not great. That it is every single day is annoying but again not completely horrible. You will definitely learn Spanish so that is a plus.",
    "SPAN 110 01 is a great way to get the L1 credit. I took the class with Sebastin, who is an excellent instructor and keeps the class very engaged. There will be plenty of homework, and expect to spend about 1 hour everyday (assuming you are like me with no prior experience of Spanish whatsoever).",
    "It's an easy enough language but even in L1 expect other people have prior knowledge.",
    "Yes. It is a course where you can also understand the culture as well as the language.",
    "I recommend this class highly for anyone even the slightest bit interested in learning Spanish. The work was never overwhelming and my professor always made time to help me with the intricacies of the language. Take it with Profesor Sebastian Diaz if you can. He was a wonderful professor and mentor in learning the language.",
    "The course is challenging but not too difficult that you shouldn't take it. The work is very doable but you must stay on top of it to know what is going on in class.",
    "SPAN 110 01 is a great way to start learning Spanish. The professor is amicable and takes a keen interest in our progress. Be prepared for classes and homework every week day (especially if you are a grad student) but know that this will also ensure constant contact with and practice of the language, enhancing your learning. The syllabus, writing exercises and regular conversations in class will leave you with a good grasp of the language at the end of the semester and you will be able to have basic conversations on a range of topics. You will learn even more (and better) if you are able to put in extra time to practice and converse with friends or language tutors. I would definitely recommend this course and professor to anyone interested in learning the language."
