   "comments": [
    "good class. nice, informative, pleasing lectures, i enjoyed it. take it if you like any modern poets.",
    "A great course which provides a good introduction to the main modern poets. Lectures raise more questions than answers, and are therefore, conducive to further study and thought in sections and on papers. A must for any English major interested in poetry. Not too much reading since its all poetry, and two papers, a midterm, and a final make it not too much work.",
    "I took this class for an English major distributional requirement. If you don't need to take it, I probably wouldn't recommend it,",
    "If you like the subject matter, the class is lovely. Most of the poets are fantastic, and the poetry itself is a great insight into the spirit of the Modern era. There are a few duds, but they're worth mucking through for the greats (Yeats, Frost, Stevens, Eliot...)",
    "A well-paced survey that allows easy comparison because of the reasonable but limited time allotted to each poet. Professor Chambers lectures in a clear, plain style that is refreshing after other, jargon-using professors. She gives a unique approach to writing the essays (both comparative) that improves their quality, and writes very reasonable exams. Highly recommended.",
    "I would highly recommend this class. It was wonderful.",
    "Modern Poetry is a great course. Within a relatively narrow spectrum (the major poets and poetic movements in English between WWI and WWII), there is a wide array of poetry to explore. Keep in mind going into this course that it is, as the name suggests, a lot of modern poetry. If you, like me, like formalism, you might be itching for a good old sonnet with end-stopped rhymes and images whose basic meaning is stated explicitly by the end of the semester. Yet this is important work to study, and Professor Chambers presents it well. She grows on you as a lecturer; her style is slower and softer than other professors you may have encountered, but it suits the material of the course well. It's clear that she cares about the material deeply and, perhaps even more importantly, about her students as people.As for the work of the course: it's two papers, a midterm, and a final, plus section participation. The midterm and final can be a bit tricky, so make sure to study how to write short answers well in preparation for them. Professor Chambers does not try to trick you with the questions; it's more a question of knowing how to quickly craft an answer that will hit all of the necessary points.I would definitely recommend this course to anyone interested in poetry.",
    "Take it if you like this period of poetry. If you do you will definitely enjoy the course. If not it will get very tedious.",
    "Take. This. Class. The poetry is glorious, Chambers has a passion and knowledge of the material that's wonderful, and it's swell times.The exams are difficult, so watch out for that. Seriously. But otherwise, you should, you know, take this.",
    "A good, solid overview of this difficult genre of literature. I did not feel as if -- by the course -- I became a better, more confident interpreter of poetry; but the reading is good (especially at the beginning).",
    "It's a great class if you are interested in modern poetry, and a good intro if you don't know much about that time period in poetry. Professor Chambers gives interesting and accessible lectures.",
    "This course is a good introduction to modern poetry. The work load is relatively light and the material is interesting. I would recommend this course to another student.",
    "Solid lectures, but generally not inspiring or eye-opening. The best part for me was getting to mine poems for my own interpretations while writing papers and hearing multiple interpretations of poems during section. The work load is pretty light. All the poets we read are awesome, in my opinion, so if you like modern poetry, definitely a class worth taking.",
    "Yes, definitely. You read a lot of well-known poets and the lectures are well thought-out and easy to follow. Before this class, I could pretty easily say that Wallace Stevens, for example, writes pretty poetry. But now I can say a little more than that for each of the poets.",
    "Definitely take this class! One of the best I've taken at Yale. Professor Chambers is wonderful!"
