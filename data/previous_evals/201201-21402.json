    "This is a very good continuation of GMAN 110. By the end, you'll have a strong grasp of German. There's a lot of grammar, which can get repetitive, and the book can be a little confusing, but the department is excellent and the course can be a lot of fun.",
    "Solid class. Take it!",
    "Definitely take it!",
    "The class is great. Take it.",
    "I've always found this question sort of inapplicable to language courses. If you started with 110 and need to finish your requirement or want to learn the language, then yes, I would recommend it, but you don't need me to tell you that.Some things to consider, though: L2 is much more work than L1, at least in my experience. Whereas I rarely did homework in L1 for more than 30 min, expect regularly long assignments and higher expectations. The grammar covered in L2 also gets harder much more quickly. Lastly, consider _why_ you want to learn German; if it is for purposes of scholarship, I wouldn't necessarily recommend you not take the class, but do realize that you will be taught contemporary German, which is not necessarily the best preparation for reading the Poetry, Literature, Philosophy, and Science of Germany.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course! (It's required to get the credit for 110).",
    "It takes a daily contribution of about 3 hours to get a good grade. It was very challenging to me, so I recommend getting a language tutor if you haven't had much experience with German.",
    "Yes. I will recommend it, it is very intense and a lot of homework.",
    "German 120 01 is a great program that gives you the tools to have a solid approach to the german language. It has a systematic learning method that guarantees a successful learning process.I would definitely recommend it since I had a good experience and because I think is a unique change to get involve in a such intense program with classes every day."
