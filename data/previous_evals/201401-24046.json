This was not the fault of the instructor or the course design, simply that some speakers were better than others. For me, the best aspect of this course were the real and engaging dialogues amongst all us students and the visiting speakers. This happened 3 or 4 times.",
    "The overarching fact is that there is not another course like this at FES. There are courses about stakeholder engagement, courses in which you could choose to analyze a campaign, but no other course that takes as it's core directive the study and implementation of successful (and occasionally unsuccessful) campaigns. This is a speaker driven course, so the quality of the course fluctuates with the quality of its speakers. When the speakers are great, so is the course. The other major positive is Hank's willingness to receive and adjust to feedback.",

    "I would try to intentionally facilitate space for more organic conversation to take place. The \"assigned hotseat\" questioneers were good to get the ball rolling, but it felt overly structured sometimes and only a few people tended to dominate the conversation.",
    "Some of the speakers weren't great, or didn't speak to campaigns broadly, instead getting lost in the particulars of their own causes. I would say the course got off to a rocky start but improved over time.",
    "I wish the kinds of discussions we had around the presentations occurred earlier in the course. The last-minute canceling of some of the longer readings was also frustrating, after having budgeted time and money towards purchasing and reading them - communicating these cancellations earlier would have been appreciated.",
    "More guided reading on critical thinking about campaigns and strategy, not just the background readings on weekly topics from guests."
