   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this class for anyone interested in learning the history and structure of the modern political system. It is not a political science class nor is it current events class focused solely on President Obama. It is a comprehensive study of the office of the presidency and not necessarily the presidents themselves.",
    "A study of the presidency rather than individual presidents. Really fascinating ideas, particularly this notion of secular and political time. I would highly recommend this class. The workload is manageable, a fair amount of reading, a ten-page take home essay and a final exam.",
    "Yeah take it. If you don't like the TA's I wouldn't stick around.",
    "I wouldn't recommend it. There are far more interesting poli sci classes you could take.",
    "This is a very good class. I'm mystified as to why the numbers have dropped so much in recent years. Prof. Skowronek's view of the presidency is very interesting and will force you to reevaluate basic assumptions about the institution. The class gives something of a historical overview to the office as well, so if you're more of a history person than a poli sci person, there's that to look forward to.",
    "Take this course if you want to learn more about the presidency. Not a history class, but an exploration of the presidency. Very interesting.",
    "This class assigns a lot of reading. Fortunately, you don't necessarily have to do all of it. The grade consists of section participation, a midterm paper, and a final. You don't need to do any of the readings for the final (only study class notes), and you can get by on the midterm without doing much reading. Overall good class but not a guaranteed A. Probably a must-take for people interested in American politics.",
    "American Presidency covers both the historical and structural aspects of the executive branch of the government. Seen as a progression through history, the course shows the progress of the presidency and the effect it has had on our nation. Yes, I would recommend this class to another student. While challenging, I believe this class is a comprehensive look at the modern center of government.",
    "Generally an interesting class. Skowonek can get boring at times, but at least the reading is good, and you'll probably get a good TA. The final is pretty rough and the midterm can get tedious, but other than that, it's a solid schedule-filler.",
    "THe American Presidency is a class that anybody can take--no prior knowledge necessary--and one that opens up a new way of thinking about the presidency. I love politics and would recommend this class to anyone who may be interested.",
    "I would recommend it. I enjoyed lecture and learned a lot. The reading is a bit much and a bit dense, and it is important to stay on top of it.",
    "The workload isnt too bad except twice during the semester - grades are based only on your weekly section participation, a take-home midterm, and a final. Its important to read, but if you dont like going to class, DONT take Presidency. If Lucas is a TA again try to take his section because he's helpful and knows what he is talking about. Overall Presidency is a solid class and i learned a lot about the history behind the office.",
    "definitely would recommend.",
    "Skowronek is a good lecturer and this class doesn't have a lot of work. There is only a midterm paper and the final. Moderate amounts of reading but on interesting topics. If you're interested in Presidential theory take this course."
