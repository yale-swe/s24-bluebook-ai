   "comments": [
    "Great course for anyone interested in spatial analysis. A grad student seminar that introduces the topic, tools and theory without intensive homework.",
    "I would recommend the course for quantitative students who engage in R or other mathematical software programs and who are looking for statistical estimation techniques for ecology or health.",
    "Yes I will recommend this class to a fellow student, because it is a great way to get exposed to very useful set of tools.",
    "This is a survey course of methods relating to analysis and management of big ecology datasets. I would recommend this to someone already moderately tech-savvy who wanted to know more about the options out there and who would be able to take the brief introduction we get in this class and figure out how to apply it to their work.",
    "Every student interested in any field of ecology should take the course. The course exposes students into new emerging fields in spatial computations which is interactively instructed.The course exposes students to current skill sets required and applicable in the study ecology and related disciplines.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student who would be using spatial analysis as part of independent research. This class provides an introduction to many resources available for working with spatial data, so it is more appropriate for someone doing long-term research rather than someone with a general interest in the topic.",
    "I will definitely recommend students to take this class because it gives a sense of understanding metadata analysis and statistical inferences, which are important for their works during graduate program. It also introduces new free software such as GRASS, which can be easily manipulated within R by a simple command.",
    "Strongly recommend"

   "comments": [
    "Introduced me to the available tools so that I know the data sources and tools available to me for my own research.",
    "Spatial data, bayesian estimation techniques as taught by Petr, and use of cluster methods will be useful for my research.",
    "It was excellent, because it gave me ideas of the tools and approach i can use to enhance my research.",
    "It gave me a much broader sense of how people are dealing with \"Big Data,\" which is likely to be important for my dissertation and throughout my career.",
    "The course has exposed me to new opportunities and areas of research that would allow the exploration of fundamental questions.Knowledge in data analysis has also been expanded. I have new skills sets for handling complex data sets.",
    "I got to know how to use quantile regression and bayesian modeling schemes. As I am working on fitting regression models to build allometric equations based on field data that I have collected over the summer, this course has provided a well-understanding of different modeling technics in addition to glm, lm, and logistic regression that I previously knew.",
    "Contribute a million to the technical part of my dissertation."
