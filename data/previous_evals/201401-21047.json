    "It was a great course. I highly recommend it. I learned so much and despite being a science major, it was my favorite course at Yale so far. Although it is very literature heavy and there are a lot of novels to be read, the course load is definitely manageable and the lecture and section helps you to gain a better understanding Of the readings.",
    "When reading articles, short texts, or poems, their analysis may be broken up into the two days of lecture: the first day you talk about a poem and the second day you discuss the article and other short piece (depends on how many things you had to read). When watching films or reading novels, you spend the first day of lecture discussing their historical background (which helps you better understand the text) and the second day analyzing the piece itself. We had a reading response due each week for section, which was always doable. There was one 5-6 page essay, one 5-7 page essay, and the final paper of 8-10 pages. All also very manageable and very interesting and enjoyable to write! TAKE IT.",
    "YES YES a million times YES. Everything about it was awesome. Subject matter, manageable workload, people drawn to the class -- all fantastic. Take this!!!",
    "A nice intro to latino studies so it's worth taking as an elective when you have the time or are looking for something light but interesting.",
    "It's very hard to sum this class up in a few words, but basically, you'll learn the skills necessary to critically analyze literature, history, music, and much more with the lens of Latina\/o Studies. By the end of the semester, you'll be equipped to talk about the way Latina\/os have had an influence on this country in a way that goes WAY beyond what you have learned before. If this class is available again, TAKE IT. Don't even hesitate. It'll change your life. Especially if Laguna is teaching it, it will be an absolutely stimulating experience!",
    "Take it.",
    "Excellent class! Take it! Everyone at Yale should take an ER&M class like this one.",
    "Latino Studies is an extremely interesting class that makes you think about the ways Latinos are represented and stigmatized in today's society.",
    "AMST 284 is an introduction to Latino studies. I would recommend to fellow student if want to explore intersections of race, gender, sex, and class through literature.",
    "Definitely take this class!! This is the kind of education few people have received in public schools, but is so important to understanding the United States. Take it whether or not you are Latin@. Professor Laguna is incredible, very genuine, charismatic, and caring about each student. It was a pleasure to sit through his lectures. I would recommend the course especially to freshman or people who haven't taken an ER&M class before since it is quite introductory.",
    "A class that provides a general view of certain areas of Latino culture in the context of America and American history."
