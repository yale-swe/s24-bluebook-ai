    "A lot of reading about feminism and African Americans",
    "The course was interesting but to my mind ultimately somewhat unsatisfying. The discussion felt as if it should have been excellent: Professor Agnew always asked provocative questions that connected the books we were reading to the \"big picture\" and approached material from a variety of different angles. However, the result was that no coherent narrative resolved itself out of the material, and discussions felt aimless and ungrounded.Interesting stuff, if it's your thing, and not a bad course. Take it if you want to read the books, or if you want a lot of examples of ways it's possible to do cultural history, but don't take it just because you're interested in the course description.",
    "AMST 456 is a literature survey seminar focused on various American historical figures and trends within the modernizing American world between 1870-1930. I would recommend the course particularly to declared or prospective American Studies majors, because it provides an excellent for the said time period, establishes good expectations for the amount of in-depth analysis required in a once-a-week seminar course, and lends the opportunity to write a major research paper with Professor Agnew's knowledge of Yale resources for guidance.",
    "If you decide that you like the syllabus, take this class but make sure that you want to be talking about art for much of the semester. Similarly, Agnew might be better as a lecturer than as a seminar leader though he is extremely helpful when it comes to papers."
