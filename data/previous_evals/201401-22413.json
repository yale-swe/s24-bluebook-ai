    "I think all history students should be required to take this class.",

    "This class is a research seminar that has a workshop setting. I would recommend it for anyone doing research in the early American period.",
    "Yes!",
    "Any student interested in Early American History should take this course! Alejandra is an amazing scholar and teacher, and you would be foolish not to take advantage of the intellectual opportunities this course provides.",
    "I would describe this as a seminar where you are given the space and support to research and write a good, strong paper. I would definitely recommend it to another student."

   "comments": [
    "The feedback on my paper from other students and the prof were invaluable. It helped kickstart my research",
    "I've never done a research project on this scale. The professor provided just the right amount of scaffolding. It deepened my knowledge of the practical moves that professionals need to make.",
    "This class gave me an excellent grounding in crafting a research paper and discussing my work in a workshop setting.",
    "Very helpful -- I got a better sense of how best to research and write, and also had the opportunity to explore a potential dissertation topic.",
    "This course allowed me a semester of research and writing to begin brainstorming (what I hope will be) a future dissertation chapter.",
    "This was perhaps the greatest strength of the course--both learning about the nuts and bolts of the profession, as well as focusing on the craft of writing."
