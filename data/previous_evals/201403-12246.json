    "The senior thesis class is really fun! You get to spend time with Professor Lofton (the religious studies DUS) and all of the religious studies majors. But this class can also be a really good opportunity to do a ton of ground work for your thesis. If you spend as much time on it each week as you spend in other classes, you will get a lot out of the class meetings.",
    "Only in major obviously, but a lot of ownership and flexibility over your own work."
