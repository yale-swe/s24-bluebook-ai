    "Before coming into this course, I had no understanding of machine learning and the course did a good job of introducing the basics of neural networks, in addition to fundamentals of computer hardware such as accelerators. We also learned about bio-plausible networks such as Spiking neural networks and neuromorphic systems. I learned how to use pytorch, a machine learning software package by taking this course.",
    "Learned about a bunch of cool topics in neural networks and machine learning, including different learning algorithms and network architectures, novel hardware accelerators for NNs, and some cutting-edge stuff like spiking nets and liquid state machines.",
    "The architecture of the neural network",
    "The experience about Numpy, PyTorch etc."

   "comments": [
    "The structure of the class was great as we tried to cover both software and hardware concepts. In addition, the problem sets were really helpful in helping us understand the class material.",
    "This course really worked for me because the assignments were very fluid and there was a large emphasis placed on individual projects. I would say keep it that way, but I think such a loose course structure wouldn't work for most students.",
    "The problem sets were too easy, I think, and the next version of the course should probably make the final project required. This is only because of the pathological aspect of the way students (myself included) interact with courses, and the tendency to be less engaged when they aren't forced to struggle through the subject matter as a means to get a good mark in the course. Dr. Panda is the best though, and I really cant speak more highly of her, and to the extent I wasn't as engaged as I could have been, I am aware that it is a missed opportunity to learn from someone so knowledgeable \/ expert in the field.",
    "The courses need to provide more specific knowledge about the learning system and the hardware",
    "We went through the basics and frontiers of neural networks, AI, which is very helpful. I think it is better to have more assignments in the future, e.g. one assignment per week."

   "comments": [
    "I highly recommend the course to anyone who is eager to learn about machine learning even though you have no background. You will learn the necessary skills you need to apply machine learning in your own research.",
    "Absolutely. Prof. Panda is amazing and one of my favorite professors at Yale. She really cares about teaching students and invested a lot of time into working on a project with me this semester. The class is super interesting in its own right, but if you're at all interested in ML\/AI research then Prof. Panda is who you should talk to.",
    "Yes i would if they are interested in this subject matter. As far as I can tell there are not so many courses available that deal specifically with network learning and the development of hardware to enable efficient computation for these sort of architectures. So this course is a very good blend of the software and hardware aspects of this evolving discipline, and Dr. Panda is an expert and future leader in this field.",
    "Yes, it's a very practical guide of the neural network",
    "Yes, this course is very helpful."
