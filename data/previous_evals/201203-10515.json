   "comments": [
    "Requires organic and biology combined background or else it will be somewhat hard.",
    "This class has a lot of work which I felt was unnecessary. I did not see the point in a News and Views article or the specific aims. This class did a poor job of outlining exactly what should be included in each assignment and how it should be written, however I thought the course content was great. I liked having the opportunity to write a proposal and dive into great depth for a topic. I did not like how the second exam was cumulative and taken a month after lectures had stopped. I wish the exam had been moved up in the year rather than being pushed back so late.",
    "I would recommend this class. It was fast-paced and covered a lot of material, but it was worthwhile. I would suggest that any student with an interest in chemical biology should take the course.",
    "This course is a survey of chemical biology principles. The first half of the semester is a typical lecture-style course, and the second half is spent with students presenting their chemical biology proposals. The proposal assignment is excellent and enjoyable - it allows you to creatively investigate the field. The homework and exams are difficult and at times irrelevant and unrepresentative of the material covered in class. Overall, it is enjoyable class.",
    "Biology with a chemical slant.No if there was another better module with a more chemistry slant that would fulfill the subtopic requirements.",
    "I would not recommend that another student take this class unless they were absolutely required to. The reason is because this class requires a huge time commitment in the way of projects and assignments, yet the amount of useful information we learned was quite little. We did get exposed to some useful chem bio techniques, but in the time that you would otherwise be spending preparing for the class assignments, you could much more effectively teach yourself about chem bio by reading journals, etc.",
    "A good overview of basic methods in chemical biology. A lot of the information, however, is only superficially covered in lectures. A lot of reading necessary, especially with only little prior knowledge in biochemistry.",
    "Chemical biology was a course that provided a survey of fields and techniques that belong under the subject heading, and it did quite well at providing that survey. It was a valuable course for students currently engaging in research that nestles around chemical biology. I would recommend it, although if the same professors are going to teach, they need to nail down some guidelines or instructions for assignments.",
    "I would describe this course to another student by saying that it was a very good and brief introduction to many areas in chemical biology, including exposure to the kinds of techniques and ideas that chemical biologists use on a regular basis to conduct their research. I also thought it was a valuable way to hone our writing and presenting skills as well as coming up with an idea of our own to pursue. I would definitely recommend this class to other students who are interested in chemical biology.",
    "This course covers important topics and is worth taking for anyone interested in future research in the areas of chemistry or biology, or any combination of the two disciplines. Be prepared for a heavy load of assignments in addition to exams.",
    "Chemical Biology presents an overview of basic biochemistry followed by a more in-depth discussion of critical techniques employed in chemical biology research. If one has never been exposed to such material before, this class is worth taking; however, if one has taken similar previous courses it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not worth the time investment.",
    "Good for practicing how to propose a chemical biology project and do presentation.",
    "Chem521 is a solid class that covers many of the fundamentals of Chemical Biology. It enables the organic chemist to understand and appreciate most primary literature from the chemical biology field.",
    "it is a methods class for chemical biology, which makes it kinda borning. I would only recommend it if you were really really interested in chemical biology"

   "comments": [
    "A lot of techniques and ideas covered in the lectures are really interesting and broaden our outlooks. Also, the readings require prepare us for the coming PhD life. It will help a lot if one decides to stay with chemical biology related study.",
    "This course exposed me to new techniques that can be used in the field of chemical biology and I might be able to use them later in my research.",
    "It gave a great overview of the current state of the field. It gives students the background to read the literature in the field and understand the design and implications of the research. And most importantly, it gave us an exercise in writing a proposal.",
    "I did not have much knowledge of chemical biology. I enjoyed the course, and although I am not in the ChemBio program, I hope to use some of the techniques from the class in my thesis.",
    "It gave me an insight into the more biology aspects of chemistry. At this point, I'm not sure if my research will have anything related to it.",
    "Among the barrage of seemingly unrelated and irrelevant information covered in this class, I learned about some now techniques used in chemical biology. The research proposal was very time-consuming, but it was good practice.",
    "Very helpful, a lot of new knowledge. Writing a proposal was very helpful too.",
    "This course was very helpful to me as a first year graduate student.",
    "Had a good opportunity to think about how to make an unique project and how to do proposal."
