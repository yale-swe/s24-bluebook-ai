   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend it to another student. If you're reading this, it's most likely that you've already taken L1\/L2 at Yale so you already know how great the department and the teachers are. The material covered in L3 is a bit challenging, and I would say that it is a step up from the L1\/L2 sequence, but definitely manageable if you put in 1.5 - 2 hours a day. Also the Sura Sura textbook is so much better than JSL!As for the people, the senseis are all great, and since the sections are small, your fellow students really become your friends. I always looked forward to going to Japanese class.",
    "a great way to learn japanese, fun and fast paced, i would recommend it",
    "I would summarize 130 as a marathon of trying to keep in line with the course, where you're constantly being pushed far beyond your comfort zone in order to show you that you know more about the language than you originally thought.I would definitely recommend Japanese 130 to anyone because the teachers are amazing and they are capable of bringing the language to life in an immediate and intuitive way.",
    "It's a lot of work, but it's definitely doable. The professors are good, and the small class size is a plus.",
    "A lot of work but very rewarding. I like how they teach you flexibility. However I had trouble hearing the correct answers to questions in class.",
    "Yes"
