   "comments": [
    "I would recommend the course for students interested in an introduction to major works and concepts in new materialism, biopolitics and feminist science studies, but also to students working at any intersections between critical theory, gender and sexuality studies an materiality.",
    "This is a great course for those interested in STS, WGSS, and coming from a variety of disciplines. It is challenging but in the best way possible.",
    "Professor A-J is an amazing thinker, teacher, and guide in exploring new subject matter. In our seminar, she spoke infrequently, but listened carefully and interjected when the conversation needed redirecting, re-energizing, or another perspective that may challenge the assumptions of the conversation. I think she excels on all counts - being present, invested, challenging, giving useful feedback, and creating an overall fantastic class. Above all, I think she succeeded most in generating an in-class atmosphere and dynamic where we could explore freely, challenge each other, and discuss with rigor but without the competitiveness (jockeying for attention\/presence) or stress that can be present in high level seminars. (Re: the syllabus+work: The syllabus was very well crafted; the readings were usually paired thoughtfully and played off each other productively. The workload was heavy (at least for me as an undergrad), requiring a full book a week, sometimes with a difficult theoretical article as well, 5 750-word reading responses, guiding a class discussion for one of the week's readings accompanied by a reflection on the praxis of teaching those thinkers, a presentation, and a 5,000 word final, which was open-ended in structure but involved a number of progressive but challenging interim steps.) I cannot recommend this class or Prof A-J enough.",
    "Feminist Science and Technology Studies is a fascinating survey of a variety of scholars thinking through the entanglement of language, bodies, and objects. This course jumps across disciplines, time periods, and perspectives in a fluid and fruitful way, pairing the history of hormone endocrine disrupters with new materialist theory, for example, or a study of biological citizenship after chernobyl with an essay on \"necropolitics.\" Take this class if you are interested in: cancer, cyborgs, testosterone, office building design, the immune system, the racialization of lead, radiation mapping, materializations of multiple chemical sensitivity, etc. As the feminist adage goes, the personal is political - be prepared to bring your own life experiences and your academic histories to the table. The \"implosion\" projects at the end of the semester gives you a lot of freedom to investigate a topic of your own choosing in whatever way is most generative\/useful for you. Highly, highly recommended!!",
    "A fascinating, unique, and rewarding course unlike any that I have taken at Yale. Would definitely recommend for anyone interested in the intersections of politics, social studies, and science. The professor is brilliant and fills the syllabus with really interesting material, and classroom discussions are always very generative.",
    "WGSS 605 is a reading seminar for students interested in current issues in STS, relying heavily on the theoretical perspectives that have come out of feminist scholarship and the \"new materialism.\" I would highly recommend this class to graduate students interested in applying the methods of STS in their own work."

   "comments": [
    "Though indirectly, this course was extremely useful for thinking through my dissertation concepts. It was also very helpful in becoming more aquatinted with approaches, conversations and writing styles of WGSS.",
    "This course deepened my knowledge of STS and WGSS a lot. It was refreshing and generative reading and useful exercises on assignments. I will definitely use much of the material to continue thinking through my own work, and was able to connect much of it to my work as an anthropologist.",
    "It gave me a totally new set of conceptual tools and vocabulary with which to think about the macro and micro scale effects of environments on bodies while opening avenues to think about environments with bodies.",
    "This class was incredibly helpful for my thinking about the intersection of history of science\/medicine and literature, which I've been thinking about on my own without any formal or methodological guidance.",
    "This course deepened my knowledge of my discipline in important ways. It influenced the directions I hope to take in my dissertation."
