    "This course is amazing and unlike any other that is offered. It is truly a gem and I would recommend it to all. It provides a unique look into the effect of media on culture, specifically Indian.",
    "I would recommend the class to another student because it has a pretty light workload. I would caution however, that the class is not an easy A.",
    "ABSOLUTELY TAKE THIS CLASS!!! It's so much fun, whether or not you've any experience with South Asia or South Asian Studies. Very reasonable workload, as well as engaging readings and movies. And Professor Chanda is a GENIUS. She is a joy to work with and learn from."
