   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend it if you are interested in psychology and are good at simple biology\/need a fairly easy science credit. The material was sometimes difficult so you definitely need to go to lecture and study, but if you are willing to put the time in it's a very interesting and rewarding course. If you are good at biology, then the course wont be too difficult.",
    "If you have any interest in neuroscience or the way animal models contribute to the understanding of human disorders of the brain, definitely take this course.",
    "Yes. If you're really afraid of neuroscience, then this class might scare you off a bit but other than that it's pretty manageable. You get to learn about diseases and syndromes like Depression, Parkinsons, Alzheimers, etc and how they use rats and monkeys to try to find cures and whatnot. Also, the prof is SUPER HELPFUL. He wants people to learn everything and understand what's going on and will go very far out of his way to make sure that happens.Awesome class.",
    "Great for a science credit, but know that you will have to put in the work to do well. I came into this class knowing that I was interested in the material and wanted to take the course regardless of what grade I would end up getting. This is not a gut science course.",
    "I actually learned quite a bit in this class in terms of how animal models are designed and evaluated to fit mental disorders. There are two exams, one 10 page paper, and a cumulative final. The exams are pretty fair and the extensive notes provided for lecture slides are really helpful. This class is a nice way to get a science credit without getting to technical but not too general either.",
    "Yes! This class is fascinating, and a very reasonable amount of work. Anyone interested in how the brain works (or how it sometimes doesn't) would really enjoy this class. I did!",
    "In PSYC 147 we learnt about animal models (mostly rats) of clinical disorders including drug addiction, anxiety, depression, schizophrenia, Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease. The course doesn't really have a book; we used the Surgeon General's report and two chapters from Carlston's Physiology of Behavior. Some of the course material was interesting, other not so much. I wouldn't recommend it to students who are looking for an easy science credit. The beginning of the course focused a lot on neurons, neurotransmitters, neurotoxins, and action potentials. I have no background in science so the details of the chemical changes resulting from different diseases and their reversal from different medications was a bit difficult for me to keep up with. Professor Donegan puts all the slides online along with some notes which is helpful given that the course doesn't follow a textbook. The tests are rather technical so you really need to study for them. It's by no means an easy course so if you decide to take it make sure you keep up with all the readings and take good notes.",
    "This class familiarizes you with a lot of recent research on several mental illnesses (we covered substance addiction, anxiety disorders\/PTSD, depression, schizophrenia, ADHD, Parkinson's and Alzheimer's). You look at these illnesses through the lens of features that can be induced and\/or treated in animals (usually rats or monkeys) but also spend a lot of time talking about the implications for our understanding and treatment of these conditions in humans. Much of the research being done is really striking and fascinating - we talked about things like the possibility of vaccines for Alzheimer's or how stem cells can migrate and completely rebuild damaged brain circuits in Parkinsonian animals. I would recommend it because it gives you a view into new and promising lines of research that probably aren't in an intro Psych textbook.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to anyone who is interesting about learning about the neuronal mechanisms behind clinical disorders like Alzheimer's or even Depression. You definitely don't need a neuro background to understand the class because Professor Donegan is amazingly clear, everything makes sense! Definitely take this class, it is one of the best classes I've ever taken here!",
    "I would recommend this class if you are interested in taking a scientific approach to mental illness. Professor Donegan is very helpful and accessible.",
    "Yes, great intro to animal models, neuro, and pharmacology at once",
    "I would definitely recommend this course--but NOT because it's easy! You will learn a lot about many complex processes in the brain and it will be fascinating to learn, but you will study hard to do well in the course. Professor Donegan explains everything very well and is very helpful. Take it if you want to learn about brain mechanisms underlying many disorders from someone who knows his stuff backwards and forwards, but don't expect an easy science credit!",
    "Good science credit if you find the material interesting. Workload is manageable (1 pretest, 3 exams, and one paper). You'll learn some interesting and relevant stuff about what happens in the brain with certain drugs or disorders."
