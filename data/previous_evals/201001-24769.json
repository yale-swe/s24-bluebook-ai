   "comments": [
    "A class of looking at slides and\/or prints and analyzing them in stiflingly schematic ways. I went to class feeling that no one else had done the reading. The papers are not necessarily connected to what we study in class. I wouldn't really recommend it if you aren't already interested in the subject matter; it didn't change the way I see the paintings, really, even if it familiarized me with them.",
    "This is a wonderful class where you get great exposure to the works of romantic painters. It is more about painting than literature, but the discussions about the similarities and differences between the two are really wonderful.",
    "Yes. unequivocally. The papers are interesting, the discussions are interesting, Prof. Fry is hilarious and incredibly knowledgeable. Basically if you have any interest in British Romanticism or British art history this is definitely a seminar to consider.",
    "It is basic art history with little to no focus on poetry. Do not take unless you are interested in this period of art history and are an art history major.",
    "I would definitely recommend it-- a really fine Junior Seminar.",
    "Twenty kids in a room. One screen. Paintings. Paul Fry talking about each one. Take it if you want to impress Paul Fry. But first you have to know a thing or two about art.",
    "I would recommend the course to a fellow student with a genuine commitment to either Romantic Poetry or to landscape painting, and preferably both. People along for the ride of a 'Fry seminar' for its own sake might want to reconsider.",
    "I would probably recommend against taking this class. Not very much work, but very difficult to follow at times. You really have to have extensive knowledge of the painters and poets going in, in order for it to resonate with you at all. Prof. Fry does not spend a lot of time explaining concepts or people. I took this course as someone casually interested in the material, which I think was a mistake.",
    "An interesting, but often repetitive, seminar that feels more like a lecture. Take it if you're already really familiar with the subject.",
    "Unless you have a strong, strong independent interest in Romantic painting, I would not recommend this class. We just sort of flipped through slideshows of paintings. The most interesting part of the course was the description on the syllabus.",
    "Take this class if you have a background in Romantic Poetry \u0097 do not take it without knowledge of the era and the literature. also, you should have some background in Art Historical analyses as these compose part of all of the writing assignments \/ classes.A great class, though! It has been one of the highlights of a sometimes drab spring semester."
