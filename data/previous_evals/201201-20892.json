    "Yes.",
    "This course provides an introduction to key concepts in internationaleconomics (i.e. economic growth and development, trade, poverty&inequality, post-conflict economic development, and foreign aid) and substantiates them with issues and problems facing the current state of international economics. The course literature is designed so that it covers a wide array of international economic concerns from scholars who have different perspectives, opposing arguments and methods of solution at odds with one another. This encouraged me to be open to different ideas and solutions. Students will learn a great deal about relevant concepts that are vital when thinking about broader international relations beyond the field of economics. I wholeheartedly recommend this course not just for its academic contributions but because students will learn a great deal from their peers through informative and engaging class discussions.",
    "I recommend other students to take the class.",
    "I'd recommend the course to someone wanting to read the major literature in development economics. This is a great way to cover that material covered, and the weekly assignments aren't hard - they're helpful for reflecting and crystallizing your thoughts.",
    "very interesting class that encourages students to explore and critique conventional thinking on growth and development. Yes, I'd recommend the class because there are few econ classes that push students to read about concepts like these from a multitude of perspectives.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to other students.",
    "Yes, especially if the person had not studied international economic development before. The course provides a good survey of various theories of economic growth.",
    "I think it would be useful to someone who is interested in getting a broad though not too detailed understanding of the current debates in international economics and development while also learning how to do other things like gaining presenting and analysing skills in working with statistical data.",
    "I would not recommend this course.",
    "Econ 708 is an opportunity to get an overview of the contemporary thinking on developmental economics. I would recommend it to anyone with a basic understanding of economics.",
    "I would recommend the course because the workload was manageable and allows students to learn well outside the canon. Good instructor for this class."

    "Having taken this course, I now have a stronger understanding of international economics with which I can apply to different fields in international relations. This course also enhanced the way I approach questions facing international relations even though the issues may not be related to economics. Understanding how international economics functions and being able to logically and substantively think about key issues facing global economic situation has been beneficial to addressing a multitude of other questions and concerns pertaining to international affairs. The concepts I learned throughout the course have been extremely helpful for my research, but the data collection and analytical skills I acquired have been equally invaluable. I now have greater confidence in knowing where to find certain data and knowing what sorts of questions to ask when looking at data.",
    "I was able to deepen my understanding of international development, especially the role of aid donors. I am very satisfied with the class.",
    "It made me question the orthodoxy of development economics, and it helped me realize that there is no one agreed upon idea about how to achieve development.",
    "This was a somewhat \"development-centric\" course; since that was lacking from my experience and prior education, I thought this course was very useful.",
    "I plan to work in security, and this course will help me to at least be conversant with the development professionals with whom I will be required to work.",
    "The course deepened my knowledge in my discipline (IR) because I did not know the material well before taking the class. The course did not contribute towards my research because it was a substantially different topic."
