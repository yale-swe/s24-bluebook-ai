    "Definitely take it if you want to learn French.",
    "In one word: frustrating. Not sure if this due to the course design (weekly tests and a bizarre textbook), the difficulty of the language itself, or just a general feature of language classes at Yale.Unless you're certain that you want to take French, try another language instead -- this was an experiment for me, and it didn't turn out to be a fun one.",
    "A LOOOOT of work, but the payoff is clear.",
    "If you want to learn French (or even just need the language credits), it's worth it. You learn an incredible amount. Although there's a lot of tedious weekly work and a test every Monday night, it really isn't all that painful. I would recommend it.",
    "TAKE.",
    "120 is just a continuation of 110, so same deal in terms of weekly quizzes, evening tests, and compositions. You do learn a lot if you put in the effort, but it can be time-consuming. Take if you're sincerely interested in learning French."
