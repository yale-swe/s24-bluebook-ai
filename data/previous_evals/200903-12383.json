   "comments": [
    "Not too difficult, sometimes a little boring, but section can be fun.",
    "take it, it's easy and super interesting. Not much work required, but definitely gets you into deep topics.",
    "This class was a mix of a wide variety of topics in philosophy. We talked about a lot of interesting things, and covered most of the traditionally famous philosophers. If you really want to get deep into a particular type of philosophy, this class does not do that. However, if you want to be introduced to philosophy as a discipline, and learn how to think and write like a philosopher, this class is very good. I totally loved the lectures and discussion sections, and I looked forward to tuesdays and thursdays. Take this class and do your reading and you will learn a lot and think a lot about important things. I plan to take another philosophy class after taking this one.\\Also, the work load is very light, even if you do all the readings.",
    "Fun class, very interesting topics, great discussion. Three 5 page papers make the work load very manageable.",
    "You will learn to think philosophically and logically. The class will lead you through important life issues. Take it.",
    "Sure, if you have the space for it.",
    "Excellent course, not too much reading, papers aren't too bad, and great introduction to philosophy.",
    "Interesting class, with a small work load.",
    "This was very engaging and i loved going to class.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class. It's a great introduction to many different topics in philosophy and extremely interesting.",
    "I'd recommend it--very light course load and interesting subject material. For those who have never taken a philosophy class before, take it.",
    "Awesome course! Take it! I love philosophy!",
    "Yes! This was a wonderful introduction to philosophy, and as a result, I can't wait to take another philosophy class.",
    "Definately recommended for a intro course to philosophy.",
    "I would recommend this class because it isn't as much work as my other classes. Professor North is great.",
    "If you are serious about philosophy, the quality of discussions in this class will disappoint you. But if you look hard (i.e. do the readings and the thinking necessary to write papers) you will find some interesting nuggets of wisdom, and you will learn a bit about the major areas of philosophy. And you will do so with very little work involved (three 5-8 page papers and 15-20 pages of reading per week).",
    "Overall I would not recommend the class. I thought the material was boring and I had a great deal of diffculty motivating myself to go to class. If you are very interested in philosophy the class may be better, but for someone like myself who is just looking for an extra class I would look elsewhere.",
    "Harder than it needs to be. Don't expect to actually understand anything, except perhaps the three topics you write your papers on. \\",
    "Take it if you are interested in the material. If you think you may not be, shop the class before making a decision. It can be a long semester if you don't.",
    "Philosophy 110 is a good class if you want to find out if you are interested in philosophy. It appears to be a gut class. In terms of workload, it definitely is - only 3 papers the whole semester. However, the grading isn't that easy.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class, lecture is interesting as is the reading and it is not an overwhelming amount of work.",
    "It's exactly what the name says. Introduction to Philosophy and no more than that. In the papers, you're not expected to do anything more than summarize the papers you read and take a position. Very little work and most of the time fun. I would imagine that it would be even nicer if taken with a group of friends because the issues brought up are worth talking about outside of class.",
    "Take it if you want to learn about Philosophy, but beware: Most of the people who take this class are overly-hardcore freshmen that can wear down even the strongest wills quickly, even the professor's.",
    "I would recommend the course with a qualification: this is a course for people interested in an introduction to the practice of philosophy, not an introduction to different philosophies.",
    "I absolutely loved this class. The topics we discuss are extremely interesting, and Professor North is absolutely great.Some of the comments I read on SIS when I was deciding whether to take this course mention the fact that there's a lot of in-class discussion and proto-philosopher freshmen can become really annoying and pompous with their comments. I disagree. In theory, the comments might be annoying. But upon actually paying attention to what people were saying, I found them to be very interesting and to help drive the class forward. I highly encourage Professor North to continue using the current class structure.Professor North was absolutely great. Extremely knowledgeable on the subject, friendly, open to new ideas, engaging, cared about her students. Several times, she took the initiative to follow up with me after comments made during lecture, which was really great. Pretty much everything you could ask for in a professor.",
    "My recommendation is this: if you know nothing or barely nothing about philosophy, you should take this course, as it will familiarize you with the basic concepts and principles of the different areasof philosophy. However, if you read philosophy in high school, or simply know some philosophy from other sources, I cannot stress this enough--do not take this course. It will be, at best, a mere summary of things that you already know. You are better off in a more advanced philosophy course, even if that means having to do more work. Really, this course is intended for people who are completely unfamiliar with philosophy. If you know even some basic philosophy, you should not take this class, because you will be bored.",
    "great introductory course",
    "Take it if you are looking for an easy philosophy class that covers a broad array of subject matter.",
    "I HIGHLY recommend it! You will not only enjoy the class, with dedication, you can do exceptionally well.",
    "Philosophy 110 is an accessible introduction to the field of philosophy- suitable for a student with no prior knowledge. The readings can be daunting, but Professor North and the TAs do a really excellent job of making the arguments more comprehensible. Also, enough resources and support were available to make papers more manageable. I would recommend it.",
    "I would recommend this class to someone who does not have much experience in philosophy. You will be able to learn how to write a good philosophy paper.",
    "Introduction to Philosophy is a pretty simple class. You really don't need to read at all because you cover everything in lecture, but the readings are short so they aren't much of a stressor anyway. Three 5-8 page papers, pretty straightforward. I'm not too big into philosophy, but the class wasn't much of a burden, even though it wasn't all that fun either.",
    "Intro Phil was a pretty easy and interesting course. I would recommend it because it is not too much work.",
    "I would recommend it only if the student has very little or no background in philosophy. The course is a good introduction to the way philosophers think and write. The discussions are interesting, and some of the material goes beyond the basic philosophical foundations. But this course is meant for the novice of philosophy.",
    "Often times regurgitates readings, failing to provide many new insights into the material.",
    "yeeeeaaaaaa. not much reading. not much work. sometimes the stuff is interesting. jill north is weird",
    "Easy readings. Doing the readings beforehand helps stay awake in class. Otherwise you only need to read the ones you write your papers on and you'll manage just fine. Lectures are usually interesting so I suppose I would recommend this to a student looking for an easy Hu credit.",
    "definitely. it made me want to do the philosophy track within my major. you get out what you put in",
    "I most definitely recommend this class! You'll study a bit of everything to give you a taste from what philosophy is about. You'll cover arguments for and against the existence of God, existence and reality, knowledge, freedom of the will, consciousness, personal identity, and ethics, among others. You'll learn how to think and write better. And it's way cooler than it sounds! For what it's worth, it's infinitely better than the history of philosophy courses because you don't necessarily follow chronological order. You'll study philosophers ranging form Plato to Descartes to 20th century ones.",
    "Good intro to philosophy--don't expect too much though. Pretty basic."
