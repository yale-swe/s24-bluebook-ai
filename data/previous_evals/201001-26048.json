   "comments": [
    "a good mix of theory and practice, but it delves into a lot more linear algebra than we need.",
    "It is a good course. However the last couple of lectures didnt really fit in that well. I would recommend the part of the course that covers openMP and MPI as this is definately parallel programming. I feel that the matrix BLAS and Lapack stuff could have been replaced by more relavant material, such as cuda or OpenCL.",
    "If you like to know and use parallel programming technique, this class is helpful.",
    "One gets the most out of the assignments of this course. The lecture time for this course is not where learning occurs.",
    "Very accessible and responsive -- offers valuable input on assignments and other assessments.",
    "The programming assignments are really long, but if you love programming, it'll be a lot of fun. Plus, for Computational Biology, it's easy to see how programs can be parallelized, so this course is great for getting more speed out of your programs.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who will be doing parallel programming and computing."

    "I think learning how to parallelize something will definitely increase the available options for me when writing algorithms for my thesis project. I'm glad Itook it.",
    "This course has been very helpful and will allow me to expand the scope of my research",
    "Parallel programming, in terms of both technique and idea, is very useful for graphics applications. Many algorithm can be adapted into a parallel counterpart. Actually, I made a trial to create a parallel texture synthesis scheme as my final project.",
    "This course is an essential addition to the computer science curriculum at Yale given that it offers a very technical overview of parallel computing while emphasizing its applicability for and implementation in a wide variety of applications.",
    "This course will help a lot for getting more speed out of the software I write. This may or may not make a valuable contribution to my thesis, but that's because I'm stilltrying to figure out what my thesis will be about.",
    "It's a good class to learn parallel computing techniques. It helped a lot to understand how to use Yale HPC servers.",
    "I learned about concepts of parallel programming and what kind of performance I can expect, as well as how to use the important tools, like MPI. Before I took this class I was having a hard time understanding problems I ran into, and if I was doing things correctly, but now I am able understand things much better."
