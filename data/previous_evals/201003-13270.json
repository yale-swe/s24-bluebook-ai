    "Take this if Denardo makes course materials for the topics not covered in the textbook.Very interesting course otherwise.",
    "It is a course in probability and excel. It teaches you how to analyze large problems using excel that otherwise would not be possible to solve by oneself. Very interesting.",
    "I'd recommend this class. If you've had probability theory, and you didn't find it too hard, this class wouldn't be that hard either. This class is not that much work either. Each problem set takes 2 to 4 hours, and there's not even one per week. But here's what this classis. You basically learn some probability models, such as discrete time Markov chains, queuing, inventory models. If you like that then it's fine. You don't much much theory in here, but I liked that you get to apply the theoretical stuff. The stochastic part of the course title is also a bit misleading, too. Denardo said he's not satisfied with how he taught the class this semester, so I think the next time he teaches it, it'll be different.",
    "Unless the professor significantly increases the density of the material and prepare better for lectures, I wouldn't recommend taking the class. In fact, a lot of people dropped the class half way.",
    "This class was worth taking, and was not terribly difficult. The only bad thing about it was that it was pretty disorganized. However, Denardo is a great guy and is willing to help you as much as you need, basically whenever you want.",
    "I would not recommend this course to another student. At the end of the semester, I didn't really feel like I had learned all that much. If Professor Denardo decides to teach this course again, hopefully it will be more organized.",
    "Yes I would. The class covers a number of interesting topics from inventory theory to basic Markov decision problems. The class is challenging enough to be very interesting but not so much as to be overly frustrating.",
    "I would recommend it to any student who wants to improve his\/her problem solving skills. It isn't too mathematical in that there isn't much theory involved, but it addresses problems from a very practical point of view.",
    "No. I would not suggest that you take this class. It was a frustrating experience. Professor Denardo is very familiar with the topics and very capable, but the course was taught in a way that I came out feeling like I had only a shallow knowledge of topics that require a deep understanding. I did not really grapple with the material and talk it through with other people, as we were unable to discuss it with our classmates for much of the course (after the first midterm, the rest of our assignments were take-home \"exams\" that could not be discussed with anyone but the professor). It was hard figuring out how to do the problems much of the time. On the plus side, the professor is flexible and does seem to want to give us more opportunities to do well (but those opportunities..aka extra exams... require a lot of work. Still, better than an in-class final.)",
    "It's a great topic, but don't take this class. It is near impossible because of the lack of direction\/guidance. the problem sets \/ take homes are close to impossible. I have never felt this frustrated with a class. No matter how much you want to learn - you cant. there are no books to help you. no TA support. Everything is a take home - so no collaboration. All you have is Denardo and the Internet - and that's not enough to learn. This class was a struggle. Don't take it."
