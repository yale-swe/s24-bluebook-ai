   "comments": [
    "Take it, especially if you're doing the lecture. Pretty chill most of the time. 3 sets of lab reports are turned in. Try to do each report as you finish the corresponding lab, it makes life WAY WAY WAY easier. I did poorly on the second set of labs because I didn't get much feedback for the first one. Just do a really solid, thorough job on the lab writeups to get a good grade.Labs were very interesting--we got to measure the electrical activity of visual neurons and muscle neurons toward the end. Just really cool, cutting edge stuff.Be wary that you will stay an hour late for most of the labs.",
    "Definitely take it. Best lab you'll take at Yale or anywhere, provided they make a few changes to the structure of the course.",
    "This was a great class. It really helped me understand what was going on in the class, since I'm a hands-on and visual learner. I had not known much about neurobiology until this class, so it really helped to take the lab with the class. The only downside is it takes from 1:30pm to past 6pm, which is longer than most other labs. But if you have the time and energy to do this lab, you should.",
    "Brett Berke is awesome. Take the class and you will learn so much about how neurons work and how to test them. Lab write ups are a bit long though.",
    "Take it. No regrets.",
    "There's no finishing early with this lab--at least this semester. Experimenting until ~5:40pm and then class discussion until 6, 6:15pm.Personally, I thought it was a painful, tedious lab, but some people loved it.It basically consists of dissecting an organism and then stimulating and recording action potentials from the organism...over and over again, just using slightly different methods and under slightly different contexts.",
    "This is a good lab. The experiments are interesting and the atmosphere is relaxed and friendly. The lab does go until 6 PM every time, which is a bummer, but it's a good class. Also, taking it with the lecture helps give extra Neurobiology practice that can be useful when studying for tests.",
    "I couldn't have taken a better lab at Yale, without a doubt. I enjoyed the lab so much, and I learned so much as well.Lab did go over the scheduled time, but it was definitely no longer than normal.Having three\/four lab reports due at a time was intense. I did well and I understood everything, but I probably would have done better on them if they were due each week.",
    "Neurobiology lab was great! You get to do a lot of cool experiments like making frog legs contract or record electrical activity from a fly's eye. It is a long lab but it's worth it - it helps in understanding some subjects in lecture and most of all, it is just plain cool.",
    "Best science laboratory I've taken at Yale. I highly recommend it if you are taking the lecture, as it helped a lot with understanding the first portion of the course. You also do amazingly cool experiments.",
    "Neurobio lab is pretty fun and not very stressful. We worked with worms, frogs, flies, and grasshoppers. There isn't that much work involved outside of lab - you just read the protocol before lab and take a short and simple quiz at the beginning of lab, and every few weeks you turn in your lab reports from the past few labs (the lab reports aren't that long or difficult, and they're graded out of 5 points). Lab does sometimes last quite long though, and I usually got out of lab between 5:30 and 6:30 p.m. I would recommend it if you're looking for a not-too-stressful bio lab in which you will still be learning interesting and useful things.",
    "Fun addition to the class itself - you get to dissect! Woo!! Sometimes it'shard, but the labs are graded fairly (read: easily) and the focus is on the learning experience, not the grade, which is extremely refreshing. Frogs, flies, grasshoppers, worms, oh my!",
    "This is a good Bio lab course. Long labs but fairly easy and interesting.",
    "Fantastic lab. I've taken chem and physics lab, which were both fairly painful, and this bears almost no relation. You'll have a good time as long as you know what you're getting into-- NOT your typical get-in-get-out cookbook lab. There's way more support than in a normal lab-- 2 or 3 profs and 3 TAs for about 15 students. Sections do run late, often 5 hours, but it's because of the focus on discussion and understanding what you're doing-- before and after you do it. Lots of dissection, fiddling with oscilloscopes, and poking things with micropipettes. Also, you get to hold a human brain. The lab reports are due in batches of about 4 at a time, which means that aside from an occasional week of lab report insanity, most weeks this class seems a lot less onerous than other labs. I recommend it.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to anyone taking MCDB 320. It's a great complement to the lecture and the experiments are pretty interesting. It does take a lot of time though, most labs run until 5:30 or 6:00. But if you have the afternoon to spare and want to understand what you're learning in lecture better then take the lab.",
    "Yes, take this course along with the lab. Very well done and an unusually positive lab experience.",
    "This class will go until 6 every single time, especially in the first four weeks. Keep this in mind, and do your lab reports more often than they're due, and you will be happy and successful in this class. It is really a lot of fun."
