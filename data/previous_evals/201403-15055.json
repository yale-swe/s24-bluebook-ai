    "If you wanted an easy QR, do not take this course. If you are interested in game theory or international relations, or both, and are up for the challenge, then go for it! Professor Debs and Tumi are awesome and make a great team, and really want you to succeed. Even though the material is difficult, they are super available to help and they grade very fairly. I wouldn't take the course again because without any econ background and not being a big math person, I struggled to keep up, BUT having survived, I am super glad I took the course and I learned a lot! Take it, but don't expect it to be a breeze! Know what you are signing up for",
    "Definitely recommend it. If your interested in economic decision making or just decision making in general, this is the class for you.",
    "Much easier game theory course than the course offered through the econ department.",
    "I only recommend this course if you find game theory really interesting as a study in and of itself. You will go over some basic games that are common to game theory, but you won't really get into international relations very late in the semester. You'll almost forget the international relations component until around thanksgiving. The way the course is set up does not include any research design or study thereof so you might get credit for it but you will not learn anything about it. This course is also super heavy on notation given it is more of an intro class so if you are more of a conceptual person you might get frustrated by this."
