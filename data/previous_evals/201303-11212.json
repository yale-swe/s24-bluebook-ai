    "This course is a poetry workshop. Each week, students are expected to submit a poem that responds to a prompt given the previous week, and from the packet two students are selected for workshop. In addition, each week students are given readings from contemporary poetry designed to illuminate a different technique.I highly recommend this class to anyone interested in receiving individual attention on their poetry - it is accessible to students without prior experience but, because of the individual attention, remains challenging to experienced poets.Be prepared to spend time outside of class attending office hours and extra class workshops (but they're fun!).",
    "You write a poem every week, and read poetry. Then you talk about them both. Quickly becomes a positive environment to grow as a writer and reader. David is very interested in what you have to write \/ say and was very encouraging throughout the course. Discussions of poems often ran well over time, which was a positive and a negative.",
    "Reading Poetry for Craft was a fantastic class. David Gorin definitely made the class what it was; if he's teaching it, then I give it my full recommendation. We wrote a poem per week and analyzed approximately two peoples' poems per class, in addition to talking about the poetry readings. It's a great opportunity to write regularly and have your poems workshopped in a positive, low-stress environment. Note that the workshop environment will depend a lot on who is teaching, which is why again I so strongly recommend David Gorin. He will give you lots of his time, both in class and at coffee shop meetings, to help you make your writing better. He clearly loves teaching this class.",
    "A great humanities course - we read and discussed many different types of poetry (mostly modern) and I learned to appreciate it a bit more. This class has a very manageable workload - each week we wrote a poem based on a different prompt and read poetry and analysis in preparation for class discussion. At the end of the class we wrote a final essay about a book of modern poetry we chose. Students are also required to attend three poetry readings, which was a fun and interesting experience.",
    "English 135 is a study of poetry - mostly recent poetry - with a view to developing techniques in one's own writing. You write a poem every week, each with a different constraint or focus, and the week's readings are all organized around some technique or theme, such as \"Irony and Sincerity\" and \"Parataxis and Hypotaxis\". Definitely take this class if you want to improve your writing (it helped me a lot) and learn about contemporary poetry from someone who knows it really well.",
    "If you want to write, take this class. If you want to be surrounded by folks who like poetry, take this class. Don't shirk off on the assignments, and don't write what you think he wants: you'll end up with a portfolio that feels empty. Just take this opportunity to create a body of work that you love, and let what you learn expand your ability in a natural manner.",
    "Absolutely! The class is interesting, you read a lot of poetry you wouldn't really read otherwise, and you have interesting prompts. Not a lot of work at all, but fun.",
    "I really enjoyed this course. It was a great introduction to the world of poetry. I liked the modern poetry that we focused on, but I think that this course could have been improved if we spent a little bit more time exploring older, classic poetry. Also, I think that the structure of the class was great - a good balance between studying poetry and workshopping our own work.And Prof. Gorin was great! His love for poetrywas contagious and he infused our class with a wonderful form of academic energy. I especially appreciated how he was so willing to patiently meet with each student in office hour meetings.",
    "Yes, for sure, this is such a fantastic class. You read many young poets (Mark Levine, Ben Lerner, Ariana Reines, many of whom came to New Haven throughout the semester. And then learn from them to develop your own writing style. Dave Gorin is wonderful in so many ways. He is fun, playful, kind, and incredibly generous with his time for students. He critiques poetry in a helpful way that validates you as a writer and pushes you forward. Of course, as a creative writing class, a lot of the enjoyment will depend on the other students as well. Take the class with a friend!",
    "Take this course! You get out what you put in, but there is so much to get out of it. Dave is a tireless teacher who goes above and beyond to make himself available to his students for conferencing and advice. If you have any interest in writing poetry but want a little more structure than the more advanced classes offer, this is a great option."
