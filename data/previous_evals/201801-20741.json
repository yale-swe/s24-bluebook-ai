   "comments": [
    "This course was a wide-ranging exploration of the causes and impacts of evolutionary biology on life. We explored the proximate and ultimate causes of many examples. The course has some overlap with BIOL104, but quickly moves beyond this introductory-level material. The material covers both gene and population level evolution. Sanchez is a much better lecturer than Powell.",
    "I learned my fair share of biology knowledge, as well as a slightly better understanding of how to read and understand scientific papers in the biology field.",
    "Some basic overview of evolution, plus some more specific topics in the second half. More practice with scientific papers.",
    "An Understanding of life through the lens of evolution. It taught me to use the different manifestations of natural and neutral selection to explain and understand the micro and macro biological world",
    "I learned more Evolutionary pathways, facets, and especially learned considerably more concerning the evolution of microbes and Evolutionary landscapes.",
    "The class was an introduction to the fundamentals of evolutionary biology. A lot of it repeated Biology 104, but there were some new concepts.",
    "Basic understanding of the core tenets of evolutionary biology, with a more in-depth study of microbe evolution and current research in the field of fitness landscapes",
    "Great class to get a sense of what EE&B is all about. Highly recommend for all life sciences majors, but also for anyone passionate about biology.",
    "You learn about evolutionary bio, it builds off of BIOL104.",
    "I learnt about topics in evolutionary biology such as population dynamics and qualitative genetics. I also developed skills while reading papers and discussing them with my peers."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This grading for this class is very stressful. The grade is based solely on 2 exams and section participation, with each exam being worth 40% of the grade. There was little preparation for either exam and I had no idea what to expect for the first test. I received no feedback regarding my performance in section. The only grade we received before the end of class was the score from the first exam. This class would greatly benefit from some additional assignments or some other feedback. The class, the material itself, is engaging and well-taught. The lecture slides are posted, but the majority of the information is given in class, and not directly on the slides. The course mostly follows the textbook. The textbook itself is a great resource for the courseit's well written and very clear. The papers provided for section and for reading are clear and concise explanations of the material we covered in class. These papers greatly increased my understanding of the applications and practical implication of the lecture material.",
    "Sanchez should be the only teacher.",
    "I don't think the transition between the two professors and the materials they taught was very smooth. It felt a little bit like they could have been teaching two different courses. Their styles were also so different that it was just kind of difficult to transition. It felt like there was no real continuity.",
    "Sanchez was a much stronger professor than Powell. Sanchez's section of the course was genuinely fascinating, with engaging material and strong lecturing. Powell barely seemed to try. He was a dry lecturer, disorganized, and completely unhelpful with questions.",
    "The lectures and lecture slides were good, but I wish there were a few more assignments to accompany the exams (a paper or a problem set perhaps). The lack of assignments meant it was easy to disengage between exams.",
    "I thought the course could b structured a little differently. Sometimes the jump from eukaryotes to bacteria was a little jarring.",
    "Strengths: Sanchez's lectures were the only highlight of this class. They were well-organized, easy to follow, and genuinely interesting. Weaknesses: Powell's lectures were murky, filled with essentially useless math, and outdated. Section was also generally a grand waste of time.",
    "Strengths - Professor Powell did a good job of teaching the more basic, textbook stuff while Professor Sanchez would cover the current research and go into many more specific examples of research in the field of microbiology. Weaknesses - not very organized at all, particularly Professor Powell's lectures",
    "Both professors are excellent. I like that it is a smaller lecture so it is easier to be engaged.",
    "In the last month of the semester we focused mainly on papers. It would have made more sense to learn about the papers in class so that the section could be used to go over things we were confused about instead of the other way around. The professors just expect a lot of memorization from you, which is one way to learn I guess.",
    "The lectures had a logical flow that was easy to follow and the professors were very knowledgeable about the topics. However, the lectures should have been longer. I would highly suggest eliminating the discussion section and adding the time to lecture to make them an hour and fifteen minutes twice a week."

   "comments": [
    "This course is an excellent explanation of the mechanisms of evolution. It is a good and engaging lecture taught by experts in the field. The grading is stressful because there are only 2 exams, and each is worth 40% of the grade (the last 20% is section participation). The material is really engaging, especially when Sanchez is the lecturer.",
    "I would recommend this course to another person, due to the importance of material as well as the impressive teaching ability of both the professors.",
    "You have to take it for E&EB. Do not take it if you're looking for a SC credit.",
    "Try to take with Sanchez if possible! His part of the course was great. Otherwise, this is an acceptable major requirement but there are better fun SC credits if that's what you're looking for.",
    "You get what you put in for this class -- it's easy to check out and not learn much or enjoy the material, but if you are driven and interesting, there is a ton to learn on this all important subject.",
    "If you are at all interested or need it for your major then sure. Otherwise if you are looking for a biology class a more specific one might be more engaging.",
    "There isn't a ton of work, but that means that your grade hinges on two exams each worth 40% of your grade. If that grading structure doesn't terrify you, and you're okay with making it through some terrible Powell lectures to get to Sanchez, then go for it.",
    "Yes, it is a good basic introduction to evolutionary biology and is not too challenging - would be a good 5th class. Some of the material seems redundant after taking Bio 104, but other parts are particularly engaging, especially the studies Professor Alvaro teaches about and the papers we read for that part of the class.",
    "Yes! It is a great way to learn about this area in a more comfortable way than BIOL 103.",
    "It's a good fifth class because there are no assignments, only 2 exams. That being said, there are only two exams that your grade counts on. Go to lecture and read the textbook and you should be fine.",
    "I would recommend this to a student interested in E&EB or another science related major or profession."
