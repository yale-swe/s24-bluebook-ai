   "comments": [
    "It is an amazing section with one of the world's pre-eminent scholars in this field. Although it covers limited span of years, it goes more in depth into history than any other history class I have ever taken. I recommend the course to anyone interested in the subject matter.",
    "I would certainly recommend this course to another student. Professor Kagan is rightfully a legendary professor and scholar and his seminars truly make this era of ancient Greek history alive and relevant.",
    "It's a survey of Greek history and politics in the Fourth Century BC. Take it, but get ready for your fair share of obnoxious YPU-style classmates and Kagan acolytes\/downright brown nosers. Nonetheless, it is a good course.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class. The class covers a relatively brief period of time in depth. The catch is, that three different sources cover the time and often have conflicting views on what happened. The trick, then, is for us to do our best with what he had to discover what really happened and the reasons why, which is not only historiographically taxing but also requires and builds critical and on your feet thinking.Having Professor Kagan in seminar is an experience that is simply not to be missed if you are one who holds your Yale education in high regard. If you have a chance to take a course with him, especially a seminar, then what the hell are you waiting for?",
    "You read primary and secondary sources every week and discuss one particular aspect of developments between 404 and 362 bc...the most fun you will ever have.",
    "The class is populated with die-hard devotees to Kagan and Greek history, which, if that doesn't describe you, can be more than a little intimidating. But if you're prepared to commit to a rigorous and rewarding academic challenge, go for it.",
    "Terrific class. Prof Kagan leads hands down the most engaging and comprehensive seminar ever. The material is pretty obscure and requires a solid amount of reading to get a hold of, but the writing workload is light (2 papers + in-class presentation). I did not take Prof Kagan's intro lecture before this class and thus was a bit lost at some points but generally was able to manage just fine. If you care about Greek\/classical history and military and political history, and want to study with a truly fun and engrossing professor, take this class.",
    "This is not your standard history seminar. Kagan requires two 5-6 page papers and a final exam, so its not great preparation for the senior essay. I do appreciate, however, that the courses focuses much more heavily on discussing and debating the issues in class rather than the quantity of research you can cram into a 20 - 30 page final paper. Overall, Kagan is what made this course so rewarding. He allows the students to engage with the texts and the information without much interference. He nudges the discussion in whatever direction he wants it to go by asking questions, as opposed to making students speak directly to him for the entire 2 hours. I did not know as much about Greek history as most of the other students, but I can confidently say that this was one of the most rewarding and informative courses I have taken at Yale. It's not his most popular seminar, but I would recommend any of them to anybody with an iota of interest in Greek history or taking a course with one of our university's intellectual titans.",
    "Take this class if you're interested in military or diplomatic history. This course is relatively light on primary source evidence, so there is a really lively discussion of the possibilities and choices facing the historical actors in question. The lessons of this course are not so much about Greek history as they are about diplomacy in general and human nature.",
    "Take this class if you are interested in the subject. If not, don't take this class.",
    "This class is the best class I have taken at Yale. In every respect it provides a model that other classes should follow. The reading is interesting and relevant to the discussion during class meetings. Kagan does a better job than anyone I've ever seen of moderating the discussion. He lets students speak and debate among themselves as long as they have relevant things to say; just as there start to be signs that it might be getting repetitive, he cuts in and gives his own (extremely interesting) take on the matter at hand. The depth and breadth of his knowledge is staggering; watching him lead a discussion has to be one of the most amazing intellectual experiences I have seminar. Finally, he genuinely enjoys teaching and will gladly get to know the students who take the time to come to his office hours. Take thisclass! It will be the best thing you do at Yale.",
    "A seminar with Professor Kagan is worth the price of Yale tuition by itself. Professor Kagan has perfected the art of running a seminar. If you can get into any one of his seminars, do not miss the opportunity. Whether you're specifically interested in ancient Greek history or more generally interested in international relations, politics, strategy, and human nature, if you take a seminar with Kagan, mark my words - in all likelihood it will define your Yale experience."
