   "comments": [
    "Take it. You'll learn some cool things about finance and the US economy, and the class is not too demanding.",
    "Take it if you are well-versed with the financial industry or have taken relevant classes\/done relevant internships. Coming in with no finance background makes it hard for me to follow some of the discussions. That said, the workload is very reasonable, and Professor Perna is nice and knows a lot about the subject, so you'll end up learning a lot.",
    "The class is not very academic and focuses heavily on current events. The workload is light, 2 3-minute presentations and a 15 page term paper on anything you want that relates to the banking system. Ideal for a senior going through the job interview process as you need to know about current events anyways for your interviews and because the majority of the work is at the end of the course.",
    "This was a great senior seminar. It combined a small amount of academic economic theory with a lot of real-world assessment of the U.S. economy and the banking system. It is extremely relevant and helpful for anyone going into the financial sector.The guest speaker, a hedge fund manager, was absolutely incredible. The professor, Nick Perna, knows an incredible amount about the banking system and creates a really relaxed seminar environment. The workload isn't bad; just one final paper and a couple mini presentations that last 3 minutes. Definitely one of the best senior seminar.",
    "Take it if you are interested in the subject matter.",
    "I would recommend this class to any student who wants to research some specific topic about financial markets in the United States. Prof. Perna gives you a good overview of financial markets during the first weeks of the semester, and then you have to choose a topic on financial markets to present a final paper on. This paper + presentation will represent 60% of your grade, so don't take this class unless you want to devote a considerable amount of time researching something specific about financial markets. The whole class was itself pretty enjoyable - Prof. Perna picks really interesting readings for each week, and students give presentations on financial concepts that are very important to know. Each class was more like a lecture than a discussion, but it was always a pleasure to listen to Prof. Perna speak, especially because he always had some good insights on how to understand financial markets.",
    "It's a great class if you want to go into finance. Otherwise, you may not find all of the material too interesting. I'm fairly certain that about 90% of the kids in the class had lined up jobs on Wall Street, either in banking or in trading, so know that this is the crowd that you will be in.",
    "Def take it. An easy, well rounded, entertaining econ seminar. Really a gem, not to be overlooked.",
    "I would recommend Economics 484. To get the most from this class, one definitely has to do the reading and stay up to date with current events (e.g. Wall St. Journal, yahoo finance, etc) in order to be able to contribute to discussion- especially because Professor Perna calls on you during class. I enjoyed how it wasn't only focused on theory but instead, on applying economics knowledge to current, specific events. Moreover, the mini-presentations on economic data was great in helping the class learn about how the markets react to this data and where the data comes from.Yes, I would recommend it. Not as advanced as \"finance\" seminars but good enough for those interested in gaining a better understanding of the financial system."
