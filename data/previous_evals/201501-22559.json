    "This was a lab that reinforced lecture themes. Take it if you want to better understand physics.",
    "This is a class for the premed that is not in love with physics, as I said earlier it accomplishes what it hopes to. You will learn basic physics E & M techniques without the hassle of complex mathematics. I would recommend it to anyone in need of a pays lab.",
    "Don't take it unless it's required for your major.",
    "This course is good for a pre-med lab. The final is very difficult but besides that everything else is fair and the TAs\/ instructors are very helpful",
    "Only if you have to take it",
    "You are taking it probably because you have to. That being said, it will be the easiest of your pre-med\/phys requirements.",
    "A pretty laid back lab - much moreso than 165L. Experiments are much more fun (and much more interesting than flipping coins). Would recommend as I actually enjoyed the class.",
    "please don't take this course unless you have to",
    "Basic introductory physics lab",
    "Good lab! Much better than PHYS 165L, and a lot of the experiments are pretty enjoyable! The weekly lab reports may seem annoying, but really do help make sure that you know the information (which is useful when the final comes along).",
    "Don't take this lab unless you have to. It's annoying and tedious.",
    "Compared to PHYS 165L (which you probably have already taken), this lab covers slightly more obscure topics to a lesser degree of detail than the previous lab. It does not tie in to the lecture course as well, though the circuits modules were very helpful for what we were learning in class.",
    "I thought that Physics 166L was quite good, actually. The workload was roughly the same as the fall semester physics lab (165L), but the experiments were much more interesting. The lab course also dovetailed nicely with the lecture course that I was in (171). I spent roughly 2 hours writing the lab reports each week, and the lab often got out after 2 or 2.5 hours (less than the allotted 3), so that was pretty great. A low-stress lab that you're probably required to take.",
    "Chances are that you are taking this course because you are required to take it. That being said, of required labs this one isn't too bad. You often get out early and I don't remember ever going over on time. The lab practical is not terribly difficult given that you don't overthink things. Make sure to keep track of all of your lab reports and quizzes because they will serve as a resource for the lab practical at the end.",
    "Don't take it unless you have to",
    "This class honestly sucks. Everyone in there is forced to take it for a pre-med requirement. It's just something you have to do unfortunately.",
    "Only ever take it if you have to. I wish physics lab could be fun, but this class isn't too much on your workload but a bit of an eyesore so to speak.",
    "It was challenging, and most labs were packed with relentless things to do, albeit a few that allowed a tiny breather. It was well run, though the final was one heckuva bombardment of disparaging upsets in which there were a couple moments in it that I truly wished I had studied harder, even though I knew that studying harder would not have made the final any easier. With that said, I hope there is a curve, because if not, everyone's GPA just went down by .2 or way more...Honestly I don't know anyone who has to take this for fun, but overall it's a solid lab course.",
    "A wonderful continuation of Phys 165L. Nothing changes; same labs, lab report, quizzes. The grade breakdown is a little different but nothing to be too worried about. Professor Cahn's enthusiasm is unmatched, and it's really not a painful pre-med requirement. Also, if you're in Phys 181, this class is an added bonus because it's slightly ahead of what we learned in class, so we had a rough idea when we got to lecture what was going on. LEARN HOW TO USE A FREAKING OSCILLOSCOPE THOUGH; DON'T LET YOUR LAB PARTNER DO IT; YOU'LL REGRET IT OTHERWISE DURING THE PRACTICAL. Overall, solid lab class!",
    "Probably have to take this class as a requirement but I think it is a great introduction to physics lab.",
    "Definitely take this course if you have to. Otherwise think about taking a more difficult course like 206.",
    "You probably won't take it for fun, but also don't be afraid! It actually is very fun, and the TAs are nice and Dr. Cahn is a baller.",
    "Physics lab is what it is really. Although the stuff we did this semester was trickier because there's a lot of troubleshooting involved and less concrete concepts.",
    "Much better than 165.",
    "A good intro physics lab. Closely connected to what you are learning in physics 171 or 181",
    "I would recommend this course. It actually taught me a lot about physics and helped me in class.",
    "More work that 165L, however also more relevant and useful",
    "A pretty low-stress way to fulfill a physics lab requirement. The labs are self-contained, with a one-page write-up for each but otherwise no outside work. The professors are all very knowledgeable (especially since the physics you do is pretty elementary) and the labs are the right amount of challenging. The practical exam is stressful in theory but ends up being very easy if you've been following along with the labs throughout the semester.",
    "I liked Phys 165L better. The lab focuses more on circuits and oscillators which are generally confusing instruments to use and by the end of the course, I still don't feel like I know how to use one. I'm guessing most people taking this class have to take it for pre-med requirements or to fulfill major requirements; otherwise, I don't see any reason to take it.",
    "Just be prepared for the practical.",
    "Fairly relaxed intro to physics concepts from 180 and 181. The workload is totally manageable, everything was graded fairly, and the material complemented what I was already learning in engineering classes.",
    "Wayyyyy better than Phys 205L. Better experiments, much less stress.",
    "If you're thinking about taking this course, you're probably a STEM major and taking as a prerequisite for your major. Otherwise, don't take it. It's good for showing students the practical uses of the ideas they learn in Physics 171 and 181 but other than that, it doesn't really do anything else.",
    "I would recommend this lab for anyone who need to take a physics lab for their major, or anyone who is looking to try out something new. The lab is not overly demanding in terms of workload.",
    "If you're taking it, you probably have to. It's not bad though, compared to some other science labs.",
    "fine",
    "Easier than 165",
    "Typical physics lab - you do the experiment, do the write-up, and then take the final exam. Make sure you learn how to actually use the equipment effectively or else you'll be stuck during the final exam",
    "You probably have to take it if you are pre-med. But definitely take it over 201. This lab course is awesome!",
    "Overall, it was very hard to get a good grade in this class not because the material was hard but because the quizzes tested subjects not on the handouts, the ta's did not clearly communicate what was being asked for in the PL, and the professors weren't really around to teach the material.",
    "A very helpful course, although I did not quite realize this at the beginning because 171 does not correspond as well as it can with the material. The instructors and TA's are all very caring and very knowledgeable - and I had a much better experience this semester compared to the last!",
    "Very reasonable, nice professors, and hilarious lab handouts. You probably have to take this anyway, so go for it.",
    "It is a lab. I didn't like the long hours; however, it was necessary for my major so I had to take it. I would not recommend this course to someone who did not have to take it, but I also would be dissuade anyone.",
    "You're probably taking this because you have to. That said its not as bad as it could be and if you're taking it with 171 it makes a lot of those concepts clearer or elaborates on them in an interesting way.",
    "It is good lab! I think it's one of the better physics intro labs. The labs reinforced class material. It wasn't that strenuous and most times we finished early.",
    "Standard premed lab, but the professors are great. Sometimes the rubrics the TAs use to grade don't match up with what they ask you in the lab report, so points are taken off there.",
    "Take this lab! It's actually pretty fun for a physics lab. The final was pretty challenging because I felt like I needed more than the allotted time for each section, so pace yourself!",
    "I mean, it's a prerequisite for med school, so you don't have a choice...But it's a better lab (WAY better than GenChem in every single way), and the one-page summaries are the BEST. Take this course if you have to, and don't take it if you don't, but it's not a bad experience at all. Make sure you have good peers and TAs, and never hesitate to switch to a different section if you need.",
    "It's pretty tedious. But then, it's physics lab, so I don't know what you expected. You take it because you want to go to med school.",
    "I would recommend it to a fellow student because the lab is a very low stress class. I felt that learning was really emphasized! Both the main professors and the TA really were easy to approach.",
    "The best prereq lab ive taken",
    "Phys 166L is like most typical lab courses--weekly lab reports, weekly quizzes, and a final in which you work alone and need to conduct your own experiment to reach a goal. I thought the course was fair, but the final was adequately difficult and I did not feel like our coursework adequately prepared us for it.",
    "A pretty painless physics lab. I would recommend it if you have to take a physics lab.",
    "Easy enough if you pay attention.",
    "Fun, easy lab. nearly always got out of time. Much better in terms of workload to do this lab than 206L. DO IT. It's super fun and the concepts are not too tough at all!",
    "If you have to take the lab it's not that bad. Annoying at worst, and you learn some pretty cool things during the lab. The final exam is somewhat stressful though.",
    "Take if you're premed obviously. A little harder than 165 but at this point you've got the hang of lab notes and reports. Final practical is very stressful and not quite like previous experiments done.",
    "PHYS 166L is definitely one of the better labs that I have taken at Yale. The workload is very fair for a 0.5 credit course (same as PHYS 165L- weekly quizzes, weekly lab report, and a lab practical). Professor Cahn and Professor Mochrie are both wonderful instructors who truly care about the class and making sure that we understood the topics covered in each lab. My one major complaint about this class is there there were many weeks in which the lab expected us to know material that had not yet been covered in lecture (I was enrolled in PHYS 171 concurrently). I found these labs extremely confusing, and had to spend a lot of my own time trying to understand what was going on. Other than that, PHYS 166L is a very high quality, well-taught course!",
    "This is a fairly low workload class during most of the semester but if you want to be well-prepared for the final it is most advisable that you actually understand what is going on in each lab and be able to do that on your own (without the help of a TA\/student). This is an ok introduction for non-engineering students on how to hook up circuits, etc. but if you want to actually delve deeper into that kind of thing and already know how to hook up a circuit, use an oscilloscope, or work through problems on your own without having an explicit procedure, than this probably isnt the course for you.",
    "Phys 166L is a necessary evil, but is also way more benign than chem labs or anything else.",
    "Yes - take it if you need that physics lab credits. I would say that it is even more enjoyable than the fall semester.",
    "PHYS 166L is what you would expect from a physics lab course. It's very similar to PHYS 165L, though I found PHYS 166L to be more exciting.",
    "Solid lab, corresponded well with Phys 171.",
    "PHYS 166L was a great lab class. Entertaining, not too difficult, and I learned a lot. It was a great supplement to PHYS 171 timing-wise, the materials\/topics lined up almost flawlessly. I honestly wish every lab course were like 166L.",
    "This course is probably a requirement for you, and as such, it will be just fine. I would recommend it as long as you make sure you join a section with a TA that explains each experiment well, particularly the practical \"how to\" aspects of each experiment in addition to background information",
    "PHYS 166L is very similar to first semester (165L), and it is a required course for pre-med. The TFs and Rona\/Sidney were very helpful and made sure students did not feel lost. Overall, for someone not immensely interested in physics, it was a good experience.",
    "I would recommend this course.",
    "166 is pretty much the same deal as 165, but be warned: the practical exam is much more challenging!! You will probably want to study for this one and make sure you understand each step of what you do throughout the semester. E.g. read the handouts and wikipedia. Try and make sure you get a good TA at the beginning of the semester, too. Stefan is the best, if he's teaching!",
    "166L is a breeze if you know how to work an oscilloscope. Or have even the most basic knowledge of the topics.",
    "Of all the physics labs, I think this is probably the chillest. However, the lab final counts for the majority of your grade and is always difficult.",
    "Easy class. Just like PHYS 165L but maybe a little shorter. Don't stress about it, do well on the final and you'll do well in the class. It is definitely less work than orgo lab for you pre-meds out there.",
    "This class is designed just like PHYS 165L, but with more E&M applications. You'll take it. You'll be fine.",
    "If you're taking this class it is because you need to take it (whether for physics, engineering, or pre-med). It is better than the other intro labs (genchem, orgo, bio) but it will still be a grind.",
    "Take only if necessary."
