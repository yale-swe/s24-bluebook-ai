    "DS Philosophy Fall Semester is a good overview of some of the most famous philosophical texts from the early Western canon. Although it's not comprehensive, it is a good overview and will definitely pique your interest in at least some, if not all, of the reading. The seminars are a great opportunity to get close contact with esteemed professors, and the lectures are often insightful.",
    "This is one of the most important classes you can take at all. A broad overview of Western thought, very comprehensive and demanding but very rewarding. Professor Hare is the kindest professor anyone could ask for. He knows everything but is incredibly approachable and helpful.",
    "Excellent course led by an excellent professor, based on conversations with peers I believe you will understand philosophy a lot better here than in most other sections",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course. The books are riveting, and the discussions are incredibly helpful, too.",
    "I was apprehensive about DS Philosophy before starting because I had never taken a philosophy class, but it ended up being a great experience. I looked forward to class every day, and I found the readings interesting. I particularly enjoyed reading the material several months into the semester once I started to understand how to look for arguments in the text."
