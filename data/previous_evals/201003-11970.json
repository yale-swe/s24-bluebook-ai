   "comments": [
    "Yes, and take it WR section, you get to hand in ungraded first drafts! Not a ton of reading, but you'll learn the material well enough (if you actually read it).",
    "A lot of philosophy, not a lot of politics. The reading is really intense, but it's a good course to take if you want a foundation in Western political philosophy.",
    "Definitely a classic Yale class that is great to take. Covers major contributors to political thought that you want to have a grasp on even if you aren't a polysci person.",
    "PLSC 114 was an excellent course that has sparked my interesest in Yale's other political science offerings. Lectures were always interesting, and section was immensely useful and enjoyable. I would definitely recommend it to other students, especially freshmen looking for a good way to nurture their writing skills. If possible, try to get into Uday Chandra's section. You'll be grateful to have him.",
    "I would recommend this class. It is a wonderful reading list that should be mandatory for everyone. But the lectures are sometimes a bit dry, and it is very easy to get by without doing the reading, making it tempting to skip some.",
    "TAKE IT.",
    "good intro to political philosophy. a lot of reading, but good.",
    "Take this class if you want a challenge. The lectures are not really important because you can watch them online\/do the readings. However, there are three 5-6 page papers that you will need to write. While not alot of time is needed spent in actual class time, a considerable amount of time is needed when writing the essays and doing the reading. the final exam is comprehensive, so you have to keep up with your reading.",
    "This was an okay class--not outstanding but not awful either. We got to read a lot of fantastic stuff, but the material was not presented in the most interesting way, so the class sort of became a drag by the end of the semester. The sections are not the best, but Professor Smith is a pretty good lecturer. It's good to have a base of knowledge in these works if you're interested in this topic, so, although it can be a bit of a drudgery at times, I came out of the class learning a lot.",
    "Political science is a difficult course, but covers ALL the basis for famous philosophy. I feel like everybody should have a working knowledge of this coursework. I would recommend anybody to take it. Even though the essay workload can be overwhelming at times.",
    "I took this class because other than doing DS it seemed like the only way to get an overview of major political philosophers, from the ancients (Plato, Aristotle) to the slightly more modern (Machiavelli, Hobbes, Locke, Rousseau, Tocqueville). You basically spend 2 weeks on each thinker, read their most famous work(s), and then move on to the next one. Sadly we did not go into as much depth as I'm sure DSers did, but it was a solid survey course nevertheless. Professor Smith is an engaging lecturer, spices up the lectures with a few movie clips sometimes, good-humored. It's also a good way to get a writing credit if you don't want to take an English seminar - I was in a writing section and we had three 5-6 page papers, just like the non-writing sections, except that we had to turn in a rough draft for each one and get comments back. Workload was reasonable and for the most part the readings are interesting. Plus, this is the kind of material any educated person should have at least some knowledge of.",
    "Learn about the philosophies that shaped political thought for the past 2.5 thousand years.",
    "Great course! If you are interested in reading and understanding the theories of Plato, Aristotle, Machiavelli, Hobbes, Locke, Rousseau and Tocqueville, then take this course! Lectures are fantastic and work load is reasonable.",
    "I don't think that you should take this class if you are a freshmen because it will mostly blow over your head, unless you put in a lot of work, or even if you do. I think that I would have really appreciated it a LOT more if I had waited some time.",
    "i would recommend it only if you are truly willing to work hard and do the reading. it will take a lot of time on your part.",
    "Political Philosophy had a good reading list, and Professor Smith was fairly engaging in lecture. Overall a worthwhile introduction to the topic, even though I found that I was not very interested in it. Take it if you feel like you want to learn the material. Try not to fall behind on reading like I did - not fun trying to read 10 books the day before the final. The final was fair - the essay prompts were general and manageable, and the IDs were fair.",
    "A fantastic introduction to higher learning, and a useful class regardless of your interests or intentions. The reading is suitable for a course of its caliber, and the lectures do not disappoint.",
    "Read the greats and see how they connect. Very interesting and well organized course.",
    "I would summarize PLSC 114 as a brief overview of varying political thought throughout the Western world and would recommend it to a fellow student. I would caution, however, against getting behind on the readings. I did, and it made lecture and section hard to understand and contribute to - plus it meant that I spent my entire reading week catching up so that I could pass the final. Overall, the work load isn't bad - in addition to the readings you write 3 papers and take a final. That being said, make sure to get into a writing section, fewer people in the section and drafts before your final papers are due.",
    "Take this class for a nice foundation in politics (and in general). There's a lot of reading, and if you don't do it, be prepared to study a ton right before the exam, which can be a bit of a mess. Otherwise, the essays are manageable as long as you work at them.",
    "I took a lot of philosophy in high school and was familiar with a fair amount of reading already, but I had a fantastic time because of who my TF was. Section is what makes or breaks this course and what you take away at the end of it. Tatiana Neumann is great!",
    "It was a good class to introduce a freshman to Yale writing. I feel like I developed some analytical skills in writing although it is not designated a writing course. Good overall.",
    "A good introduction to political philosophy that will most likely leave you wishing the class had more time to be more comprehensive. I would recommend it, especially if you get into a WR section, because the material is interesting and relevant, and its probably one of the easier WR credits available at Yale.",
    "I didn't enjoy this class. Definitely wouldn't take as a freshman.",
    "A great overview of the great thinkers in Political Philosophy. Stay on top of the readings and you should be fine.",
    "Sure, if you need it for your major or want to be familiar with the founding of political thought--lots of must-reads for people who really want to be educated in the liberal arts. I'd say, if you're considering it, take it. If for nothing else than to be knowledgeable about some of the most important philosophers...ever.",
    "I would recommend PLSC 114 to any student who is legitimately curious about philosophy and who enjoys reading thick prose each week. The amount of work that this class involves is highly contingent upon how much reading a student actually does each week.",
    "The reading is great. The work load is manageable -- three papers (5-7) and a final (that was challenging but fair). The lectures are fine, although sometimes they get repetitive. If you want to get into a WR section make sure that you sign up for sections when they open -- I signed up 2 minutes after they opened and never made it off the waiting list. Shop around for TA's if you can-- some are really good, some not so good, and grading varies substantially between sections.",
    "Take it!",
    "Yes, take it.",
    "Take the class if you have any interest in all in why our Constitution is the way it is. The essays are fairly graded (at least for me), the readings aren't bad either, and the final is very doable.",
    "Yes. If you wanna know what other people are talking about in their conversations, you need to take this class. My advice is to always take the Writing Intensive section. The workload isn't greater but you get a chance to hand in a draft first before you hand it your final version for grading.",
    "Take it. Great intro class. Teaches you not only about the actual authors but how to read philosophical texts.",
    "YES. Everyone should read the great books before they graduate, no matter what their interests or major. This is the perfect course to explore and learn the basics of political philosophy.",
    "Definitely.",
    "Good class all around, whether you're looking for a basic political philosophy introduction or using it as a prerequisite for a major.",
    "Recommend!Great lectures! I really enjoyed going to class and listening to Professor Smith's interpretation of the philosophers we were reading. He was very engaging and interesting.3 papers, section, final. 3 papers tend to get a little stressful though. Should plan your time well with other classes, because having overlapping paper deadlines can become extremely difficult in terms of time management.",
    "For an intro Poli Phil course, definitely really engaging. However, it is NOT a philosophy course, but rather almost a literary analysis course. There is not much room for thinking of your own take on the questions presented in the reading material, but there is a lot of analysis and summary of what the viewpoints of the greats are. That, by itself, should be pretty engaging.",
    "It is a very nice course if you are eager to just have a basic knowledge of the famous thinkers.",
    "Yes! Great Polisci\/Writing credit if you manage to get into the writing sections.",
    "This a good survey class of the major works of Western political thought. The class dry was at times but it is worth taking just to be exposed to the works on the syllabus. Stephen Smith is a good lecturer and keep lecture interesting.",
    "Excellent course where you get to do great readings, listen to fascinating lectures, improve your writing through a few papers that help you understand the material better, and learn to be a better citizen.",
    "This is a great intro to political philosophy, covering the essential basics. I would definitely recommend it, because it's just good to have a basic knowledge of these works, although the lectures do get a little boring.",
    "Great intro class. I was left with the sense that there is so much more to learn, but now I have an understanding of what studying philosophy is. Professor Smith is an interesting lecturer and if you're not extremely keen on politics, keep in mind that the class is not just about regimes and government - it also addresses issues such as happiness, reason, justice and freedom.",
    "The lectures were wonderful: something funny always came up. I enjoyed going to the lectures and found Professor Smith's enthusiasm contagious. He was not monotonic about the philosophers, rather he expressed sincere interest and superior knowledge in the field. I was especially impressed by this considering that had the circumstances been otherwise (that is a boring, bland, etc. professor), then, the texts would've seemed antiquated and lifeless. Specifically, I appreciated how Professor Smith would always tie in the text currently being discussed with previous texts\/philosophers covered in class, and therefore giving you a feel of how political philosophy has progressed, changed, and influenced our modern times.",
    "I would recommend this course because it is well taught, even if the TAs are spotty, and it teaches valuable information. I felt like I learned a great deal about myself through the great thinkers. This class talks a lot about the motivations of human beings, and I found it incredibly interesting.",
    "Even though this is an introductory class, I don't know if this is the best introduction. It's a little overwhelming but you do get a taste of many philosophers. It was tough but it's one of those classes that seems better in hindsight.",
    "Great class. I advise it for people who like philosophy and are considering political science. It was a really good intro course.",
    "Great class! It was a great survey of the founding political philosophers, and lectures were all interesting as they built on one another.",
    "Take this class! Professor Smith is a very engaging lecturer that makes the reading extremely interesting. The amount of reading is manageable and very interesting if you are interested in the subject. I think this is a class that everyone should take because it traces the history of our political systems. If you can, get into a writing section! The amount of writing is not that much more than regular sections, but you get to hand in a draft paper and then hand in the rewrite which will be the only actual grade you receive.",
    "What you see during shopping is not what you will get from the class. The reading gets longer and more difficult as the semester continues. The second and third essay prompts are tougher than the first.Most sections require weekly reading responses. Despite these unpleasant surprises, it was a good class. And it can be an easy one if you don't take it too seriously. If you really want to do this class justice, though, you will need to devote a lot of time to it. Smith is the man and Tatiana Neumann (TF) is the wo-man (really sharp, good feedback on essays).",
    "This class was okay. However, your peers are a bunch of first semester freshman trying to show off their intellect and thereby justify their admission. That makes section particularly annoying.",
    "Political Science 114 is a must-take course for someone who thinks an understanding of political philosophy is in any way relevant to understanding the way the world is governed today. The reading never bogs you down, and the insights provided on the works are fairly crisp, given how old and muddled the texts are. The class is by no means exhaustive, and if you've been reading these books your whole life, then it's probably not for you, but as someone who had spent a significant amount of time with five of the works covered in this class, I found it to greatly improve my understanding of the philosophy in these works as well as their effects in practice.",
    "Really cool class, with readings that make you think and question the world around you (Machiavelli and the last 2 chapters of Tocqueville especially). Steven Smith is really good at presenting material, and makes lectures interesting. If he's still doing it, try to get Luke Mayville as your TA. The guy knows his stuff, and makes section full of interesting discussion.",
    "This is a must take. Professor Smith has a way with words and knows how to soothe his audience. He also incorporates movie clips from the Big Lebowski, the Third Man...etc... occasionally to break up lectures. Most of the students are freshmen, but I took it as a junior. Best decision of the semester.",
    "After taking this class, I have discovered I have no passion for philosophy. The reading (which you should do) is sometimes dry and hard to grasp upon the first try, and I tended to forgo the reading for that of other classes. I do, however, believe that it was a worthwhile class to take, and that everyone should have a somewhat basic understanding of the philosophers we study in class. Be prepared for a significant challenge, and try to get into a writing section if you can.",
    "Great course for those interested in the subject, perhaps too tedious for those not really interested. Smith walks a fine line between first helping you understand the readings and then analyzing them and placing them in context. For this reason, lectures are both helpful and interesting.I probably wouldn't have liked it if I wasn't really interested in the material. Don't take this if you're unsure if you like political philosophy.",
    "Yes, I recommend it.",
    "This course is basically reading 7 or 8 authors that everyone should read, so if you haven't read them, I would highly recommend this course. You get to discuss in depth what each author thought and papers are not hard to write.",
    "I personally don't like lecture based humanities courses, but it's a course worth taking if you want to fill requirements and understand the basics of political philosophy. If you havent read the texts, this course might even help shape the way you think about all politics, and potentially even about life. If you have read the texts, then it's always interesting to hear Steven Smith's interpretation of the material. MAKE SURE TO USE OFFICE HOURS AND TALK TOTHE PROFESSORS - the TAs are usually brilliant people and Smith is quite an interesting and thoughtful character.",
    "I would definitely recommend Political Science 114 to fellow students. It's a great class that all Yalies should take at some point in their career as students.",
    "The class is structured so that you go to discussion once per week and participate, then write 3 papers and have a final. If you take the class for a WR credit, then you get to write a draft for each paper before submitting your final draft. I recommend the class, though if you're not interested in the material, it can be pretty boring and arduous.",
    "take this class if you are looking for a broad overview of many political philosophy thinkers. yet, with so many works read in so little time, it is impossible to grasp more than a few basic concepts. complete synthesis and comprehension of the these works and their similarities and differences is nearly impossible. for the amount of reading done, students are left feeling confused, despite the fascinating lectures.",
    "Yes, I would recommend it to a fellow student because the course touches on the roots of politics.",
    "I highly recommend this class, but only if you intend to, and will keep up with the readings from start to finish. And read them thoroughly. Perhaps twice. There's so much to learn from the political philosophers covered. But be prepared to spend twelve hours on this course a week (you can get by using MUCH less, but you won't get anything out of it then).",
    "Do the readings for this course, otherwise there's no point in taking the class. And during lecture (which you should go to, despite the temptation not to, because otherwise, again, there's no point) I'd strongly recommend not getting anything out and just listening, or maybe just jotting down a few lines on a piece of paper. His lectures are interesting, but not really informative. They're there to provide some context and analysis of the text, and to make sure you understand the important parts, nothing more. He occasionally shows some video clips which are fun and make it a little more interesting.Of course, you could really take this class by going to the library and reading the books, but you wouldn't get the benefit of his lectures or the feedback on your essays (TAKE A WRITING SECTION).Beware of all the Pre-EP&E kids trying to assert themselves, and just the overzealous freshmen in general, because there's a lot of them.",
    "A lot of reading and exposure to different well-known political schools of thought, from the ancients to Rousseau and Tocqueville. Its a very solid foundation for a continued study of political science.",
    "Exactly what you are looking for if you are interested in getting an introductory level of understanding on the great works of political philosophy. I would recommend it to any student who is willing to read 25-50 pages of political philosophy a week, and is even in the least bit interested in these topics.",
    "Great introduction to the foundations of political philosophy, but be ready for a lot of reading and writing.",
    "Take it - the lecture format can get monotonous at times, and the material can be really dense, but it's probably the best introduction to political philosophy you'll get. Steven Smith is brilliant, even though he can get a littlespacey. Actually GO and pay attention in lecture, because a lot of the points Smith makes are very clever and can be elaborated on in your essays.",
    "Great intro political philosophy course. I was hesitant at first to take a philosophy class considering the amount of material, but trust me, if you do the readings thoroughly, you'll find it enjoyable. The thinkers on the syllabus are incredibly interesting and at times have such contrasting views that you'll definitely find that you have much to think about on your own. Professor Smith's lectures were the only lectures I found truly enjoyable this term, as he is an incredibly insightful man that really helps you attain a big picture understanding of the course. It helps that he also has a sense of humor and remains engaging throughout the term. I definitely recommend Tatiana as a TF, she is certainly one of the best. The papers and the final are definitely manageable (keep track of readings and quotes throughout the term!). Definitely a course you need to take before graduating.",
    "Steven Smith isa great professor. He makes philosophers come alive in a rather romantic way. This class is an interesting first class for someone interested in exploring what Philosophy or Political Philosophy is about. The material really made me think hard and raise questions that I wouldn't have. An Intro Philosophy class and especially political philosophy broadens your mind and is something like an intellectual rite of passage - this class does exactly that. On the down side, the readings can be a bit much and you might often find yourself lagging behind. The topics for the papers are very pedantic and are basically descriptive essays as opposed to argumentative philosophy papers. If you read the transcripts from Open Yale Courses, there's little reason why to come to lecture. This class can be as hard or easy as you want it to be - it all depends on how much you want from it.",
    "Intro Political Philosophy was fantastic--a quintessential Yale course. Smith is a great lecturer. The fundamental question asked by the course is the nature of the best regime. I liked that he included Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics because the virtuous man relates to the virtuous citizen. I also liked that we read a play by Machiavelli, which was a nice change of tone for the assignments. Grading consists of three five-six page papers, a final, and participation in section. I took the course as a Wr credit, which meant a smaller section and turning in a rough draft of my paper when the non-Wr sections turned in their final drafts. The rough draft was originally a plus because I learned what my TF was looking for in a paper; however, writing two drafts later became tedious and felt like more work. If anything though, take a Wr section so you can be with Lucas Thompson in section-- he was extremely intelligent and extremely helpful. This was the third year he was a TF for the class. Definitely take PLSC 114.",
    "This class is very interesting, it's a very good chance to get exposed to some of the most influential books ever written. You'll need to do the readings every week and think about them but it's worth it. I would recommend this course to other students if they're interested in reading books like Machiavelli's The Prince and thinking about their content.",
    "Lots of reading but interesting.",
    "It's a basic introduction to the big political thinkers from Plato to Tocqueville and their ideas. Anyone slightly interested in the ideas, thinkers, politics or humanities in general should take the class. One learns so much more about their actual ideas from engaging the texts and learning from a great professor.",
    "Definitely! Professor Smith's lectures are great: most of them are basically 50-minute interpretive essays on the texts. He also has a dry wit that is pretty fun if you're keen to it. Grading in the class is not to harsh, so it shouldn't be tough, even for non-majors. The reading is easy to stay on top of because Smith chooses limited selections from the texts. In content, I'd say the best way to think of it is as the study of political literature, rather than the study of philosophy per se. Most of the essays we wrote were more like English essays that took one of our texts as the subjects than a straightahead philosophy piece, which was actually pretty refreshing to write if you are a student of philosophy.",
    "PLSC 114 is an excellent introductory course on Political Philosophy! Professor Smith is an absolutely fabulous lecturer! Although the workload and reading assignments aren't that much and don't exceed what is expected in other courses, comprehending and analyzing the material can be quite difficult if you don't take time and keep up with the course. If you think you'd be interested in political science of political philosophy, definitely take this course, but do so with the knowledge that you must put in a significant amount of effort each week to understand the material and recieve a good grade. Also, my writing improved significantly after taking this course even though I was not in a writing section. Unless you need a writing credit, I would skip the WR sections entirely. Overall, this was a fantastic course taught by a fantastic teacher!",
    "This course serves as a survey of the major thinkers in the history of political philosophy. If the reading list interests you, take the course, for the lectures, sections, and essays do a great job of fostering your understanding of these texts. If the reading list does not interest you, don't take the class.",
    "I would cautiously recommend PLSC 114 to a fellow student. I think this is crucial, basic material and that Professor Smith has a lot of brilliant things to say about it. My biggest complaint is about the volume of reading: it is not only difficult to keep up with, but also unfulfilling because so little time is spent on each work.",
    "Recommend, but not completely necessary. If you're more interested in something else, then take that class. If you want to learn about some great political philosophy books, this class goes above and beyond.",
    "Introduction to Political Philosophy is a BROAD overview of political philosophy. Don't expect to leave with more than a general, rather vague understanding of each of the authors. Prof Smith's lectures are engaging, especially if you are up-to-date with the readings!",
    "You study classic political philosophy from Aristotle to Machiavelli to Tocqueville. It can be very boring, but it can also be very interesting. You should take this class if you have the time to read the texts and like to self-reflect on philosophy like this.",
    "I think that everyone leaving Yale should take a course on Political Philosophy. The works of Plato, Machiavelli, and Hobbes are essential for any budding intellectual and scholar. I assure everyone that you will learn and enjoy Professor Smith's class a good deal.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone who wants to have a strong basis for political thought and theory. Discussing the core values of politics including equality, good citizenship, the ideal regime or human nature is essential to understand society and humanity at large.",
    "Ideal for those who want an introduction to Western philosophy. Smith does a good job of keeping it accessible to those for whom it will be their sole philosophy class while also discussing material that will keep more philosophically oriented students engaged. The reading and workload is quite manageable.",
    "This was a fascinating course with an extensive but entertaining reading list. I would suggest to any student. Especially one with an interest in philosophy, political science, or law."
