Our class had people from architecture, the art school, computer programming, a grad student from FES - in fact none of us were film students. There was a wide range of skills and interests and we all were able to work at our own pace on projects that were interesting and important to us as individuals.",
    "This course is a great way to engage with experimental forms of video\/internet art and more - definitely gives you the opportunity to work conceptually in a way that traditional filmmaking classes don't"
