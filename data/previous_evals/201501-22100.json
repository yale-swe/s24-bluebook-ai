    "ABSOLUTELY TAKE THIS CLASS NOW. Before Professor Connor has to leave! He is one of the smartest people (certainly cinephiles) you'll ever meet, and every conversation teaches you something about movies. You will work hard in this course; he has high expectations and pushes you in your questioning and analysis. The final paper is long and challenging in how open ended it is, so expect that from the beginning. But he's also super supportive and great to meet with. You'll watch an interesting range of movies and then have class discussions that reveal aspects of them you totally missed. The diary entries aren't a walk in the park, but you'll want to improve to live up to the high bar set by Professor Connor, and you will get there eventually. If you're reading this, he hasn't left yet, so you've still got time to make a great decision. Take it!",
    "Weekly seminar discussion centered on a student's presentation on a particular film of a particular semester-long theme. This time it was trains. It's been water and red before. Really up to JD. For the latter half of class he blends the student presentation into his two cents on that film\/its history\/history in general.",
    "It's a must-take for film studies majors, but that doesn't mean that every major will enjoy it. If you're more into the production side of film rather than the theory, this class may prove to be exceedingly difficult (like for me), especially if you don't have enough time to dedicate your best analysis to each film you watch. Do succeed you need to have a knack for detailed analysis or at least have the patience to build up to that, and many\/most people just do not.",
    "Only if you have to take it. It's ok but there are much better film courses that are probably more specialized to your interests."
