    "I recommend this class to anyone who has read classical Chinese a little before (or has read Mandarin or classical Japanese literature) and wants to learn about it more. In the first half of this class youll learn many characters and grammar rules as if you are learning a new modern language (knowing Mandarin certainly helps, but obviously many aspects of classical Chinese is different from Mandarin). In the second half, youll read and translate bunch of challenging but interesting texts. I found the translation exercises especially challenging, but every single text was enjoyable to read (I liked Zhuangzi the best). At the end of the semester you'll be able to look at a classical Chinese text and translate it to English without any textbook.",
    "Graded more harshly than average but worthwhile.",
    "Introduction to reading and translating Literary Chinese, provides foundational vocabulary and grammar structures, as well as the tools and ways of understanding, thinking about, and translating the language. Allows you to by the end translate (with difficulty) unfamiliar Literary Chinese texts."
