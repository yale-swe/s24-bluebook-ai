    "I would highly recommend this class. If you're looking for in depth readings of secondary literature or literary criticism combined with a theoretical approach to the texts (as I partially expected), that's not what you're going to get. However, if you're willing to entertain an approach to the topic that's a little more oblique or subtle, I think you will find yourself duly rewarded, and probably walking away with greater insights than you would have in the class you expected.",
    "Though the title of the course is a little dubious--aside from the opening lecture, the course never put forward a clear thesis on what \"Literary Ethics\" actually meant--the writers (Dinesen, Sebald) were appropriate, and compelling in the company of each other.Carol Jacobs reads texts in a way I wish more teachers practiced. In the classroom, she keeps a close reign, but I come away from each class always certain I haven't wasted my time.Writing papers is a wonderful experience. Instead of the puny attempts at simulating \"real\" criticism which are often required of Yale undergraduates, Jacobs is more interested in an attentive reading that stays withing the boundaries of the text. The result of her expectations--which are important to know before you take one of her classes--is a sense of freedom when one sits down to write, and a corresponding sense of having actually done something new when the paper is finished.",
    "Take this sheerly to discover Dinesen and Sebold. I absolutely LOVE both of them now, and I had little clue who either was before the course began!",
    "Lots and lots of close reading. Don't take it unless you like Dinesen and Sebald. Also, I think you're expected to do a certain amount of outside work, without which you will get less out of the class."
