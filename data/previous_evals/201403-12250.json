   "comments": [
    "This was a thorough and fair class. Tests were straightforward. The lecture material was communicated well, and the professor really cares about helping us engage in the subject material. As someone who was not a psych major, I found myself able to follow everything and earn--really earn--a science credit.",
    "Yes. PSYC is not a gut, but it is not hard. It's a challenge but super interesting and if you put in the time, you will do well.",
    "do not take this class. i dropped this class. nothing makes any sense, the lectures do not match the readings and then you get to the tests and they are so unexpectedly hard. also very depressing material, it really starts to wear on you. lecture is so so so so boring.",
    "I would recommend this class to psychology majors because it is an interesting course about mental disorders.",
    "It takes a while for the class to get interesting, but the second half of the semester is really good. If you just want any ol' science credit, there are probably easier ways, though if you are inclined towards psychology, I can see this being interesting.",
    "DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS. Do anything else to get your science credit.",
    "Psyc 147 is a course where you learn about different animal models that are used to induce the symptoms of disorders like depression, anxiety, addiction, schizophrenia, Parkinson's, and Alzheimer's, and about how these models are used to find different ways to treat patients with these disorders. Given that many of the disorders we cover are of a psychological nature, it's interesting to see what behavioral measures scientists look for as indications of the presence of these disorders in animals. It was also very insightful to learn about the different physiological mechanisms of these disorders and how research using animal models allows us to uncover these mechanisms and treat these disorders. I would definitely recommend this course to another student!! Not only did I find the material extremely interesting, but I also loved Professor Donegan and his way of explaining the material in a relatable and practical way. Professor Donegan is very open to questions, is very approachable and has a genuine interesting in teaching the material. Just make sure you study your class notes, and the PowerPoints and Notes posted online and know the material VERY well for tests because the level of detail can be pretty demanding. You definitely learn a lot by the end of the course though so I'd definitely recommend it!! I loved the class!!",
    "Psyc 147 is a class that will challenge you with alot of information but in the end you will come out knowing so much about different psychological disorders and how the effect the brain and how treatments are created to reverse of stop these effects. These disease are common among people so knowing the science behind them is pretty interesting and applicable.",
    "This is a very good science credit for non-science people. It is interesting, discusses drugs and the brain, but without going to far in depth. It is accessible to someone who has never done science before. If you're looking for a class that's similar to the Human Brain or Drugs, Brain, and Behavior, but is easier, then definitely take this class!",
    "It is a class in which students can learn a lot about methodological approaches to using animals models to accurately represent humans with drug addiction, schizophrenia, depression, Parkinson's, and Alzheimer's.The exams, however, are very nuanced and quite difficult. The point distribution is also a bit puzzling and unnerving. Many times, a multiple choice question will be worth 6 points while some other questions that require writing a short answer are sometimes worth only 3, so it's a bit unbalanced.",
    "Very interesting course, definitely worth taking if you have any interest in clinical psychology, medicine, pharmacology, or in how clinical animal model studies are run. That being said, the course is also accessible to pretty much anyone, although it would probably help to have a bit of background in psychology and\/or biology. Material is not terribly difficult, exams are usually quite fair with a few tricky or oddly specific little questions thrown in (as seems to be typical of psych courses), and although the course includes a 20-minute \"pre-test,\" two exams, a 10-page research paper and a final exam, essentially no other work is required, there's no section, and reading tends to be light\/minimal (no textbook). Would strongly recommend to psych majors or anyone interested in learning more about psychiatric\/neurological disorders in general.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who is interested in clinical disorders, and the mechanisms behind them. In addition, more clinical\/behavioral therapy inclined psychology majors who are looking to fulfill a science credit, this might be the course for you. This is also good for those looking for a science credit with small day-to-day workload, but expect to put in some work for the exams and the paper.",
    "Learn about various clinical disorders (its symptoms, treatments for them) and analyze manners that animal models can resemble such clinical disorder symptoms.",
    "If you aren't interested in mental disorders, don't take this class. Also, there is a great deal of neuroscience covered. If you're looking for a gut science, this isn't for you (there's a final and a 10-page paper at the end of the semester).",
    "I liked this class. Everything was pretty understandable especially once the professor put out his slide notes. The professor was clear and pretty organized and the material was interesting. Test were fair and there was 1 10 page paper which could have used a little for instruction. I would recommend it for a science class.",
    "This is definitely a great course for someone looking for the most science-y social science!",
    "Good course to gain knowledge on some of the basic neuroscience behind clinical disorders. Not a gut class for a science credit, be prepared to study the material in-depth.",
    "I would not recommend this class. There are much better psych classes. Take human brain for the science credit instead. The teacher is very monotone.",
    "If you're interesting in the underlying biological mechanisms behind mental disorders or recreational drugs then definitely take this class.",
    "I would characterize Animal Models of Clinical Disorders as a course that seeks to explain mental illness in terms of structural and biochemical processes occurring at the cellular and organ levels. The class covers the psychology and biology of drug addiction, specific phobias, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, schizophrenia, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, Parkinsons disease, and Alzheimers disease. Most lectures examine experimental studies in animal models or humans that seek to increase our understanding of mental disorders or test novel treatment approaches. Introductory courses in biology, chemistry, and psychology may make this course easier for you, but they certainly not necessary to succeed. Prof. Donegan does a good job of ensuring that the material is accessible to students who have taken only high-school science courses and who have no background in psychology. I would definitely recommend this course to any student who is interested in attaining a better understanding of the neurological and biochemical mechanisms that underlie a variety of mental illnesses. I thought it was interesting to see how in several cases, researchers took a mental disorder in humans, recapitulated the symptomology in animals, and then used that animal model to obtain new information about the disease as it occurs in humans. Prof. Donegan is a great lecturer who provides detailed online notes to supplement his in-class presentations, and he is very accessible through office hours.",
    "great class for a psychology major, more neuroscience-based than I expected but interesting content, someone who is not interested in psychology might find it dry, but as a psych major, I liked it"
