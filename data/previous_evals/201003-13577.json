   "comments": [
    "This was a fantastic class. We learned the canonical literature on state-building, read some relatively recent works on the subject, and also applied it to current issues. It requires a good amount of work, but it definitely illuminated some of the challenges of state-building in the modern era.",
    "The course is great. Take it if you are interested in attaining a grasp towards the function of the seminar. Anyone interested in the concept of the state should take this course because it will give you the opportunity to view the state through an amazing gamut of lenses.",
    "Good material, great professor, but make sure to shop the other people in your class, because they can make or break it.",
    "Good class if you like theoretical stuff, not so good if you don't. Professor Darden is a good teacher. It's a lot of reading though, and the final paper is very self-guided.",
    "Recommended if you're interested in the question of how to create states in the modern world. Does not spend much time questioning the premise of state-building. Good, interesting seminar.",
    "This is one of the best courses I've taken at Yale. The material is fascinating and really makes you look at state power in a different way. It is a particularly good counterbalance to philosophy courses that focus on how to limit state power and protect rights. I looked forward to the readings each week, and found all of them worth while. The final paper was long, but it was very fun to write and research. Overall, I HIGHLY recommend that everyone take this course, particularly those who have taken philosophy courses on the normative nature of state power.",
    "Amazing seminar with a very smart teacher.",
    "Would definitely recommend Darden's classes.",
    "A lot of reading but a really good profoessor and intellectually stimulating seminars with people who are likely going to end up working directly in this area. Take this course.",
    "If you can commit to doing most of the readings (hopefully ALL), then you will get so much out of this class. Best of all, the categorical way in which the class is structured makes it easy to apply to other courses in similar fields.",
    "A very interesting class that provides a different viewpoint than most other classes, and in today's world environment a must-take. The reading can get to be a bit much, but Darden is a very good professor and the 2 hours never failed to be interesting. Discussions were mostly student led, with Darden simply guiding it in a certain direction, and picking the topic (and readings) for the week. The final paper, and the assignments leading up to it, were well structured enough to make it fairly easy to organize and complete in the end."
