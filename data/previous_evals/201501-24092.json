    "Great course. If you have any interest in doing research, take it!",
    "We went to Patagonia and collected samples and learned how to analyze them.",
    "This class is based on field work done on a trip taken outside of the academic school year, and the class primarily consists of conducting a research project on samples and data collected in the field. You do meet like a normal class, but such meetings are less like a classroom-setting and more like a lab meeting: you discuss with the team each other's projects, as well as topics relevant to the region you visited or the data you all collected. No homework per se, but that's because you are expected to work on your project outside of class. I probably spent about 4 hours every week on this work, sometimes less, but certainly never more than 6. Plus, you'll probably enjoy the work since you do have some say over what kind of research you do. This class is a great way to learn valuable skills and be get some experience under your belt of conducting real geologic research. As a geology major at Yale, this is truly a class you cannot miss out on.",
    "Yes, this course is a great opportunity to get field and research experience."
