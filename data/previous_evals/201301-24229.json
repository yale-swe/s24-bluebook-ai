    "Prof. Xi Chen is new and I think he did a good job for being new, but I do think that he should gradually make this class his own and fell a bit more comfortable",
    "I liked the content and the idea of the course but really was hoping for something more applicable to health management.",
    "There were many elements to this course, each of which I thought was helpful, but I did feel that it was slightly disjointed. The course started out with lectures on survey design, which was great because we were in the process of designing our own surveys. Then, we moved away from actual study methods and it felt more like a statistics course; in fact, we went over topics that we had covered or were covering in biostats. I would have loved to learn more about the actual experience of doing research rather than just focusing on analyzing data.I thought the group project was really good. I think it is very enlightening to go from designing a survey to recruiting respondents to cleaning the data, analyzing it, and synthesizing results. However, I actually feel that rather than having a group project and individual proposal, it would be more helpful if each individual did the group project themselves. Though I was involved in each part of the group project, I would have gotten more out of it if I had done it alone.I thought the homework assignments were very challenging, and relied heavily on the TAs for help. The TAs and Professor Chen were all extremely willing to help.",
    "This course was very challenging. The material was difficult and I had trouble understanding the material in class lectures.The assignments were also very difficult and sometimes a little ambiguous.While the grading on the assignments and quizes was very fair, I never felt like I had an adequate handle on the material - not for lack of time spent attempting to learn it.I think this course needs to be revamped. Many slides are ambiguous and difficult to understand. Furthermore, some of the material seems a little technical for someone in management and policy.",
    "It would be good if the application part is larger ( ie. more sample data we go through in class and read results for, a little less coding and more methodology explained with examples) It would be good to be more example based!",
    "Great class, just too much work (I got sick of the classmate complaints and general destruction due to the 6 problem sets, two exams, group presentation, group paper, and individual paper).",
    "WAY TOO MANY ASSIGNMENTS. We had a lab due every week, a group project that was continuous throughout the semester, 2 in-class exams, a group paper, a group presentation, and a final individual paper. I don't understand why all of these assignments were necessary. The amount of material that we learned was maybe enough for the two in-class exams and one final project.",
    "It is an important course. However, some details should be improved. Issues with lab-space should necessarily be resolved for future courses.",
    "Good overview of survey methods and statistical techniques. SAS could have been more challenging, but the weekly homework questions were helpful. The group project was fun.",
    "Overall, this was a fine course. I think is succumbs to some of the same problems that general statistics courses here seem to struggle with - and that is, poor instruction regarding SAS mechanics. Other than that, though, it was clearly designed purposefully, and I learned more than I thought I would. Some of the scheduling\/timing issues were annoying - the lab, for example, was pretty much a waste of time. There was no helpful SAS instruction, and instead we all pretty much wasted an hour each week. The pacing of the class could be improved upon, too - the group assignment, for example, dragged on more than necessary, and the individual assignment felt rushed.",
    "good",
    ".",
    "I'm really disappointed in this course. I think it's a very important topic to learn and I believe that's why it's a core requirement, but I honestly don't feel as though I learned much from it. I don't think this is because of Xi Chen's instruction, I'm disappointed in the YSPH administration and faculty for not providing enough guidance to a new teacher, because the one's who suffer are the students - who are also the ones paying thousands of dollars in tuition money to take this class. There are other classes that I would have preferred to take this semester that would have been more applicable to my career goals, but could not because they conflicted with the time of this course. This makes this whole situation even more upsetting. The faculty and administration need to completely re-design this course next year, because from what I'm hearing from the second years, this course was not that useful to them last year either. It would be a shame if another class of policy and management students were forced to take a class that they didn't take much from.Aside from the actual teaching, logistically this class seemed disorganized. For example, there was only one lab section (on a Thursday afternoon!) and 30 something kids had to cram into one of the computer labs in the basement of 47. Being stuffed into a small room on a Thursday afternoon, after you are tired from the week is not conducive to learning.",
    "This class is very useful for us to apply biostatistic concepts to solve real problems. Although I felt that Biostats 2 is a little bit redundant with this one. It would be great just to take methods and not biostats2.",
    "Strengths -- TAs and their knowledge of SAS, ability to breakdown homework questions and instruct on how to interpret SAS output; professor was very responsive and available to answer questionsWeaknesses -- that it is not akin to the Data Analytics course that our non-policy and management counterparts take; the instruction was too high-level for many students -- too full of technical jargon and not broken down enough for students to make sense of the differences between regression types without having to filter through unnecessary details (e.g., in Lecture 5, slides 12 and 13 highlight 4 types of logarithmic transformations though we had only learned and needed to know 2 -- such inclusions of extraneous information made it difficult to reflect on what was learned and what we needed to know without directly asking for TA assistance. This is one example of many such instances); the didactic lectures were entirely separate from the SAS lab instruction and often times didn't build off of each other, making it even more difficult to make sense of the different regression types; within 1 week of realizing that there were not enough seats in the SAS lab for the entire class, the lab should have been split up into 2 45-minute lab sessions so that everyone had an opportunity to sit at a computer and learn along with the TAs -- the absence of this quickly resulted in lab sessions feeling like a joke; the TAs mostly did not attend lecture when, if they had, one could hope they could advocate on behalf of the students for different, clearer approaches to teaching the lecture material; the individual paper assignment was poorly placed at the very end of the term given the volumes of work and time devoted to the semester-long group project; the timeline of the semester-long project was too rigid and detailed in how it was laid out to students; no assigned TAs.",
    "great",
    "This course was extremely difficult in relation to biostats. It was my least favorite class all year, to those students who did not do well in the biostats arena this class was extremely difficult and frustrating",
    "Overall, this course had a fairly good organization - the class material was well integrated with the material in the labs and the material in the projects. The labs were instructive - challenging, but not overly so, and informative. The projects were interesting - creating survey questions, analyzing them with SAS programming, and writing this up as well as a making a powerpoint presentation - giving an overall \"mini\"-research experience.However, the lectures were not well taught. The material was presented in a very dry and academic way and not well explained.Doing the survey project as a group came with the problems that a group brings - some members of the group did very little and others did a lot, and the quality of the whole project was brought down by those members who did poor quality work. This is always frustrating for those who work hard and want to produce good quality work.",
    "not bad",
    "This course does a pretty good job of covering the statistical basics and keeping it interesting. The lab assignments were great, although the big group project at the end was not as interesting or helpful, perhaps because the assignment was so broad or because the course didnt fully equip us to really do a properly rigorous analysis of the data, where were themselves problematic.",
    "Power points should be more clearExpectation of course were unclearSAS should be taught in the lab in smaller sections instead of the entire class",
    "The regression project should be an individual effort."

    "Instructor: Xi Chen \u00a0He's great..i see that he's really trying..i know that a lot of students may complain about him, but I really think that material is not that cohesive to begin with.",
    "Instructor: Xi Chen \u00a0Great job on your first year! Well done. Maybe be a little more sensitive to students timing, but overall well done.",
    "Instructor: Xi Chen \u00a0It was clear that Professor Chen cared about our experience in the course and was extremely helpful whenever we had questions. Professor Chen knows a great deal about the topic. Sometimes it was hard to relate to the examples that he used since I do not have a background in labor economics, but I thought the health examples he used were very helpful. Professor Chen was very interested in our feedback, which I appreciated. We had many questions before the first quiz and he used most of a whole class to answer our questions. Moreover, he asked us for mid-semester feedback, which I really appreciated.",
    "Instructor: Xi Chen \u00a0Dr. Chen was extremely nice and responsive throughout the semester. Some of the difficulties with the course are not an indictment on him as a professor. He is certainly very knowledgable. Unfortunately it was quite difficult to understand sometimes. It seemed that the ability to communicate questions and answers in class was lacking. Additionally, by virtue of the fact that the subject matter was difficult, this lack of adequatecommunication made it more challenging.",
    "Instructor: Xi Chen \u00a0The instructor is really good, and he is very helpful if you have questions or need him to elaborate. He also gives some examples that are relavent and suggestions on further reading.",
    "Instructor: Xi Chen \u00a0Despite language hurdles, Xi worked very hard to make sure students understood the material.",
    "Instructor: Xi Chen \u00a0He's absolutely brilliant and a lovely person, but he was not the best at teaching difficult material to people who were brand new to the subject. Let him teach PhD students only!",
    "Instructor: Xi Chen \u00a0Very hard to understand in lecture, slides were often unclear and poorly structured, directions for assignments were confusing and had to be explained multiple times. The topics in this course were advanced. It is hard to understand them and even harder to understand them in heavily accented English.",
    "Instructor: Xi Chen \u00a0Very patient. The attitude of some of the students didn't help...Try and perfect accent. But otherwise very helpful.",
    "Instructor: Xi Chen \u00a0First time teaching. So I can understand why he might be a bit uncomfortable at times. Needs to ensure that he's listening to student questions before answering. Sometimes misses the question and that can be frustrating.",
    "Instructor: Xi Chen \u00a0I really like Dr. Chen, and find him to be personable, dedicated, and quite an adept teacher. He handles the class well, in spite of being new.",
    "Instructor: Xi Chen \u00a0good",
    "Instructor: Xi Chen \u00a0Strength - knowledge of content.Weaknesses - poor delivery of material, difficulty with lab time\/space coordination",
    "Instructor: Xi Chen \u00a0I think Xi Chen is very smart and competent. He is also very willing to listen to students suggestions and quick to answer questions, which I appreciate very much. I think he needs a few more classes of teaching experience though. Some things to improve on: 1) format, layout and presentation of class power points. There was often just too much information on the slides - it was overwhelming at times. 2) Use more real life examples. That's when I learned the best, when you used something that I could apply to a real life situation. 3) There were times when you sped through lectures, and even when you would ask us if we had any questions, I think some of us were so lost, we didn't even know where to begin in asking a question. 4) Make the homeworks more clear. The 6 homework assignments we had were all pretty much a struggle for a lot of the kids in the class, not even because the material was always difficult, but because the instructions were unclear.",
    "Instructor: Xi Chen \u00a0Prof. Chen is so awesome! And he truly cares about the success of every students and he always goes out of the way to help you. No matter it's explain more in class or during office hour or replying to your email questions right away. I was really inspired by him and his positive attitude.",
    "Instructor: Xi Chen \u00a0Strengths -- attentiveness to students' questions and some level of flexibility in responding to students' scheduling limitations (e.g., extending due date of final individual paper by 2 days)Weaknesses -- instruction was too high-level for this somewhat intro-level course, particularly considering that many students were also taking intro to biostatistics at the same time (effort should have been made to better align course material with what was being learned in biostatistics); examples used when answering student questions were too high-level to make sense and oftentimes didn't have visuals to accompany them; much of the things taught in lecture would have been much more easily learned if accompanied by tangible examples that students could see being created (e.g., after teaching the concept, give students an example, open SAS, create the programming together, and then lecture on the important things to see in the output).",
    "Instructor: Xi Chen \u00a0great",
    "Instructor: Xi Chen \u00a0The instructor is very knowledgable however assigned way too much work and often delved into sas methods that were over the head of most of the students, not very clearly defined to students",
    "Instructor: Xi Chen \u00a0Dr. Chen is clearly very knowledgeable in this area. He appeared enthusiastic about and motivated to teach this course. He is very nice and wanted to help students learn. He was also approachable and available. So, in many ways he was a good teacher.However, Dr. Chen did not do a very good job of explaining the material in the lectures. The lectures were dry and academic and not explained well. For the future, I recommend that Dr. Chen present his lectures in this course to colleagues on the faculty and to graduate students to get feedback on how to better present the material to maximize the understanding of the material. In addition, the language was sometimes a problem - this will likely get better over time as Dr. Chen gains more experience with English.",
    "Instructor: Xi Chen \u00a0okay. had a little trouble communicating with students. very nice. seemed smart.",
    "Instructor: Xi Chen \u00a0Professor Chen was clear and easy to understand even when talking about a fairly difficult and abstract concept.",
