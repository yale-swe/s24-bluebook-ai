    "Yes definitely, interesting content and it felt important\/urgent",
    "I would recommend this course if you are interested in the theory and practice of democracy, can get through often-dense theory, and enjoy actually participating and contributing to changes in the class structure (prof. Landemore is open to suggestions and apparently changes her class every semester).",
    "I recommend this course. Great opportunity to think critically about American government and government structures in general. The readings challenged many of my previously held beliefs about what democracy looks like. The concepts of lottery systems, constitutional revision, and cognitive diversity were particularly exciting to learn about. Professor Landemore is engaging and passionate, and her expertise is evident.",
    "In terms of approach, PLSC 308 is a contemporary political theory course. That means you'll be looking at events and practices from the last ~40 years or so and comparing them to democratic ideals set out in classical texts. In terms of content, PSLC 308 teaches you about global movements that seek or have sought to provide a sense of collective agency to citizens of representative democracies. If you vibe with John Dewey, Hannah Arendt, or our own Prof Benhabib, you will probably enjoy this course. You will be at one of the discipline's theoretical frontiers and you will have an awesome guide (Professor Landemore). The spirit of the course was my favorite part. Read the syllabus and read some of Prof Landemore's papers and you'll get a sense of where she is coming from. If anything piques your interest, definitely shop the class.",
    "A study of democratic political systems which draws theory from ancient philosophers to modern day cooperatives. It was very interesting and not a tremendous amount of work."
