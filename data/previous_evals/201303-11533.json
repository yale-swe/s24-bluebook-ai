    "If you're a math-oriented person, take MATH244 instead. 202 is a whirlwind overview of a huge number of topics in discrete math, and it's hard to learn anything in detail. If you're not as interested in math, you CAN get away with taking 202, but hold on for the ride. Aspnes is a really fun lecturer and makes lots of jokes, but many of the students in my class (not including me) felt that he jumped around and lost his place in the lecture to such an extent that they couldn't learn anything. On the other hand, an upside is that the class requires minimal work. Weekly problem sets took me between 20 and 30 minutes, and the two tests were significantly easierthan expected.",
    "Don't take it unless you need to for the CS major. Attend the Zoo office hours and be sure you absorb all the material in the lecture notes.",
    "Yes if you do not have a math background!",
    "Meh. By no means an exciting course, especially if you already have some discrete math background. If you don't, you may struggle with some of the proofs. I went to office hours for help on the problem set just about every week, not (always) because I couldn't have completed it otherwise, but mostly to expedite the process. Aspnes is a good teacher though.",
    "The course is meant to be a glimpse at a LOT of different topics. The downside is that we never spend more than 1 or 2 lectures on a given topic. For example, we spent two lectures on Linear Algebra, which is enough to give you a small taste of it, but not to really get a good understanding of the topic. Because there are so many topics to cover, the class moves VERY quickly and it's hard to keep up with what the professor is saying in lecture. The assignments are also fairly tricky, and get harder as the semester goes on. You quickly learn that you have to go to office hours to finish the problem sets, which is annoying because everyone is just being spoon-fed all the answers, so the grades on the homeworks don't really distinguish between any students.",
    "After the first few lectures, this course proved to be very difficult for me. The lessons had useful content, but proofs and examples were sometimes skimmed over so that I had very little idea of what I was actually doing once I started working on the homeworks. Professor Aspnes is very good at holding students' attention with his dynamic lecturing style and entertaining sense of humor, but helping us understand the material proved to be more difficult for him. He moved very fast during most lectures, so that it was hard for me to write quickly enough to get everything down on paper, let alone understand it. I would sometimes leave lectures feeling dazed and confused. Since this is a required class for my major, this was a real problem, and Jerrod Ankenman's office hours saved me. After gaining a basic understanding of each problem, I was generally able to finish solving it on my own. I really Long story short, it was not until long after each unit that I was able to partially or fully understand it well enough to apply it on the exams. Thus I did well on the final, but rather badly on the first exam (though the final might have also been slightly less difficult in general than the first exam).",
    "This class is not as difficult as it may seem. The homework can be very challenging, however its is graded very easily and you can easily get answers from the TAs or another student. Also, even though a ton of complex and confusing material is covered in lecture, you are only tested on a small portion of it. You don't need to know any of the derivations for any of the theorems, which is 80% of what we do in lecture, just need to know what the theorems say and how to use them. Its still helpful to go to lecture though, because the online notes cover a ton of stuff that you absolutely do not need to know. You don't need to pay much attention in lecture though or take good notes, just copy down the theorems and the main points discussed. Most people got perfect scores on the hw at the end and high scores on the midterms. Everything is graded very easily.",
    "Even after completing this course, I feel that I still know nothing about math for computer scientists. The material was confusing and overall I'm just happy to be done with this class. I wouldn't recommend this course to another student unless it is required for his\/her major.",
    "A lot easier than 244. Take it cuz you have to for the cs major.",
    "This course was not at all accessible to me, as someone who does not have a strong math background. Way too much material was covered in way too little depth. In a few months I will probably have forgotten most of the material that I learned.",
    "If it is required, take it. If not, don't take it.",
    "Beyond confusing lectures, thank god there are online notes. Go to office hours because the psets are impossible otherwise.",
    "I would not recommend it however you have to take it to complete Computer Science at Yale. I learned a lot about proving things, but I don't feel confident in my proof abilities.",
    "Eh...",
    "The worst class I've ever taken in my Yale career, which is a shame since it's a requirement for the major. It's poorly taught and organized, but take advantage of office hours with TAs and Aspnes's \"textbook.\" Make friends in the class, and best of luck.",
    "Take only if Computer Science major.",
    "Don't take it if you're not a computer science major, obviously. Lectures make no sense, and psets are very hard. Midterm and final aren't too bad, though. However, everyone did well on the psets because they'd go to the TAs before and essentially get the answers, so the midterm\/final probably will end up determining the grades because the class is graded on a curve, which is annoying.",
    "This class is tricky because all of the problem sets are just proofs. There does not seem to be a hard and fast standard about what these proofs should look like, which makes it somewhat unclear what grade you'll receive until you get them back.If you can take this class credit\/D, I would recommend it since it's very easy to do okay but hard to get an A.",
    "It's a required course but I would recommend 244.",
    "You have to take it for the major... don't take it if you don't have to.",
    "I would recommend this class. It's generally a good class that covers a lot of interesting and useful topics. If you have trouble understanding the professor's lectures, read the notes instead. The professor writes very good notes.",
    "I would not recommend this class unless you must take it for the CS\/EECS major. If at all possible, I would recommend MATH 244 as a substitute. I took LING 224 the previous semester and EENG 202 concurrently, and found that there was no new information presented. If you have a background in formal logic and proofs, you will be astonished by the redundancy of the material. Lectures were difficult to follow and the posted notes were incomplete. The entire class relied on TF office hours to complete the psets. The exams weren't bad, except that it felt like there was no way to prepare for them.Good luck.",
    "Great survey of the math related to CS. Did a good job at giving us a basic familiarity with many branches of math, from graph theory to probability to set theory to fields. Homework seems very easy at first but gets harder. Talk to the TAs and you'll understand the material much better (and get much better grades). Exams problems are like easy homework problems, and don't require much studying if you understood all of the homework. No textbooks required, just a giant PDF document he updates with all you need to know. Also Aspnes is great! His stories are so much fun.",
    "At its core, I don't think this is a hard class concept-wise, but it's execution leaves much to be desired. If you aren't very strong at constructing proofs, this class won't really improve your skills except through trial-and-error, or on your own.",
    "This dude pretty much hit the nail on the head, with a few alterations.Lectures don't make any sense, and Professor Aspnes, though entertaining, is terrible at teaching and explaining things. The problem sets are designed so that only absolute geniuses can do them without the help of a TA [well they weren't THAT hard, but the grading was harsh enough that you had to go to the TA's to get a good grade, so everyone did]. This sucked because it meant that the entire class bombed the first two, and then everyone started going to office hours and everyone got 100s on every other problem set because people were so lost that the TAs basically had to spoonfeed us the answers. So the curvesucked because everyone got 100s every time [YUP]. Also, this class calls itself \"Math for CS,\" but really it's just super abstract math. When in computer science are you going to need to prove the existence of natural numbers? I'm pretty sure you and any computer you'll ever use already believe in natural numbers. All of the math that could be useful for CS (linear algebra, graph theory), was covered too abstractly or too quickly to be of any use. I learned more \"linear algebra\" doing matrices in high school pre-calc, and we talked about graph theory for less than one lecture. You basically don't learn how to solve practical problems in this class at all.My advice:-Only take this class if you have to, or if you're naturally REALLY good at abstract math and enjoy it a lot.-If you take this class, go to office hours FOR EVERY SINGLE ASSIGNMENT, and be thorough so you know you'll get 100s on every pset. That means you'll have a few extra 100s before eveyone else in the class catches onto the fact that psets are impossible without help, and you'll be ahead of the curve.-When studying for exams, use Aspnes's online notes. They are infinitely more helpful than his lectures. [But I'd suggesting searching topics online. Most other colleges have online notes that are infinitely more helpful than Aspnes's]",
    "Chance are, you are taking this class because you have to for the Computer Science major. If you don't have to take this class, please don't. It's easier than the Math 244 counterpart, but still frustratingly difficult because it's not well taught. Make sure to go to office hours to do the problem sets, and make sure your proofs are rigorous because some TAs care too much about minor details. After the midterm, everyone starts going to office hours and getting full mark on their problem sets. You should make sure you get full marks on your initial problem sets to stay ahead of the curve.",
    "A decent course overall, but don't expect to understand what's going on in the lecture. The teaching method is mainly based on demonstrating proofs of important concepts, but you're not expected to know how to reproduce most of them. I would say that most of the actual material can be learned from the course notes, which are quite extensive (one of the better aspects of the class, without a doubt). Also, make sure you go to TAs office hours early and often or study with a group -- the problem sets can be tricky and it helps immensely to have feedback.",
    "Basically discrete math with a bit of linear algebra. Required course for cs major.",
    "I would recommend it because it is required for the computer science major. Otherwise, not at all.",
    "202 is a fast, very cursory introduction a ton of math topics you have likely never worked with before. Aspnes does a good job explaining them, but it is hard to understand everything the first time around. Some things you will get, others you won't.",
    "No!",
    "Probably not. You obviously have to take it for the CS major, but if you're not CS I think you would learn the subject better in the math department. That said, this class is probably significantly easier: tough problem sets but not only 9, and two easy exams (but ones that cause a lot of stress).",
    "CPSC 202 is a good course. The material you cover is interesting and will definitely be helpful in the future. If you're a computer science major, you have to take it. The problem sets are challenging. You often need to go to office hours for help. The tests were very fair. Overall, I definitely feel like I learned about important topics. My biggest criticism would be that there was just way too much to cover and not enough time to cover it all. We covered a lot of different topics, many of which (liner algebra, graph theory, combinatorics, probability) could be courses in and of themselves. The class moves very quickly, and you'll often spend a lot of time outside of class trying to understand everything we cover.",
    "CPSC 202 is a very, very poor course and I would strongly recommend against taking it with Aspnes unless absolutely necessary. It is essentially an introduction to discrete math, but it covers way too many topics for any of them to be taught well. All of the online materials for the course (inconveniently placed in one gigantic PDF file that had a number of typos and mistakes in it) are unclear and unhelpful. Professor Aspnes is a very poor instructor who has difficulty conveying any concepts clearly. He clearly spent absolutely no time preparing for lecture, which was extremely apparent when he stopped multiple times every class after someone pointed out a mistake that he had made on the board. The material is relatively complex, and it's almost impossible to understand it when the examples that he uses are being created on the fly and are often incorrect. He also seemed to have no overarching lesson plans for any of the classes, so we would often not spend time on the most important aspects of a topic that we were covering. The class involves weekly psets as well as a midterm and final. To the course's credit, the midterm and final were both fair; however, the psets often tested relatively arcane problems about the week's topics, and were very challenging to complete without going to a TF. Even if you were able to do the pset without going to the TF's office hours, you'd probably do very poorly on it because we frequently got docked significant numbers of points for ridiculously minor technical omissions (such as failing to cite the specific axiom that states that if a> b and b> c, a> b). After a few weeks, the entire class realized that the only way to consistently get good grades on the psets is to go to office hours and literally go over every single problem with the TFs, and so the medianfor the last 5 (out of 9!) psets was a 60\/60, meaning that any points that you got off on the first few psets were blown ridiculously out of proportion. This made the grading of the class frustratingly arbitrary. If you do take it, make sure you go to the TFs for EVERY SINGLE PSET, even if they seem simple, to make sure you do well. To make matters even worse, the psets were sometimes graded incorrectly, and Professor Aspnes would refuse to approve any changes to their grading unless the TFs approved. In the case I mentioned above -- where many students got points docked for failing to cite the axiom that states that if a> b and b> c, a> c -- the TF who graded the pset for that week refused to give anyone any points back DESPITE THE FACT that in the answer key that Professor Aspnes published the following week, he hadn't cited the axiom. In summary, if you're taking this class, you're most likely a CS major. If you're not, I would absolutely not take the course with Aspnes. Take it a different semester or take MATH 244 instead. If you are a CS major, unless you ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO take the course this semester, I would recommend MATH 244 or 202 with another professor instead.",
    "I have no strong feelings one way or the other. For someone who has a weak math background, lecture could sometimes be confusing. Just keep up with the problem sets and make sure you're prepared for the exams.",
    "I probably wouldn't recommend this class to someone else unless it's required, or unless you love doing proofs.",
    "I highly recommend it. It's an easier version of higher level Discrete Math classes and is pretty well-organized and predictable.",
    "A survey course in discrete math. Helps abstract reasoning and in writing proofs. If you can, try to get these skills elsewhere.Majors: take math 244 instead if you can stomach the harder mathiness of it.Non-majors: get your kicks elsewhere",
    "This is a great and fairly straightforward survey class for computer science students who need some mathematical background for their other courses. Prof Aspnes is great and posts super helpful notes online, but be aware that his lectures are often full of mistakes to a distracting extent. I would recommend it if you need a class with this course's content-- it's not a very exciting class by nature, but Prof. Aspnes is a nice guy and certainly knowledgeable, albeit mistake-prone in class.",
    "This is ABSOLUTELY THE WORST CLASS I HAVE EVER TAKEN AND WILL EVER TAKE. Aspnes is a horrible teacher, his lectures are sporadic, disorganized and hard to follow. The material covered is disconnected, and each topic is talked about in such brevity that it's very difficult to get a grasp on any of them. The grading structure of the course is 9 problem sets and two exams. The problem sets are usually really difficult, so most people do poorly on the first few, until they realize that if you go to office hours TAs literally GIVE YOU THE ANSWERS. Obviously once people realize this, everyone goes to office hours and everyone gets 100% on the psets, thus making the curve ridiculous. So if you do take this class, my advice to you is to go to office hours for every single pset and make sure that you have every single thing right. He tells you which TA is grading each pset so go to their office hours with a write up of your pset and show it to them and make them tell you what will be wrong. This way you can do better on the first few psets before everyone figures out how stupid the class is and starts getting 100s on everything. If you are a CS major, then obviously this is a requirement, but my advice would be to shop MATH 244 and see if that looks better or take this when someone other than Aspnes is teaching it. It is a horrible class.",
    "I recommend this class.",
    "Obviously if you are a computer science major, you have to take this course, but I don't really know how helpful it is in practice. The course seems to focus on breadth and not depth, so you'll learn ABOUT a lot, but at the end, you'll probably be like \"so...what exactly can I do now that I couldn't before?\"",
    "Good course. I took MATH 225 before this, and I thought this explained those concepts (linear algebra) in a very clear way. In class things went astray a lot when he would get lost in proofs sometimes. He was very entertaining, though, and just from my shopping of 202 last year with the other teacher, Aspnes seems much much better. And use the TAs for homework help. Actually.",
    "Too many topics, too shallow coverage. Aspnes is pretty entertaining but overall probably not worth it if you have a choice.",
    "If you're looking at this class, you probably have to take it anyway, so...more practical advice: If Aspnes is teaching, don't bother coming to class, you'll just get confused even more. Just read his notes, which are quite well done. Also, go to office hours for the problem sets, you won't be able to do them otherwise. Weekly p-sets. Difficult but if you go to office hours instead of actually trying to do them, you'll be fine.",
    "If you take it, go to office hours from Day One, and find a group of friends to work with on the homeworks and study for exams. Not recommended unless you're a CS major who needs it.",
    "Proofs. More proofs. All the proofs!A bit scattered material wise. Don't take if you don't have to.",
    "CS 202 tries to cover too much material. As a result, nothing is covered in great depth, which makes it easier in one sense, but also leaves students not feeling totally confident with any given subject. This class is impossible without going to office hours regularly for help with the psets. Professor Aspnes is entertaining, but definitely doesn't always know when he's completely lost the class and sometimes explains things in convoluted ways.",
    "It was an okay overview of Discrete Math. We went over many topics but did not cover any in great detail. I heard it's better than math 244"
