   "comments": [
    "The course had extremely relevant material, was well-prepared by the Professor and his TAs (Martha and Owais), and was well-executed.Every moment of the course was packed with useful information.The sections were perfectly relevant to the lectures, helped to maximize learning, and were tailored to make homework assignments easy to follow.",
    "This is one of the better BIS courses that I have taken at YSPH, and the approaches taken in this course should be a model for other BIS courses. Specifically, having the weekly \"lab\" sessions was very helpful and contributed greatly to my understanding of the course material. Further, it was helpful in terms of knowing how to apply the various concepts to real data (i.e., by discussing the SAS code). There was a good mix of assessments, including weekly homework, a midterm, a final \"quiz\", and a final project.Some topics were glossed over, but this course was very ambitious in terms of the amount of material covered in one semester, so I still feel like I've learned a lot.",
    "The strengths of the class are the lecture slides and labs. The class was extremely thorough. The only weakness would be the unstructured final project. The lack of guidance was a little frustrating.",
    "One strength is that I really learned the material well. One weakness was that I felt there was a very big learning curve in the first couple weeks of the course. However, this was probably more due to the fact that I had no experience with SAS, rather than the structure of the course.",
    "This course is very basic and important for biostatistics students. Overall the course is organized well. But as the time in class is limited. many topics are omitted and not talked in details.",
    "TA are good. Quiz is a little it many.",
    "The course helped me to improve my previous knowledge about regression, provided new details and led to better understanding regression analysis described in papers and books.",
    "It is quite good. Maybe a little too easy.",
    "TAs are excellent, although they give no direction for the final project. Learning in this class is very self-directed. Book is good. HWs and tests were pretty straightforward",
    "This is a great course if you are interested in understanding linear regression. That said, it is not a general biostats course, it only give you tools to develop linear models. It is challenging but at the end of the course, you leave with an important skill set.",
    "This is an excellent course in which you will really learn the important concepts in forming simple and multiple linear regression models. The structure of this course is clearly carefully thought out, and very well-done. Lectures with Heping alternating with TA sessions were very useful. Homework questions were well-chosen to illuminate the important concepts, and exams were fair. I wish that Heping taught \"Applied Linear Regression II\" because we were just getting into some non-standard linear models and I would love another semester learning those from Heping and these TAs.",
    "I thought the course provided a great foundation for regression analysis. Some of the strengths were the lab sections with the teaching assistants that put the material from the course into application in SAS. I enjoyed the homework assignments as a way to enforce the material being covered.Some of the weaknesses included the lack of public health examples with the datasets and assignments. This is a trend in most biostatistics classes, we never deal with real data or data even related to public health. I also felt like we were thrown into the final project without much guidance or expectations. I think there should be a clear set of guidelines written up and provided on the expectations of the project. It would have also been nice to have more lab sections in R.",
    "This course covers a lot of material, but the labs help reinforce the lecture material. I liked the text book, and the TA provided a lot of helpful supplementary material. Overall, it is a great introduction to linear regression and model building.",
    "I enjoyed this class, but especially because of the TAs. They were very helpful. Lecture was a bit confusing, but the lab sessions were always helpful and informative.I gained a solid knowledge of regression and the tests and homeworks were fair.The workload was sometimes intense; perhaps some of the homeworks could be shortened. They were time and labor intensive throughout the entire semester.",
    "Excellent caring instructor who is focused on teaching the basics of linear regression. Class size is getting too large due to popularity of the course.TAs were very good.",
    "This is a great class. The TAs this year were very helpful, and Heping is very enthusiastic. However, it would be nice to have a more structured final project. I don't see how TAs would be unable to assess our grasp of statistical analysis on a standardized dataset, especially as our education (ins this class) does not cover data-retrieval, data-cleaning, etc. Still, I can see that this is an important skillset to have.It would also be helpful to have some course instruction on the most appropriate order of operations of statistical procedures. We somewhat addressed this in the final class period, but a bit haphazardly\/in an unorganized fashion.Overall, this is a good course that I would recommend to anyone who will be required to understand the fundamentals of statistical analysis (especially linear regression) in their profession or future research.",
    "I found the material learned in this class to be very important for the YSPH curriculum. This class taught concrete skills in basic statistical modeling that students completing a thesis need. While the material and especially the book was very helpful, the instructor's lecture and TA's lecture could have been matched better to reflect what was taught. I occasionally though that I learned a lot, but knew less about applying what we have learned to certain tricky situations. It wasn't always clear how we were to resolve issues in regression modeling. However, I greatly enjoyed the class.",
    "I thought this was a great class. It was a well-organized, well-designed course and I really feel as though I have a good grasp of all the major topics that were covered. The book was very clear and helpful; the homework assignments were fair; and the lectures were engaging (and not dry). Unlike other biostats courses (e.g., categorical), the instructor and TAs were fully aware of our level of statistical knowledge and catered to us appropriately. The course was thus appropriately challenging.",
    "This was one of my favorite courses this semester since I could learn the essence of statistical analysis knowledge and skill at this course. As I plan to pursue a Ph.D., the knowledge and skills gained through this course would be very valuable when conducting public health research projects in the future. Again, this was one of the best courses I have taken at the public health school",
    "It is an excellent course, which gives a great intro to applied linear regression.",
    "good",
    "Great course.",
    "Use SAS coding on slides, not R, please!",
    "Very well organized, I really appreciate the clear objectives stated at the beginning of each lecture, TAs were WONDERFUL, very straight forward, relevant homework assignments, and appropriate final project.",
    "The course offers a good chance to practice SAS and labs and homeworks are very comprehensive and applied.",
    "I really enjoyed this course. I felt that I was able to gain a thorough understanding of regression in terms of both theory and application. The textbook is also excellent and easy to read.",
    "The strength is it provided many useful techniques for regression analysis, the weakness is the instructor is not competent enough to speak clearly in English. I always found it is difficult to understand his English, not to mention his lectures.",
    "The labs on Thursdays are very helpful.",
    "strengths:sense of humorTAs were superb! Martha Skup and Owais GilaniRoom for improveemnt- there was basically no time left for constructive feedback on the final project and this is exactly why people take this class for: practicing with real problems- could the project be due, say, Nov 15th and have a wrap around session or have TAs available for questions afterwards?",
    "Strengths: The homework problems reflected what we learned in lecture and SAS lab. The textbook was great! The class was fun and enjoyable to attend. The final project was a great learning experience.",
    "strengths- great lecturer and tasweaknesses- not enough applications.",
    "The course is likely the best course in the Biostatistics department. It does not require improvement.",

    "Instructor: Heping Zhang \u00a0Dr. Zhang was very knowledgeable and had a good sense of humor which made the course interesting. He presented the material in a very organized way, and listing the course objectives prior to each lecture helped to focus on the key points.I would recommend finding alternative ways to encourage class discussion ifthis is desired, rather than using the class photo generator to randomly call on people. BIS concepts require some thought\/reflection for most people, and there is no reason to put people on the spot like that in a course at the graduate school level. Maybe in an SBS class, but not BIS.",
    "Instructor: Heping Zhang \u00a0Overall Professor Zhang was a good professor. At first, his accent made it difficult to understand what he was talking about. However after a few weeks, I was able to follow the lectures without too much difficulty.",
    "Instructor: Heping Zhang \u00a0Dr. Zhang was a great teacher. He did a good job of explaining complex concepts. He was also very approachable and always willing to help.",
    "Instructor: Heping Zhang \u00a0Dr Zhang delivered the lecture in a very humorous way. His class is interesting and inspiring. He gave simple examples to help me to understand the content better. He also used \"lucky draw\" to help students focus attention on his class. He is a very experienced teacher!",
    "Instructor: Heping Zhang \u00a0Can't hear clearly about the spoken-english.",
    "Instructor: Heping Zhang \u00a0The instructor provided very clear and complete explanations of covered topics. He taught that way that led to better understanding of the concepts, not just memorizing. The focus on the applications was also very helpful.",
    "Instructor: Heping Zhang \u00a0He is very good. He could bring about some thoughtful aspects in class, which is really helpful. Hope he can go in depth more.",
    "Instructor: Heping Zhang \u00a0The selection system discouraged people from attending class.",
    "Instructor: Heping Zhang \u00a0The professor is great, he explains the material thoroughly although his English is at times difficult to understand.",
    "Instructor: Heping Zhang \u00a0It was hard to understand Heping with his thick accent.",
    "Instructor: Heping Zhang \u00a0Excellent instructor who is very good at breaking down the essential concepts and making them understandable. He is also very funny. He expects you to have read the book chapter prior to arriving at class and created a computer program that would randomly select a student for him to call on throughout the lecture. I didn't mind this (he gave away chocolate for correct answers). Although I know some students felt nervous attending lectures because of this, he was kind in his questions and feedback. This was not meant to be malicious or embarrassing, but was his way of making sure his students were reading and understanding the material along the way. Heping seems to really care about his students learning. I would take other courses taught by him.",
    "Instructor: Heping Zhang \u00a0I enjoyed Professor Zhang's positive attitude and jokes during class, I think it made the material less cumbersome. However, there were times were it was difficult understand him and his questions to the class. I think the lectures should be designed in a way that's more interactive, but I don't think the 'wheel of fortune' was the best method.",
    "Instructor: Heping Zhang \u00a0Sometimes lectures were a bit confusing, but overall Dr. Zhang was enthusiastic and responsive to student questions",
    "Instructor: Heping Zhang \u00a0The instructor was very enthusiastic about the subject, however he was sometimes hard to follow. This wasn't too much of an issue because the TAs were fantastic.",
    "Instructor: Heping Zhang \u00a0Instructor is caring.Being chinese and being used to his accent I have no problem understanding him but I can see that at times it is difficult for others.TA Gilani was strong. Having had him before he was a good senior TATA Skup was also good. She cared for her students.One suggestion is that if there are 2 TA it may be more advantageous to divide up the class to have more personalized lab instructions. Lab with 40 others makes it difficult to have a 2 way discussion about complex material.",
    "Instructor: Heping Zhang \u00a0Heping is super enthusiastic and knows how to convey complicated statistical theory to his students. That is, he has a phenomenal grasp of the course material, and is a very good teacher. Unfortunately, it is often very difficult to understand his English, which detracts from the overall quality of his teaching.",
    "Instructor: Heping Zhang \u00a0Heping Zhang was a great instructor. He is very knowledgeable on the subject matter, but I wish he went more in depth into some of the topics. Some of the more complicated material was glossed over. However, this is an introduction to regression modeling class so I understand there are only so many classes to cover a large amount of material.",
    "Instructor: Heping Zhang \u00a0Heping was a good lecturer, and he tried to make it fun with his random student selector and candy bars. He answered all questions and made sure that we fully understood the material by asking lots of questions. Besides the lectures, however, he did not seem to fully involved in the course. The TAs assigned the homework problems, graded them, wrote the midterm, final and quizzes, and graded the exams and final projects as well. Heping didn't seem to be much involved in those things -- when asked, he didn't know exactly whatwas covered on the exams and what was expected for the final project (what he told us sometimes contradicted what the TAs said).",
    "Instructor: Heping Zhang \u00a0I stopped going to the class because I didn't like his way of forcing students to answer his questions if they are randomly selected by the rottery system he devised. I don't understand why he does that as we are grown-ups, which means we ask and answer at the course if we want, and if not, we don't. Since he introduced such a stressful system into the class, I refused to go to the class, and I don't regret at all.",

    "Instructor: Heping Zhang \u00a0good",

    "Instructor: Heping Zhang \u00a0Very kind, humorous - very few professors can be light hearted and jovial when lecturing about statistics! My only critique is that we would not always cover all of the material in the lecture slides",
    "Instructor: Heping Zhang \u00a0Dr. Zhang is a funny guy and enthusiastic about the material, but his lectures are difficult to follow sometimes. It's a little difficult to understand him when he speaks too quickly.",

    "TA's are very responsible and helpful. They gave very detailed notes and lab sessions. Owais marked homework very carefully.",
    "Very good.",

    "The TAs, Martha and Owais, were the two best TAs that I have had in any course ever, including college, medical school, and now graduate school. They were both very patient, very willing to accommodate students, and seemed to really care about our learning. They are also very fair in their homework and exam questions. Homework was not given for the sake of homework, but was carefully-chosen questions that hammered the essential points home. Both were excellent at explaining concepts, Owais in particular. The only suggestion I have is that a bit more guidance on the final project would be very helpful for students -- I get that they want us to generate the final project completely to demonstrate our knowledge, but some sort of guideline on the proper length, depth, etc (and even an example project) would have really been appreciated. I know people who turned in 50 pages of output with graphs to support every statement they made, which seems a bit much, but they did it because it was unclear how much Martha and OG wanted.",
    "Both Martha and Owais are great teaching assistants. They've made themselves available to students and they work hard. I really enjoyed the handouts from lab and I've even used them for other classes.I think the only thing that stood out as a weakness was the length of time it took to return some of the homework assignments. Specifically, toward the end of the semester, there were upto three homeworks that went ungraded for weeks. That was somewhat annoying, if you wanted to know where you stood in the class or wanted to see what you had done wrong when studying for the final quiz and doing the final project.",
    "The TA's were great and provided great support for the course.",

    "Wonderful TA, they were more than perfect",
    "The TAs were excellent. Martha's lab sessions were SO helpful, as were her accompanying handouts. She was clear lecturer and receptive to questions. Owais was also great when he gave the lab sessions, and his grading of the homework was always fair. They were both always available by email (always responded promptly) and during office hours. Their practice exams were also extremely helpful for the midterm and final. Their homework solutions sets were also very useful.At the beginning of the semester, homeworks were always returned to us 1 week after we turned them in, but once we started using the electronic submission, graded homeworks were often not returned for weeks, and they sometimes would not be returned before an exam (although the solution sets were). The electronic submission of homework was new to the TAs, but in the future they should try to get homework back to us on time.",
    "The TAs.. They were best! The TA session was very helpful because I wasable to improve my SAS skills, and the materials prepared by the TA, especially Martha, were excellent. Though they might be super busy, they were very fast almost all the time. I was surprised, for instance, when they finished scoring the midterm examinations of all students within 48 hours after the exam. That's just unbelievable. In addition, whenever I had some troubles with my assignment or final project and emailed to TAs, they (Martha in particular) were pretty fast in sending the response. They were diligent, smart, but still sweet. Two of the best TAs I have ever have.",

    "I would recommend the course to students who are interested in learning how to do regression analysis on data. The course requires a final project but the guidelines are flexible enough for you to use your own data. It is a great class with excellent instructors.",
    "I would recommend it to fellow students if they want to gain better understanding of statistical analysis.",
    "Learning how to create a linear regression model and perform diagnostics is a great skill to have especially if it is applicable for your thesis. This class is also a prerequisite for other higher level biostats course (e.g. longitudinal data analysis), so I would recommend looking at other biostat courses that you may be interested in and seeing if this course is a requirement.",
    "Definitely a must! start the project early to get constructive feedback on.",
    "You get a great background in sas and it's application for using your data.",
    "Yes, I would definitively recommend this course for a fellow student because it really guides you through the course material giving you a solid undertanding of the necessary basics.",
    "This course provides a solid foundation for linear regression and offers students a way to apply SAS and biostatistics skills to a variety of datasets. The final project is a great learning opportunity and a way to practice everything learned throughout the semester. Throughout the whole process, there is a lot of support from the instructor and TAs and a great book.",
    "If the TAs, lecturer and book remains the same, definitely take it!",
    "The course is absolutely fantastic and all students in the school of public health should be required to take it. It has the most utility of any course I've taken so far at Yale.",
    "Excellent. Definitely, I will recommend it to others.",
    "This class is very good and I would definitely recommend this class to my fellow students."
