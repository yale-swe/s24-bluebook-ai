    "If you're thinking about taking this class, think before proceeding. First off, this isn't really a WGSS class - yes, it does \"focus\" on women, but in reality it's a NELC\/ancient civs course that talks about women frequently. Like seriously. Don't expect to do intense or productive analyses or readings into ancient women (one of the required books is honestly just an art history book, with no focus on women at all). The readings are fairly light and easy, but the requirements for the essays are pretty specific and demanding. The instructor has an exact idea of what she wants on an essay\/presentation, and you will have to WORK to meet her requirements.",
    "NELC 167 01 is one of the more relaxed courses at Yale. I would recommend it to anyone looking for an interesting 5th course. Anyone who is a fan of antiquity would surely enjoy it, as well as those interested in anthropology or history.",
    "Great multidisciplinary course with relatively minimal workload\/stress. Great if you are looking for a classic \"Yale\" class.",
    "I really liked the course! I was initially a bit worried because it seemed like it was going to be a dry lecture with a low-energy vibe, but so glad I stuck with it! I had a great time and I learned a lot. The workload is *very* manageable and you have complete leeway to research whatever interests you for each assignment! That was my favorite aspects. I did my assignments on recreational sex in ancient Egypt, virginity as commodity in ancient Mesopotamia, and the absence of mother figures in art in Minoan Crete. Professor Foster is a wealth of knowledge and that is apparent at every moment in the class. She gave useful feedback and suggestions in relation to our assignments, pointed us in the direction of good resources, etc. Overall I'm very glad I took the course!"
