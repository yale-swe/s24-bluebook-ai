    "Very good overview of feminist literature. Allows for a broad range of paper topics; Carol offers a lot of support in both choosing and realizing a research project.Seems more inclined to a late nineteenth and twentieth century sensibility, though this may have been shaped by the interests of the students in the course.At times, the reading load was heavy, but also well selected and provocative.",
    "Yes and no. The material covered was interesting and worthwhile, but the format was less than ideal (because of the size of the class largely).",
    "an intersection of feminist theory and some art historical topicsi would recommend the course in terms of topic, but the disorganization makes it difficult to do so ..."

   "comments": [
    "Given an interest in gender and feminist scholarship, this course was really the only way of engaging with these issues, in a direct manner, through coursework. \"Gender\" does not, it seems, rank highly on the list of interest of this department's faculty. In turn, it is wonderful that this course is offered, as it is perhaps the only way to gain an overview of feminist scholarship in the art history department at Yale.",
    "Some useful methodological issues to think about."
