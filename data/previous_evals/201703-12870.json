   "comments": [
    "I learned how to write in a more sophisticated way and engage in conversation better.",
    "This was probably my favorite class this semester. Broadly, we covered the nature of human institutions, the way the develop and the way they evolve. The course also looks at many of the basic assumptions we have about human society and policy - black boxes - and challenges them in insightful ways that help one understand the complexities of government and organization. The papers allow one to research a specific topic of interest using the theoretical framework discussed in class.",
    "We worked extensively on developing a vocabulary with which to describe and analyze the geopolitical events and systems around us. This vocabulary and it's associated theory allowed us to more fully describe and understand those systems and the interactions between them. Much of the value in the course was the insight into thinking about how we think about interactions.",
    "In this course, I learned how to analyze major policy issues related to not just environmental issues but also how to apply basic steps towards analyzing other social problems.",
    "This course taught Elinor Ostrom's theories of economics and social cohesion as applied to common pool resources. Real world applications were then studied with a focus on the lobster industry."

   "comments": [
    "I still really don't like that IAD framework, but I guess that's the whole class. It would have been nice if it were advertised\/explained more before I committed to write 25 pages using it.",
    "The strength was the Professor Fotos is the best professor that I have had at Yale.",
    "This course provides a very valuable wakeup call to step back and assess how we percieve systems of interaction in society. Its biggest strength is how it is able to open your eyes to what is inside the black box of some institutions. The only weakness I would note is that the class is very focused on assessment of systems' strengths and failures and explicitly avoids any attempt to solve or address any issues found. In the end, however, that is not the goal of the course.",
    "The strengths of the course includes the readings, speakers and professor Fotos. The readings were great and really not only helped me participate in discussions but gave me a whole new view of many different topics: social issues, environmental dilemmas, social justice, etc. Professor Fotos is amazing at facilitating and leading discussions. I loved his weekly notes that he prepares for us to guide us through readings. They were extremely helpful for understanding what we should be focusing on while doing the readings and helped tie them all under one common theme.",
    "The course was great. Professor Fotos led the seminar well, and the readings chosen covered the topics well.",
    "Strengths: Fotos cares sooo much about you and your experience in the course. He even writes up memos on the topic and readings before every seminar (although I didn't understand any of them). Weaknesses: Way too many readings to have any clue what each class is supposed to be about. Total polisci class... if you can't speak that B.S. language, count yourself lost already."

   "comments": [
    "This class is better than a lecture, but didn't rock my world. The readings and class discussions were often very interesting, though many of the readings were dry. This class had the best reading of college so far for me: My Pilgrimage to Nonviolence by Martin Luther King. Read it even if you don't take the class, it's only 8 pages. Professor Fotos gave back harsh feedback that I didn't find particularly helpful - seemed more critical than constructive. This refers to his response to our presentations, essays, etc. You can probably find a better seminar than this, but you will learn a lot and the class could substantively change your worldview regarding the interaction between science and government.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course if students are interested in the interactions between different levels of organizations have with the environment.",
    "Definitely a good course to take if you interested in either management, sustainability, human government or politics. The themes this course covers are broad enough to allow students of all interests to enjoy it.",
    "The workload is a lot relative to other Yale courses. The weekly readings and memos take up a lot of time each week, and the two papers are no breeze. But, I got a lot out of the course, and I would definitely recommend this course to another student. Definitely one of my favorite courses so far.",
    "The course and it's expectations were not very well organized in the slightest. There was very little effective feedback on the use of the framework which was studied in class.The syllabus did not reflect that it is essentially a course on one specific framework as opposed to Democracy as a political theory. Additionally, the professor did not guide conversation well or create an environment that was conducive to learning.",
    "Absolutely. Be forewarned that the course is focused on analysis of social systems and explicitly avoids attempting to prescribe solutions. If you are open to that, Professor Fotos is a truly amazing professor. His weekly memos make the purpose of each reading assignment clear, and he guides discussion without lecturing. It was my best seminar course at Yale, with honest, open discussion and healthy argument. The guest speakers were highly informative, and the private lunches afterwards were great ways to get to know them and pick their brains. To my fellow STEM folk, this is a doable WR, but be warned that Professor Fotos is a strict grader of assignments, but a very warm and helpful guide for revisions and extenuating circumstances. Overall, a must take class if you are at all interested in social systems and the role of democratic institutions.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class, its probably my favorite class ever taken at Yale. We probably spent a little more time talking about lobsters than I would have liked but I felt as if I learned so much from this one class. Learning about the intersection between science and policy, determining what social problems are actually problems, learning a new form a analysis from Ostrom, delving into the concepts of civil disobedience of MLK. I highly recommend the course if your at all interested in environmental policy. Also, the guest lectures are amazing. Professor Fotos brought in a climate change reporter from the New York Times as well as a reverend who leads the climate disobedience center.",
    "It's interesting but very lofty and a lot of work. Take it if you want to know all about Elinor Ostrom and how to analyze social ecological systems. Don't take it if you want to learn anything else."
