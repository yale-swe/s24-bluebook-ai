    "Take it if you're into constitutional law. Not much econ. That being said, it's a relatively low work load for an econ senior seminar (50 pages weekly reading, one presentation, and one 10-15 page paper due at the end of the semester).",
    "Yes, I would recommend this class if you are looking for a class with an engaging professor, low workload, and need an economics senior seminar. Professor: Prof. Jaynes was very caring and walked us through the dense material each week in a way that made the classroom discussion enjoyable and the material understandable. Program: Workload was beyond fair (much less than other econ classes I've taken). Assignments included some write ups (short 1 page responses to what we discussed - one was watching an episode of the West Wing). A group presentation (very relaxed assignment that Prof. Jaynes wants you to succeed on). And a paper (around 10 pages) about a topic in economics and discrimination you want to write about. People: Usual economics seminar. Some people are very engaged while others are on Facebook.",
    "Great class- basically con-law with economics thrown in. You lead a discussion, and write a paper at the end, with a few one page assignments throughout. It is a relaxed class that is great as a senior seminar. Professor Jaynes is the man.",
    "Great course. Yale econ needs more seminars like these. Covers important legal history with a complementary econ theory to support it.",
    "Easy 5th class for seniors writing their senior paper; really low workload; class conversation is kind of slow and veers into personal anecdotes a lot; wish Jaynes would talk more or facilitate more since Econ students often don't do seminar that often",
    "Ehhhh. It's not a lot of work, so that's nice. On the flip side, nobody - not even the prof - seems to give a fig about the class. Also, depending on who takes it with you, you might have random dudes talking about how sexism isn't real. So there's that."
