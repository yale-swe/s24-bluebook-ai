    "Very good class, not a lot of work, not a gut, interesting material.",
    "Great class. The material is extremely interesting, especially for CS majors. I definitely would recommend taking math logic beforehand, not so much because you need the material as background but because it's useful to have seen logic before taking this class. The class has a very small workload, and you still manage to learn a ton. Not to mention its a HU credit, so I would strongly recommend this class to any CS or math major struggling to find a way to satisfy their HU req.",
    "PHIL 427 is good if you need the credit for your major as an elective or requirement. Not exactly something I'd take \"for fun\" but definitely a good class in the math\/phil\/cs areas.",
    "This is a fun and interesting class, though it might be just as fun and interesting to simply read Godel, Escher, Bach. That said, the rigor towards the end of the course, when you get to the actual proofs of Godel's theorems, is something you won't find easily elsewhere. Be aware: a two-hour math lecture is nothing to be sneezed at. It can get extremely wearying, but if you doze off a bit because you've actually seen a decent amount of the material before, suddenly you've missed some crucial detail! Overall: chill class on interesting material, heavily backloaded with oral exam + take-home final, prereq not necessary for those with a bit of math background.",
    "A good class, but not easy.",
    "The class covers a number of interesting proofs that have to do with computability, decidability, and incompleteness. If these topics interest you, the class will not disappoint. Assessment consists of brief problem sets, an oral exam, a class presentation, and a larger final problem set. Each of these assignments is pedagogically valuable and reasonable in difficulty. This is definitely a class worth taking. Gdel's incompleteness theorems are truly genius.",
    "PHIL 427 is an interesting class where you learn about many theorems (Godel's incompleteness theorems, Church's thesis, ...) and how to apply them in creative ways. The division of the class into four parts (intro, presentations, oral, and final) was interesting and gave a good overview of many different areas and how they are related. At the end, all of the parts come together and it is quite interesting to see their interaction.",
    "Computability and Logic will rock your mind and it's amazing and you should totally take it. It has very interesting applications for computer science and mathematical developments in the 20th century, where logicians and mathematicians worked to secure a logical foundation for mathematics (a project doomed to failure!) Honestly this class is really, really cool, and if you enjoy logic or math or theoretical computer science you should absolutely take this course.",
    "One of the best classes I have taken at Yale. I came in expecting it to be humanities level survey of Godel's incompleteness theorem and it turned out to be mathematically rigorous material that was challenging and interesting. Low workload in terms of assignments, but you still learn so much. I highly recommend this class to philosophy, computer science, or math majors. Pre-requisites not really required if you know how to prove things in a semi-rigorous way.",
    "Yes! Super low stress and absolutely fascinating material",
    "A great class where you'll learn a ton about and prove a lot of first-order logic, theory of computation, and godel's incompleteness theorems. The class is fairly chill, but can get bogged down in the details. It can require reading (and correcting) the hand-outs several times before you see the bigger picture.",
    "Really easy Computer Science, Math, and Humanities credit (I'm counting it toward all three). In fact, this is probably the easiest class in any of those categories. Half-hour psets every other week, group presentations to learn the material in diverse ways, a really chill oral exam, and a take-home final which takes a few hours. The material is really interesting if you pay attention (take notes, even though she provides notes). Some of it can be confusing, however, so if you're confused by something like Lob's theorem go to TA office hours; they really helped me make sense of logic.",
    "Do take if interested in this aspect of math, philosophy, CS. It's not super difficult of a class in terms of workload, but the material presented may at times require a bit of work to really understand. However, professor Shin definitely helps a lot in that process, and herself just makes the class a lot more enjoyable, with clear teaching and lots of help.",
    "Take this course!",
    "Don't take this class unless you have a strong logic background and a substantial interest in the material. Iff you do, you'll enjoy it, but if not, I promise, it will not be a good experience.",
    "This class tends to get great reviews, but I really didn't like it. I am a math major, and I found that the subject matter was boring, and tedious to learn. However, I know other math majors that liked it. This class is also often reviewed as easy, but it felt much harder just because I found it so uninteresting. From speaking with other students in my class, it seemed that some loved it and some hated it, so my advice would be to look into the textbook and maybe skim some of the chapters. If the information interests you, you will probably like the class, but if not, then I definitely would not recommend taking it."
