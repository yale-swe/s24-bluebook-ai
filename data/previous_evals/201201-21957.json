    "I would recommend it. I recommend the first half of the semester heartily, and the second half mildly. If you are going on the summer program, it's all worthit.",
    "it's ok",
    "Probably not worth it",
    "City of Rome has been one of my favorite classes I've taken at Yale. There is a ton of reading for the first half of the semester, but it drops off a lot in the second half, and it's incredibly cool to learn about the history and how everything fits together in terms of history, politics, religion, art, and architecture. If you can go to Rome over the summer as well, absolutely do it. I've loved everything I've learned, but would not be nearly as excited about it if I weren't going to Rome this summer to apply the knowledge I've gained. There is only a 5-page paper, midterm, and final, and the midterm and final are very straightfoward passage identifications, with an additional essay on the final with prompts provided ahead of time. Take this! Professor Jewiss knows everything about Rome!",
    "Absolutely- and especially if you can take the summer course as well- it leaves you really wanting to go to Rome! And the work is so engaging- I'm positive you wouldn't mind doing the readings and being in Rome at the same time.",
    "I really enjoyed this course. It was an incredible blend of Roman history, archaeology, art, literature, and politics. Although the amount of reading seemed overwhelming at times, I really enjoyed the syllabus and felt like I learned so much. If you take this course you should definitely go to Rome in the summer!",
    "I came into this class as someone who had studied Latin in high school and wanted to return to classics. For this reason, I definitely enjoyed the first half very much - since we read the Aeneid, Livy, Tacitus, and other great Roman authors. However, the second half of the course covers about 1000 years of history, which got to be very disorganized since there was no text to refer to, only lectures (with no information on Powerpoints, just what Professor Jewiss mentioned). In this regard I felt that I didn't really get a full sense of the trajectory of Italian history, and it meant I did a lot of side research for the exam. Professor Jewiss does seem to grade a little harder on the midterm and essays even though it's a humanities class, though perhaps I noticed this because I'm not a humanities major."
