    "East Asian Martial Arts Film is exactly what it sounds like - a survey course of East Asian Martial Arts film from its distant origins in the early 20th century all the way up to recent blockbusters. Primarily focusing on the films of Japan, Mainland China, and Hong Kong, this course delves into and assesses critical themes such as nationalism, masculinity, authenticity, and morality, while also taking time to evaluate filmic techniques used unique to East Asia or to martial arts film. I would recommend this course to any students interested in East Asia, East Asian culture, martial arts, martial arts on film, or a casual film class that doesn't need too much prior knowledge to take. I personally highly enjoyed the class, since it took a film genre many of us enjoy but perhaps won't admit and analyzed it on an academic level, which has personally piqued my interest in film studies."
