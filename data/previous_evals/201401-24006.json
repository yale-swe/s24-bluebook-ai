    "Absolutely take it.",
    "Low structure,you get what you put into it",
    "A wonderful course. You get the chance to really develop some strong stories and professor Messud is a great combination of exacting and supportive.",
    "This is a pretty standard fiction workshop, in which you write three stories, and comment on your classmates stories. At the end, you turn in a revision. Claire Messud was a very helpful teacher, and I would certainly recommend it to anyone who is interested in writing fiction.",
    "Yes, highly recommended.",
    "I wish there were more of a discussion of craft than of the logistical workings of individual stories. The amount of attention each story gets is great, but the class is primarily used to check times and birthdays of characters, which was a bit boring. Claire is a funny, smart, and somewhat distant teacher. James Wood's class was great--a type of discussion I wish were more present in the course itself."
