    "This course is well-structured. Every concept is followed with examples, helping students to understand well.",
    "Very good",
    "Maria Ciarleglio is arguably the strongest teacher in the school of public health. She is just exceptional. This class is tough, but when you're done you will have learned a lot.",
    "Excellent. It would be great if the professor did 20-30 minutes of actual data analysis in class in conjunction with lecture material rather than just reviewing the code.",
    "well structured",
    "Strengths - Practical rundown to commonly used and widely applicable survival analysis techniques (mostly in SAS, but in R as well). Weaknesses - Course lectures mostly slide based (understandable due to coding nature of course). Office hours helpful for more thorough explanations.",
    "good course, biggest suggestion is that the material could have been heavily condensed (slides were often wordy making it hard to stay engaged during dense sections). also would recommend switching to one programming language (preferably R, as there are better packages now)",
    "strength: clear instruction and available TA weakness: needs better calc overview in beginning",
    "the course is good",
    "This course is one of my favorite courses in YSPH. It is well organized, very clear PPT, and it covers very important materials. Highly recommend if you wanna learn more about public health and data science.",
    "Very good. Very organized.",
    "Great!",
    "Strengths: 1. The homework of this course help me get a deeper understanding of the course material. 2. The ppt slides are very clear and well organized Weakness 1. It would be better if we can do a project",
    "Excellent slides in each lecture. Very clear explanation.",
    "The lecture is well prepared and well organized.",
    "This course addressed the topic of survival analysis very well. You could find every important detail in the handout materials. The logic of the content is fluent and flawless. It is a deep subject, but the course makes it easy to pick up.",
    "excellent taught lots of concepts clearly, homework and assessment are properly created",
    "I just want to say the course is awesome! Very clear and highly structured.",
    "near to perfection"
