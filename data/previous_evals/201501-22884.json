    "only take it if you need it",
    "If you have taken Calculus AB or BC in high school, with how well the professor teaches the material, given that you attend class, this course should be a breeze. Great class for anyone who has any sort of interest in math.",
    "It is a good class if you want to fulfill a pre-req or QR credit. Although it is a decent amount of work I would recommend it to other students.",
    "Pretty easy QR credit but a solid amount of work. Wouldn't take it if I didn't need it for my major though, there are easier QRs to take. Class is generally well taught and the work is useful.",
    "Math 112 is a relatively straightforward course that serves as an introduction to single-variable calculus all the way up to the basics of integration. Take it if necessary for a major, but if you are looking for a QR, there are better and more interesting options available. Workload was a bit higher than average with three problem sets per week. Tread with caution; not a gut.",
    "It's a good class and provides a strong foundation in differential and some integral calculus. The workload is quite a bit though. Take it if you need it for requirements.",
    "Math 112 was difficult, not gonna lie. It was probably one of the workload heaviest classes I've taken and the midterms and final were fairly challenging. You definitely should have some prior knowledge of calculus before taking this course, or else you will be lost. You definitely do learn a LOT about calculus, though, and all the teachers and TAs are really helpful, so reach out, Overall, a good course, albeit workload heavy and fairly challenging. I would recommend this course, but with heavy caution.",
    "I would recommend the class to fellow students. It provides a basic foundation for calculus.",
    "A tasking yet interesting class. I would recommend it to another student but also warn him\/her about the workload",
    "Great calculus course. Not that hard and you will learn a lot. Lots of helpful office hours but at least one pset due every class. Sometimes I skipped class to finish psets, which was bad.",
    "Definitely take."
