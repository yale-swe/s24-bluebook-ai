   "comments": [
    "This course is about the political side of law. It is not learning what the laws are or how they are written but how they are enforced which has many political implications. I wasn't entirely interested in law until I took this course, I definitely recommend it. Also, the midterm and final was open notes.",
    "I would recommend it, mostly because lectures are interesting. There is just too much reading and you will never do it all, but it's alright because the midterm and final (your only grades if you take it non-WR) are both open book, open note.",
    "this was my favorite class. prof. huber is an awesome lecturer and you learn a lot about the criminal justice system. you can take it writing or non-writing. non-writing isnt bad at all. midterm and final both open note. great class, definitely worth taking!!!",
    "Take it! Great class!",
    "great class!",
    "Absolutely a must-take Yale course. Highly interesting information and highly applicable information for the real world. Take this class for sure if you're a Political Science major. Definitely take it if you want to go to law school. Definitely take it if you like shows like CSI or any of the other various crime shows on TV. In fact, definitely take it if you are a living, breathing human being. That's how good it is.",
    "This class won't blow your mind, but it's a very interesting class and pretty well taught. I took it WR intensive even though I didn't really need the WR credit because I thought I would learn more - and I guess that's kind of true since it's hard to bring yourself to consistently read the readings otherwise. Some of the content actually helped me question the foundations of some of my own political beliefs - which I thought was a prettyimpressive feat for a class. You cover a lot of components of the criminal law, and will get a broader understanding of some of the workings of the criminal law. Nothing too in-depth or mind-blowing, but it's worth taking if you want to learn more about the American justice system.",
    "I would recommend this class as an easy writing credit. I hate writing, but I only had to write two papers and a paragraph each week for section. The tests are open note so it is relatively easy and you do not have to do all the reading. However, if you already have a good understanding of the criminal justice system, you will not get much out of this class. It is fun and easy, but not a class that broadens your understanding of the justice system.",
    "A really engaging and interesting survey of topics in the American criminal justice system. The class starts with the theory\/philosophy of the criminal law and transitions to how the system looks in practice. If you are even remotely interested in the topic, you will get a lot out of this class. Professor Huber is extremely talented at what he does. Take it!! Also, taking it WR is a great idea in my opinion--2 medium-length papers (two drafts on each, so it's pretty low-pressure), and a final only worth 15% of your grade. WOO!",
    "Crime and Punishment is a great way to learn about the law without having to pages and pages of legislation and without having to go to law school. You come away from the class understanding why you think about justice the way you do, even if you can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t decide if your thinking is the best in practice. So it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s doing what a class at Yale should, teaching you how to think.",
    "Take this class",
    "Really interesting class. If you want to keep up with the readings, and you should (since they'll be helpful in the exams and in understanding the lectures) you have to be ready to put quite a lot of work on it. I took it writing intensive, and I definitely liked it - even though the final (shorter than the non-writing one) wasn't that hard. I guess it's up to you - if you're ready to put a lot of work on those papers, and avoid taking the midterm, then you should writing intensive. However, the writing intensive TFs are usually pretty hard graders",
    "Take this course! It reminded me of MoFoPo, which I really liked. There's not much work; just a midterm and final. You can also take it writing intensive, but if you don't, there's just those two exams.",
    "If you're interested in the American criminal justice system at all, this is a class I would recommend taking. Even if you're not a political science major, the readings and lectures are interesting enough that it is worth taking the class. There isn't that much work you have to do if you take it non-writing intensive (midterm, section and final). Professor Huber's lectures attract students and the readings provide a good background of Supreme Court cases and various theorists on the law and its purpose.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone who is interested in political science, interested in working in law, or just looking for an interested class to take.",
    "Take this course. It will challenge your view of how law works and makes you think about why you believe what you believe politically and socially. It's one of those Yale courses that you believe that all your classes would be like when you applied. It's a world survey course and you just understand what it means to be a citizen of the world better.",
    "Easy poli sci course, open note exams but make sure you have a good overview of all of the material. Professor summarizes readings and their pertinent points for exams\/review in lecture so I'd suggest you attend that.",
    "Crime and Punishment was a really good course. It's a typical political science course - lectures coupled with many readings from different theorists and case studies. I took it Writing Intensive so 70% of my grade came from two papers, and I had a 15% final. I would definitely recommend taking it as a writing credit - Nick, my TA, was very helpful in providing comments and assistance if ever needed. We didn't have a lot of extra work (I'd heard that regular sections had weekly reading responses) The papers weren't easy to write (8-10 pages) but were graded fairly - taking consideration of improvement between drafts. There were a lot of readings though, some were pretty dense and dry. I, personally thought that the class would be more practical applications of the CJS but it wasactually, as Huber promised on the first day of lecture, a political science take on the CJS. I wouldn't recommend it unless you're interested in the criminal justice system and its workings though. It can get pretty dull at times.",
    "Yes this is an awesome class! You will learn so much just from lecture and the reading is interesting too.",
    "HIGHLY recommended. Awesome lectures, really interesting readings. I would take another class with Professor Huber in a heartbeat. We learned things everyone should know about the American justice system and the readings were nicely calibrated to lectures, complemented each other well, etc.",
    "Huber is one of the best lecturers at Yale. He is incredibly clear and smart. I would suggest taking notes on a laptop because he talks so fast (mostly because the classes are only 50 minutes long). The course material is also really interesting. There's a good amount of reading, and it's not essential to do all of it, but most of the readings are worth your time. I would definitely try to do the readings before section.",
    "I enjoyed Crime and Punishment. You learn about important issues of our time, and criminal justice issues are a great lens into how we view society, and the state. Because there are not many classes like this at Yale, I say take it.",
    "It's the kind of class that's easy if you do all the readings. Most of the readings are quite interesting, so that's really not that bad. Ultimately you learn about the Criminal Justice system from the perspective of law, philosophy and sociology.",
    "A great class. Prof Huber is fantastic and you're going to learn so much. Most importantly, you're going to learn things that matter in the real world. Definitely take it if you can.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student.",
    "A perfect class for those interested in criminal justice or more broadly, morality and human nature.",
    "Yes. The course material is very interesting. You have to notice that the work load is heavy. However, this course is worth that much work, especially if you are interested in studying law in the future.",
    "The topics and lectures were awesome and the workload isn't too heavy. No reason not to take it.",
    "Such a great class. I took it Writing, which meant two 10 page papers (you get to write rough drafts, get comments, and then the final paper is graded), and a shorter, open-book, open-note final worth 15% of your grade. I thought this was a great way to structure the class, as the papers made sure I read and understood a lot of the readings, but I definitely didn't have to read everything on the syllabus. That said, most of the readings are very interesting, so you'll want to read as much as you can. The lectures are also fascinating. If you're interested in criminal justice or at all curious about law, definitely take this class.",
    "I would recommend this class if you have an interest in law but the writing intensive section is difficult because the paper questions are challenging.",
    "A good class but a lot of reading, so much that it is impossible to do all of it for every class. Prof Huber usually goes through the important readings in lecture, which is useful. However his lectures also end up being a lot of broad unanswerable questions answered by more questions. It is definitely not just based on an analysis of the criminal law but also the philosophy behind the criminal law.",
    "Definitely take it if you're interested in the subject matter - it'll give you a bunch of different view points on a few really interesting issues (educational justice, juvenile justice, insanity, defendant's rights, etc.). You don't necessarily have to do all the reading each week, but do go to lecture. Huber's really entertaining, and the points he makes are well-argued. Also, definitely take it for the WR credit (all you do is write two papers).",
    "It was really interesting and actually applicable to life. The workload was light and the exams easy",
    "This is a great class if you are interested in the criminal justice system. Great professor, reasonable workload. The stuff on the syllabus is interesting, whether you like the philosophical side of it or take the more pragmatic approach.",
    "Definitely recommend the class! Not to heavy a work load but genuinely interesting readings that you will want to actually do. Lectures are also amazing. One of my favorite\/most interesting classes yet.",
    "I would recommend this class but be careful of the readings, especially since your whole grade is basically the final and the midterm.",
    "Yes, I strongly recommend. No matter if you are a poli sci major or a pre-law, this is a class you need to understand the workings of society and its legal structures.",
    "I would recommend this class because it offers an interesting and fresh perspective on the criminal justice experience. I would recommend the writing section because it is completely manageable and the paper topics, like the course material, are very engaging.",
    "You the student learn about the philosophical support\/ conceptions of crime and punishment, you learn about the justice system, you learn about the search for criminals, and you focus on many interesting themes such as whether or not society is fair.",
    "Great course, definitely take!",
    "Great Credit D or 5th class. Very interesting lecture. Tests are straight forward and not that hard, considering that you can use your notes.",
    "Interesting class. Engaging material. Not that much work.",
    "I would recommend it",
    "This course is a great introduction to crime and punishment in America. It has a fair amount of reading, but I didn't notice that until looking at the page count after the course, as it is going it feels extremely manageable and very interesting. I took it writing intensive and liked it a lot - the workload wasn't too much, and felt like it was providing ways to get more deeply into the material. Dr. Huber is a fantastic lecturer, I really enjoyed it. If you are interested in the subject but don't have much background in it, I strongly recommend this course.",
    "This is a meaty, fascinating, wide-ranging course, focusing on one of the most interesting issue areas in American politics. Great variety of readings -- from a number of disciplines and a number of perspectives -- and thoughtful, well-organized lectures. The writing-intensive option is a challenging, interesting way to earn a WR credit; it can be a lot of work, but I'd recommend it. Section is required, but not crucial to a thorough understanding of the material -- though, with a good TA and a fun group, it's likely to be enormously helpful, so shop around and choose carefully. Be aware that the writing assignments leave virtually no room for research; your ten-page paper will be ten pages of philosophical argument, though writing TAs will help out if you're uncomfortable with this. Overall, I'd recommend enthusiastically, especially for anybody who thinks they might be interested in law.",
    "I never knew I had an interest in the criminal justice system until I took this class. The topics are varying and all extremely interesting. I learned a ton in this class. It was also fairly relaxed and was my least stressful class."
