    "If you like evolutionary biology or just want a quick systemic review of species, great course.",
    "I really loved this class. It was fun, interesting, and the information was presented with such enthusiasm that it was just really easy to learn all of it. Prof Clement is awesome and super nice, and she honestly loves what she is teaching. She makes class fun; I never once dreaded going to class. Even when I was exhausted from other classes, I never wanted to miss a class! If you take it writing intensive (for the WR Credit), then you just have small assignments throughout the semester to help with the final paper, like picking a topic, writing an abstract, etc. It's nice because it kinda forces you to start on the paper early. There is amidterm and a final, and 2 small quizzes that are not a big deal at all. It's a pretty easy class overall, just lots of information. You should definitely take it!",
    "LOTS OF MEMORIZATION.TAKE THIS CLASS.Wendy is a truly amazing professor. I always felt like going to class just to hear her talk.Final - 30% (hope this will be good)Paper - 30% (this was a pain, but the TA helped)Midterm - 20% (relatively straightforward)2 Quizzes - 10% (not hard but frustrating)Participation - 10% (just go to class and smile)",
    "I would recommend this to another student. It is an interesting class with a lot of information. But at the end of the semester you will have learned a lot about evolution in the animal kingdom.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course. It's a great writing credit- only one 12-15 page paper. The exams\/quizzes do require a lot of memorizing, but if you're good at that you should be set. Overall, the professor is very nice and approachable, and the material is pretty interesting. As a non-science major, I enjoyed it and found it to be very manageable.",
    "Diversity of Life is a course that overviews the many lineages of organisms on Earth. The course starts with the basics of evolution and moves its way eventually to animals and mammals. I would definitely recommend this course to any student interested in ecology or evolution. The writing intensive option requires a lengthy research paper, but if one paces the material well, this course is not heavy in terms of workload."
