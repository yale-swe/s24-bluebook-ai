    "This course is a survey of ancient world civilizations and a short overview of evolution. It is a great course to take if you are interested in archaeology but have very little background. The readings are actually interesting but not vital to doing well in the course. I would definitely recommend the class.",
    "I would take it!",
    "This is a quick and basic run-through of archaeology, prehistory, and, eventually, ancient civilizations. This isn't the course to take if you're interested in one specific region or time period, but it is a sufficient introduction to archaeology as a whole. I would recommend this class to students interested in archaeology or long-term historical trends.",
    "Do not expect to cover great civilizations until the second part of the term- the first is mostly biological anthropology and early humans. Still, great intro to archaeology- that is really what the course should be called- and a class I am happy I took. Mostly readings, one 5-7pg paper, and a noncumulative final with still quite a bit of material onit.",
    "Don't take it unless you have to for your major. The course is very unstructured; the lectures and powerpoints jump around way too much, and Anne Underhill, although nice, tends to pick favorites and has a voice that is easy to tune out.",
    "I wouldrecommend the class, but I would not strongly recommend the class. I thought that it was a good class, but not a great one. Definitely interesting most of the time, not necessarily always.",
    "Anthropology 171 is a crash course in archaeological methods and findings, going from early hominid fossils up until the spanish land in the new world, and highlights the processes that contribute to urbanism and civilization. If you want to stay interested in the course, you're going to have to use the text as a starting point, basically telling you what to research in other books or articles outside of class, because the writing can at times be frustratingly surface-deep and repetitive.",
    "It's an interesting 4th or 5th class if you're looking for one.",
    "I would summarize it as a broad survey of human history, spanning many interesting topics. I would recommend it to someone who was looking for something different to take on.",
    "Yes, I would recommend the course. It is a good survey of some of the most important work in archaeology and introduces students to a wide array of knowledge about the birth of civilization and the origins of humans. The book is really well-designed, and I found that reading it and attending lecture (with any additional studying necessary for exams and papers) was more than enough to feel equipped to succeed in the course. I really enjoyed it.",
    "A study of preclassical human society and development.",
    "Stretched-out survey course. Lectures can be quite boring sometimes, but sections are somewhat intellectually profitable."
