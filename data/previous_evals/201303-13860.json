   "comments": [
    "Take this class if you have an interest in financial crises, otherwise maybe not.",
    "Absolutely take this class. Professor Roach has a unique take on macroeconomics, less focused on the strict academic theory and much more practically focused. This is an applied macro course, where you will think about real world economies and the problems they face. Definitely one of a kind.Seminars each week consist of a short lecture by Professor Roach, a presentation by students, and guided discussion. Work includes questions on the reading submitted each week, two papers, one presentation, and a final paper proposal and final paper.",
    "This is the best Econ class I have taken so far, and definitely one of the few offered by the department that is based on real-life material. You will definitely learn a lot, not only about Japan, but also about how the global economy works and how policy affects the real economy. Expect to spend a lot of time on this class: you will have to send in well-thought questions on the weekly readings, complete two long homework assignments, make a (hard) presentation, and write a 15-20 page paper. This might seem like a lot of work but it is definitely manageable and Roach is really accessible and helps students a lot. Bottom line: take the class!",
    "If you are interested in macro issues - role of government in economic progress and decision making, monetary policy, political economy - this class will serve as an excellent overview. Professor roach is fantastic and very accessible, and the classes are pretty lively. The decent but not overwhelming amount of work, combined with the really appealing subject matter and the quality of your classmates, makes this a class worth taking.",
    "A good class. Has my vote of approval.",
    "Unfortunately, I don't think this was a worthwhile class. It will still teach you the ins and outs of economics in East Asia...but not up the the hype.",
    "Great study of Japanese economic history but with great tangents into US and Euro crisis and economic policy",
    "Take this course! If you love macroeconomics, forensics, the intersection between economics and public policy, and\/or Japan, then take this course! Professor Roach is fantastic - a wonderful professor - and he chooses a wonderful group of students. The readings and material are so interesting, the class discussion is fun, and the work (weekly reading assignments, a couple of homework assignments, a presentation, and a 20-page final paper) is not too bad.",
    "Yes! If you like macro, this is great real-world thinking.",
    "Roach might only have a few key thesis about the economy, but it's really the discussions that make this course given how much debate there is about the economy. His slides are the best: clean and concise. His forensics approach towards macro is pretty interesting and I do appreciate the emphasis on evidence and empirical data before making any assertions about the economy. If you want to have an in-depth but still broad understanding about today's economy, definitely take this class.",
    "I did not enjoy this class. The premise of the class is using \"forensic macroeconomics\" to figure out what went wrong in Japan's economic crisis and what lessons could be avoided. In reality, only a small portion of the course was spent talking about Japan, and most of the discussions centered around nebulous, non-empirical discussions of various policy strategies. I do not like Stephen Roach at all.",
    "Yes",
    "Ultimately, I would recommend the class, but I would expect to be confused and frustrated. This may be one of those classes where you don't know what you got out until much later.",
    "Roach is fantastic, the class is interesting, the grading is fair, there is not a lot of work (until the final paper), and I would definitely suggest this class.",
    "A good forensic macro class with comparative knowledge from around the world. Overall very informative. Papers are fair and designed in a way that really makes you think about your own policy stance. Discussion can be dominated by a few in the class."
