    "Wonderful course! Take it!",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. It's hard to get into, but it's worth it if you can make a compelling argument.",
    "Yes",
    "take this but be very passionate about a couple of things in it and don't let yourself feel overwhelmed by section assholes.",
    "Take it! You need to speak up in class constantly. 50% participation, 50% final paper. If you are shy\/quiet this is not the class for you.",
    "Prof Kahl is very nice and the material is interesting (you read many of the foundation authors in welfare state theory) but discussion was a bit lackluster and sometimes involved simply regurgitating the authors' ideas. Shop it and see.",
    "Yes, but only if you are interested in the topic.",
    "I would only recommend the class if the student is truly interested in welfare states. If you think it could be interesting, you'll eventually get bored.People in the class who were clearly very passionate (and well-versed) got more out of it and didn't tire so quickly of discussing the same themes.",
    "I really wish this class, and plenty of other poli sci classes at Yale, would start by giving students a helpful crash course into what they're studying. Profs often forget how little the students know at the outset about the subject of the class and jump straight into theory that no one can talk intelligently about because they don't have enough background. A class on welfare states should start be explaining how various welfare states work, for those of us who didn't grow up in Europe! (Instead, this one asked us to research that fundamental and prerequisite question as part of... our final paper.) It should also be centered around discussion of some fascinating issues that, while the class did cover them, were not explored satisfactorily because we spent class time groggily rehearsing the readings' main points instead of discussing them, challenging them, etc.I think this class is worth taking but if you're like most people, you probably thought something along the lines of \"Oh, welfare states - that's so important for how people's lives work in the first world and I'm really interested in learning about (1) how they function, (2) why and how they're different in various countries and (3) how they can be fixed to help people more!\" You will get your feet wet in the area of number 2, and possibly learn about number 1 while doing your final paper, but number 3 isn't there yet in this class. Prof. Kahl is really awesome, though, and I bet she can make a few quick changes to get students thinking like her (her own theories about the effect of religion on the welfare state are really, really cool) instead of kind of coasting through stuff.",
    "It is a great course; the professor is cool and very nice and the information studied is interesting. You should certainly consider taking this course because of the unique perspective it will provide comparing various welfare states.",
    "This course was great to learn about the western welfare systems, and what they involved!"
