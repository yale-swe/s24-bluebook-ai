   "comments": [
    "I would only recommend this course if it's necessary to satisfy the language requirement after taking L1-L2 French or if one has a pressing need to learn to speak French. Otherwise, there are many less stressful language courses to take.",
    "I would recommend this class especially if someone wanted to do a study abroad program in France later on in their Yale career.",
    "French 130 is a great class. Take it with Madame Lambert! She is amazing. The class is a lot of work, but it is very rewarding in the end. My french definitely improved over the semester. Do the work, and it is absolutely worth it.",
    "TAKE FRENCH 130. I love it. I think it massively improved my reading, writing, and listening skills. It was a fair course and an enjoyable one, filled with great students and teachers.",
    "Yes, it is a great intermediate French class.",
    "I would recommend French at yale.It is well planned out and all the teachers are enthusiastic. The work is not too strenuous and the books and films are interesting.",
    "French III is a good course to take if you've gone through French I and II at Yale--you'll be right where you need to be at the beginning of the semester. If you test into French III, you may struggle quite a bit at the beginning. Alternately, you may also find yourself a step ahead.",
    "Yes! French 130 is completely different from L1 and L2. Forget Mireille and Robert, this class covers interesting french novels and films."
