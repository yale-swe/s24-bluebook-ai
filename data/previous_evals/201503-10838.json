   "comments": [
    "I would recommend it, but with the warning that they should be careful about trying to tease out what the purpose of each lecture is, perhaps by looking over the notes again immediately after class when the \"entire picture\" of the lecture is more clear.",
    "Take it if you have to.",
    "Absolutely.",
    "I would strongly recommend this course to another student.",
    "Buy the book and READ IT.",
    "CHEM 518 shows the fundamental intermolecular and intramolecular interactions. I would recommend this course, because it contains both physical and organic chemistry.",
    "I would absolutely recommend the class to another student. The class was engaging and covered my significant topics in physical organic chemistry.",
    "Yes, I would recommend it. You definitely learn interesting things and the workload is pretty light and manageable.",
    "Jorgensen is a very entertaining lecturer, but be prepared to take notes on everything as he tends to bounce around. I would recommend the course.",
    "Worth your time for your information. Take Jorgensons bullshit with a very large grain of salt.",
    "I am divided on this question. I did enjoy the material presented in this course and would recommend the course based on that; however, I thought the organization and teaching methods used in this course were underwhelming. The material was all over the place, and it was very difficult to retain a lot of information from class. Based on those factors, I would not recommend the class.",
    "It was an informative, essential course for any student studying chemistry. I would definitely recommend this course to another student because I learned a great deal through it. The professor is amazing and the topic is important in any field of chemistry."

   "comments": [
    "The course did provide some good background information that I think will be helpful, but it was not the best course for an inorganic student. Without an alternative, it is alright, but if something better came along I would recommend that over this course.",
    "I learned things.",
    "Learned some advanced concepts in organic chemistry.",
    "I was very pleased to have a course that dealt with physical organic chemistry. I had been seeking a more systematic treatment of known phenomena since learning them piecemeal in the introductory courses I took.",
    "This course showed the basic interactions, and gave me ways to analyze solvent effect and stereochemistry.",
    "The course provided a broader foundation for what synthetic organic chemistry is based on. In that regard the class was an excellent addition to my understanding of chemistry. The material in the course will definitely aid my work in future research.",
    "learned a ton of valuable info on pericylic reactions",
    "This course helped me think about thermodynamics in a way I had not considered before.",
    "This course definitely related to my discipline. Even though I am not a student in the organic division and this course will most likely not directly contribute to my research, this course addressed fundamental topics relevant to all chemistry. It was a great review of such topics.",
    "I did not have a very strong background in physical organic chemistry, so taking the class definitely helped me learn some material that will be important to know in my future research."
