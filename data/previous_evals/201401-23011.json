   "comments": [
    "I would not recommend it to anyone who does not have to take it.",
    "MCDB 630 provides an overview of biophysical techniques to a group that may otherwise not get any exposure to it. It's a good idea for a class in general, but several sections of the class did not seem to pique much student interest. I would recommend the class to a student that studied biophysics.",
    "Kind of boring. I wouldn't recommend it unless it's a requirement.",
    "It's an important course but it could be organized in a better way to improve the information delivery efficiency.",
    "It's a MCGD rite of passage, so just endure it.",
    "I would not. I felt a lot of time on this class was wasted in tours of the labs, poor lectures, and badly written problem sets. Most importantly ,the core concepts were not emphasized enough. I did not actually learn the basics of most of the techniques until I did independent reading.",
    "It is a class in which you will learn many biophysical techniques to analyze proteins. If you plan on characterizing proteins for your dissertation then I might recommend the class. Otherwise I would not, but the class is a requirement for MCGD so my recommendation doesn't really matter",
    "Nope. Right now, it's just terrible. The lectures are so boring that the whole class contemplates skipping every time, and the practicals are not useful. Looking at shiny equipment that you can't touch gets old.",
    "There was a lot of busy work that did not seem useful to do, just time consuming.",
    "a must introduction; may need a lot more self-study after class to master the contents",
    "I would recommend this course, although I would also recommend additional readings to best understand the material. The course fluctuated dramatically from \"very easy concepts\" to \"impossibly opaque\", but overall I learned a lot (especially since I am not from a biological background).",
    "In this course, one learns about different biophysical and biochemical techniques, gains hands-on experience with these techniques in live demonstrations, and synthesizes and analyzes these techniques in a final paper. I would recommend this course for a fellow student.",
    "Possibly, if required. Definitely if aforementioned reforms were enacted.",
    "Recommend. One can get exposure to all these techniques that are helpful in biomedical research.",
    "Yes. It gives a good introduction to many different techniques."

   "question_text": "How did this course deepen your knowledge of your discipline\/profession? To what extent did this course contribute to your dissertation\/research?",
   "comments": [
    "I feel less intimidated by some technology that I can potentially use in my thesis work, but I have no appreciation for exactly how I will use it in my thesis work.",
    "I will be using a couple of techniques discussed for my thesis, but many of the techniques we covered will never be touched on again.",
    "I was exposed to mass-spectrometry and Cytof, techniques that I had not been exposed to. Since we have a mass-spec core, I am encouraged to use those facilities in the future for my own research.",
    "Outside of the method papers, it was really boring. Most of the lecturers were very sleep-inducing (Pyle, Bewersdorf, and one or two others being exceptions)",
    "It gave me a little better of an understanding of what other techniques were out there and what they were used for, but for the most part it didn't expand or deepen my knowledge much. This is because most of the techniques I already understood atthe level that they were teaching it at, and for those that I didn't, it was taught at such a complicated level without any background that it was difficult to get much out of it! Also, the final paper which could have helped contribute to my research, was prevented from doing so by the rules of the assignment which stated that we could NOT work on our own research.",
    "I basically learned a tiny bit about each technique and where the different core facilities were located. Beyond that, a lot of my time was spent trying to figure out what the problem sets were actually asking, and standing around while people tried desperately to explain how some instrument worked to a cramped room of people who could rarely see the instrument or even understand what was being said.",
    "Part of my problem with the course is that I don't think that my dissertation research will involve the characterization of proteins taught here. As such I did learn about the techniques presented in class, but I do not think that they will apply that much to what I'm doing.If anything what I learned is that if I need to use one of these techniques, I can contact the appropriate core facility and get real training.",
    "This course introduced me to a variety of techniques that I did not previously know about and that I can now consider using when planning research projects.",
    "I wish that it had helped me, because I do quantitative research and would love to use some of the techniques. Unfortunately, I feel completely ill-equipped to do so.",
    "Not yet sure",
    "exposure to various advanced modern technology",
    "This introduced me to many new methods. Even if I didn't understand how they worked, I still learned what they are capable of and in the future I will know what types of techniques will be applicable to my research and who to contact for more information.",
    "I learned detailed information about many techniques that I was previously unfamiliar with, including electron and STED microscopy and kinetic analyses.",
    "I don't feel that a lot of the things we learned in class will directly apply to my research."
