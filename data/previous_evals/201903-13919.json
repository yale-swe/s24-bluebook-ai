    "A historical perspective of gender and disability through the lens of performance\/composition, better understanding of intersectionality today, skill in reading and analyzing old academic texts.",
    "How to read academic writing, think critically about 3 disciplines, analyze music through a disability and feminist lens.",
    "Taught me how to affectively read and critique academic writing. I also learned A LOT about Gender Studies and Disability studies that I was just completely unaware of previously.",
    "I learned about the ways in which structural oppressions like ableism and misogyny altered the lives of marginalized composers and performers and how femininity and disability have often been attributed to and shaped by musicians and music.",
    "This course allowed me to refine the ways in which I talk about complex issues of identity. The types of knowledge I gained on the topics discussed in the course were also valuable, but as someone who has already studied a bit in those fields, the information wasnt revolutionary. However, there was a big focus in the course on writing in a way that is both accessible yet refined, and that is a skill I really appreciated polishing. I have also gotten much better at quickly reading and processing overly academic language, and Ive learned to critique the authors given to me rather than take their words at face value.",
    "Introduced to disability theory, musicology, and queer theory; learned how to read and discuss academic writing pertaining to the subject"

   "comments": [
    "I loved the opportunity to engage with students about these important and sensitive topics, and I felt like I had a space to share my own experiences and be vulnerable. I really enjoyed the structure of the class and how much discussion we were able to have.",
    "I loved how much discussion there was and our class ended up becoming very close. I always looked forward to going to this class because of how engaging our discussions were. At times it may have been nice to have slightly more structure, but there really were not many weaknesses with this class.",
    "The concept of this course is fascinating, especially as it pertains to Professor Peritzs specific field of study. The weeks on the castrati were for sure the best of the course. In general the readings were extremely well-chosen and intellectually stimulating. However, in-class discussions often lacked structure to a degree that undermined learning. Since the course was so broad in historical scope, it would have been helpful if classes were spent providing context to readings or pursuing a specific line of inquiry about the topics at hand instead of allowing us to freely dissect the material. Since this class was an introductory-level seminar on a fairly niche topic, I think many students felt uncomfortable participating without more prompting and guidance.",
    "Strengths- extremely interesting readings and discussion Improvements- slightly more direction to avoid veering off topic would be helpful"

   "comments": [
    "Yes! I loved this course, and it changed the way I think about a lot of aspects of my own life.",
    "Yes! I loved this course. It combined three fields in really interesting ways, and I got so much out of it. I also loved the variety in readings and the opportunities to go to the Beinecke and New York to really see what we were learning about. I loved the discussions and classroom environment.",
    "Yes! It is super interesting and it makes you think about so much in many interactions you have in daily life.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student whose areas of interest tracked closely with material covered because I think it would be a really cool horizon-broadener for someone who already had devoted themselves to music or to womens studies in some sense.",
    "If a friend is interested in these topics, I would definitely recommend this class. It is a good way to get comfortable talking about them openly.",
    "Yes, I gained a lot of insight into humanities academia and into societal power structures. Some of the readings are a bit of a stretch but that's always addressed in discussion."
