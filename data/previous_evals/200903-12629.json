    "Take Religious Studies 101. This course is fantastic, and very necessary in a world where everyone thinks they understand the word \"religion.\" Professor Viefhues-Bailey not only gives decent background knowledge of Vodou, Buddhism, Catholicism and Judaism, but he also does a great job revealing many of the key issues in both academic and popular understanding of religion. If you plan on doing anything with religion at any time in your life, this course is a must!",
    "I came into this course not expecting very much to be honest, if for no other reason that it was a required course for all religious studies majors. And I expected it to be a class that just went over the major tenants of a few religions.However, I could not have been more wrong. This course has turned out to be one of my favorites at Yale so far, perhaps just for the joy of learning how to think in a new way. How does one study religion? That's what this class seeks to answer. In the future, if anyone ever asks me for recommendations on a class they should take, I will be sure to mention this one so long as Prof. Viefhues-Bailey is teaching it.",
    "Aside from being required for the RLST major, this class is an excellent small lecture. But note that this is not your typical Intro World Religion Class. You're not going to get parceled information on world religions but you will learn about 'religion' the category and the complexities of different traditions.",
    "It is super basic-- take it if ou want to learn very broad knowledge about religions, don't if you are looking for something more in depth.",
    "As you'll learn from the outset, this course is not going to give you the facts and figures about the four religions. By the end of it, I knew I didn't know as much about Judaism or Christianity as I possibly could, but that wasn't the point of the course. It's more a lesson in how to approach religions and identifying common themes that run through all four traditions that you study. The class make-up was a little tough to deal with -- there were senior RLST majors in the class, as well as juniors who had just started, and people who were not RLST majors at all. Maybe this will change in the future, but keep an eye out.",
    "It's a study of Afro-Caribbean vodou religion, Buddhism, Catholicism, and Judaism and their context in New Haven.",
    "I would recommend it if you want a different look at religion than just a survey \"Buddhism is...\" class. If you want to learn about religion in a more concrete fashion, take general world religion.",
    "I really enjoyed the field trips in this class. It is a very unique class in that we were able to take trips to a number of different religious centers and use the information that we learned there to supplement the class. It was frustrating, as it would be in any world religions class that we were not able to go in depth into an of the religious traditions.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS! While it is not a gut class (you have one page essays for eachof the four traditions and then three-pagers for each as well), you will get a lot out of it. Professor Viefhues-Bailey is phenomenal, a very kind man who is passionate about what he teaches and so entertaining. The workload is manageable, the classes double as discussion section sometimes but it's really lowkey. And there are FIELDTRIPS! What could be better than fieldtrips in college?",
    "A good class. You learn more about how to study and teach a religion than about the content of each religion. Also, the focus of gender and sexuality is really interesting although not as comprehensively engaged. A lot of written assignments and Professor Viefhues-Bailey can be a strict grader. In class lectures I felt like I got a lot of information and was able to engage with the material. Professor Viefhues-Bailey is also really a dynamic lecturer at times.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class! This class gives you an unique perspective on the \"world religions,\" in addition to Afro-Caribbean religion. The site visits allow you to see and learn things that cannot be communicated via textual study alone. Professor Viefhues-Bailey is fantastic.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone at all! The class requires no prior knowledge of religion and is especially conducive to those who are just curious to know more. If you are someone that already has a strong religious conviction, it is a very eye opening class that provides a link to other traditions around the world. The conncection to the community through site visits expands beautifully on lectures, and the instructor is fantastic. The amount of work is perfect, and the atmosphere of the classroom is ideal for exploring the concept of religion. This is a phenomenal class for any student at all!",
    "I would recommend it if you want to get a basic understanding of world religions, but you should realize that in the end you'll come out with more of a realization of how much religion varies by group and region than an understanding of each \"religion\" per say.",
    "Don't take it unless you're planning to be a religious studies major and have to. If you're just interested in a general overview of religious traditions or think the syllabus looks interesting, I'd think again, because I would have found it frustrating if I hadn't already known about each of the religions we studied.",
    "I was generally interested in the class material and therefore this was a class which I took just to learn more about the religions and therefore took it credit\/d\/fail. Becuase of this I found it not to be too challenging and even considered changing it to a grade but decided to stick with my guns on credit d part. He makes it clear that it is not a gut class and it is NOT, but I did feel that it was not one of the hardest clsss I've taken at yale. It's interesting and overall a good class to take, esp. if you are at all interested in the material.",
    "Don't take it unless you are CONSIDERING being a Religious Studies major.",
    "An interesting class is you're ready for it. Take it if you're really interested in religion. If you're just trying it out, it's still a decent class, but be ready to get pretty involved in deep questions about the nature of \"religion.\"",
    "I would recommend this course. I'm not a religious studies major, and I think if you are interested in the material you should definitely consider it. The course covers four major religions: Catholicism, Hasidic Judaism, Zen Buddhism, and Haitian Vodou (more commonly known as Voodoo). The site visits to various places are really interesting, and the readings are pretty good, too. And the highlight, clearly, is Professor Viefhues-Bailey. He's a gem in the rough at Yale--many people outside the religious studies department haven't heard his name, but he is fantastic. Shop the class to meet him and see what you think.",
    "I would highly reccomend this class for someone less interested in naming the specific rituals in each religion and more interested in learning about the social and philosophical contexts of religions and their interconnection. You get the most of this class when you are actually engaged in the discussions and reading materials.",
    "Religious Studies 101 is an introduction to world religions unlike any other: it will bring to life four traditions, Judaism, Catholicism, Buddhism, and Haitian Vodou, through fascinating readings and Professor Ludger Viefhues-Bailey\u0092s engaging lectures. You\u0092ll learn the methodology of religious studies and intertextual and critical ways of thinking on the way, as well as experience the real-life application of each religion through site visits in New Haven and on the Yale campus. I would certainly recommend this class to another student whether they are a seasoned religious studies major or a freshman\u0085anyone can take something from this class if they\u0092re interested in why and how people are religious, and what the terms \u0093religion\u0094 or \u0093religious\u0094 even mean.",
    "I definitely recommend the course. The reading was interesting and the papers were not too difficult albeit frequent. The course focused on the diversity of specific religions as they are dependent on specific cultural and demographic factors. Cite visits were an interesting and fun break from the normal class setting. The professor is very interesting and engages the students during class."
