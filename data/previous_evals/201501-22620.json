   "comments": [
    "Absolutely. The workload was manageable, the discussions were consistently interesting, and I felt I learned a lot.",
    "Great class to learn about the Middle East both compared to other regions, but also within the region. Has something for everyone interested in the region and is very accessible.",
    "Probably one of the best classes on the Middle East around at Yale!",
    "As much as I thought I might enjoy this class, it was one of my least favorite I've taken at Yale. The content was infinitely less exciting than made out in the first class, the focus on statistics in the papers was too high, and the professor clearly played favorites. In short, no, I do not recommend this class.",
    "Take this class if you want a broad survey of different issues in the Middle East, but come to class prepared and preferably with some sort of background in the region. If you know little about it, you should still think about taking the class, but just recognize that you'll have to work harder. There'll be some dense papers but interesting subject matter and discussion.",
    "PLSC 389 Middle East Exceptionalism is a great class for someone who knows very little or very much about the Middle East. The class discussions are informative and enjoyable, and the workload is balanced with three graded reading responses during the semester and then a final paper.",
    "Take this class if you are at all interested in the Middle East. It is really, really interesting. The class isn't too much work and Professor Lawrence is amazing. You don't need pre-existing knowledge on the Middle East for this class, but also I wasn't bored with it with a reasonable sizable of background knowledge. She runs in class discussions really well and I like the choice of readings.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class for anyone interested in learning more about the ME.",
    "Great class, very informative, very interactive and engaging. If you like learning about the modern middle east, this is a fun way to do it."
