    "The course started off not being too hard and with a quite manageable and reasonable workload. The first three assignments could each be done in about 10-15 hours.Then it got harder. The fourth and fifth assignments probably took 20-25 hours.Then it got crazy. The sixth assignment was to finish the compiler. There were 3 last parts of the compiler that still had to be built, so the class is divided up into three teams. Each member of each team builds his own version of the part he is assigned. Then he chooses one version of each of the other two parts (that he didn't work on) and puts them together to make a working compiler. The three parts were ItreeGen, Codegen, and RegAlloc. I chose ItreeGen and probably spent over 50 hours on it. The CodeGen people probably spent a comparable amount of time. I think the RegAlloc people had to spend the least amount of time.The seventh assignment was a project of your own choice, so I decided to implement RegAlloc. This was significantly less time-consuming than ItreeGen; it only took me about 20 hours.",
    "Every CS major should take this class. Yes, it does become a large amount of work at the end, but it's worth it. You get to build a compiler...how cool is that?",
    "This is not an easy course, but it is a good one."
