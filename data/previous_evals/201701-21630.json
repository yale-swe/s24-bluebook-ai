    "I learned a lot about Esping-Andersen's welfare regimes model. It was extremely helpful to know for other classes.",
    "I gained a deeper understanding of the different welfare systems in North American, Scandinavian, and Western Europe countries and how these various systems came about.",
    "Welfare States provided me with a broader understanding of how welfare states develop differently and what factors (cultural, political, and social) either facilitate for prevent the development of a comprehensive welfare systems. The structure of the class was really neat and allowed everyone to engage with each other each week. The weekly reflection statements were also a nice low-pressure way to have us further engage with the material outside of class.",
    "I learned more real word application of politics than I have in any other class.",
    "This course was the first time that I was introduced to terms such as moral economy, welfare state regimes, commodification, familialization, etc. I learned about the different types of welfare systems in the Western world, and how these regimes result in social contracts between the public and subgroups such as women, minorities, the disabled, the poor, the religious, etc. There are a large variety of topics, all centered on the idea of how deserving individuals are. Sigrun Kahl teaches you to think in a particular way that cuts the bullshit of a lot of mainstream academiaand integrates her own work in order to have you participate in cutting edge research.",
    "We engage with a couple of particular frameworks for looking at welfare. I feel like I gained an important understanding of political, though not moral\/philosophical, models for different types of welfare regimes, and I feel confident about the political (and some of the psychological and historical) underpinnings of the modern welfare regime."

   "comments": [
    "The strength is that it is a fun and intriguing course, while it doesn't require too much work. It was fun!",
    "Far too much for class participation in the grading distribution",
    "I loved syllabus and the reading material. The reading list was well curated, but I wish we spent more time discussing the readings for the week. At times, we got behind and spent much longer on one subject while not spending enough times on our other readings. I wish our classes had been a little bit more organized. Also, I really enjoyed the time section dedicated to discussing reparations.",
    "The course successfully covered a lot of subject material. However, the class could be a bit disorganized at times, and it happened often that the readings that were assigned for a given week had to be rescheduled because we had fallen behind. However, this would only happen because we would get a bit carried away with our class discussions and because the material was so interesting. Overall, I think Prof Kahl did a good job at balancing discussion and material, but in the future it might help to be a bit more strict with time limits.",
    "Professor Kahl is a great thinker but very bad at managing a classroom, her constant messiness with time and lack of reliable email responses made the class had to take seriously",
    "It's very disorganized (we were often multiple weeks behind in the syllabus and class always started late) but ultimately engaging.",
    "The biggest strength of the course is the interesting course material. You will learn about welfare in relationship to different countries, and social contracts related to race, gender, disability, poverty, etc. The material opens up new worlds. The biggest weakness of the course is its organization, which is heavily related to the instructor. The sheer amount of roles that different students are supposed to play is super ambitiousand sets the class up for failure. Sigrun herself does a poor job of managing it: she forgets to post readings; she shows up to class late; she doesnt email you back; she changes the schedule every week. The bare bones of the course are thereSigrun just needs to do a better job of administrating this. This might be done through eliminating either the comment or the memo in order to simplify things.",
    "It is a great comparative course (America vs. other countries) that teaches a number of important concepts relating to welfare and its effects very well. However, the course as it was taught was pretty disorganized in some respects. It was great that we got to make our own schedule for the papers, but the discussion as a result was not always great. Another huge weakness is that most of the class is spent one framework (Esping-Anderson), which is a great model, and I'm glad I understand it well, though we definitely could have gotten to more in the later half of the course."

   "comments": [
    "Absolutely!",
    "I would recommend it to anyone who wants to learn about the different cultural, political, and economic factors that led to the inception of different types of welfare systems in North American, Western European, and Scandinavian nations.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student.",
    "I absolutely would recommend this.",
    "The syllabus is good but we got behind schedule, the professor is brilliant but bad at managing a classroom, I really don't think I could recommend the class",
    "I would only recommend this class to someone who is aware going into it that the class is not well-organized and is pretty structureless. However, if you learn better in a more informal conversational environment this is a good class to take.",
    "If I were rating this course based on before spring break, I would have easily given it a 1. Sigruns course is full of really interesting materials and classroom structuresbut her ambition as a teacher is obliterated by her unbearable and confusing organization skills. She forgets to post readings; she shows up to class late; she doesnt email you back; she changes the schedule every week. After spring break, I would give this course a 4. By then, we had gotten through the introductory materials and were delving in to super interesting topics related to welfare and its social and political role with women, minorities, the disabled, the poor, the religious, etc. Here, Sigrun really came alive, and was able to use her expertise to make seminar extremely engaging and interesting. She also became more endearing once you started to get used to her quirks. All of the students in the class started to get to know everyone else as the result of trying to figure out what the hell was happening in class. At the end of the day, Id give this course a 3. Sigrun is a sweet, caring, mixed bag instructor who takes getting used to, but you will walk away from this class having learned a lotand about incredibly interesting, pertinent topics. The syllabus is extremely ambitious and you wont get to most of itbut even the small slivers that you get to will open up new worlds.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. It's really interesting that it's cross-listed between Sociology and EP&E, as these majors have very different individuals. I was a little nervous as a Sociology major, as a lot of this was new material to me. But the mix of people creates an interesting and well-rounded dynamic of individuals with a wide basis of knowledge. The only difficulty is when we fell behind on the readings and things get a little out of order. It can be hard to be all on the same page when the readings can be unclear but Professor Kahl did a good job of sending out emails to let us know what to read, as opposed to following the syllabus."
