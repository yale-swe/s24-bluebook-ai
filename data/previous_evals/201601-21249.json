   "comments": [
    "I would only recommend it if the student is willing to work extremely hard. Though I learned a lot, the grading for the seminar is brutal.",
    "More intense than the lecture by far. Take it if you really want to learn macro (and are willing to face the curve). I wanted\/was willing to do both things, and got a lot out of the class.",
    "The class is pretty similar to a lecture, except in the grading.",
    "ECON 111 is an amazing course that I highly recommend if you are a student looking to really learn, conceptualize, and understanding macroeconomics. The way the seminar is set up really focuses on teaching students, and making sure they understand what's being taught: the professor makes sure that everyone is one the same page, and there is ample opportunity to interact with the professor and ask him questions during class or during office hours. In addition, you really get to know your fellow classmates, and there are study groups all around that foster friendships over macroeconomics! However, just be warned that there is grade deflation in this class. This seminar typically attracts only the students who really care about learning macroeconomics, and so the standard deviation in terms of grades is very low. This means a difference in 1-2 points will make you or break you, and can mean the difference of a letter grade. Take this class only if you're sure you will do well.",
    "Econ 111 is a small-class alternative to the large Macroeconomics lecture. The format allows for more personal interaction with students and professors, providing (in my opinion) a more thorough understanding to the subject. Econ 111 attracts a very specific type of student--one who is likely intending to pursue economics or business after graduation and who thrives in a small environment. If you're looking for a general introduction to macro, I would suggest the lecture course, which has a much more generous curve. If you're looking for a more intense but rewarding atmosphere and a closer relationship with the professor, Econ 111 is for you.",
    "Although econ seminars have the reputation of being much more difficult and intense than the lectures, they are worth taking. Professor Hawkins keeps the class interesting and is good at explaining difficult models and concepts in economics. The problem sets can be challenging, but his office hours are quite helpful if you bring specific questions to ask. Overall, parts of the course are less interesting but important for future economics courses, although there are many interesting lessons where the national and global economies are examined and analyzed."
