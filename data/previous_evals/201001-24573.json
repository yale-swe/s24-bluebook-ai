    "This class was cool, but pretty much the same as 151. If you don't want to take a year of the same kind of class, you should probably talk to the DUS and see if you can skip to the next level of classes. I think it's a fun class that involves interesting books and movies. I would recommend this class to other students because it is interesting and it really helps.",
    "A very good course; the work is constant, but not extremely heavy. The course can also be done in the summer in Paris, which is a great opportunity. I would recommend the class to all students interested in French.",
    "Typical French class. Homework three times a week, plus essays every other week or so, plus you watch some movies and read a lot of depressing stories. Some are more depressing than others."
