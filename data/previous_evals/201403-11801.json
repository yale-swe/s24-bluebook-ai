    "I would recommend this class to another student. The topics covered are very interesting and broaden one's view of the Americas.",
    "An enjoyable and engaging seminar. The class period flew by, due to the discussion-based nature of the course. I would definitely recommend the class.",
    "Yes I would recommend it. It was an intimate seminar that covered various aspects of travel literature throughout different time periods.",
    "I would recommend it. I would describe it as a vague history of the Caribbean and North America through its travelers, and also as a look at travel and how it incorporates many systems of power within it.",
    "I would tell them that it's fun and interesting. You'll really love the professor, the class discussion and the assignments, although some of the readings will be hit or miss. Sometimes you'll be enthralled by a reading, while other times it might be a bit of a struggle to get through and they'll be a little boring. But the teacher grades fairly, and you'll learn about a subject that's genuinely interesting and inter-departmental, so it can work towards a lot of different distributional requirements. I would tell another student that if there isn't another freshman seminar that already really speaks to them, Travel Literature of the Americas would be a great course to take and they wouldn't regret it."
