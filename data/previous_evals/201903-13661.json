   "comments": [
    "How to think critically about data and its spatial arrangement, how to visualize complex phenomena, how to work with D3. How to build images which tell stories, how to think about usability and interactivity, how to see.",
    "I learned about data visualization using d3.js, as well as data visualization theories.",
    "I learned D3 as well as the theory of visualization development, including the use of attributes like color, position, shape, etc. I also learned some history of computing and visualization.",
    "Not only did I learn D3.js but I also learned the concepts behind when to use specific visual idioms.",
    "I gained valuable and useful skills about JavaScript and making visualizations using d3.",
    "You learn to use D3, which is a neat JavaScript library helping you to create complex data visualizations, and you gain an understanding of data visualization theorems.",
    "This is a good introduction to both the principles and psych behind data visualization and the implementation of interactive graphics in d3. By the end we could make pretty and functional interactive visualizations, using data and methods of our choice.",
    "Learned about representing data! It was a really important and insightful class about color, perception, uncertainty, etc.",
    "I was exposed to ideas surrounding visualization that i had never considered before. I appreciate visualizations in a new way",
    "Learned a lot about combining HTML, CSS, and JS to create webpages that showed visualizations. Learned D3 which I would never have learned without taking this class.",
    "Learn how to program with d3, which is really cool. Basic HTML\/CSS\/SVG\/Javascript. Learned about the fundamental principles of data visualization and good practices of creating vizs",
    "D3.js, how frustrating JavaScript is"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: this class teaches you REAL, APPLICABLE, MARKETABLE skills. You walk away with a thorough understanding of viz. I loved every assignment. Weaknesses: steep learning curve. This class was equally painful and pleasurable. I spent upwards of 20-30 hours on psets. I started early only to have hints given days before the deadline which would have saved me hours of agony. Also the exams SUCK, the questions are super obscure.",
    "The problem set are pretty fun and open-ended. The tests are difficult as they require a lot of memorization of the textbook. The psets are graded pretty generously, so the grades in the class are pretty much determined just by the tests.",
    "D3 is incredibly useful and the problem sets did a good job of systematically developing my abilities in D3. The readings were generally helpful in getting me to think about the theory behind the choices one has to make in visualization development. The huge weakness of this course was some of the questions included on the two tests. The tests included incredibly esoteric questions designed to test nothing but rote memorization. I am certain that I will not use that random knowledge ever againthings like the specific words that Munzner uses in a chapter, or a particular person from visualization history. I knew those questions would appear on the tests from past course reviews, and I wasted hours studying all of this super specific information from the slides. I think it would be worth dramatically re-writing the tests, or cutting them from the syllabus entirely, because other than the tests, this class was fantastic!",
    "The course's largest strength is absolutely Professor Rushmeier -- someone incredibly talented and with such deep expertise in this area. The content was dry at sometimes, but I'm not sure how this could be remedied. Additionally, the exams relied on heavy memorization instead of synthesis, which felt like a step back in terms of what I should be learning from the course.",
    "Prof. Rushmeier is an incredibly nice and understanding teacher. The assignments are manageable and the grading is very generous. The midterms require a lot of memorization but otherwise the classwork is very doable compared to other higher level CS classes.",
    "It was always nice to look back after the end of one of the homework to see the results you created. In this sense, it is a practical and useful course. However, because of the start at 9.00, it was always hard to be on time for class. Moreover, I believe that there is a better format to test the class material in comparison to the pure memorization tests, which ask details that were covered only on one\/two pages in the slides.",
    "The lecture was at 9 AM so it was hard to stay alert during lecture. But the exams were fair and derived from the textbook\/lectures\/readings.",
    "I thought the homework assignments were very engaging, but the exams were too memorization based and felt very different from the rest of the course.",
    "The problem sets are enjoyable and provide a good introduction to the various kinds of visualization possible with D3. However, most of the information presented in lecture\/readings seemed either too general or too specific to be of much practical use, and was generally pretty uninteresting. The exams, being primarily memorization of this information, felt very disconnected from the problem sets and the actual practical knowledge that students will take away from the class.",
    "strengths: really interesting material and you produce almost an entire portfolio of visualizations. weaknesses: exams are worth a large part of your grade and you dont really know what to expect on the exams.",
    "The lecture weren't super exciting (mostly off of slides), although they were informative. Professor Rushmeier brought in some really cool guest lectures throughout the semester. Homeworks were really fun! Tests were tough if you don't study.",
    "Strengths: professor is nice, feedback on exams is immediate, good course logistics, lots of examples and applications presented during lecture \/ Weaknesses: lectures were too dry and focused purely on theoretical content on how we process visual information, which is interesting but not engaging enough, so many students (including myself) did not attend lecture. Problem sets were not creative enough, i.e. they were too much textbook D3.js problems. Overall, not much incentive to pay attention since you could just try to memorize content for the exams (which were based on the conceptual content presented during lecture) the night before the exam (unless you fall asleep doing so, like me). \/ Overall: would have preferred to spend more time during lecture on applications and implementation of D3 and real-world visualizations, rather than just talking about them."

   "comments": [
    "Absolutely. Best CS class I've taken (first-sem JR). You become very comfortable with JavaScript and will become a much better thinker and coder. It combines coding with design and psychology in an awesome way. DO NOT SKIP LECTURE. You will regret it come exam time.",
    "Yes, it is useful if you don't know html\/css, and the psets are pretty fun. The exams are pretty hard.",
    "If you're interested in learning D3 and some information about the theory and history of visualization, take this course. The lectures aren't super gripping, but it's a fun CS elective, and the problem sets are manageable. The one thing to be aware of ahead of time is that the tests are pure memorization of random, esoteric facts and words, so if you take this course, be prepared to spend a few hours twice in the semester studying.",
    "Professor Rushmeier is great and incredibly knowledgeable -- she's definitely a great prof to get to know. The PSETs are front-end (which I loved). The major caution of this course is that the exams require heavy memorization instead of synthesis. The weekly reading responses are also a tax. However, the feedback on the PSETs\/exams were great and I always knew how I was doing in this course. Lastly, this course really embodies data visualization; it's more than coding idioms: it's thinking about when to choose the right idiom. Because of the wide applicability of this course's content, I'd recommend it to any CS and CS-adjacent majors.",
    "I would recommend this course to any CS student who is looking for a higher level but doable CS class. The class material is very useful and application-based especially compared to other CS classes at Yale which are more theory based.",
    "Yes, when you're a CS student or when you're genuinely interested in data visualizations. This course is a great alternative to other dry and boring courses in the CS department. Although you'll likely spend a decent amount of time on fine-tuning the visualization to match the wished format, this course isn't as mind-challenging as other courses. This is great when you want to take an upper-level CS course without straining your workload balance too much.",
    "Yes! If you are interested in data science or CS or if you are in a field that involves presentation of data and you have some programming experience, this is a manageable elective that will give you a lot of practical skills and knowledge. The work is evenly paced out and slides are pretty comprehensive for reviewing.",
    "Yes! Useful information plus a fun and easy CS elective once you get a hang of debugging.",
    "Yes fun assignments, just study hard for the exams.",
    "This is a good elective if you want to play around with visualizations in D3. Be prepared to memorize a lot of random\/useless information for the exams.",
    "yes!",
    "Yeah, definitely a good CS elective for majors (interesting, not a huge workload). Even for non-majors, this is a really cool class, and learning d3 is really useful and be taken further to do really cool things.",
    "Yes, if you're looking to 1) learn D3.js or 2) take an moderate workload CS elective or 3) Cr\/D a CS elective. You probably won't gain much otherwise. Lectures are super dry."
