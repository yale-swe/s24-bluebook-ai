   "comments": [
    "This is a solid course, whether you take it after SPAN 120 or start in this level. There is not a huge emphasis on speaking, but they do take a lot of time to cover a variety of grammar and to develop reading skills.",
    "I would highly recommend SPAN 130 to a fellow student. I expanded my Spanish speaking abilities and became more confident expressing ideas in Spanish, the workload was manageable, and the content of the readings was interesting.",
    "Take this course with Fernando!! It's a great course that really helps to improve your Spanish literature and language skills.",
    "A lot of work but really improves your spanish speaking, comprehension and writing skills. Forces you to speak spanish everyday, which is good way to learn it.",
    "Fernando's da man-do. Take this class with him! He makes the dull, dry, dreary, dreadful course work more engaging and interesting than any other professor I've had.",
    "Take this class with Prof. Riva. His laid back style makes it easy to participate in class and makes having a 9:25 a.m. class everyday as painless as possible.",
    "I would summarize Spanish 130 as an overview of all Spanish up to the intermediate level. As someone who took a nearly two year break from studying Spanish, it was a good course because it helped me review anything I had forgotten. The class has too much busywork kind of homework (unnecessary but mandatory frequent but small tasks) and goes somewhat slowly, but overall is worth it if your intention is to move on to higher level Spanish.",
    "The course is enriching and you learn a lot.",
    "This exactly what you would expect for L3 Spanish. You learn a lot and get good practice, but you have to put in the daily work if you want to get something out of it!",
    "Similar to L2 with more grammar. Good class with the right professor.",
    "SPAN 130 01 is an Intermediate level Spanish-course focused mostly, but not completely on the writing and grammar of the language. The course is important to understand the apply the practical uses of the Spanish tenses and contexts as well as for skill-building in the area of writing and grammar. The writing is not intensive, however it is the goal of the course to improve in that area. The course is also very enjoyable, providing videos, discussion, stories, and culture readings within its weekly agenda."
