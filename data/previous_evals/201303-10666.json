   "comments": [
    "Fun half-credit course that helps quite a bit in ear training. We simply sit around a table listening to great music and writing it down. If this sounds appealing to you, take this class! Virtually no work outside of class (except for practicing for keyboard lessons).",
    "I would highly recommend this class to any musician. The skills are invaluable and the class is a pleasure. Sarita is a strong and effective instructor with great kindness and a wonderful sense of humor.",
    "Dictations, sight-singing, and keyboard lab. Same deal as 218 but with tougher examples. So much fun.",
    "This is a fun course that is not too difficult. I noticed a great improvement in my ear by the end of the course. Class time is almost always spent doing dictations, with occasional sight singing practice. There is no homework, except practicing for the keyboard lab. The keyboard lab is a weekly session with a grad student, in which you work on realizing figured bass. The class is only half a credit, and can easily be tacked onto your schedule as a fifth class without adding much stress. As a jazz musician, I would have preferred a break from strictly classical music for the dictations, but on the whole, I was really impressed with my progress in this class.",
    "This class is basically just daily dictations of beautiful music from different periods. Most people are taking it because they have to for the music major, but it was fun and worthwhile anyway.",
    "Music 219 is just the extension of 218, with the difference being that now we examine all real music and listen to recordings of symphonies, quartets, vocal arias, etc. and are expected to dictate those. The ability to identify passing chords and modulations is expected past maybe the first quiz of the class. Instead, we now spend time figuring out the innovative and different elements of each piece, and discuss the genius of each composer that makes their music exciting. The class moves fast and there isn't much time for review, but everything is done within a friendly and collaborative atmosphere, and Sarita is wonderful in helping everyone to succeed and find parts of the class and the music that inspire them."
