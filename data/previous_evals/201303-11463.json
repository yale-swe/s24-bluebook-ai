    "French 150 is an excellent class. It's a lot of work, but you're not really going to find any language classes that aren't a lot of work. The grammar work is very similar to what you've already done if you've taken AP French, but the readings and works studied are very interesting and fun to talk about. The small class setting can be a bit intimidating at first because everyone comes from different backgrounds in french, but please do not let that push you away from this course. TAKE THIS COURSE WITH MADAME HOFFMANN. She was unfortunately out of class for around two weeks, and the other french teachers had to substitute to take her spot, so I've had all of the L5 teachers, and I can say with confidence that madame hoffmann is by far the best.",
    "Lots of tedious boring grammar work that you might not always feel you're getting the full benefit from. Some readings are interesting others not so much. Take it if you need to get through L5.",
    "I would recommend the course to anyone who feels a little rusty or uncertain on numerous aspects of French grammar, to those who want a class that will whip their French into shape and those who want to both read and speak French. French 150 is not a good course for someone looking for purely an oral class, nor for someone who wants something wholly literature-based - the class includes elements of both.",
    "Good French class that works on all-around skills; it seems a natural follow-up to AP French. There is a fairly equal emphasis on writing, reading, and speaking French. The assessments are fair and reflect what we work on in class; the orals are nothing frightening if you prepare.",
    "This class asks far more work than a usual 1 credit course and while it is rewarding, I nonetheless think I would have gotten far more out of the courses if I'd been involved in a more intensive program, ideally through study abroad, as opposed to having this course work compete with my work in other classes. Do a french summer program!",
    "I would absolutely recommend French 150 01 for those interested in French. In addition to refining grammatical skills, class discussions on plays, films, and books were extremely interesting and definitely improved my French substantially.",
    "I would recommend French 150 as a good class after 140 to continue with French.",
    "Be ready to work hard on your grammar for this class. The tests and exams are mostly grammar even though the class hours are spent discussing the readings. Even though it meets only three times a week, the workload is high, specially when you have to watch a film in addition to other regular assignments.",
    "Coming into this course from a year off from French was challenging, so that could be something to consider if you're in a similar situation (or try to place up into a more interesting lit class that's less nit-picky on grammar). I generally found the course to be what I expected: a bit of reading, a bit of writing, a bit of grammar. Professor Hoffmann is very sweet and makes class time fly by."
