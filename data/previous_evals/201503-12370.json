   "comments": [
    "Its a course that is necessary for many subjects from econ to physics, so if a student likes math and is interested in one such subject it is definitely worth taking.",
    "It creates a good math foundations. Work hard outside classes.",
    "Please don't take Math 120 if you don't need to. Micki is great but I didn't get her, and chances are you won't too. The experience of the course varies greatly depending on what instructor you get. The course material is honestly not the most interesting, and the curve is rather harsh. After finishing it though, you may get a sense of satisfaction at how much you've covered in a short span of time.",
    "BE WARY OF THIS COURSE. That doesn't mean don't take it, it means consider whether you want to spend a semester taking a challenging introduction to multivariable calculus FOR PHYSICS\/ENGINEERING. While I'm sure many of the concepts taught in math 120 are transferrable to other fields, this course is for STEM majors (or, I guess, students who really love to compute surface integrals. Hint, hint: If you are interested in the social sciences, at least shop math 118. You will find absolutely no mention of anything social-sciency here). Before you take this because you think you need to for a major you MIGHT declare, if you are not already familiar with multivariable calc (because there will be plenty of kids in the class who are), look up what the terms on the syllabus mean and where they can be applied. If you think that is the type of knowledge you need, go for it. But if you're looking for a low-key QR, this isn't it. Also if you haven't taken multi before, DO NOT underestimate the challenge that is presented simply by having to think about complicated objects in three dimensions. Switching to multiple variables means not only new theorems, it means transitioning to three-space, which can be very difficult to visualize. That being said, if you understand what is going on, the homework may only take a few hours a week. But the exams are tough and packed with material. This is not a course you will be able to gauge just by shopping it, so rather than trying to assess its difficulty over so little time, it is more important to evaluate beforehand what you aim to get out of it. If you want to learn what is on the syllabus, you will be wiling to struggle (march victoriously) through it. If not, save yourself the time and energy.",
    "It's a cool class but don't slack because the things you learn as you progress builds off of material from previous chapters.",
    "I recommend this course to other students.",
    "I would say that I got unlucky with my section and professor, but there are other sections that are better run."
