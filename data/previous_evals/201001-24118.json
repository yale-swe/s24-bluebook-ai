   "comments": [
    "A great overview to learning the basics of urban studies. I would recommend it, however it is difficult to wake up at 9 o'clock on Mondays and Wednesdays. It is a large time commitment, and the readings are not easy. However, the class is completely worth it.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to another student. If you're interested in cities, it's ideal for you; if you're not, it's a great introduction to urban culture and gives you a perspective that will enhance your other classes, and who knows, maybe you'll find that urban studies or anthropology is the thing for you.The reading is significant, but interesting with lots of case studies, the projects are very cool, from developing a thesis out of observing a physical location in New Haven to working with community organizations. The final project required a significant amount of commitment, but the work was enjoyable and extremely valuable in that you get to interview New Haven residents, get out on the street and connect urban theory with a detailed aspect of New Haven, all while getting to know key figures in the community that you'll be living in for the next four years.Thus, a fair bit of enjoyable work that is never boring, a great professor and some unconventional projects that make for a nice switch up from the typical workload.",
    "It is a great introduction to anthropology and urban studies. You read Jane Jacobs, James Scott, Theodore Bestor, George Simmel, Setha Low. It is a great way to hone your writing. It was specifically interesting to me since it allowed me to interview people which I enjoy since I also write for the Yale Daily News and to write analytically about it. Ethnographic writing is like journalism except you are also making an argument. Great class! Everyone should take, if they have the chance to! It has made me consider becoming an anthropology major.",
    "Urban Culture, Space,&Power is a great intro to urban anthropology, taking you through many of the most important urban anthropological theorists. The readings are interesting and worthwhile, and Professor Harms is really kind, knowledgeable, and accommodating. The writing assignments can be fun and are not intimidating. If you're at all interested in urban studies, this is a class worth taking!"
