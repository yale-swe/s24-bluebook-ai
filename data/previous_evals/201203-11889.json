   "comments": [
    "You get a good basic overview of hundreds of years of really interesting Brazilian history, unlike the history of pretty much any other part of the world that I have ever read. Stuart Schwartz is a great lecturer, the class is well-structured, and a 4-6 page paper with an easily-graded midterm and final is a pretty light workload.",
    "HIST361 is the most absolutely amazing class! Seriously not only would I recommend it I would drag my friends to audit the class. This professor is not only a great lecturer he is very friendly, interesting, and his lectures always have you wanting more. Brazil is seriously one of the up and coming nations in the world and I find it very important to learn about this country. This class is essentially History of Portugal until early 1800's until the Independence of Brazil in 1822 at which point it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all about Brazil. This class is a good balance between light reading, lectures, and has one research essay of 6 pages to do. This class is a fantastic way to meet your distributional requirements and if you are interested in Latin American studies or Global Affairs this class provides a glimpse of what the Latin American world has to offer. I cannot stress to you enough how fantastic of a class this is and what a wonderful experience it has been.",
    "Take this class if you have any interest in Brazil, you won't regret it",
    "good for a history major who needs a rest of world.",
    "An amazing introduction to the History of Brazil. Prof. Schwartz lectures wonderfully on the themes ranging from culture, discussing Samba and syncretist religions, to the development of the economy as it relates to social movements. The workload in terms of assignments is not overwhelming. At the same time, if you decide to do all of the readings, there is a significant amount (but SO worth it! They don't overlap with the lectures and add an understanding of themes that are essential to a more complete understanding of Brazil).",
    "A good class if you are interested in learning about Brazil. But a lot of it is colonial. We barely talked about any recent history.",
    "This is a great class. The material is very interesting, and Prof. Schwartz is a terrific lecturer. I would definitely recommend it.",
    "Great class on a largely ignored part of history. A must take for history majors looking to fulfill their distribution requirements.",
    "This class is neither good nor terrible. The lectures are disorganized, but you learn some interesting stories and a basic sense of Brazil. If you're looking for a rest-of-world, you could do worse, but I wouldn't recommend it for someone just looking for a history class.",
    "It's a pretty interesting history and Schwartz is great. Not the greatest history course--it almost plays out like a history of sadness.",
    "Kind of boring class about a country that's supposed to be really cool and up-and-coming. Wouldn't recommend it unless you have a personal interest in Brazil.",
    "Take it if you want a good ROW requirement that isn't terribly difficult, and is pretty interesting. Brazil is a nation that has been growing and development for decades, and we really should know just how great an impact the nation of Brazil has had.",
    "Yes, definitely. Professor Schwartz is adorable and Brazil is a fascinating, unique country. There will be a lot of bored History majors in the class that drag it down, but there are also many students that are genuinely interested in learning about Brazil.",
    "Amazing class. Take it. Schwartz is a phenomenal lecturer and it's great to learn the history of one particular country that is so rich in culture and diversity. Definitely worth it.",
    "Good RoW history credit. Covers 400+ years of history, but Schwartz does it effectively and clearly. Not overwhelmingly interesting for the casual history taker, but a solid history course taught well. Not a ton of work or reading.",
    "History 361 is an excellent introduction to Brazilian history. The readings are interesting and range from a journalist's account of the Rio Carnival to a series of essays on the Brazilian Empire. Professor Schwartz was an engaging lecturer--he even mimed how slaves produced sugar in plantations. The course is flooded with new names and Portuguese terms, which may seem daunting. But the work is worth it, since you'll understand a rising global power and feel enlightened when attending the World Cup or the Olympics in Brazil.",
    "Take this course.",
    "good rest of the world credit. Big survey that gives you a basic understanding of Brazilian history",
    "An interesting lecture on Brazil's 500 year history, with 2 midterms and a 5 page paper. Prof. Schwartz is an awesome, down-to-earth and knowledgeable lecturer. Take it!",
    "History of Brazil spans the 500 years, from the first exploration of the country to modern day. I was somewhat disappointed that there was not more in the way of the cultural and social history of Brazil. The course focused very heavily on the political and economic history of the country. I understand that this is an important framework for understanding the history of a country, especially in an introductory course, but I think I would have been more interested had more cultural topics been presented. That said, overall, I did enjoy Stuart Schwartz's lectures.",
    "Good overview and history of an exotic and diverse part of the world.",
    "Excellent course! If you are at all interested in Brazil, take it.",
    "This is a good history lecture class about Brazil. You will learn a lot about Brazil and some about the rest of Latin America. There are a lot of readings, but many of them are pretty interesting. Prof. Schwartz is AWESOME and a fantastic lecturer.",
    "An overview of Brazil's history. A lot of information, but easy to handle. I recommend the class.",
    "Yes, if you're interested in Brazil at all this is the class for you."
