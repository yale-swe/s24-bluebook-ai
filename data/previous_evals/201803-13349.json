    "This was a fantastic course that pushed me to think about history and historical writing in a different way than what I had experienced before.",
    "I learned about how to read a book for the book's sake; critical analysis",
    "The course helped me develop the ability to read a complete book within a few days and feel prepared to discuss it. I also was exposed to some major trends in the history of medicine.",
    "Important distinctions between histories of medicine and public health - learned to think about historical divergences and sites of tension that I did not see before."

   "comments": [
    "Strengths: small size, diverse backgrounds of students (different programs represented - MPH, PhD, MD), great professor",
    "I really enjoyed the majority of books in the syllabus. I think the discussion improved over the course of the semester as more students seemed to become more comfortable with speaking.",
    "I enjoyed the interdisciplinary discussions as we had students from various health fields present in class",
    "Connections between texts are emphasized - class conversation highlights historiographic trends\/patterns effectively - inbuilt opportunities to synthesize what we are learning throughout the semester."

   "comments": [
    "Absolutely! This course teaches you to think in new ways and brings up many provocative questions about the history of medicine and public health. You learn how to critically evaluate the disciplines, which is a very important skill if you're planning a future in one of those areas.",
    "100 percent. I would recommend that it becomes mandatory for all public health and medical students",
    "Yes, the course helped me improve my ability to engage with long texts, and Prof. Warner encourages students to participate in the discussion in a gentle and non-intimidating way.",
    "Definitely. Thorough survey of the history of medicine and public health in the U.S. - accessible to students without extensive familiarity in the subject matter coming in. Professor Warner is an excellent facilitator who skillfully draws graduate students from many different disciplinary and professional backgrounds into conversation. He adapts the class for the people in the room to ensure that he is speaking to and providing opportunities for growth to everyone."
