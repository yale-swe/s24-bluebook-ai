    "-projection design and sound design are so similar the way we make content and working in the show. -I learn that projection help sound more meaningful and richer at the same time the synchronize of projection and sound make magic happen. :) -The way projection work in theater is complicate and need to be though carefully. The good projection design is integrate with set and all design element.",
    "This class helps me that to see many good video. It helps me to know many ways to express your idea by images. And also I got good practice that how to make the software works for your design. This class builds good connection with Digital Imagine class which is really helpful.",
    "With every class, Wendall Harrignton discussed current broadway productions and philosophy of projection design with reference to what was being done in various current theatre productions. This was very insightful and interesting. Only after such discussions did we get into the assignments and projects we were given. Her feedback and that of the class was very helpful indeed. In fact one of my projects for her class lead to an installation at the YUAG. GREAT CLASS!",
    "i like the various types of projects we had in class. I also enjoyed the videos Wendall would show in class as well as her own work.",
    "Wendall's lectures and the insights she gave us is the most valuable thing I took away from the class. Her emphasis on developing ideas rather than focusing on projection techniques.",
    "I appreciated to learn more about some foreign film, and other movies that could be sources to do research.",
    "Being assigned projects that require me to learn a new skill set has been the most valuable. The animation projects and music videos enabled me to teach myself how to use Motion and other new software programs. Through these projects I also lean red how to be concise and specific with what my artistic choices are."

    "Please send sound designer e-mail about changing schedule. Sometime TA forget about us in the basement.",
    "I hope that this class can build more connection with different departments. It will help us to work together better.",
    "often the allotted time for presentations was totally ignored resulting in less time for some and way more time for others. Perhaps this can be better managed.",
    "First and foremost as much as I enjoyed this year, I feel that projection design students should be in the second year projection class. Similar to lighting I feel like the intro class is catering to the non projection designer. I feel like I should be taking my projection design more seriously and intensely than my set design class where I'm making a tiny model every week or costume design. I want that same experience in my projection design class. Every week content, every other a new show or assignment. How do I worksheet? I'm dipping my toe in the water, but I want to dive head first. Aside from that I think that the music video and bolcom project should switch places. I feel this way because I think editing video is easier and more effective to introduce to first time students than animating a Blake picture or even a museum piece. It also lines up better with David's class structure. I think it should go image editing to video editing to animation.",
    "I never felt there was a program or agenda that highlighted the learning goals of the semester. Some classes felt very trivial.",
    "There was confusion among myself, my peers and even the TA as to what was assigned to us. We didn't really know what was expected of us. More clarity on that would have been very helpful."

    "There was a very uneven level of skill in the class in terms of executing the assignments. It would have been useful to perhaps have after hours workshops on some of the tools that were available. I personally could have benefitted from some one on one instruction on how to render certain projection ideas.",
    "It was still a very informative class Wendall was a great teacher"
