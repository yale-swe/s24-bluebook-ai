    "Getting across an understanding of WHEN to use various techniques, i.e., what kinds of problems they are suited for.",
    "I think the pace of the class is too much for easy comprehension. The class should be slower.",
    "The course is at a weird intermediary level. The theory isn't delved into enough to really understand it. At the same time, we didn't spend enough time with the software packages to really pick them up. In many cases we were unable to do homework assignments with a particular software package. This meant we ended up jumping around packages and didn't learn one package particularly well.",
    "The pace; if we slowed down the class a little bit so students could ask questions, I think students would get more out of it.",

    "Great! Not always a lot of time, but easy to schedule and typically very helpful.",
    "Excellent Professor. The TAs were not familiar with the three major software, SAS, R and SPSS. They knew only R. So that made me wait for appointment with the professor.",
    "The availability and quality of help I received from Professor Reuning-Scherer was excellent. I did not seek assistance form the TAs because Professor Reuning-Scherer was available when I need help or advice. It is my understanding from other students that the TAs were also helpful and available.",

    "Excellent; the TAs and prof. definitely made themselves available during office hours to answer any questions students had.",
