    "Not your typical boring lab. TAKE 111L!! Great extension of class. In fact, the material taught in class is relatively useless and much harder to understand without experiencing it in the field. The lab component elucidated mineral identification and taught geological mapping principles. Group bonding over a campfire and endless brats were a huge plus.",
    "Super excellent. If Dave is teaching it, take it. It only meets 7 times, 3 of which are field trips (including an awesome weekend camping trip). Barely any work, you learn cool stuff, and it's just super chill. There's an assignment for about each meeting and a final paper.",
    "Dynamic Earth lab is one of the best \u00bd credits out there. It\u0092s now required for G&G majors, but I would recommend it to anyone who wants to appreciate how geology enters daily life. With this lab, you\u0092ll see it around Yale, in the Peabody, at West Rock, at CT beaches, and even on a weekend field trip to the mountains of the Delaware Water Gap in NJ. Along the way, you\u0092ll learn the basics of rock and mineral identification, geologic time, and structural geology. The workload for this is beyond fair \u0096 the lab itself meets only about 7 weeks for three hours, we had about three take-home graded assignments (the rest done together, automatic As), and one term paper on an interesting geology-society issue of your choice. If you\u0092re considering a geology major, take this for important basics, and to get to know the Majestic DUS, one of my favorite people at Yale.",
    "G&G111 Lab is an awesome lab class that is not stressful at all, does not meet every week, provides students the opportunity to actually practice, identify, and experience topics discussed in class. This lab class is really different from the lab classes for the other science departments and I highly recommend taking the lab."
