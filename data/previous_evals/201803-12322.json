It also gives you a very thorough introduction to proofs, which will be useful for 365.",

    "I learned the basics of combinatorics, graph theory and discussed probability and its relation to graphs. The course was very good and Prof. Berkowitz focuses on presenting detailed proofs of the concepts we learned.

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I think this course was taught well.",
    "Pretty interesting content itself, with a lot of applications across fields. The psets are not unreasonably long or anything like that, but the class has a lot of people from different backgrounds ( CS, applied math, pure Math). It seemed that the class was more geared towards pure math, and the pure math kids were clearly much better at the proof based psets and exams, while it seemed like the CS and applied math kids struggled more. Also, feedback on the psets was very slow. As of writing this at the end of classes, only the first 4 of 10 psets have been graded, making it hard to know where are you are in the class. You can drop 2 psets, but since its takes so long to get them back, its hard to know if you should risk not doing one.",
    "It is a pretty good introduction to the math required for the CS major, but people in the class are very polarised and are generally of one of two extreme types: (1) math folks who have taken other proof-based courses like MATH230, so this class is practically a gut for them, and (2) CS folk who have not seen proofs before and this class is SO HARD for them. Makes the grading and deciding on the curve very difficult, I would imagine.",
    "Strengths: Ross is a very unique teacher - he really is thorough and helpful, and his lectures are never dry or boring. Weaknesses: Perhaps more emphasis\/weight given to the problem sets for grading.",
    "For the most part, I found that the lectures did a good job of conveying the material. There were a number of occasions where a lot of class time (sometimes even a full lecture) was devoted to working through a long and laborious proof; in my opinion, these were not as helpful, and the time could perhaps have been better spent if these proofs were presented instead as sketches with more time devoted instead of discussing the structure or argument of the proof instead of working through the tedious logic and math itself. I also think that feedback on problem sets, particularly in the first half of the semester, is critical. Many students in the course had not been exposed to a proof-based math class before, and it would have been very helpful if the first few problem sets at least had been returned within a week of their due date so we could make sure we are keeping up with the material and doing the problems correctly.",
    "MATH 244 is a very good course. The class covers a lot of material and at times I thought we could have gone more slowly, however, Prof. Berkowitz presents clear proofs and understands questions. He is one of the few professors I have had who not only understands the questions he is asked, but also anticipates them in the presentation of arguments and of proofs. This was very helpful in understanding the material.",
    "Strength: lectures are engaging Weakness: too many exams and too few homework",
    "Strengths: - Great classroom - Great selection of topics, albeit seemingly dispersed. - I liked the homework, because it was challenging and required a lot of thinking. Weaknesses: - I wish there were review sessions before midterms\/final, or maybe there were some that I was not even aware about - I wish we got our assignments back in a timely manner. For the first 3 months, it felt like we only received two assignments back.",
    "i wish we were able to get psets and back sooner and receive clearer guidelines on proof techniques",
    "This course it like eating your Wheaties. It builds a great foundation and strengthens your QR skills. However, if you do not see the beauty in graph theory, it can all seem a little abstract.",
    "You walk in, you copy everything on the board, then you cry over your confusion :(",
    "Strengths: As an overview to topics in discrete mathematics, it does a solid job at balancing material breadth against depth. The course was a comprehensive survey, yet doesn't sacrifice understanding and exploration. This does lead to an intellectually challenging course; however, this is not necessarily a bad thing - as long as the students know what they're in for. Ross is a great lecturer and definitely enhances the quality of the class. Weaknesses: Organization was definitely an issue for this class. It took a very long time to get graded assignments back, and their usefulness for studying was essentially null. A good solution would be for Ross, or a TF, to create a set of solid practice problems with solutions. It can be difficult for students to regularly make help hours. Even the professor knows that the assignments do not contain enough material to give students a thorough study. In addition, the textbook doesn't have solutions. The midterms felt a little overemphasized. I personally felt that two very fast paced exams in the busiest moments of the semester shouldn't account for 50% of the grade.",
    "The material is definitely interesting, but for someone without the intuition for discrete math, it can take a lot of time and commitment to fully understand it. I often felt like the homework was too difficult, and it would have been impossible to do it without going to the (awesome) peer tutor's office hours. We also only received feedback on 3 of the 9 homeworks, and I can't help but feel like that impacted my performance on the midterms. Even if I thought I understood something, I obviously didn't when it was time to take the midterm, but there was no way to know because I didn't have feedback on my homework. We also had a lot of difficulties with the room that we were in: the white-board markers were often near-dead, the lights were always too dim, and during the final exam there was literally one light at the front of the room for a lecture hall of probably 200 seats. I could barely see my exam.",
    "We needed more feedback in a timely manner--we got 3 psets back by the final exam, and we didn't have grades or solutions for the last 2 psets, whose content made up half the final. No one ever knew how to do the psets, so it would be beneficial to have more than just 2 peer tutor sessions during the week so that we could go over general content and then the pset.",
    "I did not feel as though I knew what my level of understanding was until after the first midterm which did not give me adequate time to understand my level of engagement. I would have liked to receive more feedback on my problem sets much faster",
    "The course was a huge lecture & I think that psets could be returned much faster to assist our learning",
    "The course is pretty well organized in terms of the sequence of content and the problem sets, and some of the material is quite interesting. However, the lectures are often somewhat dry, and Professor Berkowitz is not always super engaging, clear, or friendly. The final also felt way more difficult than it should have, especially given the haphazard pacing of the class near the end.",
    "Strengths: Ross was a really good lecturer. Weaknesses: The class was not well organized outside the lecture hours - there was only 1 TA for a class of over a 100, the p-sets were corrected only after the final exam, and the office hours were quite limited. As a result, I often a little unsure of where to find help.",
    "Honestly, not a ton of strengths. I didn't love lecture structures and I didn't feel like the class facilitated learning well. Material honestly shouldn't have been as confusing as it was made to be, and I didn't feel like we were taught HOW to take the exams or how to structure mathematical arguments. The class was taught as a 'content' course but was tested more as a skills course. It wasn't enjoyable as a result.",
    "+ Exposure to a wide variety of topics and problem solving techniques in discrete mathematics. - Limited mathematical rigor due to the fact that students are not expected to have experience with proofs. - Emphasized breadth over depth. Pset problems generally not very involved, often were a small variation\/application of results derived in class. As a result, I did not feel like I obtained a meaningful understanding of many of the topics through the homeworks. - Logistically, somewhat disorganized. Would have been helpful to receive feedback on assignments in a more timely manner, as we only got our first assignment back maybe ~75% through the semester.",
    "Strengths: Ross is a fantastic lecturer. The course textbook is good enough, and the psets are generally not too bad and teach the material effectively. Weaknesses: Feedback was lacking. By the date of the final, we hadn't received three of our psets back, nor were solutions posted. This is unacceptable, considering that there were 9 psets for the course, meaning that we walked into the exam having not gotten feedback on a third of the courses psets.",
    "Course administration needs to be better. It would have been nice to get our problem sets back in a timely manner...",
    "Homeworks were not returned to us in a timely manner which made it very difficult to improve on our mistakes. Further, the textbook does not have answers to any of the problems in the book so it was hard to practice outside of class and homework.",
    "The course was great, the o ly thing that could be improved is returning graded problem sets in a more timely manner.",
    "Ross was a very good lecturer. The homeworks were very topical, interesting, and challenging, which I liked. Some of the administrative aspects of the class could be improved (i.e. returning homeworks quickly)",
    "I really enjoyed this class a good deal. The problems were fun and rewarding. The lecture was useful and the practice problems we went over were helpful. Ross was engaging and funny. In terms of weaknesses, we didn't receive the problem sets back for months. This made it hard to see if the quality of answers I was providing were up to the standards of what would be asked on the midterm\/final",
    "I thought the lectures were well-organized, and the problem sets were very engaging. I also though Ross did an excellent job with his teaching, and made class clear and interesting. I did think the assessments were weighted too heavily and that the problems were more a test of intuition and problem solving ability than the material covered in class. I did think they were fair, and that there were no surprises in the class.",
    "this class needs a better classroom and consistently good lighting lol. also the feedback on the homework was delayed for sooooooo long and I wish that we had received it much sooner after turning it in. Ross was awesome tho",
    "Strength was that Ross was great and the material was interesting. However, a lot of times the homework was not passed back and feedback was not clear, and also the exams count for a lot and getting a question wrong can count for a lot.",
    "Good and engaging lectures. However, did not receive any homework grades besides the first 2 until the last 2 weeks of class. Very difficult to gauge how well you are doing until the first midterm comes back.",
    "Strong lectures and helpful office hours; psets were difficult to complete without extensive help; got very little feedback on performance throughout the course",
    "I suppose the course itself (re: content) is pretty good. The lecture content felt fairly different from what we were expected to complete on homeworks and that different from assessments.",
    "clear teaching and fun problems to do. The class logistics are messy.",
    "The course did a good job of covering the various topics in discrete math given the amount of time we had. Discrete mathematics is an incredibly broad field, and there were certainly times where it felt rushed. Perhaps the greatest weakness was the lack of test preparation material. Many other classes make previous exams available, or offer sample exams. While this was the case for the final, for the two midterms, only a list of sample problems, rather than any comprehensive exams were offered.",
    "Ross is a rather fun lecturer, but it took absolutely forever to get psets back. TAKE PICS OF YOUR PSET before turning it in, as it makes tracking down your solutions much easier come review time.",
    "Strengths - lectures were pretty good Weaknesses - homework took forever to get back",
    "pretty good lecture but administratively we never got problem sets back, solutions were posted late and sometimes had typos\/were unhelpful, which made keeping up in the class much harder for students struggling with content",
    "Strengths: good practice exams and problem set questions that reinforce understanding Weaknesses: you dont get problem sets back until months after the due date, exams are graded on a hard curve",
    "Teaching is great. It would be better if we can get our homework feedback earlier as well as solutions for the homework.",
    "It was a great course, the lectures were interesting and clear and the problem sets were often fun and did a good job of preparing you for the exams",
    "Material was super interesting and I think Ross was a fairly good and engaging lecturer. The tough thing is this course is really hard just by its nature and the curve is awful cause it's a bunch of really smart people. I think it would have been nice to have more practice problems before exams and other supplementary material beyond lecture notes (I didn't find our textbook to be particularly good) since this course is exam-focused for most of your grade. A big weakness of the course is because the level of the class is really high, if you don't get some part of the material, you're screwed because everyone else does, which is a great feeling! Also you'll never get your HW back, but that's okay rip.",
    "Too large of a lecture; very slow feedback on problem sets",
    "Strengths: The material covered is reasonable for such a course. The instructor is a really nice person. Weaknesses: Everything else. The class is a logistical nightmare: homework assignments were neither graded nor returned to us until the LAST WEEK OF CLASS, meaning we have been given no opportunity to know if we are learning the material correctly. Said homework accounts for a meager portion of the grading system, yet is easier than the exam questions, meaning that you will do much worse on the exams than on the homework and you will be penalized for it. The lectures were often confusing and unhelpful. But fundamentally, the biggest flaw in the course is that the instructor doesn't really care to improve any of this. This course obviously isn't a priority and your time as a student is not respected at all. We receive no feedback whatsoever and the response to any failure on the part of the students is mere indifference. I saw the very real mental and emotional toll that this class took on math majors (including many who are more adept at math than I am).",
    "This course was strong in the breadth of topics it covered, but it could be improved by covering some topics in more detail. For example, generating functions was covered in general, but not many examples or uses were given or shown. Further, psets were not graded until the very end of the semester, let alone returned to students.",
    "I thought that the material was very interesting, but throughout the semester it was unclear what was expected of students: we didn't get feedback on homework until after exams, and only got our first homework back after we had handed in our 5th (so if the level of detail wasn't good, we weren't able to correct it until the 6th homework); in class we would explore proofs in great detail and then not need to know them; practice tests didn't match the difficulty of actual tests; and so on. I would have liked to have an idea of how well I was grasping the material before exams so that I wasn't just guessing what I needed to focus on and how well prepared I was.",
    "No help whatsoever from the professor. Pr Berkowitz answered none of my emails throughout the semester. Furthermore, less than half of the psets were corrected by the time we took the final, making them completely pointless.",
    "Strengths: taught well, interesting material, psets aren't too hard and neither are the exams Weaknesses: no exam review sessions, a lot of the office hours were on weekday mornings when most people had class",
    "Very little feedback. Homework assignments were not graded for weeks. The textbook is good, but the course needs a secondary text with problems and solutions.",
    "Ross is clear and well-prepared for lectures, such that you can just follows what he writes on the board to write your own notes. You learn about really interesting theories and proofs that are useful (at least for CS). The main weakness is that you get your assignments back late or not at all.",
    "There are not enough TAs or student help. The homeworks and exams are not returned in a timely manner, and answers to homeworks are sometimes not posted."

    "This was an interesting course. I would recommend it to people who need to take another math class.",
    "Yes, if you are more proof inclined. The material is very interested, but if you are a CS major who really isn't that into math, you may be better off taking CS202 instead",
    "If you are a math-inclined CS major, yes. Otherwise, take CPSC202.",
    "YES! 100%. If you're having any hesitations between 244 and CS202, take this course. It will be more challenging, but it will prepare you for things later down the road (i.e. CS 365 or 366), and life in the computational field. You'll learn subjects that you wouldn't have encountered in high school math or normal standard math classes, and it makes you appreciate some of the more unknown things in math. HIGHLY recommend.",
    "I took this class to satisfy a requirement. It served as a good overview of this general area of mathematics, but I think that if I wanted to really learn about any of the covered topics in the course, I would preferred to have taken a class devoted to studying less breadth and more depth on a particular topic.",
    "I would recommend MATH 244 to another student if Prof. Berkowitz is teaching it. He presents the material very clearly and explains proofs in details. Sometimes we covered some notions fast and I think the course could go a bit more slowly, however, the proofs were very clear and Prof. Berkowitz understands and anticipates students' questions.",
    "You have to take it if you are a math or math\/cs major.",
    "Yes, especially for people who like math. The topics in this course are fun to think about.",
    "yes, if you're doing something math-related. otherwise, i would probably not take this course just for the sake of improving my problem solving\/quantitative thinking abilities. there are probably better courses for that purpose",
    "This course is like working out in math. Nothing you learn will fundamentally change your knowledge set, but it will make every other course you take easier. If you plan on taking a STEM focus, this class is a great way to learn to think in creative ways.",
    "Enjoy your major requirement, but theres 202 just FYI.",
    "I would recommend this class to any mathematics, statistics, or computer science student, especially if you plan on taking higher level courses in the future. You will learn a great deal from the class - both contents and skills. No matter how difficult, you will walk out of the class a much better mathematician. You should take early steps in the class to get ahead, both on homework and on your understanding of the material. It will save you much frustration later in the future. The best thing would be to find a good source of practice problems with their solutions since there aren't many in the class. This requires a lot of self-discipline, but you will need that for this class and won't regret it in the end.",
    "As an elective, maybe, if they really enjoyed learning math. I took this class because I had to, and I had an alright time with it.",
    "Yes, even though it's disorganized and conceptually pretty hard. Not that much work every week, but peer tutor hours carried us all through the semester because the psets can be pretty hard. That being said, the actual problems are like puzzles so actually understanding and being able to do a problem was rewarding and some concepts in lectures are really cool. Ross is a funny guy but sometimes disorganized; we only got 3 out of 9 psets back by the end of the semester and there were no solutions posted for the last few psets, which made up the bulk of the final. Midterms were easier than the psets but the final was much harder. Take this class if you like math and are prepared to have no idea what grade you will get; it actually ended up being pretty enjoyable by the end.",
    "Yes if you have taken a proof based course before. This is not an introduction to proofs course even though it says it is. I did not understand proofs at first and I greatly struggled in this class for the first few weeks.",
    "yes! These are pretty cool problems",
    "I would recommend it to STEM majors with a fair amount of self-motivation. However, it is not as friendly a math class as it could be. I felt like the course should really be reaching out to a wider audience of non-STEM students than it actually did, and I didn't love Prof Berkowitz's occasional expressions of his opinion that the course should kind of weed people out.",
    "Not really- if you are comfortable taking a course where you'll have to figure things out on your own, the sure. The topics are really fascinating, and Ross' lectures are great, but there was very little effort put into helping us outside the course.",
    "No. If you don't have to, don't take it. It isn't well taught, it isn't structured to facilitate learning, and if you don't already have a lot of proof experience, it won't teach you what you need to know. It was not an enjoyable experience.",
    "Good overview of major topics in discrete math. If you want more in depth knowledge, probably want to do some extra reading.",
    "Yes, definitely. Ross is a fantastic lecturerpossibly the best math lecturer I've had at Yale. His lectures were always clear and well-prepared. The subject matter itself is very interesting, and certainly something that a math major should learn. Be aware that the exams are quite difficult, but not unreasonable. Also, while Ross put out solutions to 6 of the psets, we didn't receive any feedback on 3 out of the 9 psets in the course. This is a problem for large classes in math department in general, but nonetheless one should be alerted that students make the same complaint about this course when Ross taught it the previous year. I hope that the next time Ross teaches 244, he puts out solutions to all psets so that he doesn't have to rely on the graders' efficiency.",
    "Yes, it was very interesting and was administered for students learning",
    "Yes, this is a great class. I'm an applied math major and thoroughly enjoyed it. Take it if Ross is teaching it because he's pretty great.",
    "Yes - great class and very interesting material.",
    "Yes. Take this, not CS202",
    "For sure, great material.",
    "Yes, but be warned for the lack of feedback from homework.",
    "If you are looking for a challenge and will commit yourself to hard work, you will learn a lot. Otherwise, I do not recommend the course.",
    "This course was more difficult and less interesting than I expected. Take it if you have to, but if you're only considering it because you're a math major, I would say that it's not strictly necessary.",
    "Yes! Really fun math class.",
    "I would recommend this course only for those with strong mathematical backgrounds. Many of the proofs required key insights that were obtuse for those without much experience in writing proofs.",
    "I had fun, but the class felt disfunctional at times. If you can bear with inconsistent time tables, missing pset solutions, etc. its actually a very intellectually stimulating time.",
    "Discrete math is pretty cool! Would recommend if you like a different style of proofs from your standard analysis and algebra type courses. A lot of the course is presented in a puzzle-solving like manner which makes approaching the problems pretty interesting. Ross was a good lecturer though sometimes it didn't seem like he was very excited to be teaching the material. Homework is mostly fair but grading is really really slow. Tests are fairly standard though but also have some tricky questions. Following the textbook closely was very helpful for reviewing material. Overall, a fairly good course!",
    "Only if you come in with a strong math lack ground because you compete on a harsh curve with people who have competed in math olympiads",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to students need discrete math or interested in discrete math.",
    "Yes! I think the topics covered in the class are very interesting and I think Ross does a great job of teaching them. I would also recommend this course to anyone even slightly interested in math as it doesn't require a strong math background but allows you to see a very different side of math from calculus or that of other 200 level math courses.",
    "I would say the course is very interesting and very cool. If you're not a math person, take it credit d fail though because it's really depressing to be failing the course when there's a bunch of geniuses getting 100s on everything, but that's life in an advanced math course. Ross is great and I think the material is really interesting though (I never found myself bored in lecture).",
    "Yes. Good introduction to discrete",
    "Unequivocally, no. To MATH MAJORS: You don't need this course. You really don't. Take a grad class or the CPSC version of the course if you want to learn the material. Please respect yourself and know the value of your time, and don't waste either on this course. To CS MAJORS: This class is listed as a prerequisite for Intensive Algorithms. No one will care or check if you don't take this. The material you cover in this class will not help you with CPSC 366, and you'd be better off taking a class you enjoy. Seriously, don't do this. To EVERYONE ELSE: There are hundreds of courses you can take. Why on earth would you take this one.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student wishing to gain an introduction to discrete math topics and understand the theory behind counting or graphs that are so widely used in computer science and other fields. If a student has prior competition math experience, then this class would be mostly review, but there are definitely new topics.",
    "Yes, but I would want them to know the concerns that I laid out above. If you aren't a math major and are just interested in the material, definitely credit\/D the class",
    "It was a pretty chill fun math class and what was especially cool was that everything we were learning we were applying to cool puzzles or actual practical problems. So yes.",
    "If they wanted to try proof based math, but wanted a class that was not going to be very difficult.",
    "I would hesitate to. The material is interesting and important for computer science and other math disciplines, but it is also difficult. Given the disorganization of the class, it is a serious challenge."
