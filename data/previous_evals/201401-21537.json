    "I recommend this to you if you're in EP&E. This class attracts a certain type of person, which I did not always find beneficial to my learning experience because the discussion was either way over my head or I couldn't get a word in between the people who knew everything. Additionally, it's based in the theory of essentially one guy that the professor studied under. I wouldn't take it if you have no theory background at all because the instructor doesn't do the best job of teaching to the whole class. He definitely teaches to the upper 3 or 4.",
    "If you are EPE and have loved reading about philosophy and theory your whole life, take this class. If you don't have a lot of background knowledge in theory and want to learn the basics of it, don't take this class. It was taught with the assumption that you already know a lot, and when I asked the professor for help, he just talked more theory and I left even more confused than before. Professor Fotos is nice, but I left this class frustrated and irritated every week. Also, if you love being surrounded by 3-5 section assholes at a time, or if you want to be a glorified section asshole, you're made for this class.",
    "If you are considering this course, be warned that it is not what you are expecting in an EP&E seminar. First of all, Professor Fotos, while well-intentioned, openly acknowledges that he does not have a set plan for the course, and this has more of a negative impact than he might think. Second, it might seem from reading the syllabus that this course will present you with some sort of concrete framework which you can apply to political institutions to evaluate them. It does not. Instead, the reading list is somewhat jumbled. The first half is extremely theory heavy, and focuses on one specific scholar - Vincent Ostrom. You will probably grow to resent him. The second half is supposed to focus on applying these theories, and turns to subjects like counterinsurgency and nation building. The particular institution to which Fotos tries to apply the political theories covered in the first half is the US Armed Forces. If you have no interest in learning about the Armed Forces, do not take this course. If this sounds interesting, shop it. Basically, what you walk away from this course with is some very specific political theory regarding public administration, knowledge of many different insurgencies throughout the world, and much military knowledge, especially as it relates to areas in which our military has recently been involved, such as Iraq, Afghanistan, and Africa, to name a few.",
    "Only if students feel comfortable with political theory. I think the course if somewhat misnamed. I would call it federalism and public policy, or something like that. If a student is interested in federalism and can handle political theory, I would recommend it.",
    "At the moment I would not recommend this class to another student I knew. I think this class needs more structure before it will become a worthwhile educational experience. I also think that Professor Fotos may need to be more understand of students' lack of experience with political theory beforehand, or at the very least limit the class to those who do have extensive political theory experience. I do think that this class has the potential to be good in the future, however, and I look forward to hearing how Professor Fotos restructures the class.",
    "A little hard to summarize still, a class to provide a framework of analyzes institutions, with a focus on the army.",
    "If you need the political systems requirement for EP&E, then yes. Otherwise, earn your credit elsewhere.",
    "For students interested in the subject matter the course deals with, this class can be valuable."
