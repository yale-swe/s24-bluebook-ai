   "question_text": "What was valuable about this class, either in format or content?",
   "comments": [
    "This class strengthened my ability to listen critically and not just for enjoyment. As my first sound class ever, I found the material accessible, the content fascinating, and the discussions helpful.",
    "I loved learning basics of sound design and sharpening my ear.",
    "I found David to be a valuable teacher and a valuable source of all things related to sound knowledge. I really appreciated that he had a printed out syllabus for us in the first class and that he would outline what we would be doing in each class before, during and after the class. That level of pedagogical detail is lacking in my other classes and I have a new found appreciation for it. I also learned about sound and how it is heard and perceived. It gave me a stronger awareness of sound that I didn't have before.",
    "A very clear syllabus and handouts to accompany lectures\/ discussions. All assignments were detailed and outlined in the syllabus. Excellent class. Well structured in discussion of the application and approach to Sound Design. Loved how work was shared and reviewed by the class and professor. All types of questions, work, and feedback were welcome. A good balance between lecture\/ discussion, reviewing student work, and visual and auditory aides. Each student was met at their level of knowledge and comfort in an engaging learning environment.",
    "The level of organization and preparation that David Budries leads as a shining example. The class structure manages to cover so much material in the time allotted because of its preparation. Each week there is a very specific goals that are outlined in the syllabus. Then each week's subject is broken down into the information he wishes to cover in the handouts. They frame the discussion for the responses to the homework, definitions of vocabulary and clearly state the next assignment. The amount of listening to material to study was great too, letting the group also make observations and placing value in everyone's opinions on how we all learned to discuss the subject. The class seems to have the right mix of activities to keep everyone engaged, participating and invested on the assignments. The level of assignments requested is challenging enough, but remains accessible."

   "comments": [
    "I'm not sure if this is possible but I always valued listening and discussing what people brought to the class. I welcome more of that and would be happy if people brought even more material to listen too.",
    "I would love to have a bit of technical training so I can better make designs.",
    "Sometimes it was hard sitting through a 2 hour lecture. Sound is an intangible thing that is difficult to talk about, but I would have found more visuals to be helpful in this class. What I did appreciate was when we would listen to sound samples that we would bring and discuss it among the group.",
    "I would have happily taken this class for another semester. Wish there was a second level to this class to take with my sound designer classmates, and any other designers who where interested in continuing, it could also go into more technical detail.",
    "It would be great if the class was just a bit longer (30 mins?) because it would allow some more room of for the critical listening section of the class, which was always so instructive and had everyone participating. It would be great to also get a glimpse of how the departments sets up a show, perhaps a day in the theatre with an overview of how the systems are installed and how the department functions during a production."

   "comments": [
    "Being able to listen with motive in mind was something I struggled with but (hopefully) strengthened as the course went on.",
    "I just didn't know how to mix sounds or use the pieces I found in a cohesive way until about mid semester..",
    "Trying to stay focused and engaged in a 2 hour lecture on sound was difficult.",
    "It might have been nice in the first class to let students know a few free resources available (if they chose to use them). Such as, QLab, the website freesound.org to pull effects and open source music, and the editing software Audacity, all of which are free. However students who don't want to dive in this deep should still feel free to play assignments from iTunes and youtube."

    "Great environment. I highly recommend this professor on any level. I felt comfortable but challenged.",

    "This was an inclusive class, assignments were enjoyable to complete, and feedback sessions for myself and for others led to interesting discussions.",
    "I think the course covers a really solid grounding as an introductory level, but it left me wanting to keep learning about the subject, perhaps even an introduction into the hardware and application part of the process."
