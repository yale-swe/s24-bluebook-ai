    "Hmm...I wouldn't really say I enjoyed the class, but by the end of the semester, everything started to come together and I felt much better about it. Take it if you have to and it's not horrible.",
    "I wouldn't recommend it. Math is hard. Don't ever take any math if you don't have to. If you do, take MATH115, should be easier.",
    "MATH 120 is a hard class. Don't take it unless it is a prereq, or you are truly interested in understanding math for the sake of understanding it. That said, by the end of the course, I was truly amazed by the amount I had learned in one semester. If you consistently put in the work (DON'T try to cram), you will be fine.",
    "From the point of view of a humanities student, I would definitely take the class again, though I definitely wish a class that explores the same material at a slightly slower pace existed.",
    "The course is very approachable if the student has taken Math 115. I will recommend this class to students who want to study economics.",
    "You should definitely take this course at some point during your life, and I'd say the sooner the better (while you still remember highschool BC). It's definitely hard work but it's entirely manageable if you really study.",
    "A run-of-the-mill math course. Take it to prepare yourself for higher level courses, though it does not stand out as a course in and of itself. Very reasonable workload."
