    "Yes, it's more difficult than L2 (obviously) but it focuses a lot on literature\/film, which is enjoyable. It helped improve my reading comprehension. Take it with Professor Alexandrov. She's lively and overall a really cool professor.",
    "Take it if you want to improve your spanish!",
    "this is probably for a language requirement..soooo yea.",
    "Yes, good class.",
    "It's a fine class itself as a level 3 grammar and vocab learning class. Homework every night, but not that much. Sybil Alexandrov is phenomenal, enthusiastic, helpful and kind. Definitely don't miss the opportunity to take a class with her.",
    "yes, definitely...especially if you want to become fluent",
    "It is a good amount of work but all of it is necessary. If you must take it then you should and keep up with all of the work."
