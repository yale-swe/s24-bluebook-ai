    "The course was strong, with good readings and strong connections between the different topics. I might shift up the time frame slightly, as the course ran out of time a little bit near the end. Still, cutting out anything is difficult.",
    "The course is expansive and helpful. Perhaps there could have been some primary sources, but that may have made it too unwieldy. Occasionally Dr. Sorkin assigns a slightly unreasonable amount of reading (400-500 pages), but usually it is manageable, and he uses class time productively to enhance understanding of material that may have been skimmed (as well, obviously, as material that has already been read thoroughly)."

    "Yes. Anyone with an interest in modern European Jewish history should take this course."
