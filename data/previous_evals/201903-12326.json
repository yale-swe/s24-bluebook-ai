   "comments": [
    "Basic understanding of the major happenings in Europe from 1648-1945, as described in the course title. Heavy emphasis on societal impacts and cultural transformations on top of major events.",
    "This class provides a basic survey of modern European history from the unique point of view of Professor Merriman.",
    "This course gave me a general, surface-level understanding of modern-era European history. There is not too much detail but it is enough to notice general trends and patterns over the centuries.",
    "I learned about European Civilization from 1648-1945. Actually learned a lot about absolutism, enfranchisement, revolutions, the industrial revolution, and fascism.",
    "I learned about European history from a thematic perspective.",
    "In this class, we looked at core themes that resonated throughout Europe from 1648 to 1945, namely, the creation of nation-states and tendency of the people to join popular movements. In writing our essays, we learned how to analyze events, periods, or people using the core themes discussed in the class.",
    "Though I have learned how to take history classes in high school, Jen and John really helped me see history in a much more humanistic lens. John gave us a particular narrative that Jen would challenge in section to show how important historiography is to history. I really got the significance of events in history beyond their immediate consequences. I feel that I understand modern European history quite well.",
    "Learned a good overview of European history. Insights about general themes in the region and the development of the modern world as we know it.",
    "This course provides a special focus on the ideologies and movements which shaped political developments in Europe.",
    "I learned more about the political and social history of Europe."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This course is very independent, as expected. Merriman is a wonderful lecturer and I would highly recommend taking one of his courses if you're interested in history but need a (semi) gut class. Just stay on top of readings, attend lecture, attend section, and you'll breeze through it without any difficulty. How much you like section is heavily dependent on the TA; Jen was very lenient, understanding, and made section very enjoyable.",
    "The class is great because Professor Merriman is such an interesting person. It is difficult to get all the material in because there is so much to cover but he does a great job highlighting important moments throughout this time period.",
    "Because it is a survey course, it doesn't have much detail, but it is good for those who want to dabble in history without diving headfirst into it. It isn't a difficult course, so it is well-crafted for people testing history courses or who just want to learn the basics about 17th-20th century European history. On the downside, if you are looking for a detailed course, this isn't a good choice. If you took college-level history courses in high school, a lot of this information will be familiar to you already. John Merriman is a very quirky professor though, and he keeps the lectures interesting.",
    "Not a lot of uneccessary readings which was greatly appreciated. Read the book and you have all you need to succeed in the class.",
    "The scope of this course was very long which was both a strength and a weakness. I certainly learned a great deal, but as with any broad survey course at times I felt we were jumping around without too much of a connecting thread. That being said, the course did a great job of covering a very large area over an extended period of time. There was also a compelling human component to a lot of our readings and the lectures that humanized what might otherwise have been just names and dates.",
    "The lectures were very interesting. However, the readings of the course were a little dry because they were just out of the textbook and often did not really have that much to do with the lectures.",
    "Structure is great",
    "This course does a great job of giving an overview of European history and culture. The only criticism I have is that the pace is a little bit quick, mostly as a byproduct of the course covering such a large period of time.",
    "I wish there was more contextualization at the beginning of the course. I don't personally have a lot of knowledge about medieval Europe. Summarizing the importance of Christianity to politics and society, mercantilism to the development of capitalism, and comparison of Europe with other civilizations would have made the events of Europe either appear revolutionary and innovative or common and average. Perhaps even a lecture justifying the study of European history in particular rather than situating it within world history could have been helpful. I loved the passion and anecdotal stories of John's lecturing. He really brought history to life in a way that reading a mere textbook would never do. I appreciated Jen's countering of John's lecture. It was productive in demonstrating the importance of perspective in creating objectivity.",
    "Slightly disjointed lectures at time but a generally fun and informative class",
    "Slides to go along with the lecture would really help for so many topics that are only mentioned briefly or when it's not exactly clear whom the professor is describing.",
    "I really enjoyed this class! It was very interesting and well-structured."

    "If you are even somewhat interested in history and are looking for an easy class for a credit, look no further! Merriman is wonderful and he truly has a passion for what he is teaching. He often goes off on tangents but he definitely knows how to properly lecture.",
    "I would definitely recommend taking a course with Professor Merriman. I am not sure if this is the most interesting course or that I feel I have a solid grasp on a specific topic from it, but if you are looking for an interesting and broad overview with a great professor, this is a pretty good class.",
    "If you want to get a taste for what a history course might be like, this is a good choice. I am glad to have taken it and I would take it again if I had to do it over again.",
    "John is the man. You get to hear his tangents and funny stories while also learning a thing or two about absolutism, revolutions, and fascism.",
    "I would to students looking for a survey course, because Merriman is a great professor. I would, however, warn them to check who the TA is, because Jennifer made an otherwise enjoyable course a lot less so.",
    "It's a good overview of European history during the time period described, and the professor clearly cares very much about the subject and its relevance. I'd recommend you take it if you're specifically interested in the subject or if you feel like you need the overview - but if you don't, it feels a bit like you're taking a more nuanced AP Euro course with a very good and personally invested professor.",
    "I think the course was good for someone just looking to get a survey understanding of European history but it was not very in-depth.",
    "Yes",
    "Yes",
    "I think the pace of this course is a little quick for someone without a background in European history. However, if anyone has any kind of interest in European history or culture I would definitely recommend this class. Additionally, if someone wants to take a class with an amazing professor, this is definitely a class to take.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to any student trying to learn the significance of Europe in modern history regardless of their major.",
    "Yes, it gave a good overview of the economic, political, and social developments of the time.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to any other student. It was a great class!"
