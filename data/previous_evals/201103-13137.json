   "comments": [
    "Absolutely. Great course, fairly easy tests. Interesting subject that most people don't know much about. If you're a history, political science, or any kind of major looking for a good survey course take this.",
    "This course and its sequel in the spring are both must-takes. The course title doesn\u0092t lie\u0097pretty much the history of Eastern Europe from the dawn of time to 1914. General focus is on Poland, but you do a little bit on Bohemia, the Balkans, Russia, Ukraine, etc. Snyder is such a great lecturer that he makes what would otherwise be ridiculously boring material interesting. Be warned though, he moves very quickly and laptops are not allowed\u0097this is not a class to slack off in. Also, the readings are generally dull, but with a professor this good, who cares?",
    "I would avoid this class. Prof. Snyder is brilliant, but his lectures are frustratingly difficult to follow and the grading is notably harsher than other History courses. There are other courses in History that you'll enjoy much more. Frankly, this one has not been worth it.",
    "I have taken history courses for several years, and I can say confidently that HIST 263 was one of the greatest I have ever taken. The course covers Eastern European history from roughly 1000 to 1914. The two strongest topics are religious conflict and the history of Poland\u0097once the largest state in Europe, and the most tolerant. Each was fascinating. In particular, Professor Snyder makes the course great. He is analytical, incisive, and flawless. He makes themes clear throughout the course. He also has a brilliant sense of humor, so it is always a joy to go to lecture. The reading is both manageable and fascinating; there is a short map test, a midterm, a ten-page paper, and a final. Whether you are a history major or have never tried the field, TAKE IT!!",
    "Eastern European History to 1915 is well-taught, engaging, and challenging. Professor Snyder is a wonderful lecturer, but be ready to have a cramping hand by the end of lecture. The material is something you usually don't cover in a typical European history course. You will get a lot out of it.",
    "I would highly recommend this course. Even if you do not have time to fully take the course, attending the lectures is highly insightful and worthwhile. Professor Snyder is a great lecturer!"
