   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course if you want a broad base of knowledge of Western literature from the Renaissance to the modern period. However, this could be too broad for some people: we read War and Peace in two weeks, for example.",
    "To some extent yes. It is a very good course but clearly not for everyone. I would have equally enjoyable a semester without DS I am sure. However, shop the classes if possible, make sure the professor works well with your style. If you like it, then there is no reason to hesitate. Take it!",
    "This course is a writing-intensive course that covers broad realm of readings.",
    "I would highly recommend this class. Directed Studies is something that each student should follow through and the literature branch of it is particularly rewarding.",
    "You know what you're getting yourself into with D.S. Tons of reading but it's all incredible. All of the works on the syllabus are great. You won't be able to do all of the reading effectively, but you can get a lot out of the course regardless. Some of the other students are annoying as hell, but many of them are brilliant.",
    "I would definitely recommend DS Lit. I think after the 1st semester you know what you're getting into, if you liked the first semester you'll like the second semester. I enjoyed the books this semester even more (despite the fact that it's more pages).",
    "2nd semester literature is not too different in terms of difficulty, but the expectations are higher. Papers are read more critically. In addition, the reading skyrockets especially with Don Quixote and War and Peace. Be prepared to invest a lot more time for literature, and you really ought to do the bulk of those two novels during Winter\/Spring break. Don't drop DS!",
    "An awesome introduction to Western Literature. Switch sections if you get Jewiss."
