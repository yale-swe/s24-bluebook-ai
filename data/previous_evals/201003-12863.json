   "comments": [
    "If you wanna learn to work with metal and make some art this class rocks.",
    "Intro to metal sculpture is an incredible class. Professor Howard gives you freedom to do whatever you want, and his skill and knowledge helps you do things you never would have thought possible. I definitely recommend it to anyone interested, you will not regret it. You can work as much or little as you want, but you will probably end up spending a lot of time working just because it is so fun to do.",
    "Great way to fulfill humanities credit and gain a better appreciation for welding and metal.",
    "Definitely, take the class its a blast and you learn so many awesome metal-working skills.",
    "I would definitely recommend it - it is artistic and awesome!",
    "This is an excellent class. Proff Howard spends the time to teach the students as much technical skills as they want to learn. He discusses conceptual ideas with students. The class is a great hands on class and I definitely recommend it to everyone.",
    "I would recommend this class because it has a very reasonable workload and you learn a lot about the medium that this class focuses on and the methods of working with it.",
    "Definitely take Introductory Sculpture. Professor Howard is amazing. However, be ready to work, and put in extra time outside the classroom if you want to produce good work. However, if you are efficient you will be able to get everything done during class time.",
    "This course taught me the basics of welding and cutting steel to produce art. You are given the freedom to sculpt whatever you feel."
