   "comments": [
    "It's a class with fun, but time consuming, projects. Take it if you think you want to be a Mechanical Engineering major.",
    "i would recommend it. the labs were fun and lectures were pretty relaxed. you get valuable experience working with machining and laser cutters",
    "The projects are very interesting and fun, but Dollar could improve his lectures.I didn't really learn much in the class as it only superficially explores many topics, but the design experience was definitely helpful and fun.",
    "Mechanical Design is a good practical course to learn about the design process and what you can do. The projects are fun, but can be a bit frustrating at times, and are often time-consuming. The lectures are pretty basic and not too hard, though most MechE majors will learn all the material in subsequent classes.",
    "If you are interested in MechE or you want to actually build things in lab take this class. It can be a lot of work, but in my opinion it's worth it when you see your final result.",
    "I would recommend this class only to those that are seriously considering Mechanical Engineering. Although the projects were interesting, the lectures were not very well taught. The workload is certainly manageable but more than average and the last several weeks were spent in the lab working on the final project. It will teach you about solidworks and the laser cutter and you'll get a little bit of machine shop experience.",
    "Definitely. Really gives you a great overview of Mechanical Engineering"
