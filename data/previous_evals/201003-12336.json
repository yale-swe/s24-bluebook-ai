   "comments": [
    "Mixed feelings--very interesting history,and Prof Merriman is certainly entertaining, but as a student who prefers to rely on lectures than readings, Prof Merriman's winding\/digressive\/very left-leaning\/ranting lectures sometimes made it hard to take good notes or keep track of what was happening in France at the time. I would take it if you're interested in a more leftist study of France.",
    "Yes, although it's helpful to have taken the first part of this course (History 275 - France 1789-1870) first. If you're interested in French literature, culture, or the government today, it will provide you with excellent background in understanding why the country is the way it is today. Professor Merriman is hilarious (check him out on the iTunes video lectures!) and makes it worthwhile to go to every class. One midterm, a paper, and a final - not bad. (If you can, opt for the oral final exam and head home for break early!)",
    "This is a modern French history class, beginning with the Paris Commune in 1871 and concluding with the \"problem of the suburbs\" in the last two decades. The lectures, readings and assignments are all well-organized and tyical of a Yale history course. What makes this class different is absolutely Professor Merriman - take this course if only to listen to his fantastic lectures.",
    "Take this course.",
    "yes",
    "HIST 276 is a modern French history course, covering from 1871 (the Paris Commune, i.e. the last of the revolutions in Paris) to the modern day. If you have any interest in this period or in France in general, or in European history, TAKE THIS CLASS. It's an opportunity to hear from a very prominent historian in this field (Merriman lives in France when he's not in the US) who is at the same time incredibly accessible and relaxed and a fun lecturer. This class will be the fun 50 minutes of your day - the lectures are engaging and the readings for them include novels and memoirs, which are genuinely a pleasure to read. The reading is moderate, nothing too demanding, and spaced out pretty well. In terms of assessments the class isn't very hard - just a midterm, an 8-10 page paper on a topic completely of your choice, and a final. For the final, there's an oral option: 30 mins of talking to your TA as opposed to a 3 hour written final. For French majors (or anyone who is just good at French) there's also the option to take a section in French for this course - with readings and discussions in French. So overall this course is just awesome.",
    "Take it if you're a history major or interested in the topic-- French history is great and Merriman knows it like the back of his hand.",
    "I highly recommend it. This is an extraordinarily well-taught history class with a relatively light workload.",
    "I would recommend this class to other students. The work load is pretty light, but if you do the readings and watch the movies you can get a lot out of the class. Professor Merriman is an entertaining lecturer, as long as you are ok with diversions from the lesson for personal anecdotes.",
    "This was a good class. Merriman is a very enthusiastic and interesting lecturer. There isn't that much work (midterm, paper and final) but sometimes we read a book a week which, with other coursework, became a lot. Overall it was a good course.",
    "Not really being a History guy, I didn't enjoy this class much. French history can be rather dull, I'd suggest a more interesting course.",
    "Good course - not too much work, pretty light on the reading (and you can get away with not doing any of it besides the textbook). Attending lecture is unnecessary, videos of lectures can be found on iTunes and Merriman sends out lecture notes so you know you're watching the same lecture that he's giving in class. Interesting material. Midterm, 10 pg paper, and final, can take the final as an oral exam. Would definitely recommend to anyone interested in France\/French history or European history.",
    "This class is more relaxed than some other history classes. It's good if you want an interesting but not too demanding history class, but i would say it's important that you are interested in the subject matter to some extent.",
    "Absolutely. Understanding the recent history of France is very useful for anyone interested in the dynamics of modern Europe or in political philosophy: the best way to study that philosophy is to look at how it has played out in a tumultuous set of political experiments. Merriman's lectures are rich and entertaining, and the requirements are very reasonable.",
    "I would recommend it as a solid class with a zany professor. Much less reading than most history classes. Midterm, 10-page paper, and a choice of an oral or written final. I took the oral final, but just be warned, it's hard to talk for 25 minutes! In retrospect I wish I'd taken the written final.",
    "Wonderful course. Merriman is a fantastic lecturer, but you should do the reading to get all you can out of the class. Easy midterm, final, and a short paper that you can write about anything. If you have any interest in modern European history, this will be useful to you, and if you know French it will be even better.",
    "Take this class! France may not sound like the most interesting subject, but Merriman is a fantastic (if kind of tangential) lecturer and makes the period fascinating, especially if you enjoy random tangents and a more left-leaning view of history. The option of the oral final exam is great, as it gets it done early in the finals period and is almost fun. But seriously, take this class.",
    "Great class to survey this period of history, and all its different aspects.",
    "I would not recommend Hist 276 because it lacks structure. I simply think there are better history classes, but, for someone who really wants to take French history, then take this course. The course load is definitely manageable and Merriman is lively and exciting. This was a fine fifth class but nothing jaw-dropping.",
    "Interesting, fairly easy modern French history class. Taken in combination with France 1789-1871, you will gain a near complete conception of modern French history.",
    "This class is awesome. Merriman is the man and you will never get bored. If you get to know him, he'll even somehow manage to include you or something tangentially related to you in his lectures.",
    "Do it. Merriman is entertaining. There is very little reading compared to a normal Yale history class. It is enjoyable.",
    "Fun history class. Lectures are much like the readings, but with colorful commentary and anecdotes!",
    "If you're really into learning about France since 1871 (but come on, why would you be?) go for it. It's a standard lecture\/section class that I doubt anyone would find life changing, but it's a midterm, paper, and final that you could BS your way through with a little determination.In short, take it if you're bleed France or need an extra credit- although in all honesty you could probably find something more interesting.",
    "great class. really fun and not too much work.",
    "French social history since 1871, big focus on the wars.",
    "So boring. Disorganized. Don't take this.",
    "This is a great class. Merriman is hilarious. He brings a great personality to the subject and will keep you captivated. Make sure you read the textbook though, it will contextualize some of his tangential points. Take it if you are a flexible learner and not too obsessed with rigid structure. Highly Recommended!",
    "It was a fun course. Sometimes the lectures were all over the place or off topic but they were interesting and in the end it came together pretty well.",
    "Take it! Wonderful course. Professor Merriman is absolutely crazy, and he's an awesome lecturer. He's obviously very knowledgeable and passionate about the material (and never afraid to throw in his own opinions), and that makes the class so engaging.",
    "I definitely recommend History 276. Professor Merriman is an experience. His lectures aren't particularly well-organized, but they're fun, and the grading is pretty lax.",
    "Straight forward history lecture. It isn't too much work, and if you do miss a lecture, the 07 versions are available through yale open lectures.It is a great hist class for history majors who need credit towards the major.",
    "Great class. If you have any interest in France, or simply in European history, this is well worth taking. A fun combination of thematic study and entertaining anecdotes and details, highly recommendable.",
    "Yes, Merriman is great",
    "I would definitely recommend History 276. If you love France the class will be one of your favorites and if you don't know anything about France but love history it will STILL be one of your favorites. Look forward to interesting primary documents, films, and other outside readings.",
    "The course is a survey of French politics, economics, and society from 1871 until the beginning of the Fifth Republic. History 276 is a great course if you are interested in learning more about France.",
    "This class really brings modern French history alive. Professor Merriman is lots of fun and a little quirky, and class is never boring. I would recommend the class if you have a vague interest in the subject and want a fun class with interesting and varied readings (some of the best I've had for a history class).",
    "History 276 is an excellent class on the history of modern France. Thereis a particularly strong focus on the Paris Commune, World War I, World War II, and Charles De Gaulle. If you appreciate funny and informative tangents during lecture, you will enjoy Professor Merriman. The readings and assignments were well chosen and very reasonable. Having taken L4 French at Yale I really enjoyed taking the French section of the class. It was a really neat experience to read the novels and books in French. If you want an understanding of France outside the language and \"The French Revolution\" this is a great class.",
    "i would recommend the course for any history major or french enthusiast"
