    "A little difficult to get through, and I'm someone who has an inherent grasp of math usually. Doug is just a little rambling and nervous and focuses too much on telling amusing anecdotes rather than on the math, so as a result, I picked up very little about the mechanisms on which we were being tested from him. Rather, I relied on my teaching fellow to actually teach anything useful. However, he cares a lot about our feedback, so I'm sure he'll be constantly improving. I'm assuming if you're taking this class you're probably required to for the econ major, so just grit your teeth and get through it. I hear it's very much like stats, so if you have that background, it's probably a lot easier.",
    "Although this class started as a review of AP Statistics for me, I found that, after the midterm, most of the information was incredibly interesting and presented in a great way. Admittedly, I had a love-hate relationship with this class (thinking: \"Why do I have to be in this class when I already know AP Stats?\"). But I'm so glad I was proved wrong. Professor McKee is exceptionally fair in his grading, and he made every lecture incredibly fun and interesting. Absolutely take this class, if you want to know the basics of data analysis and look into pretty cool stuff in econometrics. You'll get lots of exposure to Stata, which I hated initially but have grown to love, which looks great on a resume.",
    "Only take if you have to.",
    "Recommended for people interested in finance\/econ ... If not, just take Stat 100-106",
    "Surprise, an economics class where you actually learn something. I can't say enough good things about Professor McKee. It's refreshing to see a professor who actually cares about teaching an intro level undergrad class. His lectures are interactive and engaging. He set up an online discussion forum for students and personally answered every question. He organized lunches to get to know his students. He recorded every lecture and posted them online for people to review. One time he brought 2 urns and some 600 tennis balls to the lecture hall in order to demonstrate the wisdom of crowds. In sum, he did everything big and small to maximize our learning experience.",
    "It was OK",
    "You know you have to take it -- but it's really not that bad! Course material: it is what it is; not terribly boring, not terribly fascinating; Prof McKee makes it as appealing as anyone can, so that's good. Teaching: love Prof McKee! He's an absolute delight - passionate about the stuff, and involved in\/concerned with his teaching. Conveys the much-needed intuition for things very well! I wish his lectures were more representative of the exams' (quantitative) difficulty - the midterm was a bit too tricky - haven't done the final yet. Workload: can't complain, could be worse - 6 Psets, midterm, final, weekly online quizzes, and empirical project (in 2 installments). Fair grading, though exams should be less tricky! Section was essentially a lab for stata. There was an anonymous online forum for questions and discussion - which was super helpful! Prof McKee regularly answered tons of questions. He has a delightful personality - pleasant, witty, approachable.",
    "The class has the usual weekly pset, but with recorded lectures and useful weekly quizzes. The information is interesting, but the labs can become somewhat tedious. I would, however, recommend the course to a friend.",
    "A requirement for Economics, so you have to take it. I would strongly recommend taking with Professor McKee. Econometrics as a whole is a little dull and time consuming, but Professor McKee made it enjoyable. He was innovative and engaging and I would take other classes that he teaches. Worth waiting a semester to see if you can take it with McKee.",
    "The class is pretty standard, nothing I can add. If Doug is teaching it, definitely take it with him--he's a very thoughtful and dedicated teacher who will actually teach you the concepts.",
    "It's required for the econ major so if you want to do econ you have to take it. However, many of the statistical methods we learned were very cool and have real-world significance, so I would recommend it to people who are interested in probability\/statistics.",
    "Stats and stata. not much else. not much econ either. good course if Doug McKee is teaching. Otherwise, I've heard its horrible.",
    "An introduction to the basic methods of statistical analysis in economics - not math-heavy or rigorous, look to 135\/136 for that. Very different from micro \/ macro in that you need to start thinking about how to build models yourself, and how to evaluate those models - be prepared to put in some time \/ thought into this course, even if you've taken stats before.",
    "You can't get a more painless introduction to statistics than 131 with Doug. As a non-Econ major, I was very happy with this alternative to the Stat 10x sequence -- I definitely learned A LOT more than my peers in Stat 10x and can program in Stata. The stuff at the end of the semester was also very cool. Doug is a solid lecturer and cares so much about teaching.",
    "Amazing course! Prof. McKee puts lectures online which is a GREAT resource. I feel like the nature of econometrics makes it a course that you can easily fall asleep to, but McKee makes it as enjoyable as it gets. Stata is kinda' annoying. The labs are as well, but it's overall a great course.",
    "ECON 131 is a required class for the Econ major. However, it is incredibly useful from any serious research standpoint, and anyone considering writing a thesis in economic or policy implementation would be well-advised to gain some of these statistical tools. The class consists of: weekly quizzes (you get 100% percent because you can attempt as many times as you like), problem sets, a midterm, a Big Empirical Project (Stata), and a final. Doug records each lecture so you can rewatch it online, but I would strongly advise against skipping lecture and only watching them online. I rewatched lectures for both ones I'd been to, and ones I skipped, and watching them online was far more effective if I went to class in the first place. That being said, they are a great tool and allow you to miss class without serious repercussions if you need to.",
    "131 is rough. It's not well taught and the material is not well explained. Don't expect the textbook to be helpful either - its pretty useless. If you take it though, get Yu as your TA as he is the best. Also, don't count on the practice midterms or exams as being indicative of the midterm or final. Especially the final.",
    "Come ready to work. McKee is great though",
    "131 is a fine course, take it if you need it for the major or are interested in learning about data analysis. That being said, I had NO background in Statistics coming into the course and basically suffered all throughout. I learnt a lot but now my grade is solely dependent on how many screwed up the insanely hard final more than I did.",
    "McKee's the man to take it with, you'll learn the basics of Stata and statistics, good primer",
    "Ugh take only if you absolutely have to.",
    "Pretty atrocious class. Take it if you must.",
    "A good class for those interested in learning basic statistics with an economic application, but other stats course may be better for just learning statistics. Psets and tests were manageable. Professor McKee looks for feedback throughout the semester and takes students opinions into account. He really tries to make some of the drier statistics more interesting with examples and real data.",
    "Take this class if you have to for your major or if you want to be able to work with economists and social scientists.",
    "Even though this is a required course in the econ major, I think Professor McKee made this Econ 131 so enjoyable and informative that I'd highly recommend it to anyone in the social sciences.",
    "Definitely depends on the professor, since this class has a reputation for being awful, but if Professor McKee is teaching it then go for it! Pretty much average in terms of workload (biweekly psets, midterm, final), and material is tough but totally manageable. If this class is a requirement, then you just gotta take it. But as a non-Econ major, I'm still really happy I took it. Statistical literacy is super important, and this class gives you enough of a background to be able to tell good data analysis from bad data analysis (of which there is a lot!!) when you see it. Also probably makes you vaguely more employable, or something.",
    "Useful class. Sort of difficult.",
    "TAKE IT WITH MCKEE! He's the man. He spends so much time on this class and it shows. He's technology from recording the lectures, to Piazza, to discussion labs make ECON 131 a great course to take. I came out of this class knowing how to use STATA and felt like I actually learned a marketable tool.",
    "Required for Econ majors, so you don't really have a choice. That said, personally I would advise trying to take the class with Doug. I don't know much about who will be teaching it in the spring semester, but I doubt they'll be able to do a better job with the material.",
    "ECON 131 this semester was a great course. The material is not tremendously difficult, the grading is fair, the structure is logical, and the professor is fantastic. This is required for econ majors, but this is a great class that should not be viewed as a dull requirement. I would certainly recommend this to another student.",
    "It's required for the major, and it teaches important concepts. The first half is much like AP Stats, so for those with advanced prep they may want to take a higher level course. Overall the class was enjoyable - Prof McKee was always very eager to help answer questions, as were the TAs.",
    "A thorough and very well-taught course. Professor McKee is a gifted and dedicated professor, and he works hard to make the material accessible to students. Every problem, concept, and formula is geared towards real world applications. You will never sit in class and wonder how the material is relevant to real life (which makes it easier to stay interested and motivated). Although I didnt do as well in the course as I would have hoped, I learned a huge amount over the course of the semester. I gained a far more comprehensive understanding of econometrics than I thought possible after just one semester. THAT BEING SAID, students in this class typically come in with a background in stat and calc, and they are much more competitive than the average Yalie (the class is a requirement for the economics major after all). Take Stat 100 or Applied Quantitative Analysis prior to this course unless you are naturally gifted at econ and math.",
    "Worth taking even if you're not an Econ major",
    "Yes I would recommend this course if taught by Professor McKee. I've heard bad things about it in the past, but he was pretty awesome",
    "ECON 131 is a course that is filled with Econ majors, but is very relevant to anyone who is interested in statistics and quantitative analysis. Doug McKee is an AMAZING professor who nobody should pass up the chance to take a class with. He was very creative with the class and he was an engaging lecturer. This class is not easy though, but if you really apply yourself, you can learn a lot. And walk away with a real skill--using Stata!!",
    "An econ requirement that I'm glad is now out of the way.",
    "It's an interesting course that is not terribly difficult as long as you are diligent about putting in the extra hours every week.",
    "I would definitely recommend ECON 131 when taught by Doug. He's a good teacher who puts a lot of thought and time into teaching. He posts videos of all lectures online so that you can watch, rewatch, and LEARN the material at your own schedule. The material itself is interesting and absolutely vital for quantitative research in any social science. This isn't so much an economics course as a basic data analysis course: you'll learn probability, concepts from statistics (e.g. hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, p-values, etc.), and then of course many methods of linear regression analysis, both single and multiple regression. Very useful stuff, and taught well here by a caring professor!",
    "I thought Econometrics was a great course. I entered the class hearing horror stories from students who have taken it, but ended up really liking all the material, and the way that Doug taught the class. The use of technology was EXCELLENT and I hope that every course at Yale eventually \"modernizes\" to use helpful tools like lab sections, Canvas, video lectures, web quizzes, data analysis of course implementations, etc. Doug was also an exceptional professor, taking everyone to lunch at their convenience. All of these things made the course more bearable and much more enjoyable.",
    "Definitely take the class with McKee!",
    "DEFINITELY. Take it, Professor McKee is a great guy and you will like the material if you pay attention in lecture. He makes a lot of effort to simplify the concepts and give us the skills that are required to excel in Econ in the long run. The class is really well structured. I would do it again if I could!",
    "Yes, absolutely. Useful knowledge and take it for Doug.",
    "Yes, plus you probably need to take it anyway.",
    "I would recommend econometrics (taught by McKee) to anyone interested in the social sciences. It's practical and relatively painless, and even fun at times.",
    "Definitely worth taking if Professor McKee is teaching.",
    "Challenging statistics and econometrics course that does teach you a lot of methods for analyzing data by hand and using stata.",
    "The first half of the class can be avoided with a basic background in statistics. Not a heavy math based course.",
    "You have to take it so you will. But beware - an overload of material, extremely easy to fall behind, and a purgatory for econ majors.",
    "I would recommend ECON 131 to another student if you have a good professor and TA. The first course of the class is basically intro to statistics and the second part of the class may get a little messy conceptually. You learn how to use STATA and the different types of data analysis methods, which are very useful.",
    "Overall, this is a course for Economic majors who do not want to see too much mathematics.",
    "Required class for the Econ major, take it with McKee if you have some background stats and want to hear about some interesting research projects that he and his colleagues have done. If you have zero stats background (like me) I would advise either first taking stats 100 or taking 131 with a professor who will spend more time on the statistics part of the class. McKee was really engaging throughout the semester, but I felt that he rushed through the statistics and probability because he was so excited for the regressions.",
    "If youre an Econ major, you must absolutely take it with Doug. Do not consider any other options. He values student feedback above all else and at times is even too considerate, if thats possible. Hes also very clear in his lectures, and if there are things you still dont understand, he provides you with all of the resources youll ever need. You will come out of this class with many useful skills to apply to the real world, and develop technical knowledge of Stata, which is also extremely useful. Overall Dougs a great guy (who even tries to get lunch with all of his students in a class of 150+) and I highly recommend this class, even if youre not an Econ major.",
    "It is a good course. I wouldn't take it unless it was a requirement since much of it overlapped with my high school stats course. The material was not very interesting, but it was well taught.",
    "As someone with no stats or probability experience, this class did a good job teaching me all of these things. Before the midterm it was difficult because I went to class and it was hard to learn everything. After the midterm I only watched the lecture videos and that was a lot better. Watch the lecture videos!! The class teaches a coherent system of math, that ends up making sense which is nice.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class, it is not too focused on economics and therefore accessible and interesting for people outside of the major. It is extremely useful and ultimately the best one of the 'intros to statistics'. The workload is non-negligable but managable, the psets are assigned every other week but take quite a few hours. The curve is nice enough.",
    "I'm not an econ major. That said, I thought ECON 131 was a great course. Metrics has changed the way I think about statistics quoted in magazines and newspapers. The course made me more aware of the ideas of data mining, correlation vs. causation and other important concepts that affect the validity of claims supported by statistics.",
    "I would absolutely recommend ECON 131, with one caveat: TAKE IT WITH McKee!!! He is an incredible instructor and does his absolute best to provide as much possible material and help to students when they are struggling with coursework. He also does weekly lunches where he sits down with students and talks to them, attempting to make a large lecture course feel like a seminar. That said, the material isn't easy if you haven't had statistics before, so be prepared to work hard for a good grade. Also make sure to take full advantage of the notes he allows you to bring to the test. Overall, highly recommend and take it with McKee.",
    "A very good introduction to statistics and basic data analysis. The lectures are really interesting and you get to learn a very useful data analysis software",
    "Take it if you need it or want a good learning experience. If you're bad at calculus or programming - DO NOT TAKE.",
    "If you can take it with Doug McKee. The class itself was ok but the professor was great.",
    "Good class, good instructor. McKee teaches clearly, is fair and accommodating, and most importantly, actually cares about teaching. Lectures are filmed and put online which is nice. Class, at least as its taught by McKee, is structured well.",
    "It is a tough class, I wouldn't really recommend it unless you need it for your major or are super interested in regression analysis. You learn a lot of stats also but there are probably better classes where you can also learn stats.",
    "Take 131 with McKee if you can, he's a great professor. It's a good course with a decent workload, and you learn to use stata and interpret regressions which is a valuable skill to have. The class is especially good after the midterm, and the labs were a cool way to apply concepts learnt in class to real life.",
    "Basically a statistics course, good foundation, recommend really only for econ majors",
    "Certainly an enjoyable class with Professor McKee. If you've taken statistics before, this class will probably be easy for you if you put the work in. If you haven't, Doug's research during our class showed that you won't necessarily be at a disadvantage, since a lot of the kids with experience treat the class as a joke and don't end up doing that well. The first half of the semester is essentially AP Stats (I've heard), and then the second half is a pretty big overview of regression analysis. The PSets are only biweekly and took me between 4 and 8 hours each, I'd say. And you get all sorts of online resources like Piazza, recorded lectures and online slides. Just make sure not to fall behind, because statistics is more about intuition than specifics, and it's hard to cram.",
    "Yes I would recommend ECON 131. Nothing was terrible until the end where I was a bit overwhelmed with end of the semester projects and studying for the final. Very doable, pertinent, and fun. The final was a bit hard though.",
    "Imparts a basic understanding of econometrics along with the tools for elementary data analysis--in other words, precisely what it is intended to do. While not particularly exciting\/engaging, the course is certainly well taught. Take it if you need to or if you find the subject intrinsically interesting.",
    "A required class for econ majors, not sure why anyone would take it otherwise. Doug McKee is clearly very passionate about teaching, and puts a lot of effort into using Piazza effectively, actually incorporating Stata, and helping students learn. That being said, having Doug teach econometrics is pretty much putting lipstick on a pig. There is no way this class would be fun or interesting no matter who taught it, and Doug's talents would be better served teaching an interesting seminar.",
    "If you're an econ major, you have to take. otherwise, probably just take a stats class if you're interested in this type of stuff. it's nice the lectures are online. professor was enthusiastic."
