    "Sorkin is fantastic. Incredibly knowledgable, and super clear as he guides the discussion each week. The readings are long, and some weeks quite dull or dense, but on the whole were fascinating. You get out what you put in. The 25 page final paper is arduous, but Sorkin wonderfully guides you along the way with two preliminary deadlines.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to another student. This is a fascinating class that really sets up how religion can co-exist in the intellectual environment of the enlightenment. Professor Sorkin is a great teacher.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class."
