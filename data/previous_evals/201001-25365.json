    "TAKE THIS COURSE!!!!! good lord if you are an actor, a director, a poet, a painter, an artist of any kind, you must take this class. Working with Woodruff is unlike anything you have or will ever experience and you will be a better artist because of it. All the rumors are true, but is always worth it!!!!!!!!!!!",
    "This is an incredibly educational class if you are interested in performance, but it is A LOT of work. Do not underestimate the time involved in creating an original piece every week.",
    "Project Runway, theater-style. A new challenge to complete each week in a performance piece. Absolutely absolutey recommend. it'll change your theatrical thinking like crazy.",
    "This is possibly the best class I have taken at Yale. It is also the most stressful class I have ever taken, but in the best way possible. It stretched my brain and my imagination to extreme measures and challenged me in the best ways. This is one of the few classes at Yale that isn't as focused on studying other people's material than it is creating your own - and you get to do it ever week. Granted I would spend a lot of time curled on the floor of my suite frantically trying to come up with things to fit the crazy, creative assignments that Woodruff gave us, but I have 12 weeks worth of performances to show for that. Woodruff is fantastic - basically, if you are even vaguely considering this course, TAKE IT TAKE IT TAKE IT TAKE IT!",
    "Very intense introduction to experimental direction and exploration of time and space in theatrical performance through the weekly creation of performance art pieces. Incredible amount of work to prepare, but at its best this class can be the most exciting and challenging performance laboratory at Yale. Be ready to reconsider what you value in performance and how you approach making what you do. And work as hard as you possibly can to get the most out of it.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this for anyone who wants a hands on course in theater or any kind of performance art."
