   "comments": [
    "Yes highly recommend",
    "ANTH 204 is a basic introduction to genetics with an emphasis on evolution. You will go through basic biological processes, genotyping methods, transmission and population genetics, evolution, and phylogenetic diagrams of species, with components of current events. I would recommend this class to a non-science major looking for a basic science class.",
    "Molecular Anthropology was a really satisfying way to fulfill the science requirement as a humanities major. I feel like the science requirement is ideally supposed to serve as a way to be scientifically literate enough to understand issues that might come up in our adult lives, and this class teaches you enough about these issues of genetic testing, technology etc. to evaluate them. It's also nice because most easy science classes place the entire grade on the midterm and final and this splits it up between a lot of small assignments.",
    "If you are a non-science student looking for a science credit, this is a great course to take. The information is really interesting, and Bradley breaks down the science so that any of us can understand.",
    "A painful and stupid way to get a science credit",
    "I guess. The class is super boring but if you do the work you'll get good grades. There must be a less painful, but non challening science class on this campus though.",
    "This is kind of a dumb class. It was a little basic and slow-- a little more like a high school class. If you want to have an easy science credit that is interesting and not too much work, this is a good class, but if you really want to learn a lot about the field of Molecular Anthropology perhaps a higher level course.",
    "evolution, molecular composition of DNA",
    "Sure, it's not a bad way to fulfill a science credit if you're a social science person.",
    "Interesting class. Gives a nice basis for modern human evolution. Covers both micro- and macro-evolution",
    "It's a low-stress class: you don't have to do reading outside of class etc. but you should pay attention to the slides because the exams are actually pretty tricky. The problem sets and projects are easy though.",
    "Wonderful science credit for people who want to learn something interesting without undue stress.",
    "I would recommend Molecular Anthropology for anyone looking for a non-stressful science course. It helps to have a background in genetics so that the concepts are not completely foreign. There isn't a lot of work (three psets, midterm, final, book report) but there is a group project. The reading is not necessary (I didn't even buy the textbook). The tests are annoyingly structure with a bunch of random facts and you have to chose the false one. Overall, molecular anthropology is interesting, but more so if you actually want to learn about how humans have populated the planet and how we use genetics to understand this.",
    "Definitely take this class if you are a non science major that is looking for a lower level science credit. I am far from talented when it comes to science and I ended up doing fairly well in this class. The class is actually a good time as well with a great professor and material that is interesting.",
    "Out of all the Sc or QR credits I've taken for the requirements (and this is the fourth one) I think this is the only where I felt like I actually understood what I learned and thought it was interesting. I recommend it to everyone who needs a Sc credit. I found it to be quite easy and the time I did spend on it I felt was really worth it because the material was cool to learn about.",
    "Molecular Anthropology is a fascinating subject with great real life applications. In the class you learn about how studies of genetics can be applied to forensic testing, studies on race, and understanding human evolution. And it's a science credit with virtually no work, which is nice. However, be warned that unless Professor Bradley changes the format of the class (which I think she will because she is very receptive to suggestions for improving the class) you will spend large swaths of time listening (or not) to fairly useless student presentations at the beginning of class. The class was definitely designed to be for a small class, not a giant lecture which is what it ended up being this year, so I do think it will be tailored next year to be more effective and therefore probably a better class than it was this year! So take it if you want a laid back fun science credit.",
    "A very average and painless way to get a Sc credit. Moderately interesting. Easy. Some really ridiculous group work made it annoying. It was fine.",
    "I would recommend it because it's relatively easy, it's interesting, and there isn't any section",
    "The class is interesting, and it's got some fun projects. This class would be a gut to someone with a bio background, but it's not a gut for non-science majors. You're tested on a greater level of knowledge that what is taught, and the tests are worded strangely. I enjoyed taking the class, just not the exams. Brenda Bradley is pretty hilarious.",
    "This is a great class for a science credit; Professor Bradley puts science into a social science context and the material is genuinely interesting. That said, lectures are dull, readings are irrelevant, and it's filled with a ton of unnecessary busywork and stupid \"problem sets\" and quizzes that require you to be in class.",
    "I would recommend this course as a good introduction course as well as a science course for those who do not want to take a very math heavy science.",
    "I enjoyed the course a lot and I feel like I learned a lot of applicable things. Overall though, I thought the class was too slow and therefore I found it difficult to pay attention because I was bored a lot. Additionally, the class was simply too big to do the \"hot topics\" presentations. Professor Bradley is very friendly and eager to make us understand everything. She was also very helpful.",
    "Yes, I would recommend Molecular Anthropology to a fellow student. The material is engaging and interesting for majors and non-majors alike. I think that this course is a great introduction to the Biological Anthropology world and a the Sc requirement. The workload for this course is very manageable. Only material taken from Professor Bradley\u0092s PowerPoint presentations, which she posts on ClassesV2, appeared on the exams. Weekly readings were assigned but material never appeared from them on exams. The readings were only advantageous to students who lacked a basic biology background. However, the one caveat of the course is that class attendance is required. There are surprise quizzes (for participation credit) almost every week that can\u0092t be made up. Our final grades were compromised of a midterm, 3 short assignments, a presentation, quizzes and a final. Also, be wary of the exams. If you are not careful, the synthesized T\/F multiple-choice format and the wording will trip you up! For example a question might ask you to choose the false answer from a list of 6 statements, two of which could say, \u0093all of the above are true\u0094 or \u0093none of the above are true. Overall, I am glad that I decided to take this course I felt that I gained a lot of knowledge about human evolution and basic genetics. Take this class! You will not regret your decision!",
    "If you need a science credit , this is one of the best",
    "I would defiantly recommend this course as a science credit for non-science majors- It is not too hard and is pretty interesting.",
    "This is a pretty decent science credit. Work is extraordinarily manageable, and the projects are pretty fun. Tests aren't difficult, but Bradley's formatting can be super frustrating. It's basically a biology course though, so you should know that if you choose to take it.",
    "good class. Nice science credit",
    "gets really interesting towards the end but otherwise it's a bit dull. It's basic bio and evolutionary bio. do the assignments and do them well, study everything for the tests (which are a bit tough) and you'll be fine.",
    "This class is a solid overview of molecular anthropology. Still, though, it's really broad and not very challenging--it felt very much like a class that was designed for people looking for a science credit. That really disappointed me--Prof Bradley is very clear and enthusiastic, so I wish that the course itself were better.",
    "I would not recommend Anthropology 204 to another student. I think a lot of people take it thinking it will be an easy class, but the lectures are very boring and the outside work (when we have any) is pretty difficult.",
    "An incredibly easy way to get through a Sc credit, but not worth the semester of boredom.",
    "It is exactly how it is described in the course. This is an interesting science class for non-science majors.",
    "Great class for students who did not have a solid background in science. It did get quite technical and specific, but it did so at a good pace. The second half was much more relaxing and simpler. Fun, intelligent professor and very interesting material. The workload is definitely manageable for non-science majors. Although the assignments sound like a lot of work, they were actually very easy and took up no time at all: 3 word-problem psets, a few ungraded pop quizzes, a 5-minute powerpoint, a 2-page book report, and 2 exams, which were in a sort of humanities exam format (choose the best answer, fill in the blanks, and an essay question). If you need a low-stress Sc credit or Anthro elective, I would definitely recommend this! Plus, you get to watch YouTube videos of monkeys every other day.",
    "yes, good science credit and interesting and not too much work",
    "Yes it a very interesting course",
    "This course is a basic introduction to human evolution and diversity that begins with a broad background in population genetics and DNA replication. Lots of review if you remember high school bio. It's an easy and interesting class. Lots of different kinds of assessments. Professor Bradley is great - sharp, up on the field's latest research, and wickedly funny. Exams are worth studying for. This is a great class for non-science majors looking to learn something while seeking a distributional credit, and if you're an Anthro major, you can also get credit for the major.",
    "If you have any interest in human origins or genetics or are just looking for a relatively easy science credit, take this class. It's fun and interesting and not too much of a course load.",
    "Easy science credit, take it if you have a mild interest in the subject and it won't be too bad.",
    "Take this class with Professor Bradley. She's wonderful, and makes what could be very dry course material pretty interesting, even if there is a lot of memorization.",
    "I would recommend this course to someone who perhaps does not have a strong science background, but who is interested in developing one (instead of just being interested in taking aone-time science course to satisfy a credit or distribution requirement). The course showed me that I am interested in anthropology form a biological or genetic perspective.The material covered in this course was very interesting; however, most of it was not challenging or novel until at least halfway through the semester. The first half of the semester dealt largely with basic biology and genetics principles, like transcription and translation. It definitely felt like a class for non-science majors.The most unique part of the course were the Hot Topics. At first it seemed unnecessary to cover random news topics in the science world, but these eventually proved to be extremely useful. Not only were they interesting once the students got the hang of summarizing something relevant and significant, but they provided beginning places when wanting to investigate methods used in scientific studies or fields where a lot of progress is being made.The powerpoint presentations were used very well as a teaching aid. Professor Bradley did not rely on them too much, and was clearly familiar with the information she wanted to present orally, but the slides were helpful for note-taking, displaying images or charts, and for reviewing before tests."
