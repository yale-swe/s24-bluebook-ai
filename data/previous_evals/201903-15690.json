   "comments": [
    "Granted insight into the values, loves, ideals, and goals that I believe are worthy of my humanity and that I should pursue.",
    "I learned so much from this course! About philosophy and about myself. I developed my reading skills and writing skills but also my critical thinking skills. Most importantly, my discussion skills!",
    "This class teaches the skills and reflection processes that are most important for any college student to work on. By analyzing a variety of traditions and relating them to our time and goals at Yale, every student came away with a greater understanding of their purpose here at Yale and in life in general. This class made me reflect on what I hope to get out of an education both in the traditional sense of my time at Yale and seeing a variety of parts of my life as educating and impacting me. Overall, I learned so much especially from the process of reflecting on what I want to get out of Yale and beyond.",
    "This course really pushed me to think about what I wanted out of a Yale education and how my education would help me achieve my vision of a life worth living. We covered Confucianism, Christianity, and modern schools of thought on what a life worth living is to help develop our personal vision. I learned how to critically evaluate texts and my own beliefs.",
    "This class was an amazing chance to reflect on my motivations for attending college. It was a really good class to take first semester.",
    "I was forced to ask myself the important, yet sometimes uncomfortable, questions surrounding why I came to Yale and what I want to get out of my college experience and it helped me to develop a clear picture of myself and what I want out of my education and my life as a whole.",
    "In this class we took a deeper look at our values and what we deem to be meaningful in our lives. We used centuries long traditions and contemporary texts to help us weigh what each of us had never considered before and decide what we want to incorporate into the lives we wish to live.",
    "I learned a lot about how to think about my self and my education.",
    "This class was one of the most thought provoking classes I've taken. The discussions we had in class were all centered around different teachings, but I think my group in particular made the discussions 10x more interesting as we discussed multiple perspectives about learning, education, and just simply what it means to be human. I think I walked into the class really wanting to find a solid answer of what I wanted my education to look like, but I slowly started realizing that it's okay and a lot more common than many think to not have an answer. I honestly would leave every class reconsidering and evaluating a lot of my daily life choices, and I'm so happy to have taken this course.",
    "I learned how to have an academic discussion and how to articulate my thoughts into coherent sentences. I gained a lot of insight into what I want my college education to be.",
    "I developed greater understanding of my core values and how to use them to guide my educational journey. I learned how to analyze what an education is giving me, explicitly and implicitly, and to hold on to what is important. I also had a lot of insights about the current structure of secondary education in the US.",
    "-I have a new foundation to continue my college education with",
    "I learned a lot about myself. This course invites you to engage in a lot of serious self-reflection; if you choose to do so, then the course will be very helpful to you in figuring out the person you want to become, and how you can best make use of the years of college that lie ahead of you to achieve that end. I also gained insights into the minds of my classmates, both as a result of speaking with them during our seminar-style classes and of reading all of their final papers, which truly was an amazing opportunity. Seeing how your peers think is interesting in itself, but it is also ultimately helpful for you in deciding what path you want to take for your own self-development. I also learned a great deal about Confucianism, Christianity, and some more modern thinkers, such as Rousseau and Mary Wollstonecraft. Mostly, we focused our attention on what these traditions and thinkers had to say about what it means to live a good life, and how one's education plays into that. Having this focus in mind was very useful while doing the assigned readings, as it never felt like I was reading merely to soak up lots of information and not necessarily do anything with it. Rather, I was able to pinpoint the bits that were immediately relevant to the purpose of the class, and think critically about them; in my mind, this resulted in me being able to better retain the knowledge gained from the various readings, and also have a decent understanding of how to apply it to my daily life. Overall, I feel that I got a lot out of this course."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: The material is really captivating and the discussions are engaging and thought provoking. Makes you interrogate your beliefs and goals for your education: an essential process for any first year to undergo. Weaknesses: Way too much of the course was devoted to Christianity; most of the class agreed that that section of readings and conversations were particularly dry.",
    "I think this class was very well structured and I cant think of how it could be improved. I loved the routine of the class and the material we read. Matt was very deft at guiding the discussion without controlling it. I think the only way it could be improved was potentially more continuity throughout the units.",
    "Strengths: Matt is such a thoughtful and engaging professor. The classes flew by with really interesting discussion, collaboration, and debate helped by a student group that was passionate about the topics and a professor who was great at facilitating these discussions. The readings were dense at times but were always broken down in class allowing for an overall understanding of the big ideas. Students were encouraged to make the learning their own and question and critique the texts and Yale while understanding how this process affects us. Weaknesses: There were very few; this truly was a terrific class.",
    "The biggest strength of this class was Matt. He guides class discussions so fluidly and allows opportunities for each student to jump into the conversation. He is also really easy to talk to - I wish I had taken greater advantage of his office hours, which are convenient to schedule. Another strength of this class is the people who take it. Each person brings something valuable to the table and wants to critically analyze their education, which is just a phenomenally engaging environment to be in. One weakness is that the class time is really short - often, we would begin to touch on a really interesting topic in the last five minutes of class.",
    "I feel like I learned so much. I just wish I could have shared more of this knowledge in our assessments, which asked for a lot of important information, but gave little room to lay out more than the bare bones ideas if we wanted to cover everything. But, when I tried to hone in on more specific aspects of a tradition that interested me I was penalized for not addressing everything (maybe these two parts- tradition knowledge and personal thoughts- could be separated into two essays or word count could be extended.",
    "The strength of this course is the seminar format and the selection of texts that we look at. A weakness of this course and for other seminar style courses is the lack of a rubric system for grading participation in class. Midterm participation is given as a grade without comments, which does not do much to help us know how to improve the way in which we contribute to each class.",
    "The conversation could sometimes get off topic which was interesting but it would help to be more guided.",
    "There was a few readings I think we could have talked more about, like the last few with bell hooks and Paulo Freire, but I understand it's really hard to cut down from all the other readings.",
    "A strength was that it was clearly structured. I knew exactly what the work to be done was, and the discussion questions were always helpful in interpreting the text. I will say that a weakness of the course was that there was a little bit too much reading--sometimes it was hard to delve into a text deeply because we spent a day per text.",
    "I think the order of the class is set up very well. I loved the essay review portion of the class. The further we got into the class the stronger the discussions got and I had more and more realizations about my life and the educational system and my role in it. No real weaknesses.",
    "The seminar style of this course really encourages discussion that is driven by the students themselves. That being said, because the format was the same almost every class, it sometimes felt very monotonous and it was easy to fall into a habit of not contributing to class discussions.",
    "-The class size was great for discussion -The teacher was an excellent",
    "The biggest strength was definitely the class discussions. A wide variety of opinions were shared, and almost everyone was an active participant. Our professor, Matt, did a wonderful job of facilitating the conversation: he kept us on topic, but did not forcibly steer us to any particular conclusions. The selected readings were also strong. They opened my eyes to many new ways of thinking and seeing the world. They typically weren't too short to be superficial or too long to be overbearing; instead, there was usually just the right amount of material to read, and there was always plenty for us to talk about on the day of class. The paper at the end of each unit was also very helpful for my learning process, as it allowed me to finally organize my thoughts about the unit into something at least fairly coherent. As such, the third unit, \"Modern Options,\" felt like the weakest one to me, because we didn't have a final assignment for it (instead, we had the final paper for the course). Perhaps this issue could be remedied in a future course, because I think that that unit most of all needs an assignment to tie everything together, since we were exposed to a large number of different thinkers in a relatively short amount of time. That's a small point, though; I can't think of any major weaknesses of this course."

   "comments": [
    "Yes; the class encourages students to ask important questions, about their own goals for their education and life, which are essential for framing their intentions for their college pursuits.",
    "Absolutely. This class is the perfect one to begin your Yale education. You learn so much about education, philosophy, and then apply it to your own life and get to hear others. I learned so much but also grew so much.",
    "Absolutely! I can't think of a better course to begin my time here at Yale. It made me question what I want to get at Yale and wrestle with the weaknesses of an institution at Yale. The students are all excited to learn and question and collaborate and every class felt like an amazing philosophical chat with friends more than a mandatory class.",
    "I would absolutely recommend others to take this class. It's a great way to start off your Yale experience because it allows you time to assess what you want out of your Yale education and how you will navigate the next four years.",
    "Yes! I wish every first-year could take this class.",
    "I would recommend this course to those interested in the humanities. Many of our classes echoed many late-night conversations I have had with my suite mates and I could imagine that students uninterested in the philosophical nature of these discussions could find themselves frustrated with the content that we dealt with.",
    "Yes I would because I think it is helpful in recognizing who you want to be.",
    "Yes! I think this was an amazing introduction to Yale, it forced me to think about what I truly desire and want out of Yale and even if it wasn't all that different to what I had originally sort of known I'm really happy I got to solidify that and just hear the rest of my peers' opinion.",
    "Yes! The class really provides insight into your college education and gets you thinking about what you really want out of it. It was the perfect course to take in my first semester of college.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student! I think taking it as a freshman seminar really helped me set goals and expectations for the rest of my college years and beyond. I met and deeply connected to other students and the professor and I loved all the discussions and essay prompts. It's so important to reflect on your life and what you want out of it and this class really helped me do that.",
    "Absolutely. This course functions so well as a first-year seminar as it truly helps you analyze how your college education will change your path to the flourishing life.",
    "yes, we pose very essential questions regarding your college education",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. I think it is a particularly good class to take right at the beginning of one's Yale career, as it really helps set the tone moving forward, and allows you to think critically about what it is that you want to get out of your time here. The intimate, seminar-style environment of the class also lends itself well to making friends, which is also important for one's first year."
