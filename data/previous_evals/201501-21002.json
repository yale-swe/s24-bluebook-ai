    "if interested in philosophy, take this class, the Professors have a great collection of readings.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student interested in the intersection of literature and politics, or literature and moral philosophy. Although it is heavily geared toward so-called \"political philosophy\" texts, the syllabus includes a number of works of imaginative literature. I was pleased that the class discussions of these texts went well beyond the standard post-colonial readings one might expect to find in a course cross-listed with the political science department. This class demonstrates better than most, perhaps, the benefits of interdisciplinary discourse."
