   "comments": [
    "I would summarise it as a really befuddlingly huge amount of stuff to learn, but that it's stuff that's very well worth the time of any scholar of Western music to learn. I would definitely recommend it to any music theorist, as well as to anyone (yes, even those who are not music scholars) with a deep interest in ancient, medival, and Renaissance thought. Music is such a huge and oft-unacknowledged and -misunderstood area of their complex webs of world-knowledge.",
    "It seems like the course has an inevitably somewhat impossible task: to cover some 2000 years of the history of music theory. Given this and the instructor's competencies with the subject, students should expect this class to be conducted at an extremely high level and should expected to be challenged. I sometimes found that I was struggling to keep up with the pace of the material, the reading load, and the intensity of the seminar meeting discussions, though they were all very stimulating. I think many students will find many of the sources and intellectual contexts for the material to be rather foreign.",
    "History of Theory I, in summary, covers the history of Western musical thought from roughly Aristoxenus through Zarlino. I would recommend it for theorists (who are required to take it anyway) or for musicologists whose work involves any of the included time periods.",
    "This course is an introduction to the music theoretical texts of Western music from Ancient Greece to Rameau."

   "question_text": "How did this course deepen your knowledge of your discipline\/profession? To what extent did this course contribute to your dissertation\/research?",
   "comments": [
    "The course provided a beautiful counterweight to the music theory proseminar (which almost all of us were concurrently taking with Pat McCreless), since the proseminar taught us about the most recent incarnation of music theory as an academic discipline in the modern university--the opposite end of the history of theory, in other words. As helpful and important as the proseminar was, it was easy for me to think somewhat bleak thoughts during it: \"must Music stay shackled to ivy-covered walls if her devotees wish to make even a living wage?\" I would ask, knowing the question a bit silly but still being unable to help it. But taking Nathan's class at the same time reminded me that, long after the Sterling Memorial Library has been burnt to a pile of ash that future historians can hardly distinguish from those left behind by the Library of Alexandria, the harmony of the sphres will continue to reverberate across the infinite reaches of time and space as serenely as ever before. This knowledge will contribute to my dissertation and research both spiritually (by making sure I do not forget to listen for the World-Soul singing lullabies to me each night) and practically (by giving me a much stronger base of knowledge about early music-theoretical knowledge), since I do hope to write a dissertation that considers a rather long time-scale, especially the earlier parts of which this course's materials will most certainly aid a great deal in understanding.",
    "This course was very relevant to my profession and significantly deepened my historical perspective.",
    "Though I am unsure as to the extent to which this course's topics will figure into future dissertation research, I am glad to have surveyed parts of the history of music theory that I otherwise have little exposure to on a regular basis. I am glad to have gained at least some insight into older music theories and to have a much greater sense of the intellectual lineage of my discipline from some of its earliest origins.",
    "This course provides a foundation for understanding many trends in musical thought that continue today, so it is extremely valuable for that. I do not expect to do much research in purely history of theory areas in the future, but I do expect that my general understanding of the material from this course will make me a better musical thinker in the future. Much of the best theoretical work does a good job of tracing its lineage in historical precedents, and I think that this course will help me to do that in my own work.",
    "This course allowed for a wide exposure to primary source material that could be useful later on."
