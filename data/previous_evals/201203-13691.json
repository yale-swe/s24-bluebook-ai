I'm not sure the course was designed to have a common thread beyond agrarian societies. Maybe an intro or wrap up with common themes.",
    "This is an excellent inter-disciplinary course. I recommend this course to anyone who has an open mind and is ready to challenge their preconceived notions.",
    "3. There is SO MUCH reading for this course! I imagine that the instructors must know that it's really not feasible to do200+ pages of reading a week--not when you're taking other classes that also require a lot of time.",

    "class discussion",
    "The rotation of the professors fit well with the inter-disciplinary nature of the course. The lectures were interesting because they were not strictly confined to the subject matter of the book(s). The best aspect of the course is the discussion group - since it is a small group of students from different stages of study (undergraduate&graduate) and fields of study (history, anthropology, environmental studies). This is the most diverse set of students I have shared a class with here at Yale.",
    "The best aspect of the course was the interdisciplinary approach to the material given by having three professors. The readings were always very engaging.",
    "The subject matter is really interesting, and each of the professors is clearly brilliant and really interesting.",
    "This is one of the best courses I have taken in the school. The course was interdisciplinary, focusing on current and very high standard analytical skill.The best aspect of the this course was the group discussion with students, where by students in turn lead discussion sessions on the reading materials. The discussions were high standard and relevant."

    "continuity between classes and the \"narrative thread\" of the course. Maybe consider a Ta or TF",
    "N\/A - this class is perfect.",
    "It seemed like a lot of the discussions were centered around theoretical discussion. I would have liked to talk about a more practical application of the material.",
    "I think this class would be greatly benefitted by a TA. It was pretty easy to feel that the professors didn't really care too much about the students--or at least that they were not very communicative. It was hard to gauge what was expected of us, and we never got any feedback on our assignments.",
    "All in all I found this course to be one of the best courses I have taken. The history part of the course entirely focused on China, which I thought could be improved by adding perspectives from other countries."

    "Yes, no room for improvement.",
    "Sometimes there was disconnect between lecture and discussions. Lecture material was seldom brought up in discussion.",
    "The discussion was often more interesting to me than the lecture, because it was more relevant to the reading, and more helpful for understanding conceptual material. Sometimes the lecture seemed only tangentially related to the readings.",
    "The discussion and the lectures were consistent and complimentary. It was quite remarkable how the professors pulled this off to make it look natural.The course lectures provided a frame of thought while the discussion sessions offered cases to reflect up on using the frames."

It is intellectually engaging and challenging. If you are ready to read and open to discussing your thoughts and listening to differing points of view then you should take this course. You will not regret it.",

    "Overall, it's really interesting--just know that the reading load is immense (though you can usually get a away with not doing all of it), and professors can seem a bit distant.",
    "The readings for this course tend to get intensive. As long as you're ready for that, it is the best course. Th fact that it was interdisciplinary, gave me perspectives I would not have gained if I was taking only environmental courses."
