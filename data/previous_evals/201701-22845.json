    "My vocabulary and grammar really improved in this course.",
    "I learned a significant number of Hebrew vocabulary and grammar as well as past tense verbs which was excellent in preparing me for practical application of Hebrew. I improved my speaking, reading, and writing skills as well as learned about Hebrew in modern technology such as texting in Hebrew."

    "I think this class is very strong in teaching students of all backgrounds and never really going to slowly or quickly, which I think is a very good quality. As a weakness, I think that the course sometimes covers topics in a somewhat unnatural order, but I do not feel that particularly takes away from the learning process.",
    "We had so many resources available to us. I really like that we can go to events and hebrew tables to get more exposure to the language. However, I felt that there was a lot of homework around the time of the final exam, and I would have rather used that time to study on my own.",
    "This was an excellent course. The fact that it met every day and had short homework assignments helped process and reinforce the information learned in class."

    "I would definitely recommend this course and the entire Hebrew program to another Student! I think that Hebrew is a very special language and it can be picked up through the interesting and rigorous Hebrew courses, especially 120!",
    "I thought the language was taught very well. I felt that the instructor was approachable and the material was accessible.",
    "Yes!",
    "Yes I would definitely recommend this course to another student! The Hebrew department at Yale is absolutely amazing and I am so glad I took this course. Orit is the nicest professor, who is always there to support you and give you feedback and is extremely understanding. She wants her students to succeed and does an excellent job teaching. Take this course!!!"
