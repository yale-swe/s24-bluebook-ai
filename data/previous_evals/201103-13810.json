   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this class. The readings are very varied and super interesting and you learn a lot about writing.",
    "I would summarize the course as a very interesting class with good readings but a tough schedule in writing. There was a period where I had to work on two essays at the same time for this class, which was a little overwhelming. Overall I'd recommend this class to another student as it was my favorite class this semester. The readings and discussion are pretty interesting, and the writing wasn't too bad besides a few stressful weeks.",
    "This class introduced me to writing college papers. For me, the essays were very challenging because I had never written college papers before, but the course and the professor helped me a lot. I feel that my writing has improved because of this course and I have a better understanding of what a college paper entails. I would definitely recommend this class, especially to someone who, like me, wasn't very confident in their ability to write on a college level.",
    "I recommend this course because it will get you thinking about literature (and the works) in new ways.Also, this course was very helpful when it came to improving our writing skills.",
    "English 115 was a good class for people who need instruction for writing in college. It was generous grading, and there was plenty of help. The work load was very manageable and the discussions were always interesting.",
    "English 115 is a class that gears students to writing for college, and is a great transition from high school to university-level writing. I would recommend this class to all incoming freshmen."
