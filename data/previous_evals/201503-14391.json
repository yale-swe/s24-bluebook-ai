    "Take it. So interesting and relevant. Prof Aslanidis is a great teacher and the conversations in class are always very lively. The two hours fly by!!",
    "Yes! really interesting topic with not a lot of work",
    "Take it, it is a good intro to an important economic event in history for poli sci majors",
    "Absolutely, I would recommend this course for students very interested in the causes and consequences leading up to and following the Eurozone crisis. Many current events today in the Greek region pertain to the course material.",
    "A great class if you have any interest in learning about the Eurozone crisis.",
    "The course was genuinely great. The combination of effective techniques, organization and amicability of the instructor created an incredible classroom environment. You learn a great deal about the Eurozone Crisis through very fairly balanced readings (cover all major and even several minor viewpoints) and a fun classroom setting that engages and challenges your viewpoints while offering further information and angles to several issues. Sick course take it, you won't regret it. Paris is an awesome professor.",
    "I would recommend this class because you come out with a very sound knowledge of a current issue."
