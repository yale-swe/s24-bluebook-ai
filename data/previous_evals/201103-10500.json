    "This course can be looked as an advanced course in Computer Science. If some students aim to pursue some research in the field of programming language or formal semantics, I will absolutely recommend this course to them. On the other side, this course is also very challenging, since the content of the lectures is very difficult and there are many assignments which can be looked as time killer.Therefore, I can say I will recommend this course to the students who are ambitious and indeed aim to pursue some challenging researches."

   "comments": [
    "I can say I will benefit from almost all the content of this course, since the content is so important for my future research. More important thing is that I cannot understand many parts of the course if I learn this course by myself (i.e., not taking the course). Thus, taking this course and finishing all the assignments (including final project) is very important for my research and my understanding of this course.In addition, I think formal methods should be very useful for any parts of computer science; thus, studying this course will be useful to pursue many fields in Computer Science.",
    "Prior to taking this course I had very little exposure to formal semantics and type theory. As such, it has been an immense help and I now feel that I am much better equipped to understand current research in the field."
