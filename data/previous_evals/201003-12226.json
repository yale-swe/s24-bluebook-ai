   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend the class. Professor Tooze is engaging and incredibly intelligent, and the breadth of information taught is great.",
    "Unless you are obsessed with the diplomatic history and obsessed with this time period, no. If you are just interested, but don't know that much ( how I was), I'd say take a different seminar. Tooze is a nice guy and a fair grader, but he doesn't devote a lot of himself to teaching this seminar.",
    "Yes. It's a great seminar, lots of interesting people, Tooze is great. Take it if you have any interest in the period, but maybe freshen up on your WWI history in the first couple weeks. The workload is quite manageable.",
    "if you want to throw yourself into the subject matter of ww1 (which is fascinating) take this class- i find it difficult to imagine a better professor from which to learn",
    "Definitely would recommend it. The topics are very interesting and Professor Tooze always led good discussions. Try to do some background reading about the war if you don't know much about it already.",
    "Tooze is a legend. Amazing. History 241J has a great reading list and an amazing concept. If you are interested in really seeing the foundations of Democracy and Peacemaking in the 20th century, this is the perfect course to explore those ideas.Beware, the course is often dominated by Tooze fans who dominate and lead the conversation, often away from the reading. If you do not have a strong background in WW1 I would not take the course. Tooze is very critical of your work, for better or worse.",
    "This class was completely awful. Tooze talks almost the whole time, there's no class discussion, almost all the readings are from his yet-unpublished, rough manuscript, so the course generally is hard to follow. Totally uninteresting, not at all engaging. Tooze is really unpleasant. Don't take it. There are so many better junior history seminars.",
    "This is an advanced seminar that deals with WWI in a thematic way by focusing on the ways in which the rhetorics of democracy and peace became entangled during and after the war. The course is a lot of work and very rewarding. I would advise students to be cautious before enrolling, however, because the course is truly designed for an advanced student of European history. Professor Tooze is brilliant and one of his greatest strengths is his ability to draw on relevant episodes across European history and politics to complement the readings for each seminar. Not having a great familiarity with many of these references will greatly diminish the value of the seminar."
