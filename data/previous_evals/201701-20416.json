    "Knowledge about Roman law, how legal systems evolved over time.",
    "This course helped me view Roman history through its legal development. Because I came to the class with a strong knowledge of Roman history, I could look at the laws as formal codifications of social and cultural change. Thus, the history itself was illuminated.",
    "General knowledge of Roman law and how it applies to modern legal systems How to apply law to specific cases",
    "A introduction to a chronological framework for veiwing Roman law, and a sense of the basic architecture of civil law.",
    "Take this class if you want to learn about Roman society, not if you want to learn about the law. Roman law, despite influencing our modern legal code, was very different. Its strict rules reveal more about Roman life and how people interacted with each other and their government. Professor Lenski is a gem of a teacher who gave very good lecture notes that made his classes easy to follow. All in all, a good class to take if you need a preindustrial credit.",
    "This course focuses on critical thinking and memorization. It is a good introduction to Roman history and draws interesting lines between historical events and the evolution of a Roman sense of justice."

   "comments": [
    "Lectures and reading pretty good. Not a lot of feedback on assignments. Great overall though.",
    "The readings and case studies were very interesting. The lectures were informative.",
    "The course was well structured with a good textbook and strong case studies. However, I felt we spent too much time discussing basic history and law in lecture, detracting from the best aspect of the course: viewing and contextualizing the development of Rome through her laws. Perhaps a version of the course could be explicitly aimed at students with substantial classics experience.",
    "The sections for this course were absolutely fantastic. Seriously the best sections I've had at Yale. They were so organized and helpful for the midterm and final",
    "Could include more acknowledgment of relevance, i.e. how certain aspects of ancient law affected present legal tradition throughout the course rather than a summary of it at the end.",
    "In depth treatment of legal concepts but with a historical focus. The discussions sections were more helpful when they consistently applied time towards reviewing the material.",
    "We did not have enough time to complete the coins\/papyrus paper. I felt very rushed and even though it's only 10% of our grade, I would certainly have appreciated at least a weekend to collect my thoughts and organize them on paper.",
    "I think this course was strongest when it was creating connections between ideas and historical events. This is a ton of information for memorization, and it sometimes feels overwhelming because some ID's may have been mentioned only in passing during class. Another strength of the course is section. It was great to discuss case studies and logic our way through them together as opposed to discussing the history, which Prof Lenski often explained thoroughly during class."

    "Would recommend. Easy, interesting class if you're into Roman culture\/law.",
    "Yes! Take this course. It's different from your usual history class.",
    "Yes, definitely. The workload is manageable and you learn a lot about Roman law in one semester.",
    "Yes! Lenski and Feeney made a great team.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student looking for an introductory Roman history course that covers Roman laws. I would have some reservations suggesting it to a student with substantial knowledge of classical history looking for high-level analysis.",
    "I have already recommended this course to a bunch of my friends. Roman law is a superb Yale course, truly a gem",
    "If they are very interested in Roman law and legal tradition in general then yes. Otherwise, it will likely be quite boring.",
    "This course is a must for conceptualizing the origins of law and gaining a deeper perspective on law and classics. Would recommend to anyone willing to put up with Latin heavy vocab, but especially to Classics majors.",
    "Especially if considering law school. Also a great substitute for lecture on Roman law.",
    "Take this class if you want to learn about Roman society, not if you want to learn about the law. Roman law, despite influencing our modern legal code, was very different. Its strict rules reveal more about Roman life and how people interacted with each other and their government.
