   "question_text": "What knowledge, skills, and insights did you develop by taking this course?",
   "comments": [
    "Writing ability, awareness of the scope of educational issues, how to think clearly about education and how to interact with my own education.",
    "Meta-thinking the ability to critically think about and evaluate how I have learned and developed in the last 21 years of my life.",
    "I am a better person for having taken EDST 210. Hersh runs this course under the belief that everyone shold be putting more into higher education. Students should have more demanded of them, and he asks a lot. This course requires hundreds of pages of reading (and I mean *actually* doing the reading) and a 3+ page paper EVERY week. And this isn't a reading response -- the man is a tough grader. If you write a bad paper, you're getting a bad grade. Simple as that. That said, he also demands more of himself. The seminars are expertly planned and follow a beautiful arc. The paper topics are engaging and complex. The readings present a variety of viewpoints. He runs a well-organized class with clarity and tact. And because I had to put in a lot, I got a lot out of this course. It solidified my passion for education -- now more than ever am I certain this is what I want to follow. I feel like my perspective on learning and development has been permanently changed (for the better). I can't go back after taking this course. It has changed my life, and I am the richer for it.",
    "This class (although not a writing credit), really helps you grow as a writer. Probably the most valuable writing skill I developed is the ability to judge and criticize my own writing. Additionally, this is the kind of class that really gives you a different lens of looking at concepts of human growth and meaning, which you can use for things very far removed from the topic of education. Finally, this class gives you the language (knowledge, framework, insights) you need to really talk to any expert of U.S. education. You can be really interested in the topic of education and be unable to be on the same page (or close enough to the same page) as someone who is really involved because you just don't know enough about the topic. If you took EDST110 and still didn't feel like you don't know enough TAKE THIS CLASS.",
    "This class was wonderful in that I learned a lot about the American education system while developing my skills as a writer, too. In doing the hundreds of pages of reading every week, we learned a lot about the American ed system, everything from pre-K to higher ed, which was really valuable. Beyond learning a lot from the readings - and from our class discussions - this class was really valuable in that Hersh is a demanding grader and expects a great deal out of your writing. So, in writing a five (to seven or so) page paper every week, he challenged us to be comfortable writing consistently, and pushing ourselves to write in a clear and compelling way.",
    "A ton! I learned about the American education system - its promises and its challenges. Some of the readings were really gripping, but some were pretty boring and chart-heavy.",
    "In this class, I learned to more confidently discern my own meaning from a variety of authorities, facts, and opinions. I gained writing skills, such as making a clear argument in a concise manner and using sources without relying on their voices. In reading the variety of books, papers, and articles that we did--and in having the sort of detailed synthesis that we did through our writing and discussion--I gained enormous insight into the ideological promises our education system puts forward and the practical failures we currently face throughout our country that do not allow the promises to be realized. I gained a type of detailed analytic thinking about American education that is too often overlooked, even by education professionals and policy makers. I feel I have gained an enormous amount of insight and skill that have made me a better student overall as well as a more aware and knowledgeable player in our education system.",
    "I learned an unbelievable amount about the U.S. K-12 and higher education systems, about the theory behind them and what makes them effective, about the actual practices that our country engages in and how they differ from theory and best practices, and about the critical role that education plays for our society and our psychological development. The course inspired me to pursue a career in education despite having entered with no prior knowledge and only a vague notion about the importance of education. And not only did the course inspire me and teach me about education theory, but it provided me with a standard from which to evaluate all other courses that I take, as Professor Hersh does an incredible job of putting the theories of effective teaching into practice. This leads to a class that really immerses you in the material, giving you a deep understanding of all the issues discussed, and makes you wonder how you ever learned within any other context. The assignment structure developed my critical reading skills, my writing skills, my research skills, my teamwork and collaboration skills, and my ability to take large amounts of information and synthesize it into a compelling and persuasive argument. It was easily the most I've ever learned in a single class at Yale or otherwise.",
    "Super in-depth knowledge about all issues PK-12 education, as well as insight into the psychology of learning and development. Really strong ability to synthesize and critically analyze information, as well as much improved writing skills over the course of the semester. Greater ability to express nuanced and sometimes controversial viewpoints clearly and with confidence during class. This class gives you an idea of what every classroom-- Yale or otherwise-- should look like."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: Everything about how meticulously and thoughtfully the reading and writing assignments were selected and structured. It taught us what learning should like, while at the same time meeting those very standards. Weaknesses: I think that there could have been more opportunity for discussion and debate within the actual seminars. Prof. Hersh always had amazing things to say, but I wish he let students do a little more talking during seminar itself.",
    "Strengths- The professor is a good teacher. The people that take this class are really in it to learn. You leave each class with a sense of wonder. Weaknesses- If you are afraid of a lot of work don't take this class. (But then again, if you are fine with a lot of work as long as its meaningful work, go ahead take this class.)",
    "The strengths of this class were, this semester, in the students in the class - my classmates cared really deeply about the class and were smart and passionate, and I don't think that it was an accident (because the kids who take this class care a lot about ed and know that Hersh expects a lot out of his students). So I loved that this class attracted really engaged people, and then that Hersh set very high standards for us -- in assigning a few hundred pages of reading and an essay every week, as well as a long mid-term and a final paper -- and then challenged us to meet his standards, and to grow. The reading list is, for the most part, great, and you'll learn a ton from writing the essays every week. The weakness of this class was that, sometimes, it felt like we wasted whole class periods because Hersh would literally talk for the entire class and just ramble -- he is super smart and has an incredible depth of knowledge, but sometimes he'll just start talking and ramble, and not engage us\/ask us questions\/challenge us to think about and talk about what we were learning. That was very frustrating -- but hopefully he'll do that less in the future.",
    "Class discussions could be a bit more \"guided\" and rigorous. Whenever Prof Hersh spoke, it really helped things along.",
    "The most obvious strength, from my perspective, is the accountability. You are expected, both by Professor Hersh and by your peers, to perform at your highest level and to put in the time and effort to master the material. Each week, you must not only understand the material, but form clear opinions about it and about its significance in the context of the other information you have learned so far. The discussion section format, where each student has a voice in the classroom and has become expert in others' writing and opinions, also creates the optimal environment for tackling the material in the greatest possible depth. Plus, it helped to have nametags up in every class so that we could not possibly help but pair names to faces throughout the semester. I count myself incredibly blessed to have wandered into the classroom during shopping period, despite not being an education studies scholar, and I would not change the class in the slightest. I only wish my own schedule had allowed me more time to spend with the readings each week.",
    "This course is incredible. Professor Hersh's pedagogy is exactly in line with the most effective teaching practices. He's extremely accessible and easy to talk to, always certain to take your ideas seriously and help you to develop them. He even invited our class over to his house for dinner one night, where we had a delicious home-cooked meal and a full discussion that acted as that week's seminar. Hersh encourages group discussion and collaboration, including several assignments that require peer editing or co-authorship. He gives feedback on assignments within hours of your sending them to him, including the final 20-page paper I had to submit, and he concentrates more on your learning than any sort of administrative duties or strict set of rules. The curriculum is structured intuitively and in a way that builds upon itself to create a grand overall picture of education by the end of the semester. Professor Hersh even encouraged class discussion outside of the classroom through an email panlist he set up early in the semester for the exchange of education news articles. He inspired full participation from every student, making the classroom an environment full of eager and prepared participants. The assignments were directly linked to class discussions and provided ample guidance while awarding plenty of room for creativity, and each one helped to develop essential college and workplace skills of research, writing, synthesis, and collaboration. The readings each week all fit together beautifully to provide a full and complete picture of the week's topics, allowing for a level of comfortability with the material that made writing and discussion easier. The only thing that might be considered a weakness of the class is the time commitment it entails, as it required a fair bit more work than any of my other classes. But this shouldn't even be counted as a weakness because the time I invested in the class each week was enjoyable, because the work was so interesting and involved, and it really felt as if I was learning an incredible amount of material. Overall this was an amazing class.",
    "There isnt much more I want to add in this section besides what I wrote in the general comments (this class was amazing, and I loved it), but I have a couple ideas for how to improve the course. For one, this class should be a writing credit. I did two or three times more writing in this class than for any other writing credit Ive taken. It would be awesome if EDST 210 could have fulfilled a WR requirement. Second, this course could benefit from biweekly essays.I understand why the workload is necessary, and that real learning cannot be achieved unless students engage with the material in depth. But I often felt like I spent a good 80% (or more) of my time on this class alone, and didnt have time to devote to my other courses. Though I was able to work around that (I prioritized this class from the start and always felt that the readings and essays were valuable), it was very stressful, and having the essays due every Sunday made it so there was never really a break. In a place as crazy stressful as Yale, burnout is real and having a day to recharge is a huge help to students. The way EDST 210 is set up, that day is technically Monday (if we submitted our work by Sunday), but Monday is typically the day that the work stacks up for all of our other classes. This structure results in a constant grind, which is manageable but costly to students. Im not sure if you would agree with this, but adjusting the essays\/prompts to be biweekly may help students breathe better and have more energy to devote to each response. Other than that, this class was amazing and the best Ive taken at Yale!"

   "comments": [
    "10\/10 would recommend. Lots of work though.",
    "This was an absolutely amazing class. I am not an Ed Studies scholar, and have never taken an Ed Studies class. I am international, and have not undergone the American education system, other than my last three years at Yale. But this class blew my mind made me critically think about how we learn, how we develop, how we can optimally make the most of a place like Yale, the purpose of a liberal arts education etcetc. As a senior, I found it one of the most challenging and reflection-inducing classes I have taken here, and I can not recommend it more to anyone else, regardless of what they study and what their aspirations are. I am an English major, but our class consisted of Math, Comp-Sci, East Asian Studies, Chemistry, EP&E, Af-Am studies etcetc, I don't think there was a single overlap. This class represents what a seminar in a liberal arts college should look like in its most ideal form. It is hard though, a ton of writing and reading (weekly papers!) But it pays off. And Prof. Hersh gives you feedback literally the day after you turn a paper in.",
    "Without a doubt. I honestly believe every Yale student should take this course -- we would all be the richer for it. Sure, this class teaches you everything you could possibly know about education in America. But it also helps you learn about the developmental process of higher learning. If you've ever had confusion or frustration in college, this class will help you sort through it. That was immensely powerful for me.",
    "yaaaas take it! take it!",
    "I'd definitely recommend this class. If you're interested in the American education system (everything from pre-K to higher ed) and in getting the chance to reflect on your own education\/Yale, too, it's a really valuable class -- you read a ton, reflect on it in weekly essays, and talk about it in a seminar with a really knowledgeable teacher. The other excellent part of this class is that Hersh assigns weekly five page papers -- which are a lot of work, but if you want to become a better writer, Hersh challenges you to step up and write in a clear and compelling way, which is extremely valuable. Hersh cares a lot about his students and has put together a class that teaches you a great deal -- the frustrating thing is that Hersh is sometimes not the greatest at leading class discussions. He has a tendency to ramble, and sometimes will spend almost a whole class period talking in tangents and anecdotes -- class was great when he challenged us to engage with each other, but sometimes it felt like he had no real plan or goals for a class session, so the seminar itself sometimes felt like wasted time. That said, when he did lead class discussions in a constructive way, we had excellent discussions, and I learned a ton -- so while the class meetings were a bit mixed, overall the class was absolutely worth it.",
    "Yes!",
    "This is unquestionably one of the best classes at Yale. It will force you to think from a completely different perspective about systems and ideas you take for granted, it will push you to the limit in your capacity to ingest new information and concepts every week, it will hold you accountable for your learning, and it will improve your ability to make a clear, interesting argument concisely through writing. If you are given the chance, PLEASE take this class. It was the best decision I have made at Yale, especially since I am not an education studies scholar, and I kind of wandered into the class during shopping period because it looked interesting. The class covers a ton of material, from philosophy to history to policy to psychology, and from preschool through higher education. You gain incredible insight into the ideological promises our education system puts forward and the practical failures we currently face throughout our country that do not allow the promises to be realized. Professor Hersh is a gifted, experienced, and incredible teacher. Everyone who has been a student, and certainly everyone who would like to work in education, should be put through his curriculum. The information about the many malfunctions in our education system in and of itself is incredibly important and will probably shift your worldview. And when paired with his instruction, it may just blow your mind. It did for me. I will say to make sure that you are aware of--and plan for--the workload. You will write a 2-5 page paper every week after what can amount to 200-400 pages of reading (plus a longer paper for the midterm and final), and this is definitely one of those classes where you want to (and need to) actually do the readings and put in the work. I should not have taken five classes during the semester I took this class, and I would definitely plan to have this class be your center of focus or your life might get very overwhelming. But high expectations leads to a high payoff, and I could not recommend the class more effusively. Honestly, the workload made it even more impactful and immersive. It is amazing. Take it, take it, take it!",
    "Absolutely take this class. Professor Hersh is the single best professor I've ever had, and I wish that everyone could have the same learning experience that I had this past semester. I came into the course with almost no knowledge about education, and I'm leaving with intimate understandings of the U.S. K-12 and higher education systems, the developmental psychology of learning, the policy issues behind school reform, ideal teaching and schooling practices, and so much more that I had never expected to get out of this course. The workload is heavy, yes, but every minute spent on this class is interesting and worthwhile, and I never once felt like I was spending too much time on this class despite the fact that it was more involved than any of my other classes. Professor Hersh himself exemplifies in practice the most effective teaching practices that he talks about in theory. He is accessible and easy to talk to, he provides almost immediate feedback on every assignment, he has held every position imaginable in education and knows an unbelievable amount about the subject, and he manages to lead and inspire every student in the class to create an environment where everyone comes eager and fully prepared to class. If you're even thinking about taking this class, do it. Shape your schedule around it. Every student at Yale should have a learning experience like the one Professor Hersh provides.",
    "This class is incredible. I have never learned more about education policy than I have in the last semester, and Ive never taken a course that felt so applicable to real life. Professor Hersh has high expectations for his students and treats them as if they will become the future leaders in education policy. He has a great deal of faith in his students to analyze and solve (to the best of their ability) some of the most difficult issues in education policy. This class is challenging, though the workload is immense and this is done on purpose. Professor Hersh wants his students to truly engage with the material, so it is not at all possible to skate through this class without doing the reading. The weekly reading responses were pretty stressful for me, since I wanted to turn in multiple drafts (Hersh encourages this and will increase your grade if your draft shows real improvement) and that meant completing the 200+ pages of reading a week within a few days and then submitting a first draft by Friday (which I only ever managed to do once, since it was practically impossible). But the bright side is that Professor Hersh is flexible with deadlines and really only cares that youre putting effort into your work and growing as a writer. He also provides a lot of feedback on your writing (track changes) and encourages you to email him, meet with him in person, or even call him to talk about your essay. Try to have as relaxed of an attitude towards the essays as possible while still treating them as priority, since in my experience its easy to develop a mental block towards them. I think thats what made the essays so difficult to write for me, and why my writing felt pretty awkward and forced at times. The best essays I wrote were the ones where I did the reading with the prompt in mind, and then sat down and let the thoughts just flow out onto the page. This can produce a kind of messy essay, but with Hershs critiques (and eventually, with your own) you can learn to make really excellent revisions and produce better and better work over the course of the semester (thats the whole point). Because every student has engaged with the readings in depth before coming to class, the seminar discussions are AMAZING. Over time the group becomes really close-knit I became friends with every student in the class. At the end of the semester Professor Hersh invites everyone to his house for dinner, which he cooks himself, and you get to meet his wife and his cats (!!). One of my best experiences at Yale was driving back to campus in the rain, six of us piled into one car, talking about education and telling funny stories and sharing memories. Just an example of how much you bond with your peers in this class. For the final, Professor Hersh gives you a choice between responding to a prompt or pursuing a project of your choice. Pick the project of your choice! Its so much more fun, and it made it much easier for me to write because I was so interested in the subject I was exploring. So tl;dr: This class is FANTASTIC despite the hilarious amount of work, because you learn so much about education, your writing, and yourself. Ive never felt so engaged in a class before. The work (though tough) was always worth it because I felt connected to my professor and my classmates, and I wanted to contribute meaningfully to the conversations. Plus the readings are naturally interesting and surprisingly easy to read most of the time (though theyre long). I loved this class, it was a defining experience in my Yale career, and coming out of it I feel I have grown as a person, not just as a student. The work was worth it for the knowledge and skills I developed over time, and for the relationships I made with the professor and the other students in the class."
