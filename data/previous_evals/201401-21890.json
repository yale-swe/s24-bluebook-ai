    "It's a faster pace than L1, but I enjoyed the class much more. It was a lot of fun, and I would definitely recommend it!",
    "Taking Portuguese at Yale was the best academic decision I made. I say that even though my major is not in Portuguese. We each have our individual reasons for taking a language, but trust that the department at Yale is fantastic. My professor in particular made it great fun, and I feel like I've emerged out of L2 with respectable proficiency. I can now hold basic conversations and even write emails in Portuguese. Seriously, take Portuguese. It's not as easy as I thought it would be (I had no background whatsoever in Spanish), but I've seriously enjoyed L1 and L2 so much this year.",
    "The class is not very challenging, and not that different from L1. I would recommend it to someone who needs a language credit, because it seems to be less intensive than other L1 language options."
