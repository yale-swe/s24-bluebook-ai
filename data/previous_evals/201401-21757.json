    "Well worth it. This course challenges you. It takes up a lot of time but not in the busy work, pset kind of way. You are learning an entirely new craft from the ground up and in order to learn, one needs to invest substantial time. I would definitely recommend that anyone who is even slightly interested in filmmaking take this course. At times you will hate it. You will hate the editing software for not exporting your footage because of some bug. You will hate yourself for forgetting to make sure audio was recording. But it will all be okay and even better than okay. When you finally finish a scene or short film, you have a tangible representation of all of your work. This art form is definitely one that requires work and grit, but it is so awesome. You learn about all of the technical aspects as well as the artistic ones, and it is an extremely well structured course. Keep in mind that you will have some sort of film project every week so make sure you have time in your schedule if you intend to take the class. This course forces you to actually make films and do something instead of waffling between ifs and maybes. And for that I am extremely grateful. This class gives you a whole new appreciation for filmmaking and movies. Start thinking about your final project early.",
    "Definitely take the class... unless you don't have a lot of time for it. This is not just a fun, relaxing course you can take for a 5th class. It is really fun and rewarding, but only if you put time and effort into it; otherwise, it's going to be a difficult journey. If you're at all interested in learning how to make films - camera technique, writing, directing, lighting, sound, etc. - take it! You'll make a lot of mistakes but love every minute of it and end up with a final project you're actually proud of.",
    "If you want to learn how to make films, this class is the way to do it. You'll work a lot, make films every week, and learn a lot about writing, acting, and everything else that goes into a film\u2014and Prof. Luckow's guidance is valuable and knowledgeable.",
    "If you already love filmmaking, this class is for you. If you don't and want to see, this will definitely tell you whether making films is your thing. The workload is intensive, with a project and reading every week, but very rewarding, especially at the end when watching the final projects and seeing how far you and your classmates have come.",
    "Great class. You should take it if you are not afraid to have your work analyzed. Sandra Luckow is a great professor. And I enjoyed the small size of the classs.",
    "I would recommend it if you're at all interested in making films. It's fun and I learned a lot, even though it's a lot of work. If you're willing to put in the effort (and even if you're not) it's a really rewarding experience.",
    "I would recommend this class if you are really excited to learn how to make films. You will get to make many films, some of which you will be proud of, and most of which will be more learning experiences---but that's what's fun about it! However, don't take this class if you already have a heavy workload---the filming assignments take longer than they seem they will, and there is a lot of reading and responses on top of that. Overall I'm really glad I took this class and learned about a subject I knew very little about.",
    "This class gives you a hard skill, which is somewhat rare at Yale. It really challenges you to do something entirely different from nearly every other course at Yale... (no essays, barely any reading) but... you create from start to finish your own short films. Although the syllabus says a film a week, it ended up being a little less than that, but the class is work intensive. Getting actors for a film last minute on the weekend, shooting and editing is A LOT of work. It's worth it though. Also, be wary, you have to be able to take a joke and a lot of criticism. Sandra makes a nearly 4 hour class seem shorter than it is, but will not go lightly on your films. If you really start thinking about your final film early, it will be something you're very proud of.",
    "This class is essential to two sorts of people: those who want a carrier in film, and those who just want to be able to rely on film in their career. It is of course not enough as the class is an introduction: but it is a very very good and complete introduction that will not only introduce you to the general practical knowledge of filmmaking, but will also immerse you in the mindset of visual thinking."
