    "I learnt a lot about how corporations manage environment-related aspects of their businesses.",
    "business and the environment",
    "Useful frameworks to begin thinking about corporate sustainability and environmental management.",
    "I learned basic business skills, strategies, and management practices. In addition, we were taught how to look at these issues with an environmental perspective.",
    "Basic intro to CSR and corporate sustainability concepts.",
    "The course provided a strong foundation for business theory and strategy, which was new for me. I appreciated the way the class integrated environmental management objectives with business objectives, and illustrated the tensions and synergies between them.",
    "I gained knowledge about management tools (Six Sigma, lean), CSR strategy (CSV), and business strategy (coopetition).",
    "CSV, BOP, Social entrepreneurship",
    "This course provided a valuable introduction to the fundamental concepts of corporate environmental strategy and the tools needed to successfully implement corporate sustainability initiatives. I learned a great deal about the terminology used in the business arena, as well as the most effective strategies to accomplish sustainability goals (as well as the strategies to avoid). This course will serve as a strong foundation for my remaining coursework in the Business and the Environment specialization and for my future career in this field.",
    "Every week's topic was new for me--you could count me as having learning every week's main topic.",
    "Fundamental business concepts and their application to a range of environmental and sustainability issues.",
    "General strategic tools to measure specific parts of a business model, specially related to risk and competition"

    "Met expectations",
    "I think the class met my expectations - at first I was worried that it would be repetitive for me given my previous work experiences, but I was pleasantly surprised and felt like I learned many new concepts.",
    "This class did not meet my expectations. I felt I gained more knowledge about corporate and business strategy, but not enough about sustainability or environmental strategy.",
    "Very good! I really enjoyed the class, and it was very interesting and engaging.",
    "The knowledge, skills, and insights that I gained in this course exceeded my initial expectations.",
    "Early in the course, without business experience, I sometimes felt out of my element. Sometimes I wondered if the strategy piece could come first, or if it could be interwoven amongst the management piece rather than standing in their own blocks.",
    "The skills and concepts covered in the class aligned quite well with my expectations.",
    "Very well"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of the course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "case studies and group projects",
    "topics are interesting, the class felt a bit disorganized at times.",
    "Strengths included the materials taught and the stellar professor. The TFs had varied grading standards and it made it really hard to know what the expectations for each assignment was.",
    "Strong integration of guest lectures, good case studies and term project topics. Interesting field trip(s). Overall an engaging class.",
    "I enjoyed the various case-based assignments for the course, as well as the in-class activities that allowed us to engage with the material of the class. The TA team were all great, very helpful and organized. The final project was rewarding, but we could have received better guidance on structure and expectations for the project. I also sometimes felt that there was an over-emphasis on the manufacturing environment and industrial operations, and I would have liked broader exposure to how environmental concerns play out for diverse types of companies.",
    "Strengths: Guest lecturers (esp. Andy Winston, Ann from GE) Weaknesses: Sometimes poorly organized with readings assigned the night before Issues surrounding corp envi strategy & sustainability lend themselves well to discussion, so it would be beneficial to have more opportunities for structured discussions rather than some of the in-class activities, which were less valuable.",
    "S: the cases were very interesting! It was a great opportunity to learn the concepts in a real-world example. All guests speakers were amazing! W: I personally think that some discussions during the class were not as insightful as when the professor was leading the class.",
    "This course taught me a wide variety of valuable information and tools, through both the lectures and the homework assignments. I particularly enjoyed working on the case study homework assignments - I thought that they provided interesting real-world context for the concepts that we learned in class throughout the semester. I feel that the course could be improved with clearer and more specific guidelines for the homework assignments and the final project.",
    "I appreciated very much the case studies and speakers in the class- felt like a high quality, immersive experience.",
    "Guest speakers usually brought interesting perspectives to class. Case assignments were effective at promoting reflection on course topics, but grading felt very subjective.",
    "The assignments were interesting and engaging, and TAs were very helpful. The group project was a good way to apply the lessons learned in class. Sometimes it felt to me that the class and the way it was taught was too trusting of corporations and business actors. Clearly, corporations are working hard to improve their environmental performance, but it's also true that businesses have caused significant environmental damage, and I was somewhat frustrated throughout the course with what I interpreted as an overall message of \"Oh, they're doing their best, so let's give them credit for that.\" I know that businesses are absolutely vital, but in thinking about systems change and the lessons learned in the Perspectives course, this message was unsatisfactory to me. Perhaps I had somewhat unrealistic expectations, but I was anticipating more of a critical lens being brought into the discussions overall.",
    "A lot of topics without opportunity to fully understand one in particular"

    "Take this class for a general overview of business and the environment.",

    "I would say that this course provides a valuable introduction to the broad concepts in corporate environmental management. My advice would be to choose a project topic that you are interested in and want to spend a lot of time on!",
