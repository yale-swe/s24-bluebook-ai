   "comments": [
    "This course describes how networks increasingly dominate the economic and political situation in the world. It will challenge your thinking about the role of states and politicians. I would recommend this course, because it leads you to think about fascinating topics in the general subject matter. If you are a numbers person, you may be put off by the absence of any sort of empirical evidence for anything in the course.",
    "Take this class. It will change how you think about infrastructure, international governance and strategies for resistance.The ideas explored in this class are borderline subversive. Easterling is talking about nothing less than than the hidden dials and toggles of fictions, economics and politics that help author the world. It's no exaggeration to call this class Yale's \"anti-Grand Strategy\" course. Easterling herself is a delight. She loves these ideas, and it shows. In a lecture full of both undergraduate and graduate students, she somehow managed to learn all our names and address ourindividual interests.The class might sometimes seem a bit erratic, but I promise you that it starts to all come together, and you will literally raise your head from a week's reading and you will see the world differently. The multiple scales at which the course operates (from the global scale in a discussion about \"Empire\" to the scale of the dimensions of a credit card) can sometimes be disorienting, but again, it's worth it.If you're interested in the ideas about global governance, and the hidden machinations that shape our world. THIS INCLUDES NON-ARCHITECTURE MAJORS. The class is cross-listed under Architecture, but non-architecture majors have just as much to gain from it.I'm rambling, but seriously, I can't recommend this course enough. I sincerely think that it should be a distributional requirement.",
    "This class seems more interesting than it actually ends up becoming. It introduces some interesting new ways of thinking that I find worthwhile. I also think Prof. Easterling is brilliant, and her writing (you read a couple of her books in class) is very lucid while utilizing a very new mode of analysis. However, I always thought that the lectures paled in comparison - they danced around the content with ultramodern powerpoint presentations in the background. This is a good fifth class, perhaps, because it isn't demanding and there are some things to be taken from it, but lecture was just a frustrating experience and it always felt like there was more to be had.",
    "Great course. Would recommend the course to another student.",
    "Globalization Space offers a new approach in looking at the underlying infrastructures of the post-nation-state world we live in today. A new approach requires new vocabulary and new modes of thinking, and Professor Easterling does a wonderful job of taking us through these through her lectures and reading discussions. I highly recommend this course to everyone, as I believe the material is relevant to students of all disciplines.",
    "Yes, if you're in the architecture major it's a useful way to broaden your understanding of what architecture can mean ...",
    "Prof. Easterling\u0092s course is definitely one of the more mind-opening ones I\u0092ve taken here. She does a very good job of presenting the topic of Globalization and its constructs in a very accessible way to students. Her lectures are always interesting, once people emerge from the theoretical classes in the first few weeks. The workload of the class is fair, with readings and section every week, and a final paper. The TA\u0092s are really helpful, especially Matthew Gin, and if he\u0092s leading a section next year, definitely try to get into that. Overall, I\u0092m happy that I took this class and it certainly was one of the better taught courses I\u0092ve taken here.",
    "Sometimes you might get lost in the jargon, but if you overlook it the class is very interesting. Take it!"
