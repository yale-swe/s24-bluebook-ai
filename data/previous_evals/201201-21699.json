    "Take it. Even if it's totally outside your normal areas of interest, this stuff is surprisingly relevant to understanding the modern world and Manning does a great job.",
    "The readings are very dense, but you will learn about topics that not many people know about. It's a nice little niche course, and I think it gave me a better picture of Ancient societies than anything to do with law. There's a final paper and one must lead the classroom lecture once. Other than that it is pretty painless and the topics are mostly interesting. Take it if you are looking for something where the work comes in one huge chunk at the end of the semester and there's nothing before that.",
    "Yes, if it looks like it's a little more focused.",
    "It has a lot of reading but not a huge amount of work overall, and is interesting in class. I'd definitely recommend it.",
    "Disorganized syllabus but good content.",
    "fun seminar if you're interested in the topic",
    "I would recommend this class because the subject was fascinating and the discussion was also very interesting.",
    "I would, but only if you are willing to deal with occasionally large -and sometimes even boring- amounts of reading."
