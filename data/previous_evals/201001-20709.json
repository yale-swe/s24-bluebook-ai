   "comments": [
    "Take this if you are really interested in development and have good knowledge of econometrics.",
    "Yes I would to anyone who wants to understand development economics better.",
    "Great course. Work load is not too heavy.",
    "Yes. I will.",
    "I definitely recommend the course to non-IDE students, who has interest in development economics.",
    "Development Economics was the one class in the IDE program that had a more practical approach to economics. In that sense, it was very valuable. However, a lot could be improved.",
    "I strongly recommend this course to other students with strong economic background. Students with non-economic background may find the material harder to grasp.",
    "It will be difficult for someone who has never done econometrics before.",
    "ECO732 is an in depth analysis of economic theory as it relates to development economics. It is not about specific development project, but focuses on issues of economic evaluation and growth with respect to development. I would recommend 732 to another student, assuming they were adequately prepared to take the class, and realized this is an economics course and not say, a course surveying development projects.",
    "It's a good way to explore development economics that builds on some basic understanding of economic concepts and especially of econometric methods.",
    "I would recommend the course to other students interested in development\/development economics but would suggest that to get most from the course a understanding of econometrics is important.",
    "Yes, if they're interested in the econometric side of development, it's a great course to pursue."
