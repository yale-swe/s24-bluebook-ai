   "comments": [
    "I would recommend it if you need a QR credit, or if you need it for a major, but not otherwise",
    "Take it when you're prepared to do Math!!!. I clearly wasn't.Be ready to put in the effort for the grade.Overall not a bad class starting class for Math. The instructor was great though.",
    "Math 112 is a good review of basic Calculus principles. The online homework involves useful exercises; however, the written homework is often unrelated to work in class, and grading at times seems arbitrary.",
    "Do not take this class unless you have prior experience in calculus. It is taught horribly and the exams are extremely difficult.",
    "I would not recommendMath 112 to another student because I thought that the way in which we were tested was not fair. The homework that we completed for the course did not prepare us for the examinations. I do not believe that our grades will be able to reflect our work done or even mastery of the subject.",
    "Like Calc AB without the integrals, plus some extra difficult material",
    "If you are very good with Math and have a Calc background I would recommend this class",
    "DON'T DEPEND ON THE CURVE! It will MURDER you! Study and practice. Material taught in class is just average. You have to do a little more (or have to have done a little more) in order to sail through with an A.",
    "Cal 112 is a manageable class: One homework per week. Your experience all depends on the instructor you choose. Mr. Tecu is a great teacher. I also heard Mr. Rapinchuk and Mr. Ip were okay too.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course, if you do not have a strong background in calculus. If you have taken calculus before, you should definitely consider higher courses instead.",
    "Honestly, I don't think that the class was taught well at all. I feel like too many of people who are enrolled are taking calc for the second or third time, which really makes it hard to teach to the average student who hasn't taken calculous before (i.e. the student that this class is supposed to be geared towards). I wouldn't take it unless absolutely necessary or without prior knowledge of basic calc.",
    "Math 112 is a quick study of calculus. It seemed as though nearly everyone in the class had previously taken a calculus class,but I had not. This intimidated me at first, but do not be afraid to take calculus if you never have before. The instructors are very helpful. The tests are a little scary, though.",
    "Math 112 is an overall good introduction to Calculus, but most of the instructors will be difficult to understand at times. In addition, the tests and midterms are considerably harder than the homework material, and will be hard to anticipate. I feel like you'll need a bit of prior Calculus prep before this class."
