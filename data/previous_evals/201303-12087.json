    "A great way to fulfill the senior requirement in psych. Really interesting lectures and the workload isn't bad. Recommended highly.",
    "Yes take it!!",
    "Do not take this class as your senior psych seminar. I learned nothing except that women are objectified in images. The only real work is designing a content analysis and writing up the entire study, which is all in the second half of the semester. The class is structured extremely poorly. You don't start the content analysis until late in the semester and there is hardly time to work on your data, results, or discussion sections. There is no TA to help you and Professor LaFrance does not openly offer help and you would have to actively seek it out. You learn how to do zero of the paper writing in the class or receive no help in analyzing your data - I used old documents from Research Methods and Intro Stat to write my paper. Class was useless and a waste of time. That said, it was easy most of the time but she is a tough grader.",
    "Awesome class--definitely try to fight your way in if you aren't pre-registered!",
    "I highly recommend this course. The work for this class did not feel like work! This was a great senior seminar.",
    "Interesting and not much work. Gets redundant by the end though.",
    "Weekly seminar, weekly readings, two project proposals, and a final 20 page paper. I'd definitely recommend this class -- the seminar topics are super interesting; we spent entire class periods discussing topics like gender& facebook, family photographs, Disney films, and hip hop music. The final project was almost fun because we got to choose which medium& topic we wanted to investigate, and develop our own coding system.",
    "This class looks at psychology research in gender imagery, and is a thorough introduction to the subject. You conduct your own content analysis for the final paper, and read many of the influential authors on the subject. The class is usually quite engaging, but since there isn't an easy way to access the lectures it can be frustrating to be taking a lot of notes instead of discussing the material. The papers were not terribly difficult and the final project was pretty fun for me.",
    "I would recommend this class. It can be somewhat repetitive, but the subject matter is interesting. I was pleased that we actually did some WGSS theory at the beginning of the course, although that was less true after the first couple weeks. I think we should have discussed the meaning of gender more and done more to avoid setting up a dichotomy between men and women while ignoring other genders, but otherwise I enjoyed the class.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. If you have an interest in gender psychology, don't think twice! Absolutely take this course. If you have an interest in the impacts of media on psychology, also absolutely take this! The sheer amount of research knowledge that you gain from Dr. LaFrance's integration of the papers at hand and past experiments that have been done is awesome - I can now cite specific off the top of my head that have demonstrated different phenomena of the genders from a psychological perspective. There are two seminar meetings per week, two short oral presentations, and four total written assignments over the course of the semester that culminate in an independent content analysis that you collect data for and write up as your final work.",
    "Take it if you're interested in content analyses, but it is a very difficult methodology to become accustomed to. Further, the assignments aren't always clearly described."
