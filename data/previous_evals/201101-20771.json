    "I would not recommend this course either to specialists or nonspecialists, for the reasons stated above.",
    "This course allows a great deal of individual freedom as to choosing how to navigate the material and selecting a paper topic. If questions of geographic scale play any part in your work, the opportunity to play with these questions in the course will be very valuable, and Professor Dimock is extremely supportive. On the other hand, it is probably not an ideal course for someone who has only a schematic grasp of American literary history; because it is not a period study, one has to fill in a lot of the literary history for oneself.",
    "Very good but very challenging",
    "I would recommend the class with reservations. I really appreciated the freedom that we had to choose our paper topics, and the reading selections were truly excellent - but the course overall did not cohere in the way that I had been expecting it to."
