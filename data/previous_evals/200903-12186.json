    "History of Astronomy deals with a great overview of the history of astronomical advancements and thought reaching as far back as the Babylonians. The material itself was usually intriguing to study, and from time to time the class met at the observatory or at the Beinecke to examine maps, tools and other items associated with astronomy. There was one viewing session where we got to search for Jupiter and its moons using an older telescope as well as the giant one at the observatory, which was awesome. Professor Dal Prete is also a great lecturer that's very approachable and engaging. There are 2 papers and weekly 1-2 page responses associated with the readings, which are a bit dense for certain weeks but overall not too bad. If you have any interest in history, astronomy or both, definitely take this course.",
    "This class covers the cultural history of astronomy, particularly from the sixteenth to the early twentieth centuries. I would absolutely recommend the class; out of all the classes I have taken at Yale, I have probably learned the most from this one. Aside from the regular classes being interesting, the classes at Beinecke were a great opportunity to see some of the early examples of astronomy books."
