   "comments": [
    "It is a very good start to study econometrics",
    "good",
    "Technical. Recommendation would depend on students needs and interest.",
    "Definitely would recommend it since it provides invaluable insights into probability theory and statistics basic on a graduate level. Prerequisite for all data work we will do in years to come.",
    "Sure, seems pretty useful.",
    "This course is definitely one of the most enlightening in the first year economics sequence. The tests are quite difficult but one can definitely do well with hard work. Plenty of help is available for catching up on concepts you can't understand the first-time around. The professor is undoubtably one of the best, most interesting lecturers at Yale and one of the most accomplished econometricians in the world. It is a great privilege to be taught by him. Furthermore, the TA is extremely helpful, holding informative information sessions and being very willing to meet with students individually after class. Overall, an excellent class that you should definitely consider taking if you have the chance.",
    "This course covers the material -very- carefully. Think one learns more rigorous econometrics than in equivalent metrics courses in other programs.",
    "I would recommend to students interested in PhD programs."

    "I learned a lot of interesting history surrounding famous theorems and papers.",
    "It provides good foundation for econometrics techniques and prepares for future research."
