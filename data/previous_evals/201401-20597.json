    "If you are willing to put in the effort, this is a great class.",
    "Absolutely. Be aware however, there's not really any grammar review, but there is a decent amount of writing.",
    "Fren 160 02 is great for the French student looking to understand France and her place in the world. Take the class. You'll be glad you did.",
    "There's a lot of writing and listening homework--which can sometimes become repetitive and cumbersome--but if you are sincerely interested in French culture (not just the French language), you should take the class.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. It is much more interesting than an average french class, and I felt that I really learned many new things about French culture. The class was divided into sections such as the french language, the European Union, immigration, etc. and each theme included textbook readings, articles, and often a movie. The class explored these issues from a French perspective, allowing us to understand more than just the French language. We had reading assignments almost every class, as well as short written responses or questions. This class was a great way to enrich my knowledge of France, as well as to practice my speaking, listening, and writing skills."
