    "I developed a new toolkit for pondering meaning and its connection to language. I also learned how to propose and develop a long-term study.",
    "I learned some of the neuropsychological theories underlying language production and comprehension in the mind.",
    "Learned lots about neurolinguistics and semantics, both conceptually and with a lot of studies. The class was mainly centered around the Lexical-Conceptual Structure (LCS) system. Also learned about conducting research and writing research papers. But the most rewarding parts were learning about a whole new way to look at the ways in which we use languagae, and what it means for words to \"mean\" something.",
    "This course will teach you how to think about meaning from the basis of (lexical) conceptual structure.",
    "I learned a lot about the structure of meaning and how we can derive multiple meanings from one word."

   "comments": [
    "This course gives students immense opportunities to engage with the material in the way that most interests them.",
    "The content was interesting but was presented in a fairly disorganized manner. I think a bit more cohesion of the curriculum would have been helpful.",
    "Professor Pinango is a fantastic professor and seminar leader. Feedback on assignments quick, and even though some of the reaedings were difficult, they were never overly long so it always felt manageable. The only place where I could see this class improving is in some more direction for the final project, but really one of the best parts about it was the complete independence we had to research whatever we were interested in.",
    "I think the strength about this course is that it really gets you thinking about meaning from a scientific side using semantic theory and neuroscience data. As for a weakness, I feel like the material was a bit all over the place. LCS, complement coercion, Spanish copulas, causality... this is a little too broad. Interesting, but broad."

    "Yes, if you're interested in cognitive science and linguistics.",
    "If this seems like the sort of topic you'd be interested in, aboslutely. Professor Pinango is one of the leaders in this field and it was a real privilege to get to learn about this subject from her.",
    "If you're into semantics, you have a significant level of experience with linguistics, or have to take this for your major, I think it could be engaging. If not, think long and hard before you take this class. If you're not super interested by day two, you probably won't be for the rest of the semester. I took a few cognitive science and psychology classes before taking this one, and it went straight over my head for the whole semester.",
    "I'd definitely recommend this to any cog sci people or linguists interested in semantics. You WILL learn something relevant.",
    "Yes! Very engaging and interesting class"
