    "It's a fun class and I would recommend it. It's a ton of work, but the work isn't too hard, it's just bulky.",
    "Yes, very practical.",
    "Spanish 110 is very carefully constructed: professors follow the curriculum carefully, and it is productive, though does not feel at all regimented. The placement process seemed to do a good job at making sure that people with experience didn't get into the class, and though there was one person who had taken spanish before, this student was in the minority. This preserved the feeling and expectations of an introductory class. It is a challenging yet comfortable start to the language.",
    "Spanish L1 is a pretty average but fast paced Spanish course. 9 chapters are cover in one semester, so early preparation and studying are a must.",
    "Maybe it's a little tough.",
    "Take it with Francisco! Class is really fun every day!",
    "My section of L1 Spanish was fast-paced, energetic, and challenging (for me). I came away feeling like I had learned a lot. I would recommend this class to another student because it is doable as someone relatively new to foreign languages and, again, I felt like I had learned a lot."
