   "comments": [
    "For undergraduates: this course will be rigorous, informative, and useful. For graduates: this course will likely be a review of material you have already seen, but will allow you to gain a better understanding of the material and think about interesting questions. In general, this class will be an enjoyable course, the atmosphere is good, and Nilay is friendly and approachable.",
    "Definitely take this class if you are an inorganic student. Especially with Nilay, but even if you can't get it with Nilay, a helpful class that will teach you the basic overview of what you need to know.",
    "I would definitely recommend CHEM 557 to another student. This class was interesting and appropriately challenging. It addressed topics that many graduate students had already seen before, yet remained one of my favorite classes.",
    "CHEM 557 teaches the fundamentals of coordination chemistry and is an essential class for any graduate student in the inorganic division. I would definitely recommend it to another student.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. I think that the material is certainly familiar enough to a graduate student that it's accessible. For an advanced undergraduate, this class is also very accessible. For those less confident with fundamental chemical principles, I would suggest avoiding this course. Much can be learned, but there may be a big hurdle overcoming differences in baseline-familiarity with the material.",
    "Absolutely recommend for an inorganic chemistry student",
    "Yes",
    "If you are doing inorganic you should definitely take it.",
    "Yes, of course.",
    "I would summarize it as a standard coordination chemistry or inorganic class. I would recommend it.",
    "This course is an excellent introduction to concepts in inorganic chemistry beyond those presented in introductory courses. It should complement nicely course work taken in the chemistry department including courses in organic chemistry, biochemistry, and physical chemistry.",
    "It is an interesting and useful course."

   "question_text": "How did this course deepen your knowledge of your discipline\/profession? To what extent did this course contribute to your dissertation\/research?",
   "comments": [
    "As stated above, this course helped me to synthesize and further think about material I was already familiar with. It is a hard course to evaluate because it was very high quality in its instruction manner, homeworks, tests, etc., but was a little low level for a graduate audience. I believe the department would be better served splitting this course into undergraduate and graduate versions. The exact course should be used for undergraduates, but a more literature\/discussion-based version should be for graduates. Any negative assessment I have of this class stems solely from the appropriateness level of material for the audience, and is not a reflection of the objective quality of the course, which is extremely high.",
    "This course covered some things I had not covered, but did cover some things I had taken as graduate-level coursework at my undergrad institution. It's a shame that can't be accounted for, but I guess there's no easy way to do that. Still helpful to have a refresher of the material and learn some new things.",
    "As an graduate student in inorganic chemistry, this class was definitely relevant to my discipline and research. It focused on topics that do and will continue to impact my research in the lab. The professor was also very good about connecting the topics to research and highlighting their importance to our graduate work.",
    "The class certainly enhanced my understanding of coordination chemistry, which has enabled me to make connections between the material in this course and topics in other areas of chemistry. I know that I will use the information I learned to help me with my future research projects.",
    "See response above regarding applicability of this course material.",
    "It helped me get a clearer idea on bonding including CFT and LFT etc. Also, it complemented the stuff I learned in organometallic chemistry.",
    "It solidifies some of my knowledge acquired in the past.",
    "I definitely tried to think more in depth about the material although I had seen it before. I wish we had spent more time going over kinetics.",
    "As an organic chemist who studies transition metal catalysis, the material presented in this course will likely become relevant. I'm very glad that I took it."
