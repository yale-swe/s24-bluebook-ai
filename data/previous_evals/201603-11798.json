   "comments": [
    "An overview of how to model the tech industry through economics.",
    "This course helped to solidify a lot of intermediate micro and game theory skills. It also gave me the ability to speak intelligently on many issues related to intellectual property including patents, copyright, venture capital, and litigation.",
    "I learned to do multi-step problems modeling real-world situations using economic optimization techniques. The concepts of Cournot and Bertrand competition, as well as their application to topics like monopolies, competition, research and development, venture capital, and patents were extensively explored.",
    "economics of innovation",
    "Reinforced mathematical concepts of economics, and intuition behind them.",
    "Gives you insight into the economic incentives behind the patent system, and how firms compete with differentiated products -- basically an extension of non-competitive markets part of intermediate micro. But also with lots of great, real-world examples from the tech industry.",
    "I learned some more about microeconomics. It was super interesting to consider the decisions that go into R&D and also production. It was a nice new angle through which to evaluate economics.",
    "I learned about intellectual property (patents, copyrights, trade secrets), innovation and market power (knowledge as a public good), market structure (drastic and non-drastic innovation), strategic investment in R&D, basic and applied research, product innovation, network effects, knowledge spillovers, and more. All in all, it was a fantastic excursion through the economics of innovation.",
    "I learned about intellectual property, patent races, venture capital, etc. In addition, I developed intuition about how competition in the research and product market work through economic models such as Cournot, Bertrand, and simultaneous games.",
    "Great Econ class. Please take. I learned more about microeconomics in this class than I learned in into and intermediate micro combined.",
    "I gained a lot of knowledge about the tech industry and how new technology is modeled by economists. This course provided insight into topics such as research and development, intellectual property rights, compensation contracts, and venture capital. It improved my mathematical skills as well as my logical reasoning.",
    "I don't know if I would recommend it. It's an okay senior lecture that is like Intermediate Micro but with weekly lecture that gloss the surface of technology."

   "comments": [
    "Super nice instructor who truly cares about students and is very helpful. The course is well thought out and extremely manageable.",
    "Strengths: extremely well organized. The lectures were crystal clear and problem sets and exams were both very reasonable. If you paid a moderate amount of attention in class and did the homework diligently, you easily did well. Weaknesses: it would be nice to have a choice on the topic for the final presentation.",
    "good course, i did not like the case studies (not very interesting and they took up a lot of class time) but other than that it was good.",
    "Very organized and well planned.",
    "Strengths: great professor, good content, fair grading, doable (but sometimes challenging) problem sets. Weaknesses: none. honestly gem of a class",
    "The material was very interesting, and I enjoyed using economic models to gain intuition about how innovation works in real-life.",
    "I thought that the readings weren't very helpful, but the class materials on canvas were essential for learning and doing the problem sets. Professor Chalioti was great about supplying us with sufficient material to learn ant study.",
    "Strengths: applicable, real world material and methods. Weaknesses: sometimes the math will go over students heads at first, and there won't be much follow up",
    "One of the strengths of this course is its interesting subject matter. The topics covered were very interesting, especially in today's age of innovation. Another strength of the course is its ability to combine qualitative and quantitative concepts, teaching the practical and legal aspects of innovation and also using mathematical models. I also thought the cases were an especially interesting way to learn about important companies. One of the weaknesses of the course was that due to the nature of the mathematical models, a simple arithmetic error could be propagated throughout an entire problem. This might be remedied by assuring the students that the correct steps and reasoning would be graded, deemphasizing the arithmetic. Overall, very good course.",
    "Great professor",
    "Strengths: pretty consistent, somewhat applies microeconomic concepts to real life examples of firms, good organization and resources Weaknesses: topic isn't very enthralling or applicable"

   "comments": [
    "Yes, definitely. Basically this class takes intermediate micro and applies it to technological settings, which is both interesting and not too hard if you have a good grasp of maximization. A great class all around and the instructor is probably the clearest and nicest professor I've had in the econ department. Exams are fair and are based on the p-sets. Hard to get into if you're not a senior, but be persistent.",
    "Yes, this is a great senior Econ seminar. Professor Chalioti presented the information in a very digestible manner and the grading was very fair overall.",
    "I think this lecture is a great mix of legitimately engaging material and manageable workload for a senior seminar. It's not a gut by any means--the 6 pset take some time and it's a good amount of material--but the course primarily works on new applications for models that econ majors learned in earlier courses (especially intermediate micro). This class is a nice opportunity to solidify your knowledge of micro and learn about how firms in high-tech industries use innovation to compete.",
    "Yes! It is a relatively easy econ senior seminar. Not a ton of work, but an extremely kind professor who is clearly on your side. The final presentation is low pressure but will teach you a lot about the industry you are assigned to research. Two exams (non-cumulative) are both straightforward and you are given extensive amounts of prep material so you know exactly what you are walking into.",
    "yes",
    "Yes, this was a solid, enjoyable class, with relatively interesting material. The organized teaching style made it an overall high quality class.",
    "Take it as a senior seminar. Very straightforward in terms of expectations if you listen in class, you'll be able to do the problem sets. If you do the problem sets, you'll do great on the exams. Fairly interesting material in terms of intellectual property, and Eva tries to make things engaging and fun. Not the most intellectually stimulating or challenging but you're learning while not dying, which is a pretty good balance, in my opinion.",
    "This is a class that teaches how to solve models of the economics of innovation at an abstract level, and also teaches introductory concepts in this area. If you're looking to learn more about this, I would heartily recommend the class.",
    "Yes! A good 400-level econ that is super interesting and quant-focused but also not too heavy of a workload, and very applicable.",
    "Great class! Take it if you can get in. Chalioti is honestly such a wonderful person and a great lecturer. Enjoyed every class and never felt like anything was unfair. Really great :)",
    "Absolutely. What a fantastic class - if you can get in, take it!!",
    "The material is interesting, and you learn a lot by the end of the semester. You use Cournot, Bertrand, sequential games to model a lot of the concepts. Professor Chalioti is also very helpful, and will help clarify any confusing concepts.",
    "Yes, great class to get your senior requirement in.",
    "Yes. Professor Chalioti is a great teacher and presents the material in a way that makes it easy to learn. She really wants everyone to do well and cares a great deal about her students.",
    "Good senior seminar, take it",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone who is looking for a less stressful workload as well as excellent quality instruction. Eva is one of the most caring and responsible professors at Yale. She is very passionate about teaching and has great communication with students a really well-organized and interesting syllabus with clear requirements.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student who is interested in technology and looking for a senior lecture in Economics. The subject is interesting, and the course provides a nice balance between qualitative and quantitative topics. Professor Chalioti is so nice and wants to do whatever she can to help her students. It was also nice that she let in the many students who wanted to take the course. Overall, a great senior lecture.",
    "Take the course. 6 doable sets, very fair exams, and a caring professor.",
    "Decent course, but understand that this is essentially an intermediate microeconomics course that involves a lot of optimization math problems. To be fair, it is miles more engaging and less tedious than Intermediate Micro itself, but just don't expect to learn material that is extremely applicable. There are examples of how the theory applies to firms in real life sprinkled across the lectures to keep the material engaging."
