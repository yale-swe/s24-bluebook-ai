   "comments": [
    "I developed my writing skills. I think I also got better at critically analyzing primary documents, since Professor Marcus was so good at leading us through them and producing a coherent discussion of that day's theme by navigating us through the documents.",
    "As a history major, I have focused mostly on the 18th-20th centuries, and thus had never studied the Middle Ages in any depth before taking this class. This semester I gained exposure to the broad arc of Medieval history, and I also learned a lot about the Jewish, Christian, and Islamic religious traditions, and the interactions between them.",
    "I learned a lot about how sources can be seen as interacting and taking from one another, about how to think about perception, position and identity in terms of history. I think, however, the refrain I heard a lot, that knowledge does not breed tolerance, was interesting, and probably the most memorable thing. Still, the way in which various religious groups viewed each other with hostility or comfort, as logical or illogical, all was very new and interesting."

   "comments": [
    "The course is a very strong course for several reasons. It is small and you really engage with both Professor Marcus and the documents. Professor Marcus is extremely knowledgeable and a good teacher (the two don't always go hand in hand!) He's also very approachable, which helps around the time that you're writing your paper. The themes in the class are all interesting and cover a broad spectrum of cultural contexts - I feel like we covered a very expansive overview of medieval Jews, Christians, and Muslims.",
    "I found the themes and readings for each week interesting, but often the class felt more like a lecture from the professor than a seminar, with little chance for students to engage in debate with each other.",
    "I honestly thing a slightly larger group would have been better. But I thought the class did a good job of avoiding male over-speaking, most of the time."

   "comments": [
    "I absolutely would. Professor Marcus does a very good job of treating the subject with both depth and breadth. The documents are interesting and fit together in a clear way, and Prof Marcus is very good at leading you through them to produce a coherent narrative of what interactions were like between Jews, Christians, and Muslims in medieval times.",
    "I think the subject matter of this class is quite interesting, and I learned a lot. The format of the class, however, was somewhat frustrating in that it often felt like the professor was lecturing to the five students, rather than fostering discussion amongst all of us. I also thought it was problematic to have the final research paper be worth 75% of the grade, instead of having other assignments or papers throughout the semester.",
    "Very much yes. The subject matter was interesting, and thinking about perception in particular was a very different way of analyzing often politically and religiously focused history."
