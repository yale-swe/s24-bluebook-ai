   "comments": [
    "Do yourself the great favor of taking this course. Verlyn opens by telling students to stop worrying about meeting academic benchmarks, and to start accepting our own senses of authority. Class becomes unstressful, cathartic, and useful. My writing has vastly improved. Genre of the Sentence gave me solid feedback while renewing my love of creative nonfiction. This is a rarity. Know that getting in has more to do with your passion than your ability. Verlyn is extremely responsive over email--if you have any questions it is definitely worth reaching out to him.",
    "Definitely take this class! Verlyn is such a nice man, and he will absolutely change the way you think about writing. The readings are interesting, and you will undoubtedly produce some interesting and fun material. One thing I wish I had done more was to visit Verlyn in office hours -- definitely do that and do it frequently!",
    "TAKE THIS IF YOU LOVE TO WRITE!! Verlyn knows how to talk about writing in a really great and productive way. You will be writing every week about whatever you want, reading some really interesting and kick-ass nonfiction pieces, and improving your writing each week. It's a really fun class and going to Verlyn at office hours is so helpful and simultaneously challenging and comforting. TAKE IT!!!",
    "Genre of the Sentence is the best course I've ever taken, and truly a remarkable course only taught at Yale. If you get into this course, take it. If you take it, GO TO OFFICE HOURS. I didn't start doing so until about halfway through, and seriously, conversations with Verlyn in office hours were some of the best I've ever had at Yale. This course is as much about perception, observation, and attention as it is about writing--all crucial elements if you want to write well and true. I cannot recommend this course enough--or thank Verlyn enough for letting me take it.",
    "This was a phenomenal class--probably the best I've taken at Yale. Verlyn is a bona fide genius, and I don't think it is possible for me to have learned more from him. Anyone who wants to learn to be a better reader, a better writer, and a better thinker should absolutely take this class. You'll leave with such clear prose and such a grasp on how to write. Copying and pasting my teacher evaluation, too: Verlyn is utterly brilliant. He guides section discussion so beautifully, centering discussion on our comments but responding to each one with mini-lectures about writing that absolutely blew my mind. He reads each new piece with great care, and provided incredible feedback. He encourages everyone to come to office hours, and is interested in getting to know each of us as individuals beyond the classroom. He is absolutely one of the best teachers I've ever had. I'm so grateful to have had this experience, and will recommend it to everyone I know.",
    "I would recommend Genre to anyone interested in improving their prose (and though the course focuses on non-fiction, it'll definitely help fiction writers too). It's a unique class, and a calm and relaxing one as well. One of the best parts of the course is reading other people's prose. Since the prompts are so broad (basically nonexistent), you really get to know everyone's style and learn from their best work.",
    "Take it. Take it to improve your writing, but also take it because Verlyn is the wisest instructor you will ever have the pleasure of learning from. He cares very, very deeply.",
    "I went into this course not being too sure what to expect and kind of worried it might be fluffy or useless in terms of instruction. But no. Verlyn's comments about writing were always clear and insightful.",
    "Genre of the Sentence is a good class, although I wasn't quite as blown away by it as earlier reviews of the course suggested I would be. Every week we read something and for the first half of class we talked about it. The approach here is the \"what do you notice\" approach: look at the essay, say things about it, and hope that you learn something about writing. Everyone writes two pages a week, about anything, and we talked about that during the second half of the class. The name of the class suggests that you can write anything at all, but you should know that the genre of the class is actually non-fiction. Not everyone understood that."
