   "comments": [
    "An interesting course looking at the development of documentary films. I would recommend it.",
    "This is sort of an odd class. The documentaries are interesting, but all cinema veritae, so just be aware of that. It's not intriguing enough to be worth a three hour session.",
    "Not a bad class to take, especially if you're interested in documentary. It's going to be a lot of cinema verite films, and less of the Ken Burns-esque kind of films. However, the class itself is a little disorganized. We didn't get much communication from the TA except when she graded our papers (3 in total for the semester - that's the entire workload) and so we didn't get much guidance in what we needed to do for the papers. Roemer has great insight into the films and lectures really well. You'll definitely learn a ton, not just about film, but also about life itself. However, discussion kind of waned in our group; it might be because Roemer was a little intimidating or because the topics he picked seemed to overlap quite a bit and there wasn't that much variety. I would say definitely shop it and see if the class is something you would enjoy. The lessons you get out of it are great but the actual work for the class can be a little frustrating since you don't get much guidance for that.",
    "Definitely take this class! Roemer is an absolutely amazing professor to learn from. He doesn't really teach so much as just give you his thoughts on the films you watch, but that's what so amazing about this class. It's also pretty easy - only three 5-7 papers on the films you watch.",
    "Michael Roemer provides a very interesting and intelligent way of viewing documentaries. The papers are not very intensive, and there is not much instruction about film technique. However, I found it to be a perfect introduction to viewing films critically. Roemer causes you to think about truth value, manipulation, and politics while doing a good job of encouraging students to relate it to their personal lives."
