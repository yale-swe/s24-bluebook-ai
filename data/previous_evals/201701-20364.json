    "I learned a lot from this course and think it will be very helpful in moving forward as a biomedical engineer! I refreshed on coding and learned some specifics for applying it to biological modeling. I also learned a lot about stochastic simulations which I think will be very helpful in college and beyond. I also learned a lot about a lot of different topics that are helpful to BME but that I haven't had time to take a whole class over yet (like linear algebra and some stats topics).",
    "Basic Matlab, basic statistics, basic linear algebra, basic modeling, basic applications of physics.",
    "This was my first time programming in Matlab, and I gained a basic understanding of probability, statistics, and linear algebra concepts as they relate to biomedical engineering. I also think I developed a better mindset and logical thought process for solving programming problems.",
    "I became proficient in MATLAB and learned a lot about statistics and modeling biological systems.",
    "Learned how to use MATLAB.",
    "I surprisingly did learn how to do basic coding in Matlab, but not with any thanks to the class. I learned from online tutorials and the TA's and was propelled by the fear that I was so behind. This is NOT an introductory course, because it is barely a course at all. The class is taught off confusing, overwhelming ppt slides that the professor reads off as if its the first time he's seen them too.",
    "I gained a basic knowledge of statistical computation and Matlab programming, probably a little less than I would have liked, however, I know a lot more about the logic of programming and simulation than I did when I entered the course",
    "Using MATLAB to simulate certain aspects of biological systems via stochastic and deterministic methods as well as concepts of probability, statistics, differential equations, linear algebra, and other concepts",
    "I expected to learn a lot more coding than I did. It was really a hybrid math and coding course, and some of the things we did towards the end were more interesting, though I still don't feel that I'd be able to code things myself.",
    "I learned how to use matlab and write codes. I learned how to create simulations of data and then analyze that data. Learned some basics of statistics and how to code to find statistical values.",
    "Introduction to Matlab as a language for different kinds of simulations with limited probability and statistics. By the end of the course I was able to program the growth and spread of cancer cells, but be warned getting there involved buckets of blood sweat and tears.",
    "I picked up basic Matlab skills, which is actually really cool and applicable, but I personally wish I had more time in my schedule to really understand matlab and apply it on my own without help.",
    "This class was cool - I learned a lot in the general fields of programming and statistics. Likely the most important skill I've developed would be the capability to simulate or create simulations of real life situations via coding for the sake of better understanding legitimate problems in the laboratory setting.",
    "Matlab skills",
    "How to problem solve",
    "I learned the basics of MATLAB thanks almost exclusively to the TAs",
    "Some MATLAB basic programming skills, mostly based on the fit of trends to a random data. We were also supposed to calculate some statistical characteristics of the data, though I belive this was poorly teached",
    "Basic statistics and probability. Matlab programming. Different numerical methods and how to model certain physical and biological phenomena",
    "learned basic matlab, biomedical computation and modeling. Basic math and statistics in addition to coding skills.",
    "I learned how to use MATLAB and some statistics knowledge.",
    "This course is suppose to teach you basic concepts in statistics and Matlab.",
    "This class was so ambiguous and poorly taught that I am unclear what I gained from this course.",
    "I learned how to create functions and use for loops using Matlab. I learned some linear algebra and some basic matrix operations. I learned a little about standard deviation, variance, applying fits to data, probability, and normal and Gaussian distributions."

   "comments": [
    "It is hard to learn math from powerpoint slides so maybe changing the teaching style a little bit would help but overall I enjoyed this class. I also like how the problem set questions and class examples are rooted in real world things (like modeling nanoparticle size distributions or tumor cell growth) which makes it more interesting and easier to see how it might be applied. Additionally the TAs (especially Ed) were amazing and helped a lot in section with helping us understand the topics!",
    "The strengths were obviously the TAs--they were both very helpful and very knowledgeable. They were willing to meet with students beyond section and office hours, willing to help with code late at night, they were always there. The weaknesses of the class were the sheer volume of information that they tried to shove into one semester and the way that it was taught. I have friends at other universities that spend a whole semester on Matlab and learning the basics of coding logic, another on statistics, another on modeling, etc. It was just too much to fit into one semester. In addition, the class was taught with little to no engagement with students--simply slides (not even writing on the board! even though it's a math\/logic class) and no chance for us to engage with the material.",
    "I liked that it was very clear how all of the concepts we learned tied back to direct applications in biomedical engineering. However, it felt like we breezed through each topic without a proper introduction or taking time to understand each concept fully. I understand this is not an easy issue to address, since many different topics need to be covered in just one semester. I strongly believe that a class in probability\/statistics, linear algebra, and programming should be taken (or even required) before this class, as it would create a much more solid foundation for truly understanding and applying the concepts to biomedical engineering. Other than that, I thought there was an incredible support system outside of class time. Fan and Ed were fantastic TAs who really went above and beyond to make sure that we had all the resources needed to do well on the problem sets and exams -- they definitely made the class much more enjoyable.",
    "Teaching needs to be improved. Rather than having code pre-written, it would have been very helpful if the professor went through the logic of writing the code. Class was essentially background -> derivations -> showing us that a pre-written code worked which is not very conducive to learning. The TFs saved this course. They were very helpful and taught the class content in section very well.",
    "The teachers assistants, Fan and Ed were amazing and extremely helpful. They spent so much extra time with the students and allowed us to understand the material. The class covered very applicable material although it did a very poor job connecting basic coding skills to real world application. Very little time was spent on basic knowledge or explaining fundamentals of coding so it was extremely difficult to keep up without prior coding knowledge. Without the fundamentals, it was very difficult to understand when Professor Mak started talking about real world applications that required much more advanced coding knowledge than he had taught. The course needs to focus on the basics before it can work on complicated topics. The problem sets often covered topics we did not cover in class.",
    "This class could be improved in literally every way. Mainly, by getting a professor who actually cares about the students enough to teach them! It was as if the professor was just teaching this class because he drew the short straw in the BME research department. That being said, the grade break down in this class is really good. The homework being 50% of the grade really helps, and the homework is how I learned to code. The midterm was reasonable in terms of material, but the final was so far from what we should have been expected to do.",
    "It would be nice to have more comments on the code posted in the class notes. It took a while to understand what each section of code did on my own time. Overall, the TAs were extremely helpful reinforcing the concepts taught in class.",
    "I think that for the coding portions of the course, it would be much more helpful to have a walkthrough of typing the code, with explanations of the logic behind why we code certain things. Also, considering that a lot engineering utilizes coding, the class should probably spend more time on explicitly working with Matlab and getting the fundamentals down.",
    "It needs a new professor. He is a nice guy but not a great teacher. He tries but just doesn't know how to teach effectively. TAs are absolutely amazing and saved all of us in this class. Psets were very challenging and class did not always prepare us well to answer the questions. The lack of material like a real textbook to learn from made this class all the more challenging. Lectures slides could be difficult to follow. The material and topic of this class is very interesting. It has so much potential but the material was so hard to learn and lectures were not good or even really worth going to at times.",
    "The quality of teaching in this class was extremely poor. I would leave every lecture a lot more confused than I walked in. Much of it was proof based, but the proofs were difficult, pre-written on powerpoint slides, and Michael Mak went through them extremely quick so there was no way to follow. The slides themselves were also really unhelpful, since some steps in proofs would be show up 5 times while others would be skipped altogether , none of which were explained. As someone with no coding background, it was really hard to follow the demonstrations on Matlab and understand what different lines of codes or even single operators did, and it didn't help that most of the code was uncommented. Even though there was always time for questions, I never even knew how to formulate one - I just wouldn't know where to begin, and couldn't ask about anything specific since I didn't understand anything general. Some students in the class had already taken coding, stats, linear or diff eq classes, but as someone with none of that knowledge I felt hugely disadvantaged. The redeeming factor to this class are the TFs, who are wonderful, accessible and really good at explaining. Section each week was as savior, and I don't know what I would have done without it",
    "Nobody taking this class has a background in statistics yet the professor assumes that you do,",
    "The TAs were great and always willing to go our of their way to help on psets. Lecture was a little dry and sometimes not really relevant to the psets. Also there has to be a better way to turn in homework than copying and pasting Matlab code into a word document and uploading it to the dropbox of Classes V2.",
    "This course would be better taught if the professor actually demonstrated derivations of mathematical formulas by writing them out on the board instead of reading off the slides. As a visual learner, I suffered from the style of simply reading off slides and narration of code being applied.",
    "The course, meant for BENG 249 students early in the track, was particularly fast paced and difficult for all who had no prior coding or statistics backgrounds. Although it was supposedly intended for individuals who had no such experience, it did not truly seem this way. If there were a way to make it more friendly to these individuals, perhaps slowing down the pace of the course, that would probably be appreciated by students.",
    "Bad lectures. Excellent discussion sections. To improve, make the lectures better, and keep getting great TAs.",
    "oh my gosh, you can't survive this without office hours or a previous knowledge of matlab",
    "It was honestly awful, so poorly taught. However the TAs were wonderful",
    "Reslly poorly taught. Super hard p-sets. Horrible final, we were not properly explained what the exam would entail and how much memorization it would require (it was very different from the midterm and required a lt of coding by hand).",
    "Good practical knowledge t be learned in principle. Too much info at once with a terrible method of teaching.",
    "I believe one of the greastes weakness of the course was that it expected us to have a strong basis in statistics and some in differential equations, when the only requirement for the class was multivariable calculus The second weakness was the written exams. The midterm was considered diffucult, as it required to calculate a lot of statistical measures which we didn't extensively cover, but the final exam was very unexpected. In the latter, students were supposed to write a number (~5) of matlab codes of around 40 lines by heart, which mostly consisted of repetition of previous codes, and the formula sheet didn't help in almost anything. In addition, we were tested on the subject of the last unit, which we didn't have homework on and that would already be covered on the extra credit project. Never in any STEM class of Yale I have seen such practices, not even in Yale's computing for engineering class (Enas 130), whose exams were open notes and on the computer, not on paper.",
    "I would have liked to go more in depth into the meaning behind different statistical estimators and stuff. I feel like I didn't get an intuition for the meaning of total sum of squares and explained sum of squares, for example. Strengths: by the end you are well equipped to build cool models on matlab!",
    "It's a great introduction to very important issues in research and biology. I think the topic selection was good, but there should be some way for people who lack a background in math or computing to be brought to speed. A series of additional optional exercises in the beginning of the course could be helpful, when there is less material to cover. I did notice that some friends who didn't have the background in math or coding struggled a considerable amount. Overall, fun and engaging course.",
    "Many concepts were not that easy to understand without any statistics knowledge. The content should be explained assuming no previous knowledge or understanding from students.",
    "Strengths: The TFs were great. The homeworks were good practice on the material learned. Weaknesses: The professor moved quickly, so it was easy to fall behind. Material was a bit difficult is you do not have practice coding. The professor just went through power point slides without really teaching you how to do things.",
    "I am aware that this was the first time Dr. Mak was teaching, but this was probably the single worst class I have ever taken at Yale. Organization was nearly absent. Instruction was unclear and unhelpful. Assignments were not reflective of tests. Communication was terrible.",
    "This course has many weaknesses. As many of my classmates, including me, had very little experience with coding, the beginning of the course was already very difficult since it had us doing tasks that required a basic understanding that we did not have. The course covers topics in linear and nonlinear algebra and statistics in a manner that is not friendly to those who have not taken classes covering these subjects."

   "comments": [
    "Pretty good class. Interesting problem sets and rooted in real world applications which is nice. Maybe most applicable for BME majors but a very helpful class overall that I feel I got a lot out of.",
    "You probably have to take it for BME--it's not impossible to handle, the curve is probably nice, the homework is a good chunk of the grade and you can get lots of help, but it will be very frustrating because the class is too much with no help from the professor.",
    "Interesting material. Very poorly taught. Professor Mak stood there for the requisite 75 minutes and read us the slides. I only managed to learn new things because the teaching fellows Fan Zhang and Edric Tam were excellent!!",
    "BENG 249 is a crash course in programming, statistics, and linear algebra. The class covers these topics as they relate to BME applications (as it is supposed to), but I think depth was largely sacrified for the sake of breadth. The class will be a lot more manageable and meaningful if you go into it with some sort of background in all these topics, since they are covered very quickly and not very well in lectures. Although the lectures were quite dry, section and office hours were very helpful for the problem sets. The class was made a lot more engaging and fun thanks to our two incredible TAs, who were always extremely understanding and regularly stayed long past their scheduled office hours to help us on problem sets. I also really enjoyed the collaborative environment, especially because this was the first time I really got to know the other people in the BME major. Overall, you probably wouldn't take this class unless you have to for the BME major, but I think it was an appropriately challenging class with a lot of resources to help you succeed.",
    "You should really only take this if you are BME \/ really interested in coding biological simulations in MATLAB.",
    "No I would not recommend the class. Overall, the class was incredibly frustrating. The lectures were not helpful due to Professor Maks disconnect with the students. The problem sets were extremely time consuming and difficult. I was only able to learn the material by spending extra time with the TFs.",
    "Only if its required for your major",
    "I would only recommend people to take this as a major requirement for biomedical engineering. It covers a range of topics including linear algebra, statistics, coding, and computer simulation, but those topics would be much better learned in courses specific to that topic. If you aren't in Biomedical Engineering and are interested in linear algebra, statistics, coding, etc..., take classes specific to those topics.",
    "The course had very interesting content and I was quite fascinated once I actually understood what I was doing. Would recommend this course -- BUT only with better\/more effective teaching.",
    "eh",
    "If you're BME, you're gonna have to bite the bullet. If you aren't, there's gotta be better coding classes out there.",
    "This class is required for BME, so if you have to take it, you have to take it. Not a terrible class, and you learn a fair amount about Matlab. The psets are mostly coding-based and are due on Wednesday at midnight. As long as you don't start them Wednesday afternoon, you'll be fine.",
    "The only thing that helped me survive this course were the amazing TFs and collaboration with classmates.",
    "This class is pretty rough, especially if you're like me and have 0 programming experience. Sometimes there were things we were assumed to know, so you have to make sure to ask as soon as it pops up (because you probably didn't just 'miss it' before, it just wasn't explained). Prof. Mak goes through his lecture slides *really* fast, and going back through them doesn't really help explain what he is doing\/why when you are trying to understand the code. He did start posting his lecture slides and codes before class, which helped some, but wasn't really enough to make much of an improvement. Section was way more helpful than lecture (I went to both sections every week), and our TAs Fan and Ed were AMAZING. Without them, I probably wouldn't have any idea how to do anything in this class. There's only one homework assignment per week (usually 5 problems), plus one midterm and the final, so the workload isn't really bad, it just takes a long time because class isn't helpful so you have to figure everything out in section and TA office hours. Also I don't know why he listed a required textbook, I only know a few people who tried to use it and apparently it was completely irrelevant. There's also class participation problems at the end of most of the lectures, and even though he doesn't say that they are required, they end up being considered for extra credit, so you should be attempting them\/sending them in. Overall, the class is mostly frustrating, and your experience will be mostly dependent on your TAs.",
    "Unless you have to for your major, this class is too much work",
    "No. Awfully taught",
    "Horrible course, should be re-structured and a new professor chosen. Our TA Ed was amazing and should teach the course. The professor should actually care about their students and their learning. There should be practice midterm\/final given out. The p-sets toward the end were unnecessarily hard and tedious.",
    "Only if you really have to.",
    "Not a great course for someone interested in matlab applications, as it is very focused on statistics and less on biocomputation",
    "Wasn't super well taught, but the material is super interesting and useful",
    "Yes, it's an interesting course, especially if you're into biological computation. I have developed a better understanding of many computational methods, and I am excited to continue learning about this topic.",
    "I would not recommend this course. You should only take this course if you have to for the BME major.",
    "I would absolutely 100% NEVER recommend this course to anyone. This was such a negative experience that added stress with no rewarding qualities.",
    "I would only recommend this course to a person who needed this for their major and had background in coding. This course is not friendly to students that are new to coding. The homework is often impossible if you do not work with classmates and go to office hours. The midterm and finals are paper and pencil so it is very tough to check your work for this program which lends itself to making many mistakes."
