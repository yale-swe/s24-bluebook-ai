   "comments": [
    "Again, it's a great class if you're willing to put in the time\/effort, but if you're looking for an \"easy art class,\" this isn't it. I would recommend Basic Drawing on a case-by-case basis, all conditioned upon whether or not someone is really willing to fully engage, and has the time to do so.",
    "I have mixed feelings about this class. I did not enjoy the class, and more than once in the semester, I fell below the \"zero confidence level\". This is the class I felt the most anxious about. I would beat myself up on a daily basis, because I did not feel good about my drawings. I am happy I took the class though. I learned a lot. I developed a new way of thinking about composition. On an everyday basis, I look more carefully at what surrounds me. I try to \"stop, look and listen\". When facing a problem, I have learned to sit down and look for a creative solution, no matter what the nature of the problem may be. I have also become a more articulate person, because Professor Reed and Steve do such an excellent job at explaining their ideas. I have also found some of their comments to apply themselves to much more than just my drawing. Think carefully about whether you want to take this class credit\/D or not. But in any case, TAKE THIS CLASS !",
    "I promise that Basic Drawing will be a memorable experience--whether it'll be a good memory or bad memory will depend on how much you decide to dedicate to this class, and what attitude you take towards this class. This class is unlike any other class you could take at Yale. If you're looking for the next step forward as an artist, then I highly recommend this class with Professor Reed.",
    "Yes, take it. It makes you think and see the world in a completely different way-- a way I think everyone should experience at least once. It's also great to draw of course, but you should know-- in this class with Prof. Reed, a lot of it is conceptual--"
