    "I would recommend Tibetan Buddhism to another student, especially a Religious Studies major looking to learn something about the non-Abrahamic traditions. It teaches an entirely different approach to RLST, not commonly available in other classes.",
    "Yes",
    "Overall, Tibetan Buddhism is definitely one of the best classes that I have taken at Yale! Here are some reasons why:(1) It is incredibly well structured:This class should be an exemplar of the way that all introductory courses to any subject should be structured! Even someone with no background in either Tibet or Buddhism, WHATSOEVER, will be completely absorbed intro the course and will come out with a comprehensive understanding of both! The way in which the course builds over time - from an overview of Buddhist doctrine and ritual practice, through to a focus on the cultural history of Tibet and beyond - is perfect. The syllabus is very well thought through, and is structured in a way that maximizes the amount that the class's students will learn over the course of the semester.(2) The readings and assignments are perfect:Similarly to point (1) above, all of the assignments for class are extremely well designed and relevant. Even if you aren't necessarily too excited to do them, you can appreciate that they are increasing your knowledge and are perfectly tailored and appropriate assignments for the class. In addition, throughout the course you view many fascinating films, which adds yet another really fascinating dimension to one's class experience.(3) Many added opportunities thanks to the class:From going to the Beineke, to seeing a Tibetan Lama come and present the traditional techniques of Tibetan painting, to going to the Reuben Museum in New York City, to a visit to a Tibetan monastery in Woodstock, NY - this class offers constantly offers incredible opportunities and new experiences to supplement the traditional learning done through readings and lecture. Each and every additional experience is incredible, and makes this one of the most interactive and fun courses at Yale!(4) Balance between lecture and seminar:Finally, the class reaches a perfect balance of lecture and seminar like discussion. Given that it is an introductory course, lecturing is necessary - but that doesn't stop Prof. Quintman from engaging the class and sparking interesting debate and discourse nearly every class period! One more way that the class is extremely well designed and executed.Once again, this is one of the best courses that I have taken at Yale (and I am currently a senior, so I've had a lot of classes). I really recommend it for anyone who is considering taking the course!",
    "I would definitely recommend the course if you are interested in Buddhism or Asian religions, or Tibetan history or current political issues with China. Tibetan Buddhism is, as you will soon realize, much more important than you think... Tibet is just a wonderful place, full of magic, etc...That said, workload is not light. Readings are considerable, although you don't really have to do them, and if you choose to do them, they are very interesting. There are films almost every week that you should watch, films were all great. No section, but classroom discussion wasn't as enlightening or fascinating as I had hoped...The topics are wonderful though. You really do get a solid foundation knowledge of Buddhism (whether it is East Asian Buddhism or Southeast or whatever), and also interesting things about Tibetan specific things...Weekly responses weregreat way to engage with materials. Writing assignments were unclear though; I felt like the first paper and the final paper were very hard to write because of the lack of clarity in terms of what the purpose of those papers are..I have taken many humanities classes and have written a lot of papers at Yale, but i felt that these papers were two of the most difficult things to write... On the other hand, the second assignment (creating wiki entries), while time consuming, were straight forward and clear.Overall, a wonderful class. Quintman is a nice guy!",
    "If you're willing to do a fair amount of reading within a conceptual landscape you may not be familiar with, this class is a really cool one to take. It's small (at least it was), giving the potential for seminar-style interaction without the pressure of too much preparation. It's a fascinating subject and, though at times a bit obscure, definitely something I'm glad I know more about. If you take it, it should be one of the courses you focus on. But go for it.",
    "This course provides an in-depth overview of the Tibetan Buddhist tradition through various modes of instruction. This is easily one of the best religion courses I've had yet because of the professor's knowledge on the subject and resources used.",
    "Overall, the course is informative and the material is interesting. The fact that the class does not require an exam turned out to be an incentive to really listen during lecture. I wasn't furiously scribbling notes the entire time - I was just listening. If one can understand the important concepts that Professor Quintman is talking about, writing one's own research paper isn't very difficult, and it makes the lectures so much more engaging. Also, the amount of choice given to us with respect to choosing our own paper topics was really great. I felt like I was able not only to show that I had learned about Tibetan Buddhism but also to apply that knowledge to a paper topic of my choice. In this way, the class is both informative and intellectually liberating.",
    "Tibetan Buddhism covers too specific of a topic for people who may be interested in learning more about Buddhism as a whole. The assignments were not clear and were only fully explained after they were due.",
    "Yes!",
    "Though the topic of this course is so highly specific, I never found the material redundant - within the theme of Tibetan Buddhism, we explored not only theology, but also the literary traditions, political history, and cultural heritage of Tibet. This lead to deeper and more meaningful understanding of the region and, in turn, the evolution of Buddhism there. The readings and films were generally excellent, a nice balance of different styles and perspectives. Also, I was personally a big fan of the lecture\/seminar fusion that the class's small size provided - Quintman would lecture traditionally, and then segments of the class were used to discuss the readings or topics of interest. Also, a good mix of Religious Studies, East Asian Studies, and Humanity-brand majors; most people in the class had some background in studying religion at Yale, however. I'd never studied Buddhism before, and there's plenty of time spent establishing the basics.Quintman's exceptionally knowledgable and very available to answer questions or discuss students' specific interests. I took this class on a whim, and a semester later, am extraordinarily glad that I did."
