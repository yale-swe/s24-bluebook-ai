    "I gained a greater appreciation for the breadth of work happening in the field of Cognitive Science and narrowed in on the types of work that are most interesting to me heading into senior year.",
    "I gained a broad overview of cognitive science and got to dive somewhat deeply into a few particular topics that were presented. I also cemented my senior thesis plans.",
    "Think crititcallt about a wide range of current cog sci research",
    "You gain a lot of interesting insight into the psychology research going on at the university and also more information about the senior cognitive science thesis requirement."

    "Not so early in the morning, otherwise great.",
    "Assignments were somewhat jumbled up at the end which was a bit confusing. It would have been helpful to have all assignments posted on Canvas to unify and organize everything a bit more rather than needing to sift through emails and class notes. Also would have been helpful to have a bio provided with the weekly readings to learn more about the professor beforehand!",
    "I think this class does a good job of leading into the senior thesis process, and one of its strengths is the diversity of research areas represented in the guest lectures. I think having one class off is also something that could be continued for future years, as in a half credit class, it was nice to have a week of a reduced time commitment.",

    "It's obviously required for CogSci majors, but it's extremely low-stress and interesting so it is pretty ideal!",
    "A mandatory class for Cog Sci majors, pretty fine. 925 was a bit tough.",
    "Yeah, this is a great course. You basically get to just hear about cool research.",
    "Found my thesis advisor through this course.",
    "Have to take it as a junior cog sci major, but totally worth it. A really fun and engaging course that was not hard to motivate to attend despite the 9:25 start time. Mark Sheskin was great and the assignments are very low key. As long as you meet the requirements, you will do well and learn a LOT about cogsci!",
    "If you're looking at this class, you have to take it. That said, it's actually pretty interesting and can be quite helpful, depending on what your interests are. The guest lectures are well chosen and reflect a variety of fields, so at the very least, you'll get an interesting overview of the research going on in the CogSci world.",
    "There is no point in recommending or not recommending a class that an entire major takes, but in general this class was interesting and fun. Work is minimal and you get to hear some cool guest speakers while gradually clarifying your senior thesis plans.",
    "Required for the major, but also a fun chill course regardless",
    "It's a required course for cognitive science so you have no choice. That said, it's not a bad class. The speakers are very interesting, you have the thesis process thoroughly laid out for you. Useful stuff."
