   "comments": [
    "Take this! This course is manageable and interesting. I always looked forward to discussions every week, and Julian is a great instructor.",
    "Yes! If you are at all interested in the course material, it is a great class.",
    "A wonderful seminar for those interested in discussing the ethical gray areas of practicing medicine from both the physician's and patient's perspective. Hopefully it will be offered in future semesters.",
    "Definitely would recommend, especially to pre-meds! This course involves a relatively light workload (readings are quite short and easy) and gives students a sophisticated look into many complex and controversial issues in medical ethics. Having a mental framework for thinking about and understanding these issues is especially important for anyone interested in working in medicine, and as someone who has gone through the med school interview process I can tell you that having the critical thinking skills to assess and respond to these kinds of ethical dilemmas is something that schools are looking for in students and doctors.",
    "I would recommend this class to only pre-law and pre-health students. There's a healthy mix of both material in the course.",
    "If this class if offered again, I'd highly recommend it to anyone who's premed or just interesting in health law. Class was fun, and the readings are great. Except for some judicial opinions, they all read easily, and there isn't that much reading at all",
    "This was a really good class - I loved how we looked at very relevant and under the radar topics that underlie medicine - issues that I believe are as if not more important than the mere science. Highly recommended for anyone who wants to practice medicine.",
    "If this class is being offered, take it. Especially if you're looking to going into medicine, these are all issues you should know about. From payment structures to health ethics, to ACTUALLY knowing about HIPAA you've gotta know all of this.",
    "If this is offered again, take it! Readings are interesting and not too long, the paper was fun to write, and Julian was one of the best instructors I've had at Yale, despite him only being a 3rd year law student. Discussions were well-paced and interesting. If you're interested in the legal and ethical issues involved in the doctor-patient relationship, I highly recommend this class.",
    "Great class about medical ethics and the law.",
    "This a wonderful class for anyone with any interest in topics related to the Doctor-Patient relationship and if you do have such an interest, you should definitely try to take it if it is ever offered again. Julian is amazing, and the class is engaging.",
    "I would recommend this course for another student. It's a course on the unique and complex doctor-patient relationship and the many facets of it. We covered a lot of material and delved into topics I had no prior knowledge about. It was a great survey course in a small seminar style.",
    "A great class. The topics are relevant today and Julian guides you through them and the ethical dilemmas posed in an engaging fashion."
