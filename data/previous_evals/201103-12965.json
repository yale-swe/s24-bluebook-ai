   "comments": [
    "I will not recommend this course to a fellow student. This course did not add to my knowledge or understanding of the material. The discussions were often unproductive. There is little guidance in terms of the professor teaching.",
    "I would recommend this course. There are lots of great readings\/",
    "If you are a Humanities-minded person, don't miss out on this seminar. It is one of the best.",
    "Great survey class that will change the way you think. Probably more helpful if you've taken DS, but very accessible for non-majors and those with a burning curiosity for new ideas. That said, the course was quite large (in terms of the number of students) for a seminar and could be streamlined by shrinking it down.",
    "Yes! its a very interesting course and the readings are relevant and insightful. Discussion while frequently side tracked was usually productive",
    "Taking Rhetoric and Political Order feels a lot like returning to a DS classroom -- if you like that environment, you'll probably enjoy the class; if not, you probably may dislike it. It also seems to attract a lot of former DS-ers who enjoy talking in seminars and who have a seemingly strong philosophy background. You will hopefully be introduced to some texts that you've never encountered previously that are highly relevant to rhetoric. Btu if you're looking for practical tools on how to craft speeches, this is probably not the class for you -- the focus is much more on the theory of rhetoric: the role of rhetoric \/ political speeches in society, how to use them, the morality of rhetoric, etc.Also, Prof. Thompson has a student lead almost every class -- this is generally very unhelpful -- she does not assert her authority or add her own view often enough in my opinion. Usually when she did so, I found it to be very helpful! But my own classmates' comments I often found much less helpful -- it seemed (I could be mistaken) that they were usually not really having a conversation or dialogue but merely declaring some insight or grand theory they had formulated. The next person to speak would strike out in a completely different direction. This was very frustrating -- at the end of class, I often was very unsure of what to take away from that day's free-wheeling discussion. More focus and more lecturing (really!) and guidance of the conversation from the prof would be much appreciated. I remained (alas) very confused about what to take away from the course throughout the semester and even now. The papers are excellent opportunities to create focus for yourself, though they can be challenging. Also make sure to really do the readings!",
    "Excellent seminar. It attracts a group of smart, vocal students, and though I might have preferred a slower, more deliberate pace, I learned a lot from everyone in the class. Be open to the reading list even if you've spent a lot of time with these writers in the past.",
    "Eh. There are a lot of good discussions in this class, but it doesn't really have a coherent theme or point that goes through the semester. Know what you're getting into and hope you get a good selection of students in the class if you really want to take it.",
    "Absolutely - the reading list alone is a valuable opportunity to examine some of the greatest oratory in the Western cannon. And Professor Thompson brings unparalleled dynamism, wisdom, and intellectual flexibility - this class will hone not only your writing skills but your ability to think.",
    "The course is great because of the reading - the pieces we read just have so much meat in them. The classes were also good, because barring a few assholes, the people were smart and by the end of each class, you knew much more about the reading than you did from a single read. That aside, this is not a class that is about any specific subject - talking about 'rhetoric' can be extremely broad and center-less.",
    "Take this course if you can. The reading list is great. Professor Thompson is a great discussion leader; she doesn't dominate the seminar but instead allows everyone to talk and argue. The reading load is completely manageable.",
    "A wonderful opportunity to encounter some great texts. Do not expect Professor Thompson to open your eyes to surprises buried in the works - but do expect a fun discussion. So if you look at the syllabus and think \"I'd love to read and discuss these texts with classmates and some input from a really smart professor\" - then take the course, for sure.",
    "Pros:1. Chance to read a variety of great books2. Professor Thompson is brilliant, and runs seminars very wellCons:1. The variety might have been TOO great. Sometimes it felt like we were reading things only obliquely related to \"rhetoric and political order,\" as we frequently failed to consider political order."
