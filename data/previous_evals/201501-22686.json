    "I think that this class is best taken if you personally have experience with other religious topics. As a comparative course it definitely helps.",
    "I would recommend any course co-taught by Professors Davis and Quintman. The two bring very different approaches to similar material, which allows for vast learning (and more than a little bit of fun) on the part of the student. It can be annoying to have weekly blog posts to turn in, but it does take some of the pressure off of the short papers."
