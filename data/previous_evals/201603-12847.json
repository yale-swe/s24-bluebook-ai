    "This class was focused on becoming conversational in the Levantine dialect, and helped me to build a vocabulary base and fluency in this form of spoken Arabic.",
    "Speaking skills in levantine dialect",
    "Developed my speaking skills, as well as listening comprehension",
    "A better understanding of Arabic and better understanding of the Levantine dialect. I wish my listening skills improved as much, but I'm much more comfortable conversationally.",
    "I developed a facility with dialect and an ability to translate from a more formal register of Arabic to a spoken variety of the Levant. Also learned valuable cultural lessons on Arab approaches to space (directions), food and hospitality, and customary behaviors like greetings.",
    "I developed much higher proficiency in spoken Levantine Arabic. Aside fro learning a lot of vocabulary and colloquial phrases, I also gained a better understanding of the overarching differences between written and spoken Arabic. Additionally, I developed much great circumlocution abilities in Arabic because much of the class time was dedicated to speaking with partners in class.",
    "This course gave me a broader understanding of Levantine Arabic, the dialect spoken in the Jordan\/Syria\/Palestine region of the Middle East. I especially learned important phrases and idioms to use in everyday speech, as well as vocabulary for specific situations. More importantly, this class allowed me to maintain the speaking skills I developed while studying abroad in Jordan over the summer. Finally, I learned cultural information which was weaved in throughout the course."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The course is very conversation and dialogue oriented, which is what I had been wanting out of my Arabic instruction for a long time and was finally able to find. It was really helpful to have a classroom community to practice with. The course could have been slightly more vocab-oriented and helped me to build a bigger lexicon.",
    "A great emphasis on speaking, which is the most useful skill when trying to learn a language. Would have been useful to have a native speaker TA.",
    "It was perfect!",
    "The primary strength of this course is its focus area: It is the only Arabic course at Yale that focuses on spoken (instead of written) Arabic. In addition it is also a very common variant of spoken Arabic (that spoken in Syria, Jordan, and Lebanon). The course also provides a lot of opportunity for speaking in a judgement-free zone. The primary weakness of the course was that there were no times, written assessments to encourage building large stores of memorized vocabulary. Of course, the lack of tests made the class easier-which many students like-it also meant that many students ended the class without retaining much information, which many students regretted. Each student had to give two presentations to complete the class, but those projects did not foster the same kind of information retention as written tests or other kinds of assessments do.",
    "I think that one strength of this course is that most of the people in the class are there because they are really interested in speaking Arabic. The class makes use of technology and other resources to further students learning. The instructor is also very knowledgeable, and I appreciated her willingness to diverge from the lesson plan and focus on specific interests of the class, or a subset of the class. I liked the weekly collaborations as well because they allowed me to get to know the class better, and also put to use some of the obscure vocabulary we were learning for specific situations. I think the class could be improved in several ways. First, I think there should be some forms of assessment in the class. Vocabulary tests or grammar tests would have helped me learn the vocabulary from the book, as well as the vocabulary we learned in class. I think homework could be more rigorous and stimulating as well. The book drills are good, but very brief and I didnt feel like I had internalized vocab or a grammatical concept after doing the couple of drills the book provided. Finding ways to listen to native speakers through online was very helpful, and I think there could be more of that. Also, there are students of very different levels in the class; I think finding a way to take advantage of the knowledge of some students and use that to teach others would help keep all of the students interested and engaged. Finally, I found the section to be pretty useless frankly. It was so short, and if I didnt have questions about the material I didnt feel like I gained much, especially since I had other people to speak Arabic with and for longer than 15 minutes. If there is going to be a section at all (I think it should be optional), I think it must be with a native speaker, and preferably with other students, and perhaps we could prepare a topic to discuss so there was some sort of structure. Oh, and I think limiting the use of computers in class would improve discussions and student engagement. I saw lots of people checked out, messaging each other behind the cover of a computer screen."

   "comments": [
    "Yes! It is a great way to learn conversational arabic for travel and conversation instead of just written Arabic.",
    "If you want to be able to speak Arabic in the Sham region, this course will help you with listening and speaking skills",
    "Would absolutely recommend to anyone who is trying to learn Arabic - MSA is a great background to have, but without some basic dialect foundations it is impossible to hold a conversation - this is a must, and hopefully more dialect classes would be offered in the future.",
    "Definitely! Professor Al Ani's the best, and it was a very useful course!",
    "Definitely!",
    "I would highly recommend this course to anyone that hopes to further develop their Arabic skills, especially to students that want to live and\/or work in Jordan, Syria, or Lebanon. This class equips students with the skills needed to understand many informal Arabic resources online, like blog posts, videos, etc.",
    "First off, Im in an airplane and there is an amazing gradient of red-indigo color in the post-sunset sky. Second, I would recommend this class to other students. Personally, it was a useful way of maintaining my Arabic skills and engaging with Arabic in a casual way. It was certainly not challenging, and I feel that if I had been pushed a little more I would have learned much more. I have a lot of notes, but didnt retain a lot of the information due to lack of use and an insufficient amount of out-of-class work to solidify the concepts. That said, the students were engaged and excited to learn, although certainly shy at times. The class was also quite big, which made it hard to get a lot of practice speaking. Ustaaza Sarab is brilliant though, and very adaptable and receptive to class feedback."
