    "I became a faster reader in French, and my aural and written understanding of French greatly improved! I am very happy to have taken this course.",
    "I developed a lot of new grammar still in this class that I didn't get from previous French classes.",
    "I honed my French skills. I improved upon my ability to read, speak, and write.",
    "i learned much more about the basics of French grammar and my speaking\/writing\/reading skills got much better.",
    "Conversational skills, vocabulary, writing, literally everything. I came in with a super low level from L1\/L2, so this class was amazing for putting me up to speed. That said, you HAVE to be willing and available to put in the work and actually prioritize it, because it will not work unless you really put the effort in.",
    "I improved my ability to understand french writing and speaking greatly. I had never read a full length book in french before, so it was a bit of a challenge, but I was able to get though it.",
    "I gained so much clarity on the mechanics of the French language, and I also gained some confidence in my French speaking.",
    "My French definitely improved during this course. My reading and memorization also improved."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: I loved reading these three books, which were all very different but very interesting, and they definitely helped my vocabulary to expand as well as my comprehension to increase. The tests were extremely fair and were actually very useful and helpful. Unlike French 110\/120, the audio programs are actually extremely helpful this semester, especially for the tests. Weaknesses: I don't understand why we spent three weeks on one film, which I also happened to hate. I think that was the least useful unit and it seemed like the grammar concepts in that unit weren't explained very clearly as a result either. I also wish we had gotten more chances to practice our speaking in class, not just with answering plot questions but with giving our own opinions. Also this is something very minor, but the audio programs are such bad quality that sometimes I could barely hear what they were saying. I think they need to be changed.",
    "I think this class could have more free-form discussions on the reading.",
    "I believe that this course takes away from the love of learning French. I think the course could be improved by providing a course for students who would like to learn French but not have to worry about how it might affect their GPA because the homework assignments and assessments were very time consuming and quite difficult.",
    "strengths - books were interesting, you learn a lot of french very quickly. weaknesses - there is daily homework that is somewhat time consuming (30-45 minutes)",
    "The course is extremely well organized and conducive to actual learning (as opposed to 110 and 120). I think smaller class sizes might improve day to day learning, but without a doubt, the department NEEDS more funding. Their program has proven so effective and profitable, it makes no sense for them to not be able to modernize the material.",
    "I think that the CLS audio programs are very helpful in getting the student to be completely comfortable with the French language.",
    "Strengths: - interesting stories in the syllabus - small class sizes made me feel close to my classmates, gave me opportunities to speak\/participate, and made me feel more comfortable speaking\/participating Weaknesses: - a lot of reading made the class hard to manage in a full course schedule",
    "This course did very well with developing all of the necessary skills to progress in a second language. Students were able to work on their listening, reading, writing, and speaking skills all throughout the semester.",
    "The strengths of this course are definitely in the material covered and the quality instruction. The audio programs could be improved. Watching the film almost four times over the course of two weeks wasnt great."

   "comments": [
    "Absolutely! I personally love learning new languages, and this is an exciting way to get introduced to Francophone literature as well as becoming more comfortable with speaking. I would also recommend that everyone in this course get a tutor on the side, at least to practice speaking and comprehension. It was really helpful!",
    "I would because I think these classes really teach you a lot about the language in a very short period of time.",
    "I would recommend French, but caution them that if they would like to take French they need to be able to allocate the great amounts of time and energy that would be required. The class was very demanding.",
    "Yes. It isn't too difficult and you learn a lot about the language.",
    "I would only recommend this course if you're actually interested in learning French (not getting rid of your language requirement). I'm sure there are other languages that are better for satisfying the requirement, because it's simply not worth the pain. This class is extremely demanding, but it's equally as rewarding. The work you put in actually comes out! I came in with such a basic level of French because I did not have a good L1\/L2 experience and this course put me up to speed. L3 is designed to be a semester-long review of all the concepts learned in L1\/L2, but they are actually taught and discussed in depth. I would highly recommend for anyone really trying to learn French. I would also really REALLY recommend taking it with Mme. Burton because she is one of the best French professors the University has!",
    "I would because the 3 books and 1 movie required are very interesting and cover some complex material. Despite it seeming impossible initially, through enough work it eventually became smoother.",
    "The class was challenging, but I would absolutely recommend it to another student. I was very pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed the class.",
    "Yes. I would highly recommend taking this course. This class really helped me develop my french and I have improved more than I have in the past years that I have been taking French.",
    "Yes this was a good course and I would recommend it to other students."
