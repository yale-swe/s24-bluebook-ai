    "Brilliant and surprising",
    "It is a documentary workshop course, which teaches the elements of documentary filmmaking. It also allows students to learn documentary filmmaking through active engagement and process-learning. The weekly classes provide feedback on clips, research, and ideas.I would recommend the class to a student who is already interested in making a documentary film.",
    "If you're a film student, this class is essential. If you're not, but have a fondness for the past, this class is essential. If you're interested in where film language, technology and institutions come from, this class is essential."

    "It has been truly an amazing journey along the learning curveI loved this courseThe best and most intriguing of my time at Yale",
    "I am very new to film as a discipline, therefore I would have to say I received a lot of the benefits of such a course. It may not be appropriate for someone looking for more of analytical course. This is a course for (future) practitioners.",
    "This course is absolutely essential in film studies. I'll be writing my dissertation on a topic related to my final paper for this class."
