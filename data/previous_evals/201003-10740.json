    "I would recommend it to those who major in statistics and computer science.",
    "This class is intrinsically theoretical. While there is the choice for an experimental track, the benefits of taking said path are not obvious. Class is taught based on a \"big picture - interesting results - theory - proofs\" cycle. For those who want to gain experience in probabilistic proofs and understand some of the underlying \"machinery\" of state-of-the-art graphs and networks concepts, this is a good course. For a plug-and-play treatment of graphs, your time is better spent on the web.",
    "This is a great introduction for anyone wanting to learn graph theory who knows basic math. Computer background is helpful, but not necessary.",
    "The course is closely connected with application. It gives a knowledge of the current graphs studies. The homework might be hard.",
    "Absolutely if they're interested in graph theory\/computer science. Very unique course - nothing like it probably anywhere.",
    "good course."

    "Yes. I'm interested in some things in graph theory. I feel that some of the material presented in this course could one day be incorporated into my research."
