   "comments": [
    "The course is fun (good books and movies) but it does require a significant time commitment.",
    "Gotta do what you have to do...",
    "French 130 is a very solid course. At the end of it, you'll have read Le Petit Nicolas, L'Etranger, Monsieur Ibrahim et Les Fleurs du Coran, and you'll have watched the classic films of L'Argent de poche and Jules et Jim. They all contributed to an interesting classroom experience (esp. Jules et Jim!)",
    "Take it if you really want to learn french, its a lot a work.",
    "I would recommend this class. I feel like I significantly improved my speaking and grammatical French throughout this course, which shows it to be effective. In class time was always productively spent and questions were encouraged. I think this course was very well organized. The daily exercises that were assigned reinforced what we learned in class. The tests that were given once every two weeks forced appropriate review and understanding of the material. Karen Duval was an excellent and knowledgeable professor. Her class was fast-paced, but she slowed down, encouraged questions, and gave further explanations when students were confused. At the beginning of the semester I found her intimidating because she speaks quickly and forthrightly corrects you when you are wrong. However, this is a productive teaching style. Also, one must always be paying attention in her class because she calls on students randomly! She makes sure that every student understands the material.",
    "Somewhat difficult, but likely worth it.",
    "See question one. Yes, I would recommend the French 110-140 track at Yale; I'm not sure I would recommend the instructor.",
    "This class is a lot of work, though the work itself is not very hard. There are several hours of listening homework every night and usually some reading. It is really helpful to do these things, but it does take a lot of time."
