    "Check: Is Udo Schwarz teaching this class? [Yes\/No] If Yes: DO NOT. NO. DON'T. If you can at all help it, don't take this with Schwarz. Put it off. See if Chem Eng Thermodynamics is available. Anything else. DO NOT TAKE THIS WITH UDO SCHWARZ. If No: Go for it. It can't be too terrible, even if it is the teacher's first year teaching it.",
    "Seriously - don't take it if you don't have to. I wish Dufresne would come back and teach this. It was an awful class, not enjoyable at all. Didn't learn anything.",
    "It was a good class. Learned a fair amount and not terribly difficult. Don't take it unless you have to.",
    "DEATH Udo is a great guy but not a great lecturer. You end up teaching yourself how to do most of the work because lecturers are devoted entirely to derivation. Also the exams are nothing like the homework. The homework tend to be fairly application oriented while exams tend to have lots of derivations, oftentimes of equations you have never seen before.",
    "This is one of the easiest classes in engineering.",
    "If you are an engineer, you have to take it. The class depends entirely upon the teacher.",
    "Thermodynamics is interesting enough, and you will learn something, but there is a lot of Google-ing in this class. Download the book.",
    "Don't take it if Udo is teaching it -- simple as that. But you probably have to take this if you're MechE\/ChemE\/EnvE. Psets aren't hard; class is useless. Exams aren't really indicative of the psets, but they aren't horrible.",
    "It's a great and important topic, but this semester it was taught very poorly. We spent the first most of the semester on easy, uninteresting stuff (more time than was necessary to learn the simple introductory concepts); while the interesting, more complicated stuff was crammed at the end of the course and not given enough time. Also, Udo Schwarz' lecturing style was sort of one of going through a laundry list of derivations and equations without adequately explaining what the equations mean and why they are significant. It would have been great to have a better idea of why we were learning what we were learning. I've heard that Eric Dufresne does an excellent job teaching it; I wish I could have taken it with him.",
    "If you have to take it, follow along in the book and make sure you understand the material from each week. I didn't really think about this class all semester and simply crammed for the midterm and final. This class isn't that bad, but it wasn't too interesting either.",
    "I would recommend MENG 211 to another student because the material is very interesting.",
    "I would recommend MENG 211 to another engineering student.",
    "This class is actually not that bad. The lectures don't really start sounding relevant until a few weeks in. But once they do, they are actually helpful. Udo is also an incredibly nice teacher so it's very easy to ask him questions if there's any misunderstanding.",
    "This class is just a boring Thermodynamics class that is necessary for the Mechanical and Chemical Engineering majors.",
    "Another one of the requirements for engineering majors. If you can look past the pages full of equations and think about how these concepts relate to processes in daily life, you\u2019ll have more motivation to dig deeper into the details. The lectures often do not provide that big picture but the application boxes in the textbook might. The course needs a lab component to reinforce our knowledge.",
    "Don't take it if you don't have to. Worst class I've taken at Yale. Extremely frustrating and be prepared to learn the information on your own and then still be thrown curve balls on examinations.",
    "Only take it if needed for major or if interested in thermodynamics",
    "Unfortunately as CENG 300 isn't offered anymore, chemE's have no other alternative. I wouldn't recommend it but we don't have a choice.",
    "Only take this if you have to. The material could be interesting, but it was taught very poorly and wasn't worth it.",
    "I had to teach myself from the book. Going to class was useless I learned nothing from it. Unfortunately this class is a requirement for many so you don't really have a choice. If you can take it with someone besides Udo Schwarz you should",
    "A decent course, although if you are a chemical engineering student, much of this may be review already. The class follows closely with Physical Chemistry Semester 1 with James Cross. The material is a slight review, but ultimately is very easy. The psets are fair and the exams are decent as well. The teaching of the course might need a bit more improvement. Tying in overall concepts together and showing a roadmap to solving thermodynamic problems might be more useful than going through the list of topics systematically. Ultimately students will have a decent idea of energy balances, energy rate balances, and entropy balances.",
    "If you are ChemE or MechE you pretty much have to take it. ChemE's who have taken PChem 1 will be particularly well prepared. Not a very work intensive class week-to-week.",
    "I would describe it has a class that does not live up to its expectations. The subject is cool, but in this class, the best way to learn about it is through the textbook, because notes from class are not that good. The homeworks are not bad at all and the tests are decent. If you are interested in the subject, you might want to take it with the other professor in the fall. I heard he is much better.",
    "You most likely have to take it, but it's a solid class. Not the worst engineering class, but not the easiest either. There's a lot of math and a million equations, but if you understand the material and topics well enough the math usually simplifies and the problems aren't that hard.",
    "...ABSOLUTELY NOT. Udo Schwarz is an awful teacher. Here are a couple of reasons why (no specific order): 1) He takes time out of class to write complete, unimportant sentences on the board. An example might be, \"we have now defined a term called 'enthalpy' which is defined in terms of entropy and pressure.\" These sentences are not at all important and waste a significant amount of time in class. Prof. Schwarz doesn't speak while he writes, so a lot of the class is wasted waiting for him to write out full sentences and start talking again. This leads to: 2) He claims that the course doesn't have enough time to cover examples\/applications of ANY of the covered material EVER. Instead, this information is only taught in the review sessions. For students who need to see such examples, Schwarz effectively extended the required classroom hours of MENG 211. This was never mentioned on YBB or at the beginning of the class, so shoppers had no idea what was in store for them. 3) He requires you to compile formula sheets for every test- he doesn't provide ANY constants\/equations\/etc. This is a huge waste of time because it turns the focus away from the application of engineering concepts and instead emphasizes specifics which a) aren't nearly as important as how they are used and b) can be looked up online by anybody who is working as an engineer. Throughout the course, Prof. Schwarz was an exceedingly unhelpful and poor teacher. He ruined thermodynamics.",
    "Do not take this class unless you absolutely have to. If you have to take it, only take it with Professor Dufresne, even if this puts you off track for your major. The class with Professor Schwarz is not interesting and difficult because you end up learning everything on your own.",
    "Take this class if you need it for your major. I'm sure if you're looking at thermodynamics for mechanical engineers you know what you're getting into.",
    "Rather disappointing. Lecture consists of nothing but derivations of various formulas, which turn out to be only a few formulas applied to various situations. So it's neither particularly exciting nor particularly stimulating. I suppose that I learned something, but I certainly didn't cherish it, and as a chemical engineering major I was also disappointed by the fact that problem sets seemed to draw far more from mechanical engineering applications than chemical engineering ones.",
    "I would recommend this for students that need it for their major but if a student was simply interested in the topic of thermodynamics or engines, there are more intriguing classes such as Engines, Energy and the Environment which has a unit of thermo that was quite comprehensive (MENG 101 when I was a freshmen).",
    "it is a class you are probably required to take, but it definitely is a worth while class that could be very interesting and enjoyable.",
    "The book and problem sets and midterms and class time all focus on different material. Concepts overall though are kind of interesting and its cool to hear how things work.",
    ". I would advise against taking this course though you probably have to take it for your major. Prof. Schwarz\u2019s lectures are very long-winded and generally follow the format of him saying a sentence, then writing it down word for word. Prof. Schwarz will take the time to write a lot of superfluous words on the board when he might have only needed to say a few, resulting in a lot of wasted time. The course has only one midterm and then the final, so those tests count for a lot and there is little opportunity to make up for any failure on those exams.",
    "If you have to take it, then it's not the end of the world. I certainly would not recommend this course though.",
    "This class wasn't too hard, but there was a big difference between what was taught in class and tested in the exams and psets. Schwarz really wanted to teach a more theoretical class, but all the problems were from the book and very applications-based. The TA homework session were useless-if you need help you need to meet with them one-on-one. Basically it's just one of those classes you need to slog through, but it is by no means the most difficult course in the major.",
    "Not a great course. Only take it if you need to. P-sets aren't terrible, but lecture isn't helpful, and the tests are very different than what we did on problem sets.",
    "This course is a good intro to thermodynamics, but there\u2019s much more of a focus on the conceptual rather than mathematical explanations. The big equations are introduced and you use them, but there are a lot more definitions and explanations, especially in the first part of the course. Chemical engineers, you should take this before physical chemistry I. Pchem is basically the same material as thermo, but more in-depth, with a lot more math, and generally more difficult. Not a bad course, well-organized (Prof Schwarz gives good notes, even if most of them are written definitions), and relatively enjoyable lectures (although a bunch of my friends stopped going because they already knew the material because of pchem). Make sure you either go to class or get the notes, because he tests specific examples that he mentions in class. Get the textbook because psets are much easier with the textbook, specific examples very similar to homework problems and tons of looking things up in tables."
