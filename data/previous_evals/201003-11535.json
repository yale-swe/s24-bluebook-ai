   "comments": [
    "This course introduced me to a lot of concepts that I felt I should already know.",
    "question 4: i thought that having problem sets every week (even weeks we had exams) was a little too much when put on top of 2 out of class exams, 2 out of class field trips, and a final exam.question 6: the class moved quite quickly, especially when it came to guest lectures.question 9: the field trips were fun, but i am not sure i gained very much from them. the soil field trip was quite long and started to get quite boring after 2 soil sites. it was bordering on too cold by the time we did the water field trip. i might suggest doing the field trips even sooner in the semester.question 10: the course was a nice overview\/review of science i had learned in undergrad, but as i am not a scientist, i doubt that i will need to know the material in the same detail as we learned it in this class.",
    "Very good course. The amount of material was overwhelming, but I did learn a great deal.",
    "Question 6: It seems like there was just too much subject matter to cover in one semester. All the subjects we learned were extremely dense (I've seen semester long classes cover just one subject in this course) and I struggled to find enough time to actually learn any of the material.",
    "Overall the class was a good overview of physical science concepts. Some of the topics were presented in ways that seemed less practical than others. But overall, the professor and TAs were very supportive and helpful to learning the topics.",
    "The content of the course was a) too much, and b) too specific. Knowing what units are used in the Manning equation, for example, will not help me in my career at all. Even if I was going into environmental science i don't think it would be that helpful.",
    "Regarding text books and course material I have a suggestion as this course requires multiple books which can be quite expensive to buy it will be great to scan the relevant chapters and make them available online.",
    "Field Trips: It would be preferable to time the water field trip first, before the weather gets so cold.Overall: Prof Anisfeld is a great professor. He puts a lot of effort into preparing for the classes. He is clear and his responsiveness to students reflects knowledge and patience.",
    "6. The pace of this class was too fast given that there was such a variety of \"physical science experience\" in the class. Some students were humanities majors in undergrad, while others had already studied much of the material that this course covered.",
    "I believe there was far too much material in this course and the area (energy) that I wanted covered the most was skipped. I really appreciated the professors' availability outside of the class to help and he was very nice. However, I believe he moved too rapidly through the class. This was a particular problem because there wasn't always a very good text to refer to and the notes that he provided in class were not nearly detailed enough. Furthermore I think that the material in class was too theoretical. It would have been more effective to also talk more about the application of the concepts.",
    "I feel that I represent the \"lowest common denominator\" of student in the class in the sense that my prior background knowledge likely ranks towards the bottom of other students in the class. Give this, my feeling on things to consider a first-time class such as this are as follows:\u0097Find a way to cover less material that works with this class still serving as a springboard for a certain (possibly reduced?) set of future classes.\u0097This class struck me as exploring too much depth at the sacrifice of comfortable pace and introductory context for each issue that we covered. I really needed more context before, say, diving into equations. If some depth can be saved for future classes in order to introduce the two aspects above, that would be great. Alternately, as mentioned, covering less material could be an option.\u0097Consider some combination of fewer tests or homework, possibly even to build in reviews of another kind at certain points in the semester. Consider either these alternate forms of review or TA sessions as more direct ways to point students in the direction of material worth retaining the best\/material that would be tested. Consider making HW and test and review sessions more directly build toward the material most worth retaining in your opinion, if the class continues to cover so much material (ie, some filter in this sense from other teaching tools would be appreciated).\u0097Having said all the above, what was covered was approached in a really great teaching fashion that was also well organized. Much appreciated.",
    "The field trips were both really fun and interesting. I definitely recommend doing them both again (two is enough - no need to add a third).",
    "This was by far and away the best foundations course I had. Shimi was a fantastic instructor. I had some difficulty, as I've never been comfortable with chemistry, but that's also what ended up making it a great course."

    "Shimon is a fantastic instructor. He is very engaging and very knowledgeable. I didn't do as well as I wanted to in this course because there was so much information it was difficult to keep up.",
    "I enjoyed the broad coverage. I felt I knew enough about a variety of topics to learn more on my own on a specific topic if it was of particular interest to my research\/ career",
    "All the office hours and TA session are really helpful for understanding the course materials.",
    "Shimi is an excellent professor. he did a great job of assuming no previous knowledge of the material, and was careful not to give explanations that would further confuse people.",
    "The field trips and the professor.",
    "Covers lots of basic material.",
    "The professor stuck to the science. Although there were many times in the course when I wished the Professor would talk more about the environmental issues along with the science, I think in the end the professor was right to be disciplined about sticking to the reduced science. He maximized the amount of scientific knowledge and method, sometimes at the expense of talking about more fun environmental issues. This must have been a disciplined choice by the professor and at the end of it I am thankful and understand the approach.",
    "Probably the homework",
    "The problem sets were excellent learning opportunities - they were not taken straight from lecture but instead forced students to think and apply knowledge that was presented in class. These offered real learning opportunities.",
    "Breadth of topics, fieldtrips, problem set QandA support at office hours",
    "Shimi is helpful in study sessions.",
    "A diverse range of topics was interlinked in an interesting manner. The instructor has put in a lot of effort to make sure that the class learns what is being taught.",

    "Really good, broad overview that will help me chart my next steps at F&ES in terms of where I want to go deeper. The course gave me a foundation I lacked.",
    "THe instructor",
    "Shimi was very nice and responsive too all questions. I went to almost all of the office hours and found his guidance most helpful.",
    "Professor Anisfeld is a very good teacher; All lectures were well organized and well structured. For a course that integrates so many disciplines, this was very helpful, and indeed necessary.",
    "The course material is clearly critical as a foundation for environmental managers. Shimi is an excellent teacher, and the TAs returned homework very quickly.",
    "Teaching lectures.",
    "The professor was truly excellent at explaining difficult concepts in a simple way.",
    "This was my favorite foundations course, because I feel it best fulfilled the spirit of what foundations courses should do: provide exposure to new issues and empower students to pursue them via further study. I've never taken a physical sciences class like this before, and had never studied soil, water, or air issues. I loved the broad exposure and the material itself, and am very glad I took this course.",
    "Shimi, Mercedes, and Troy. Interesting subject matter. Good field trips.",
    "Shimmi's humor and excellent lecturing.",
    "Professor Anisfeld's weekly office hours were extremely helpful. He set them up in a way that facilitated working in groups. I attended the office hours for this class more regularly than for any of my other classes.",
    "Excellent professor who did a good job of covering tough material."

   "comments": [
    "I'm not sure if it is possible, but there is almost too much information to cover in the class. Perhaps if there was a mandatory lab associated with this class to help review information on a weekly basis.",
    "Timing. I understand it was the first semester the class was taught, so the amount of material to be covered in each lecture still needs to be ironned out.",
    "Some parts of the course are a little bit too difficult given this is a foundation course. Most students in this course do not have scientific backgroud.",
    "perhaps give us a week or two off from problem sets--maybe during weeks when we had exams--would have been nice",
    "So much information, it's hard to get it all straight sometime.",
    "The readings could be tied into class more, or at least gel with class a little better.",
    "Restructure to cover less material.",

    "Interweaving the guest lectures better.",
    "Content.",
    "1. Online availability of reading material.2. In some sections the concepts are abstract and not linked to practical applications.",
    "I think more effort should be put in building from concepts rather than on explaining concepts themselves.",
    "The pace of the class was a bit quick for me -- I could have used more time in class dedicated to working through problems together, as I think I spent way too long puzzling through homework assignments that in retrospect shouldn't have required so much time.",
    "The field trips, while useful, could have been more so.",
    "More detailed notes and a slower pace. Midterms should be given in class and not in separate Friday sessions.",
    "The course structure and pace seemed poorly thought-out. While the course was intended to provide a foundation of the key concepts from the physical sciences necessary for environmental managers, approximately half the course focused on fundamental chemistry that I struggled to connect with the real world and the problems I hope to work on.I also struggled with the focus on academic texts, which did not always put concepts into context. It would have been helpful to supplement some of the readings with work from the secondary literature or lay publications to allow students to understand the concepts being taught as well as why they were relevant to environmental problems.",
    "See Question 11.",
    "It would be helpful if additional, optional readings were made available to provide extra background and explanation for more difficult topics and topics for which class time did not allot significant discussion time (ex: soil pH, nutrient cycles, air pollutants, etc.)Sometimes, graphs in the slides during lecture lacked captioning that could have helped during reviewing (easy to forget what they were about if you took inadequate notes)The weekly problem sets were undeniably useful and essential for learning - I would advocate cheerfully ignoring any comments from students that suggest otherwise.",
    "I could have used a more coherent reading packet. If you're not an auditory learner, it can be hard to keep up.",
    "Field trips weren't so helpful. Tests and field trips shouldn't be outside of class time.",
    "None",
    "Needs to relate to the real world. We learned a lot of chemistry with little discussion of how this actually relates to the problems we'll be facing. An example would be learning the nitrogen cycle by oxidation states, not where nitrogen comes from and where it goes."
