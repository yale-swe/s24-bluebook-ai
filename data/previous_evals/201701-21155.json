    "I learned a lot about the Spanish vanguard movements, and I learned how to analyze literature in Spanish, which was something I'd never been asked to do at such a high level. I also learned a lot generally about poetry and developed a strong appreciation for it.",
    "The vanguards period and movement(s) in Latin America were to me relatively unknown and amorphous; this course examined the various strains of avant garde literature from the turn of the 20th century in several genres and topics, including poetry, theatre, short stories, and negrismo.",
    "It was very interesting to explore the literary repercussions of the political and global happenings of the early 20th in one region, connected through art, music and words.",
    "Interesting class with engaging readings. A bit more discussion would have been appreciated"

   "comments": [
    "I think the biggest strength is Anibal's passion for the subject and his excitement every morning at 9am. That helped the class be engaging and exciting every day. I think the one big way that the course could be improved is to have more student discussion, led in a guided way. I think it would work well for it to be a more guided seminar rather than a small lecture with a bit of participation. That would have encouraged me to engage with the readings more on a day-to-day basis. Also, I thought that we could have been more organized when going through literary movements from different countries and maybe incorporated politics more.",
    "The class is a lecture, but with 8 people, there is the opportunity for singifnacnt sudent engagement. This potential, however, went unrealized. Perhaps it was the 9 AM start time, but half of the class consistently arrive late, or not at all. Comments were limited, and discussion never really thrived- not that it does in lectures. Nonetheless, Professor Gonzalez Perez demonstrates how to approach a text, indicating how the smallest of details may be grounds for extensive analysis. That said, I found that there was often much more to be said about a text than was covered, even in two 75 sessions, not because of the richness of the text, but because the method of working through a text almost page by page leaves out the bulk of what is to be said.",
    "Student participation in the course would be higher if it had a later time slot."

    "I would recommend this class as a work-light (2 short papers that come at weird times, and one giant paper) but intellectually-heavy way to engage with Spanish. Anibal is a delight, and the works we read can be fun to read and are generally interesting. I really did enjoy learning about the vanguard movements, particularly the poetry. For non-native speakers, some units are harder than others, but as long as you're fairly comfortable reading and writing in Spanish, the assignments are totally manageable. A fun way to do some Spanish! I found it to be a great fifth class where I was doing something challenging, different, and fun, but not too stressful work-wise.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course! It was so nice going into class in the mornings, discussing literature with a small group, and learning from such a kind and warm professor.",
    "I would recommend this course but urge students to do the reading carefully in order to engage well with the professor and to truly enjoy the teaching style. Insights and analysis are interwoven with much simpler plot summary and basic questions to the class, so relying on lectures alone may prove rather dull, although you could senselessly trudge through the class that way. Have fun with the two writing assignments, and have fun with the course.",
    "Yes if you're interested in Latin American literature and social issues.",
    "Yes if you are interested in unconventional literature"
