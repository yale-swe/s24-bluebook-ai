   "comments": [
    "It is the ideal space to develop any of your own projects related to political ecology. I would absolutely recommend it.",
    "Great course, interesting material, makes you realize the complexities of rivers and how crucial they are",
    "An interesting study on rivers. Take this if you are willing to put in the work it requires. If you do not do the reading, you will get nothing out of the class. The final paper was very unstructured, which could be good or bad depending on the student.",
    "I would recommend this course. The readings were all interesting, and discussions were fun as well.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student interested in politics and environmental studies who can keep up with the readings and contribute meaningfully to the conversation.",
    "Phenomenal class. Jim is the best professor I've had at Yale and it's a privilege to learn from him.",
    "Absolutely. The course material is great, and you will learn so much about rivers and the various factors that influence and shape rivers.",
    "A great seminar with fascinating readings (which really challenge typical assumptions we make when discussing rivers\/the environment at large and human interactions with them) and a brilliant, actively engaged professor. While certain key themes discussed over the course of the semester verged on repetition, each work introduced new perspectives\/frameworks that kept most conversations fresh. Professor Scott is very approachable, and you should attempt to talk with him early and often about potential final paper topics--he is great to bounce ideas off of and provides helpful book\/source recommendations.",
    "Fair class. A lot of reading and laid-back nature on fulfilling assignments. However, the casualness of the class also made it hard to determine how to actually do the assignments well or how the professor wanted. The discussions are student led so you have to be prepared to speak or there will be a tangible lull in the conversation. The final paper is on a river or river-body of your choosing however the requirements are not well-outlined so the paper could be any length and there is uncertainty as to what the professor wants.",
    "This class has been described as the rivers book club, and that's basically it--you read a book or two each week and discuss them in class for two hours. The readings are all at least good and at best incredible, and come at rivers from perspectives ranging from the biological to the sociological to the political, and Professor Scott is a wellspring of anecdotes. Classes are largely unstructured discussion, which can lead to dead ends in conversation, but Professor Scott is good at jump starting conversation by connecting to the topic of his study. I'd recommend if you want to read awesome books and have fairly casual discussion once a week-at least save the syllabus for your own reading."
