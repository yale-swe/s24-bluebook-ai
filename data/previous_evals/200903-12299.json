    "Classes 1-4 crash course in old norseClasses 5-end reading and translating sagas and poetry with epic battles, drinking bouts, cross-dressing, trickery and more.",
    "TAKE OLD NORSE TAKE OLD NORSE TAKE OLD NORSE TAKE OLD NORSE. It is the most fantastic class ever. It's not really a language class - more of an English class where the readings just happen to be in Old Norse, which is important, because sagas that are kind of boring in English are hilariously awesome in the original (Old Norse doesn't translate into idiomatic English well). It's a fairly chill class, and you'll end up learning allsorts of utterly fantastic random facts (about Vikings, runes, Greenland, Tolkein, etc) while getting to read about diplomats leading their polar bears behind them and the end of the world (with the ship made of human nails...and the Middle-Earth serpent with fire shooting out of its eyes...and the frost-giants, mustn't forget the frost giants...). Professor Frank is phenomenal - she's really nice, and she knows absolutely everything. If this is offered again, TAKE IT.",
    "I would strongly recommend Readings in Old Norse to anyone with an interest in language history, in fantasy and exploration narratives, in early Europe, or in English in general. It provides a strong background in the prehistory of the English language andmuch of the English literary tradition, through readings which are genuinely fun and real work in a distinct language.",
    "Take it if you want to study this material and not if you don't. Frank is good--spacey but good. She's better at teaching literature than language, so only take this if you feel like you're good at acquiring grammar on your own. There's a lot of daily work, but Old Norse language is not too hard and Frank very understanding of cramped schedules. The textbook is from the 19th century (no joke) and makes homework take 10x longer than it would with a modern book, but the material is amazing and, seriously, when else will you get a chance to study this stuff?",
    "You learn to read Old Norse (learn the grammar), read some of the most important works in Old Norse literature in the original and in translation (some of the most important Icelandic sagas, Eddic and Skaldic poetry, etc.). Most class sessions consist of translating around the table from the assigned passage for the day. There was one tiny quiz and then one final test, as well as a presentation and a final paper. The presentations could be on anything and as a result we had interesting presentations on everything from math in Viking age to riddles in sagas. I would ABSOLUTELY recommend this class to another student. I didn't think that I would be interested in Old Norse at all, but I am, and I hope to take Old English with Professor Frank next semester as well. If you enjoy learning languages or would like to read some of the literature of the Viking age in the original and learn many cool facts along the way with a small group of students, then this is the class for you. It is truly a great English course, and you don't get something like it often at Yale -- we don't have many course offerings on Medieval literature. So if it's offered, TAKE IT!",
    "I would recommend this class. This literature can be difficult to access at first (especially in the original!) but by the end I had a feel for the unique tone and style of the sagas and can talk about the literary history of Iceland. The language is also really beautiful and grammatically interesting.",
    "If you're willing to learn a new language and read original texts in Old Norse, take the class: it is so much better to read parts of the sagas in the original. However, if you haven't ever learned a foreign language such as Latin or a Germanic language, you might struggle with the grammar a bit."
