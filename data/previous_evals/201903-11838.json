    "This course really helped me with interpreting Spanish and speaking Spanish much more accurately. The class teaches all of Spanish grammar and is taught in Spanish forcing you to adapt your brain to thinking in the language.",
    "I really improved my ability to speak and read in spanish. The comprehension of short stories and lectures was greatly improved.",
    "I re-learned the grammatical concepts I had learned in Span 110-120 and gained additional insight from practicing these skills in a variety of ways. The Supersite homework, the course packet readings, the novela, and even some videos were used to help me practice my spanish.",

   "comments": [
    "I thought the class was great and particularly because its taught 100% in Spanish. It aids in learning the language without even knowing it. I dont think there are any weaknesses with the course. It is a manageable work load and youre constantly learning.",
    "The strength of this course I believe was the discussions had within the class as well as the focus on literature which helped bring the language to life. A weakness is the lack of writing present in the course.",
    "This course was very immersive and meeting every day was a fantastic way to improve skills rapidly. I thought the material covered was very useful and engaging. The pace of the class was very manageable and the size of the class was perfect. I personally however did not like the way the oral exam was structured at all (we basically were given 1 text and 1 movie and had to prepare 10-minute answers for 10 different questions regarding the content). I also did not love the book and the short stories. However these are just rudimentary things that can be easily changed and is also dependent on the person (e.g. I had classmates who liked the book we read). As long as you go into class with an eagerness to learn the language, you'll be good.",
    "Small class sizes were great! The readings were sometimes confusing and sad, different kinds of readings could have made them more engaging"

    "Yes! If you are looking for a language course thats not too difficult but will teach you Spanish. L3 is it!",
    "Most definitely this was one of my favorite courses.",
    "I am personally taking Spanish just because I really like the language (not to fulfill the requirement) and so I would of course recommend it (it was my favourite class this semester). The grammar was taught systematically and the teaching style was very clear and effective. The various methods of learning such as reading literature and having conversations was an amazing way to practice the skills we were learning. However, there will always be some people in the class who are not in it to truly learn the language and so sometimes progress feels slow.",
    "Yes if needed for Spanish requirement"
