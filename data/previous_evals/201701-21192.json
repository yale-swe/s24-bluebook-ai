    "The course content was kind of weird because it bounced back and forth between theory and poetry. I think I would have preferred to see a narrower focus in the material we studied. However, I think a lot of the work we read was very important and valuable, especially theory from trans people of color and indigenous two-spirit people.",
    "Professor Peterson could improve the course most by redesigning the syllabus to match her strengths and interests instead of using the syllabus designed by the previous instructor. I imagine this is what she'll do in future semesters.",
    "This course was very ill-organized. It was constantly being reorganized."

    "This was an excellent course to take, especially as a trans* person. Highly recommend, especially if professor Peterson is teaching it again.",
    "Really great class to be trans in. Would definitely recommend for trans\/queer folks (and allies who are wiling to learn) because the classroom environment is A+, and you learn a lot about trans history and queer theory. Despite it being a 300 level WGSS class, I think you can get by without a whole lot of WGSS theory\/knowledge, so don't let the numbering scare you from taking it!",
    "Yes-- anyone interested in gender studies or LGBT issues should absolutely take this course."
