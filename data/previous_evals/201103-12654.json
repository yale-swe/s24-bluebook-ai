   "comments": [
    "A great way to practice sight singing.",
    "We came to class, sight-read music, and that's it. Really fun, and you come out of it a much better sight reader. We mostly sang, but by the end, a lot of us were playing recorder as well. If you're considering this class at all, DEFINITELY take it. Not much work at all, either.",
    "Take it if you can read music, have a mature interest in the material, and are interested in a Yale course that for once has a manageable work load. I had many goosebump moments in class, as well as on stage. The music scores were like rare gems.",
    "Definitely a must for singers with any interest in pre-Baroque and Baroque music. Super interesting and enjoyable, and Prof. Herreid is incredible. Lots of singing.",
    "SICK CLASS! I would highly recommend it. It's super chill and interesting.You don't need to be a pro singer to join either. I started singing for the first time since middle school chorus and was able to catch on with a little work. Actually, I would encourage those who are musical, can hum in tune, and can read music but have never sung before to take this class. You'll learn a lot and your singing will really improve. It's also a lot of fun!You may not learn as much if you're already a pro singer in terms of music technique, but you'll learn some of other neat stuff and get a lot of sight reading practice because there is a lot of music we go through.",
    "This class is great if you just want to be exposed to specific styles of early music in a low-stress environment. If you're looking for a rigorous analytical and historical treatment of this music, this is not the class for you. But it was a fun time - basically, \"class\" functions as a weekly rehearsal, and there's a performance at the end of the semester. Prof. Herreid was engaging, although he's somewhat disorganized, and sometimes he gets impatient when we can't roll with the punches (e.g. a new 8-part piece the week before the performance) as quickly as he'd like us to. But overall, a solid choice - this would make a perfect 5th class.",
    "Such a fun class--you basically get to stand in a room of amazingly talented musicians and make music, learn about the time period the music was originally composed in, and then give a great performance.",
    "Yes. Good performance credit."
