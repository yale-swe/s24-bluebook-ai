   "comments": [
    "I loved this course! I learned many valuable skills about conducting a systematic review and about work in the field of obesity prevention. I would highly recommend this course.",
    "I would like to make one suggestion here. I think the students would benefit if they could have some librarian come in and give a session on how to systematically search or do an exhaustive search for relevant articles and how to develop an apriori protocol for searching articles. That's the most important part of any review and I felt the need for more guidance on it.",
    "I loved this course! I love the combination of guest speakers and lecture because it gave us a well rounded view of the issue.",
    "It was an excellent course. I especially loved the fact that our final assignment was broken into smaller assignments and spread out throughout the semester; it made the work more manageable. In terms of weaknesses, I would have loved to learn more about stigma\/discrimination surrounding obesity or the relationship between mental health and obesity.",
    "Fantastic courses! Very interesting lectures, taught in a informative and engaging manner. Professor Irwin was great in teaching the material, connecting it to current events and showing students that these are existing, salient issues in public health and society. Weaknesses: Maybe assign some articles on how to write systematic reviews, because I was a bit lost initially.",
    "I thought the course did a really great job of giving an overview of interdisciplinary issues and perspectives related to obesity. I enjoyed writing the systematic review and integrating new perspectives into my paper as the class went on. However, I wish the actual class lectures were less focused on the nitty-gritty of the biological mechanisms underlying obesity treatment and more focused on different opinions and movements related to the obesity epidemic. I would have preferred more content related to the social and political circumstances that reliably produce obesity on a population level. I think learning the biological mechanisms is something students can do in their own time with assigned readings.",
    "Good course-provided a comprehensive overview of obesity prevention and intervention strategies,complimented by a great opportunity to conduct our own research through systematic reviews. More opportunities to discuss as a class would be appreciated.",
    "Subject matter was great, and Professor Irwin does a great job at engaging students and sharing her expertise in this topic. Guest speakers were all great and managed to add a lot to the course without seeming like a replacement for usual course content as in some other courses. My one suggestion is that one entire class be spent on methodology for completing a systematic review. Bringing in YSPH's resource librarian as a guest lecturer prior to the \"methods\" section of the systematic review being due would be very helpful and would hopefully help students circumvent some typical pitfalls in searching the literature. Having the systematic review due in sections throughout the term with applicable feedback was extremely helpful when it came to the final submission.",
    "Interesting topics with innovative project (the review) & great guest lecturers; however, there could be better feedback on the quality of the lit review. Some topics that could be considered include more global obesity trends and information (the nutrition transition, etc.)",
    "Great class! really enjoyed the guest lectures. Really wish it wasn't at 8am :\/",
    "I liked learning about the field through my own literature research. And I very much liked learning about various aspects of obesity treatment\/intervention efforts in the medical field with guest lecturers.",
    "Overall, I learned a lot from this course. Dr. Irwin was clearly passionate about the topic and she had a lot of great insights I thought the readings were excellent and I enjoyed all of the guest lectures. I appreciated Dr. Irwin spacing out the different parts of the review throughout the semester and giving us step-by-step instructors on how to complete our reviews. It was always stressful the couple days before part of our review was due, but it was great at the end of the semester when a draft of everything was complete. My only suggestion is that it would have been helpful to go into more detail on how to do the literature search. I only did a pubmed search for my topic and did not feel super confident about it. I eventually talked to the public health librarian, which was helpful, but it required me to re-do my literature search towards the end of the semester and made things really stressful. It might be helpful to have the public health librarian come in to one of the classes earlier in the semester and go over the different databases besides pubmed that students can use and show students how to properly do a literature search.",
    "The guest lecturers were great and I really liked writing the editorials",
    "Despite the early morning start, the topic and professor and guest lecturers are engaging. We spent a great deal of time discussing interventions and I did like the guest speakers who came in, however I think we should have spent more time discussing social theories and the underpinning of obesity as a public health problem. I think we would have benefited from someone from the library coming to talk to us about how to do a systematic review in the beginning of the semester, namely search strategies! Would have like more guidance on the oral presentations because some people went way too far in depth."

    "Instructor: Melinda Liggett Irwin \u00a0Great instructor. Truly cared about the students, their understanding of the material, and wanted the best. She knows a lot about the topic, and it was interesting to hear her work.",
    "Instructor: Melinda Liggett Irwin \u00a0Dr. Irwin did a magnificent job pushing the class to think critically about the subject. I thought her grading and expectations were extremely fair. I very much enjoyed the assigned readings and guest speakers. I ado wish we had more explicit formal instructions and expectations regarding our systematic review. I had never written a systematic review before and most of the instructions and grading criteria were given to me via individual questions or for 5 minutes at the end of class, making it difficult to refer back to when I went to do my work.",
    "Instructor: Melinda Liggett Irwin \u00a0Very knowledgeable and eager to teach; wonderful",
    "Instructor: Melinda Liggett Irwin \u00a0Professor Irwin is great and is one of the only professors able to engage students at 8am!",

    "Instructor: Melinda Liggett Irwin \u00a0Professor Irwin is really a leader in her field and it was cool to hear about all the research she has done and what obesity research is like in the real world. She's a fun and engaging professor (which is necessary at 8am).",
    "Instructor: Melinda Liggett Irwin \u00a0Thank you so much for the semester I enjoyed learning about the field & having the opportunity to challenge myself to write a systematic review. I think students would appreciate printed guidelines of the assignments.",
    "Instructor: Melinda Liggett Irwin \u00a0Melinda Irwin was an excellent instructor and I appreciated her quick responses to e-mails outside of class. She was always willing to give feedback, which was extremely helpful.",
    "Instructor: Melinda Liggett Irwin \u00a0I really enjoyed Prof. Irwin's perspectives and the occasional off the cuff remarks. She's easy to listen to and follow her train of thought. Very responsive to emails."
