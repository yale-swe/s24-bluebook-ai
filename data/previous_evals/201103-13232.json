    "This course was very interesting. It showed me a side of genetics that I never knew existed. It also taught me the practical side of genetics too.",
    "The lectures were organized and made sense sequentially. I think that the course did a great job of bridging public health and genetics. I realized how important these concepts are to public health and I think the things I learned in this class will become increasingly useful as public health starts to utilize genetics more often.",
    "I would have liked more general concepts and less solving equations.",
    "The course covered a lot of material very quickly, but a majority of the course was spent on the relevance of genetics to public health (which I appreciated). However, I would not say that this course is geared toward those without a science background. I do not have a science background and felt very lost and confused during the first half of the course when we covered basic genetics.",
    "Great introduction to genetics in public health. A background in biology\/genetics is helpful but probably not necessary. Dr. Dewan touched on a lot of great topics; however, sometimes lectures were very jargon heavy",
    "Good class, although it is quite difficult if you do not have a strong science background.",
    "Overall, this course was a very interesting introductory course to many of the key concepts important to Genetic Epidemiology. I feel like more resources to understand the application of concepts that are being taught would be a helpful supplement.",
    "The course was interesting but it was frustrating to understand the main points\/essence behind the lecture concepts. I wish concepts were made clearer in lecture so that I can say that I understood the points in lecture.",
    "The overall course wasn't bad, just wish the course material was taught at a slightly slower pace with the understanding that some taking it may not have a background in genetics. Mainly, the homework questions should be provided with a bit more instructions-I'm of course not suggesting feeding students the answers, but providing enough information so that students don't have to rely on instructor office hours for clarification in order to proceed with completing the homework.",
    "I feel that the class was excellent. There was ample opportunity for me to receive explanations during class and during Prof. Dewan's office hours. However, it lacked a TA, which would have helped a bit more."

    "Instructor: Andrew T. DeWan \u00a0Dr. DeWan was great. He was extremely prepared, and always encouraged us to ask for help. Because Dr. DeWan is so knowledgeable in his field, sometimes he would say things that were a bit over my head, but otherwise he is a great teacher.",
    "Instructor: Andrew T. DeWan \u00a0Dr. DeWan was a great lecturer. He was very good about adjusting the content and his speed of lecture to meet the needs of the students. I really enjoyed learning from him.",
    "Instructor: Andrew T. DeWan \u00a0Really nice guy, really wanted everyone to do well. Always smiley and cheerful!",
    "Instructor: Andrew T. DeWan \u00a0Dr. DeWan is always availabe and willing to answer student questions. I went to his office hour almost every week with questions, and he was always very kind and attentive. However, I feel that the explanation of some topics were rushed and\/or incomplete during class time and that is why so many students went to office hours each week.",
    "Instructor: Andrew T. DeWan \u00a0Dr. Dewan is very knowledgeable, and I felt like I learned a lot. At times, explanations were either lacking or confusing, but he was responsive to questions.",
    "Instructor: Andrew T. DeWan \u00a0Dr. Dewan is extremely smart, a nice guy, and pretty good lecturer.",
    "Instructor: Andrew T. DeWan \u00a0Dr. DeWan was great. He was very helpful and approachable.",
    "Instructor: Andrew T. DeWan \u00a0Andy was a good teacher- very passionate and enthusiastic about the course material. He sometimes didn't explain fundamental concepts and thus it made complicated concepts difficult to understand. If students asked for clarification, he would go back and explain, but it made it difficult to still follow lecture.",
    "Instructor: Andrew T. DeWan \u00a0Really knowledgeable and enthusiastic instructor, but could have taught the course in a way that adjusted to students pace of understanding.",
    "Instructor: Andrew T. DeWan \u00a0Prof. Dewan answered all my questions. He was clear during lecture."

    "Yes, it is a way to see how Genetic Concepts are applied in genetically related disease epidemiology."
