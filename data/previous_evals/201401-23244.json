   "comments": [
    "I would only recommend this course if Prof. Maralani were teaching it.",
    "I would simply characterize it as indispensable. It is crucial to reading sociological journals, holding substantive conversations with fellow peers and colleagues, and thinking through sociological problems and questions, whether they be qualitative or quantitative in nature. For these reasons alone, I would recommend this course to other students.",
    "Overall, the course was very useful.",
    "Whether you plan to conduct quantitative research or occasionally read a quantitative article, you will find this course very helpful. It covers many important models and tools that address questions OLS (the first semester model) cannot. Vida ensures the course moves at an appropriate pace, and clearly shows how each tool is applied in current sociological research.",
    "Following a semester that focused on the OLS model, Sociology 581 01 is a survey course that exposes studentsto and provides a brief introduction to many different models and techniques that are applied by quantitative scholars in sociology.Yes, I would recommend the course.",
    "I would recommend the course to any student who wants an overview of the basic statistical methods that social scientists use in their research. The course provides essential knowledge for anyone who wants to understand how sociologists translate data for interpretation. It is also required knowledge for anyone who hopes to do quantitative research in the discipline."

   "question_text": "How did this course deepen your knowledge of your discipline\/profession? To what extent did this course contribute to your dissertation\/research?",
   "comments": [
    "Teaches you basic models and so very helpful for reading various literatures.",
    "The course was very practical and gave me the skills I need to explore the my research questions.",
    "It increased the essential knowledge.",
    "I have become seriously interested in quantitative research, so the topics covered in this course are very relevant not only to the literature I am reading, but also to the work I would eventually like to do. This course gave me tools to analyze many different research questions and types of data. As I prepare to do my own data analysis next year, I feel much more comfortable with the type of critical thinking necessary to use these quantitative methods. (I also recognize, having taken this course, what I know and what I still need to learn. That in itself is very valuable.)",
    "The course exposed me to a wide range of techniques and methods in quantitative sociology and, in so doing, deepened my knowledge, at an introductory level, of the tools that are available to apply in sociological research.The course has not yet contributed to my dissertation research, but I am certain it will, even though my dissertation will likely be qualitative. For example, for the qualitative project I am considering now, I suspect I would use the regression discontinuity technique to study the effect of a program on those admitted to it (as compared to those who just missed being omitted to the program).",
    "This course made sociological studies more accessible to me. I feel more confident scrolling through the pages of leading journals in the discipline because the data tables no longer seem unfamiliar or obtuse.This course does not contribute to my dissertation or research as alternative research methods are more appropriate for the work that I plan to do and the questions I am trying to explore."
