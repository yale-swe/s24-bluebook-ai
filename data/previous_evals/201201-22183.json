    "This is not a very good course. However, it's probably the best way to do your math requirement. It's fairly easy to follow along and the workload is not too bad at all, just one problem set each week, two mid-terms, and a final. I would recommend it if you need to take math, but otherwise, I would skip it.",
    "It's a good place to start if you're looking to take a higher level calculus in the future. I would recommend it for those without a strong math background from high school.",
    "I would recommend Math 112 for students who need to get a QR credit, want to keep up with their math from high school, or who need it for their major. The workload isn't too intense and as long as you go to class and turn in the homework you are pretty well prepared for the midterm. However, before the tests it is recommended to go through the book and take advantage of what the book has to offer.",
    "Math 112 is a class that I wouldn't recommend taking. Take Math 120 instead.",
    "I would recommend Math 112 if you are genuinely interested in math, The material isn't too complicated, but the midterms and final are quite difficult!",
    "It is much different than a high school calc course so be prepared for that, but it is necessary as a foundation.",
    "If you did have much experience with calc in high school, take the class",
    "It is tough. I would recommend to another student.",
    "I took Math 112 after many years without real math, and it was very challenging. The level depends on your level of pre-college preparation, and also the amount of work you are ready to put in. Still, I learned a lot, it is very applicable to the real world, and also just relays fundamental information that I think is important to know."
