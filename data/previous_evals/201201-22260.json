   "comments": [
    "Yes. DS Lit is fabulous. It's lots of reading and writing, but what you read teaches you how to read and how to enjoy it (Wordsworth comes to mind here).",
    "I would totally recommend Directed Studies. Even if you're not into the humanities or will be majoring in something in the math or sciences, you will learn so much from doing Directed Studies and probably enjoy it, too.",
    "Take this if you want a survey of the Western Canon - possibly the best undergraduate survey anywhere in the world. Actually. Professor Bauer is one of, if not the best professor to take it with, for the serious student. Word of warning, be prepared for possibly the most intense professor in DS. He will expect much of you, but if you're up for it, push you to be the best that you can be.",
    "Honestly if you've done the first semester of ds you know what you're in for, I recommend it if you liked first semester, the reading lost for this one is incredible.",
    "Spring lit is the best part of DS, and that's saying something. If you're thinking about dropping DS second semester, this class is one very compelling reason to stay. The books you read are incredible.",
    "A continuation of the western cannon of Literature. I would recommend this course because I feel it is well-taught and the works are interesting",
    "The reading was really great but it was hard doing two longs books (Don Quixote and War and Peace) in one semester.",
    "I would recommend this class because the reading, while daunting, is well worth it. In years to come, you will regret having read essential texts like Paradise Lost, War and Peace, and the short fiction of Jorge Luis Borges.",
    "This is one of my favorite classes! The works are amazing, class discussion is great, and it only motivates you to want to read deeper into the works and explore more after the class is over. I enjoyed being in class every day.",
    "Having DS Literature with Professor Bauer is definitely going to be quite an experience. He is a brilliant professor and a experienced section leader. He demands a lot from student, even compared to other DS instructors. Be prepared to put a lot of work into this course. But you will know all the work you put into is going to be worth it."
