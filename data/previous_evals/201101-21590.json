   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course, though you may leave with some pessimistic conclusions it will widen your frame of knowledge regarding not only Americas political system, but all democracies.",
    "You will love Professor DeCanio. Love him. I see him becoming Yale's most loved professor if he stays here awhile.",
    "This course was a waste of time. I took it because it was easy, and I barely had to do any work, so I guess I shouldn't complain. But I didn't learn ANYTHING. I was hoping to learn some basic facts about the separation of powers, duties of the supreme court, etc-- stuff that would be useful as acitizen-- but instead, the thesis for every class was just that democracy doesn't really exist, voters are ill-informed, and voting is useless. There were a few interesting theories in there, but not interesting enough to fill a whole semester. I would have appreciated an actual overview of government power, etc. It just felt sort of irrelevant. But it was easy and Decanio has a nice, approachable manner.",
    "The class doesn't really take a three branches of government approach and tell you the major duties and responsibilities of each endowed by the Constitution. Rather, the course focuses on the analytical and asks the question of whether American democracy functions the way the Constitution says or how we, as American citizens, perceive it to function. We look at high rates of voter ignorance and how that affects the representativeness of our preferences of the legislators we elect into office, the differences between public and private bureaucracy, misconceptions about the advantages of the minimum wage, and more. We never talk about the judicial branch in any capacity which was weird to me.",
    "This is basically a gut--the readings are long but you only have to remember them for a day, since there are quizzes. And there's one ten-page paper at the end. It's interesting material, but be prepared to feel really depressed at the end.",
    "I absolutely would recommend this class. I thought it was amazing and I looked forward to going to lectures.",
    "Take it. Great intro poli sci course.",
    "Do not take this course. It is quite awful. You'll have to do readings (that get really repetitive after about a week) because there are reading check quizzes sporadically throughout the semester. These quizzes make it so that you have to go to lecture, where the professor will spend 50 minutes just summarizing everything in the readings without saying anything new.I also always had the impression that Prof Decanio was really inattentive and uncaring about the class. He assigned us a 350 page book, then came into class on the day it was due and told us that he finally got around to reading the book and hated it. So essentially we all wasted 40$ and a couple hours.",
    "When I looked at evaluations before taking this course, I read that Prof. DeCanio was interesting, lively and eager to listen to students' thoughts. I was told the coursework was relatively light and the class was enjoyable. I am not sure what other people are going to write in their evaluations after this semester, but if they write what I just summarized above, please, for your sake, IGNORE THEM.This class was an absolute disaster from beginning to end and I cannot regret taking it more. Prof. DeCanio did not teach a single thing that was not in the readings. He would assign readings for each class that ranged from a 20-page paper to a 300 page book and then when we got to class, he would summarize the content in a simplistic, meaningless way. The point he was trying to make with the course seemed to be how American democracy is doomed from a variety of angles, but he never offered any kind of solution aside from a completely ridiculous, poorly-thought-out idea in the last lecture. His seemed to be trying to be controversial, but unfortunately, that came at the cost of teaching anything at all. He would often let us out early because he had nothing more to say.The format of the class was that there were easy weekly quizzes on the readings and a 10-page final paper. Though this seems light, it could be difficult at times to keep up with the readings. Once, Prof. DeCanio assigned a renowned, classic 300-page book only to tell us in class that he thought it was stupid and then let us out early instead of discussing it. Since there were no tests or papers, we quickly learned that it was pointless to take notes. And since he wasn't saying anything of value, it was basically pointless to listen at all. Prof. DeCanio ran the lecture like a section, and spent a disproportional amount of time going back and forth with students.If you attend the first lecture of the course, do not be fooled by Prof. DeCanio's demeanor. He is young and seems friendly and easygoing. But outside of the classroom, Prof. DeCanio was notoriously irresponsible and rude to students.If nothing I have said has persuaded you not to take this course, just know that the class is not really a gut and if that's what you're looking for, surely there are better gut classes out there.",
    "Intro to American Politics is an interesting class with a manageable amount of work, I would definitely recommend this class.",
    "I would summarize this class as a very general summary of some fundamental problems with American Government. You won't actually learn much about the structure or function of government, so much as some of its inadequacies.",
    "This class is great! It was probably my favorite class of the semester. I really learned a lot about American politics on top of what I already knew from AP Gov. Professor DeCanio is the best!! He is funny, provocative, and engaging. His lectures are great and the 50 minutes fly by. It is not very much work, consisting of two readings per week (which can be really long once you switch from articles to entire books), and 50% of the grade is based on weekly quizzes on the readings. So if you do the readings, you should do well in this class. I would definitely recommend this class to anyone even remotely interested in politics.",
    "Professor DeCanio encourages participation and makes class more engaging than your average lecture course. A great thing about the class is that there are no exams; your grade is based on in-class quizzes, section participation, and the final paper. The quizzes are unannounced, but towards the end of the semester we knew when we were going to be quizzed. The quizzes are short (2 questions) and are based off of the reading due that class day. As long as you did the reading, the quizzes are straightforward and easy. Lecture was usually pretty interesting, but often just summarized what we had been assigned to read for that day.",
    "I would recommend it because the course books are fun reads and the debates are nice. The paper at the end of the class - 10 page minimum - actually types itself out, and the TAs are very helpful. It's great if you have interest in the subject.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course!",
    "I would definitely recommend it because it was very interesting. If you enjoy the material and the subject the class will hardly seem like work because there are no exams. It is by no means a gut because the reading can be arduous at times. At the same time it was never the hardest class on my schedule. The effort that it took was well worth it. I learned a lot about politics that I had never even heard before.",
    "Great course. Gives a broad scope of politics and is pretty interesting if you want to learn about it. Got me more interested in politics.",
    "The course is really like a big session, except that it's too big so it's really really hard to follow with what other students are rambling at the time. Professor is generally nice, but sometimes he always declines to give his own answer or opinion, which is quite frustrating because you feel like you're not learning much from him.",
    "Awesome class. Low stress. Highly recommended. Grades are based on weekly reading quizzes and a 10-page final paper about anything you want (so no midterm, no final).",
    "This is a very problematic class. Prof. DeCanio treats lectures as opportunities to ask very basic questions about the reading. Regardless of how one feels about running lecture as a seminar, the questions asked rarely amounted to anything but a shallow review of the reading. When class transitioned to discussion of broader questions, Prof. DeCanio often encouraged and sometimes made completely bizarre arguments - not provocative, but simply bad arguments.The reading itself was another problem. The beginning of the course worked relatively well - I got the sense that this was because we were covering voter ignorance, which seems to be DeCanio's field. Then, at least, the curriculum fit together from week to week.After week five or so, things fell apart. During one week, the class assigned readings on the economics of the minimum wage. Class discussion stalled because - surprise, surprise! - non-economics majors have two or three things to say about complex economic arguments. Later, during the units on the presidency, Prof. DeCanio simply seemed uncomfortable with the material. For instance, he assigned \"Presidential Power,\" apparently a canonical book on the presidency, after we read \"The Rhetorical Presidency.\" The \"Rhetorical Presidency,\" by its own terms, is a response to the famous arguments of \"Presidential Power.\" It's beyond me why one would read the response to a certain book before reading that book itself.In short, this class was dull at best and uninformed at worst.",
    "Take it!",
    "I would recommend this to someone who enjoys theoretical political science. A lot of the reading could be boring, and it was essential you do it because of the in class quizzes, and if you don't have a genuine interest in it, you won't enjoy it at all. But overall, it was a good class.",
    "yeah, take it if you're a freshman or you want an easy gut",
    "I would recommend this course to other students, especially those who haven't taken an American government course before. However, this course focuses on voter ignorance, which is a very interesting topic in itself, more so than the actual structure of government. The workload is manageable and the professor makes the lectures engaging and interesting.",
    "Intro to American Politics is a really fun class. Professor DeCanio is different than any other professor I've had in the way he runs a class- it's a lecture that's really more like a really big seminar, because everyone is encouraged to talk throughout class. He also started every class by taking questions about current events, which is something we don't get often enough at Yale. You may end up learning mostly about how flawed American politics are, rather than how it actually works, but it was a nice class to take as a change of pace from other, more intense classes, and I'd totally recommend it.",
    "This class is a lot better than I thought it was going to be. I thought it was going to be a fairly basic overview of government (e.g. there are 3 branches of government, etc.). It ended up being a pretty interesting look at the forces that drive the decisions government makes. For example, we explored pretty deeply the causes and consequences of voter ignorance.That said, as much as the subject matter was fairly interesting, it was a pretty easy class. The only time you have to put much effort in is for the final paper.I'd say take it if you are looking for a fairly easy class and have an interest in American politics.",
    "It is a strong introductory course that sheds light on many aspects of american politics that people are unaware of. It requires you to do work and a long final term paper. None of the work is difficult and you can choose the topic of your final paper. I highly recommend this class.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. There is not too much work and the material is really interesting.",
    "Basic intro covering Congress, Prez, and bureaucracies, and public opinion. Recommended for an easy survey course.",
    "The course if very straight forward. If you do the reading and at least understand the basic concepts behind the reading, and you go to class to take the quizes you will do well. I find reading and discussing voter ignorance, public and private bureaucracies etc. very interesting. Look at the syllabus if the readings do not seem at all interesting don't take it. If they do, take it.",
    "Yes I would! VEry interesting lecture, section, and reading! Makes you think a lot"
