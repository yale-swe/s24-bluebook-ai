    "Interesting class that delves into why we as humans listen to music and how musical capabilities have evolved from our ancestors to modern times.",
    "This seminar is great! Very engaging discussions on interesting topics. We usually had reading to do each night for homework, and a couple of writings to do throughout the semester. Nothing unmanageable. One note--it's more focused on the evolutionary aspect of music than on music theory, so be aware of that if you're looking for something more theory-based.",
    "Sure, try it out if you like music and Socratic-style discussions.",
    "Take it. It's a lot of reading, but the discussions are engaging and the homework assignments aren't too bad.",
    "This class gives a really good macro-level overview of one of themost fascinating subjects in contemporary biology, and I would totally recommend it to anyone. We get to read everything from Steven Pinker to Rousseau, and it's got enough content to satisfy the musician, the biologist, and the writer. Be warned though: this is a rhetoric class, not a science class. As a writing credit, the main focus is in analyzing the arguments presented in the readings and constructing our own arguments, rather than a hardcore introduction to the science behind the issue. That being said, you get a taste of it, and I would certainly recommend the class.",
    "I would recommend this if you are extremely knowledgable about music. I thought it would be more science based, but it was mainly focused on the humanities.",
    "If you want to know more about the foundations of music, take this class. Workload is very manageable, Professor Quinn is a boss, and you will learn so much about the theories of musical development.",
    "MUSI 021, a combination of mainly music, cognitive science, and English, will soon become the seminar that every freshman tries to get into. The goal of the class is to investigate the origins of music and answer questions like \u00e2\u0080\u009cis music adaptive?\u00e2\u0080\u009d We read a range of material including scientific papers, modern books (eg. Levitin), and some older works (eg. Rousseau). The class discussions on the readings are often incredibly fruitful. Overall, the class has a laidback atmosphere and the workload is relatively light. Professor Quinn is awesome; he is very knowledgeable about the topic and does a great job in encouraging or galvanizing a great discussion. In my opinion, the class is perfect for students who have some musical talent but also are pursuing a technical or scientific area of study. To be clear, virtuosic musical abilities are not a prerequisite; in fact you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t need to know much music theory or even play an instrument well to be able to do well in the class as it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s essentially an English class with a music bent. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s great for anyone who needs a writing credit. Overall, MUSI 021 is a veryinteresting class that I would highly recommend to almost anyone.",
    "I enjoyed it--fun class.",
    "If you're looking for a course where you will get a chance to have a lot of really interesting class discussions, this is the course you want. If you're okay with the fact that at the end of each one, you'll kind of end up back where you started in terms of what you have actually learned from the discussion, that's even better, because you will have to deal with that in this course simply due to the nature of the material -- very little on the subject is known for sure. I would definitely recommend this course if you're looking for an engaging, seminar-style course.",
    "Music and Human Evolution is an incredible class and if you get the opportunity to take it you should. It would really be interest ion to people who have a strong interest in music and animals and the rout of evolution.",
    "I would recommend the course, but with a bit of qualification. I really enjoyed it, and thought that Professor Quinn let me explore my own interest in the philosophy of music in the two papers assigned, which I really appreciated. The course is heavily focused on the science behind the evolution of music, and while it does engage questions like \"what is music,\" I would have enjoyed a bit more of the philosophy of music. That being said, Professor Quinn really led really interesting and deep discussions during class. It wasn't much work (only two papers, and manageable readings), and he's not an incredibly hard grader (although I know for the first paper at least, only 3 out of 18 got A's). Overall though, I would recommend it for any music lover who is interested in some of the deeper questions behind human and animal music.",
    "It is an excellent freshman seminar that most people would otherwise not be exposed to. It allows people to learn about an interesting subject while simultaneously teaching people to think on their feet in response to comments made by peers in class, and also teaches the basics of persuasive essay writing. There are two essays for the midterm and the final, the rest of the work done for the class is reading and in-class discussion."
