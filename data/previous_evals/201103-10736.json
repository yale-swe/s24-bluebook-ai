    "Yes. The class is wonderful. A reasonable amount of reading and writing, a wonderful syllabus with a fantastic professor. Gets you to think not just about the course material but about literary study as a field and education in general.",
    "The course is an elaborate response to Plato's accusations against poetry in Book X of his Republic; in other words, it takes on different prose works throughout history which defend poetry's place in society and, eventually, in academia (once science started asserting itself). It's a large-ish seminar in which Fry does most of the talking, but that's fine with everybody, because he is astoundingly knowledgeable. It could be improved by SOME sort of required assignment that isn't a full-fledged essay, part-way through the semester."

    "Dramatically! I am an undergraduate, and it was my first experience with a grad seminar, with literary criticism, and with Matthew Arnold, the subject of my 25-page paper. The paper was a transformative experience, as was keeping up in seminar."
