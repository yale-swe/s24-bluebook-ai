   "question_text": "Looking back on this course, what is your overall assessment of the course:  What are its strengths and weaknesses, and in what ways might it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This class is advertised as a beginning-level physiology class for people without an extensive biology background, but it felt much higher-level during lecture. I learned some new things, but lots of the information went over my head because topics were taught very quickly. It would have helped me if she had gone over the simple basics of all the systems before jumping into the specific processes.",
    "Might be improved with a little more structure.",
    "I wish I could have learned more basic physiology in this class. All the focus was on what seemed to be specific and peripheral topics in physiology without enough focus on the foundations. This lead me to be confused or lost most of the class, and thus I don't think I learned much physiology at all.",
    "not really sure why I need to take it, but it's fun.",
    "Good use of time in class - 1st half was lecture, 2nd half was normally discussion.",
    "This course was excellent for someone who's never taken a physiology course (yours truly).Strengths:1. Clarity, coherence, and depth of material and instruction.2. Professor's communication skills and preparedness -- truly outstanding!!Weaknesses:None that the professor could change (eg, ignorant students tend to babble on).",
    "It's a difficult course to teach with so many levels of education of physiology, because there are doctors and then also first year graduate students that literally know nothing. For a few of us it is certainly above our heads, and it was a difficult course, but that's hard to balance with physicians who know everything already.I LOVED the panels, and the in-class projects were due, but the disorganization was a little frustrating. We never knew what we were in for, and that's a not good feeling when you're in grad school and literally have to have ever moment of your life planned.Suggestions would be advanced notice for the project, like 'here is what we're doing next time', just a little fyi, so we can sort of prepare to be in the mood to work well with others (not always capable in the afternoon after 6 hours of class). Also, following a syllabus would be really helpful, and if the syllabus is changed, then we could like make a new syllabus or update it or something. Just little 5 minute things to keep us structured.",
    "The material for the course is very interesting but the class is a little unorganized. The lectures do not cater to students who have no previous experience with biology. Rather, it seems to be taught more to professionals.",
    "I don't feel as though I learned much from this class. It is a hard class to teach, given the range of knowledge of the students -- ranging from never having taken a biology class to practicing clinicians. I fell somewhere in between and I often felt lost during the lectures. The take-home assignments didn't exactly drive home the material; the answers came straight from our notes, readings, and outside sources but I didn't always truly understand it.",
    "I enjoyed how much Cathy linked everything together. She would often refer back to other physiological systems and would give a big picture public health perspective on physiology. The course material did sometimes feel like it was over my head because it was so much detail and a lot of physiological terminology. The weekly assignments seemed like a little too much. I enjoyed doing them, but having write-ups due every week added quite a bit of anxiety to my schedule. It might have been more helpful if we could choose which weeks we turned them in or if they were every other week or something of the like.",
    "I would have preferred a class that taught more systemic physiology. Many of us have not had physiology or have taken it years ago. It would be helpful to have a text or some review questions. I feel like I had to teach myself the physiology in writing the perspectives before we had lecture each week. I also feel like I walked away from the course not learning too much in terms of physiology.",
    "Strength: we had the ability to take the information in any perspective that we wanted to.Weakness: Not as structured as I would have imagined. Regardless, I did learn a lot.",
    "This was one of the best classes that I have take at Yale. It was a great combination on my interest and the curriculum was incredibly interdisciplinary. The topics and assignments that were covered were stimulating, interesting, and current.",
    "The course was a great review of physiology as it applies to Public Health.",
    "You have weekly assignments (a two page writeup) that allow you to explore any topic within a certain body system. These assignments can be very time consuming but they allow you to explore your interests. Many interesting topics within physiology are presented including current hot topics\/debates, but the class may be confusing at times. Students range from those with no physiology experience to doctors. This creates an interesting learning environment but also creates a large learning curve for those less familiar with physiology."

   "comments": [
    "Instructor: Catherine Yeckel \u00a0Weakness: Bringing the language down to a level that everyone can understand.",
    "Instructor: Catherine Yeckel \u00a0She obviously really loves the subject, which helps make it even more interesting for the student.",
    "Instructor: Catherine Yeckel \u00a0Professor Yeckel is extremely intelligent, and as a result, she sometimes brushes over points that some of us do not understand. She is very willing to answer questions, however, and she even scheduled multiple review sessions for people who needed to catch up or understand things better. Her grading is very fair because her main goal is to have students learn more about something they're interested in and to explore it further.",
    "Instructor: Catherine Yeckel \u00a0Excellent and very knowledgable! Very receptive to feedback and very very nice!",
    "Instructor: Catherine Yeckel \u00a0Prof. Yeckel was really enthusiastic and always super friendly and willing to help in any way she could. I wish however, that the class could have been better organized and that we could have learned more intro material as opposed to a scattering of more complicated topics.",
    "Instructor: Catherine Yeckel \u00a0Cathy Yeckel loves Physiology, and we love that she loves it! I've never seen one professor just love the subject matter so much. She's very enthusiastic and very helpful. She's very responsive to her students and will help them understand the material at any cost. Great teacher!",
    "Instructor: Catherine Yeckel \u00a0wonderful and helpful instructor who knows the course material exceptionally well.",
    "Instructor: Catherine Yeckel \u00a0Enthusiastic, supportive, willing to help, passionate.",
    "Instructor: Catherine Yeckel \u00a0Professor Yeckel is a sincerely dedicated teacher and scientist with an appreciation for the forest (ie,applied public health) and the trees (ie, research).She's a real asset to her students -- always being available to help clarify or further the materials as needed (note: she did a very nice job of teaching a class with a wide range of physiology knowledge).So glad I got to take Physiology with her.",
    "Instructor: Catherine Yeckel \u00a0Dr. Yeckel is fantastically enthusiastic about her work, and MAN is she intelligent. This enthusiasm is a vital asset, as the subject matter is neither straight-forward nor easy to comprehend.",
    "Instructor: Catherine Yeckel \u00a0Professor Yeckel is amazing. She is passionate and knowledgeable about the structure she teaches, she is a great professor and an animate lecturer, and she teaches an incredibly broad and in-depth course with a wide variety of student knowledge. Not only does she do her own research while keeping up with what's 'hot' in the public health world, but she is approachable, great to talk to, and gives great advice. Favorite professor this semester.",
    "Instructor: Catherine Yeckel \u00a0Dr. Yeckel is extremely knowledgeable and passionate about the material. Her enthusiasm while teaching the course engages students to learn beyond the scope of the classroom.",
    "Instructor: Catherine Yeckel \u00a0The instructor was great -- knowledgeable, encouraging and responsive, and sensitive to the fact that we all had differing levels of expertise. However, I often felt lost during the lectures. She used terminology that I didn't understand and talked quickly and moved very quickly through the slides.",
    "Instructor: Catherine Yeckel \u00a0Cathy is a very knowledgeable instructor and did a wonderful job explaining complex material in a simplistic way. She encouraged students to look at physiology from their own perspective - in my case, from a social and behavioral science perspective - and to not worry about understanding all the minute details. She was very responsive and gave great feedback for each of the assignments.",
    "Instructor: Catherine Yeckel \u00a0Dr. Yeckel is very approachable and very eager to help students. I appreciate how much she wants us to learn based on our own interests, but I feel like the course as a whole can be catered better to those who may not have much of a background on systemic physiology. It would be helpful to explain things in more layman terms. Acronyms and other terms that aren't commonly used could be clarified more often.",
    "Instructor: Catherine Yeckel \u00a0Knowledgeable in the material.",
    "Instructor: Catherine Yeckel \u00a0Dr. Yeckel is a very enthusiastic professor. She has the ability to make dense information interesting and exciting for students.",
    "Instructor: Catherine Yeckel \u00a0Dr. Yeckel is one of the most enthusiastic, spirited, inspiring, and down to earth professors that I have ever had the pleasure of working with. Not only was she an incredible motivator but was also a great mentor.",
    "Instructor: Catherine Yeckel \u00a0This instructor does an excellent job engaging students from a variety of backgrounds. The class discussions are uniformly stimulating and interesting. This instructor lectures in a clear and concise format.",
    "Instructor: Catherine Yeckel \u00a0Dr Yeckel is an energized, engaging instructor and did an absolutely fantastic job delivering this course.",
    "Instructor: Catherine Yeckel \u00a0Dr. Yeckel is very knowledgeable and enthusiastic, which comes forth in her teaching. She only wants people to learn. She makes the class very interesting and is very open to helping people outside of the classroom.",
    "Instructor: Catherine Yeckel \u00a0Great listener and easy to speak to if you had any questions regarding the class"

   "comments": [
    "Good prep for a med school type class.",
    "Yes, I would recommend the class, you pick up some truly interesting facts about how the human body works.",
    "I would recommend this class to people who have some working knowledge of biology or physiology because as a beginner, it was hard for me to keep up during lecture. Still, it's a good class, and Professor Yeckel is willing to help you if you need it.",
    "Not as much hard science as you might think, but a useful base in physiology. You probably get more out of it if you already know the subject matter.",
    "This class was pleasant, and not a lot of work, however, if someone is interested in actually learning physiology, I wouldn't recommend it.",
    "yeah, if you want a fun course with a very dedicated teacher, take the course.but if you really want to take another class, I wouldn't take it. You could use your time to be productive in other classes.",
    "If you want to understand major systems in the body and their complex interplay, take this course.",
    "A lot of people take it for an elective, so there are a wide variety of diverse individuals in the class with different specialties. You learn a lot from your peers in this course, you do group projects, and do panels. So don't take it if you don't like talking and discussing in front of people. Every week there is a little 2 page research paper about your choice, and so it's great because you can really focus on researching your own interests, and finding out more about areas that YOU want to find out more about, and then report them to your classmates. She also does amazing projects like writing a public health campaign and working towards research funding.",
    "Physiology provides an understanding of functions in the body that lead to illness. It is a very stimulating class, but without an understanding of physiology the class is difficult to understand.",
    "I don't think I would recommend this course as a way of truly learning about the physiological systems because I don't think I learned very much. But if you're looking for a course where you can focus on your own interests (which you can do with the once-a-week essays we had to write) and learn a little bit about physiology without it being too work-heavy, then I would recommend this course.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student, with the caveat that if you do not come from a biological sciences background, it will take some extra work to understand what is going on during lectures. It is an excellent course in understanding how different public health problems affect specific physiologic functions and is a great backdrop for understanding the intersection between public health and medicine.",
    "It is a good review of physiology. If you have never taken a previous physiology course it is not one that delves into great detail but a good course to refresh memories about specific systems and their integration with the body.",
    "This is a course that should be required for all Public Health Students.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student interested in gaining or refreshing his or her knowledge of physiology. Even for students with a background in physiology and other sciences, Dr. Yeckel presents course material in novel ways. I recommend this course without hesitation.",
    "I would strongly recommend this course to any Public Health professional student because of the enriching educational experience that is obtained.",
    "Yes I would recommend it since it helps connect the individual health issues to larger public health topics, and discusses new experimental tools used in physiology"
