    "Intensive French is intensive. You meet five days a week, MWF for 2 hours, TTh for 1 hour. Each week you have workbook exercises, a short composition, and a test. It's not as bad as it sounds; the class is so fast-paced that infrequent tests would cover way too much material.In class, you learn by watching a French video series from the 80s (it's called French in Action, check it out on YouTube) and practicing the relevant vocab\/grammar from each lesson in class. You'll have to speak a lot in class, and you won't use very much English. The course is immersive, which definitely helps you learn quickly. If you enjoy learning languages, you'll love this class. Prof Sherak is an absolute angel - very understanding, always willing to give extra help.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS! Yes, it's double the work, but you are receiving 2 credits for it and that's no reason not to take it. It requires commitment, but you will NOT BE LET DOWN! I came in knowing like, 3 phrases, and after just 4 months feel comfortable sending emails in French, and would easily be able to have a nice conversation in French. It is so, so, so worth it. I have learned four languages in my lifetime and French has without a doubt been the one I had the most fun time learning. Madame Sherak is INCREDIBLE! There are hardly words to describe how thankful I am for having taken this class.",
    "Taking Intensive French was one of the best decisions I've made in my time at Yale. Intensive French was also one of the most difficult courses I've ever taken, if not the most difficult. Imagine climbing K2, most days, that's what it felt like. BUT-- listen to this, don't be dissuaded just yet-- I left the course knowing how to read, speak and write all of the verb tenses in addition to learning all the essential structures of French grammar. I've been able to draft e-mails to potential employers in France. I speak French better than I speak Spanish and, that's saying something, as I've been studying Spanish for over four years. Point being, this class is hard because language is subtle and French is perhaps the most subtle language of all. I think learning this language is a very rewarding pursuit. I think taking this course is one of the best ways to do that.",
    "This course is hard. Like, really hard. But if you're up for the challenge, I can't imagine a better way to learn the language (short of actually living in a French-speaking country).",
    "French 125 provided a rigorous and thorough introduction to the French language. The daily class meetings were important for making consistent strides toward proficiency. The immersive approach and focus on listening to and speaking the language can be challenging and requires significant commitment, but provide rapid results."
