    "Expanding beyond just environmental studies will be great!",
    "Q 11- Average course rating. Difficult because the idea behind the course was a really good one and I was very excited after the first few lectures to see where it went. I and many others were a bit disappointed though with several of the presentations and did not come away feeling like we learned as much as in other courses. Certain guest lecturers were really well prepared, gave interesting and informative lectures, and some great insight to students. Others did not have very good presentation skills and lost the attention of the majority of students very quickly; both their subject matter and presentation were very difficult to engage with. Some lecturers gave very useful advice, others seemed to repeat vague overtones that were not particularly helpful for students who wanted to get past the overview. As a one credit who attended almost all session, I don't feel like I took away as much as I could have from this course. Perhaps screening lecturers before hand, getting outside perspective on their presenting ability, and a broader spectrum of personalities might relate to students a bit better.",
    "Q11 Below average because while certain presenters were highly valuable and provided clear, concise information that can be used outside of their presentation, others were completely unable to hold students attention and often talked in vagaries that did not provide many tangible takeaways. The course started out with great potential and some guest lecturers lived up to the ambitious billing, but many did not.",
    "This course nearly sent me into conniptions every week: I could not have been more disappointed by the lack of diversity of perspective, the constant tapping of networks and personal connections, and what I saw as the singular definition of \"success.\" One overarching message of the class was that it's entirely possible to \"structure success\" if you already have access to powerful networks and capital, especially if you are an upper-class, educated white male (or his progeny\/spouse).",
    "Chris Sawyer was great. Every time he got up to speak, he had something useful and usually important to say. But most of the time in the course was given to speakers, and they were very uneven. Some of them were really knowledgeable, and conveyed that knowledge well. And some of them were just all about themselves.",
    "Peter Crane did not instruct the class. Chris Sawyer should practice brevity when delivering class material.",
    "Obviously the coursework is very minimal, but the pace of the class is at times unbearably slow. 2 Straight hours of lecture that late in the evening is really difficult.",
    "My interests are conservation and development, and I hope to work in an NGO in the future. I took the course because it seemed interesting to learn about how organizations should work, so I could evaluate organizations I could work for in the future. However, it really wasn't that helpful.",
    "2. There were no out-of-class assignments 8. 9. 10. Did Dean Crane ever teach in this class? 8. 9. 10. Sawyer is a talker. Even when we had amazing guest speakers, he always had to throw his (20 minute) 2 cents in. 11. There are ways to teach management. SOM has it down to a science. This was not it. This was haphazard at best. A bunch of rich, white people telling war stories about their glory days. 12. Don't take this class. Take a class at SOM that offers real structure, class discussion, and applied case studies.",
    "Most of the questions were not applicable to the course, as taken for 1 credit.",
    "While the concept of the class was very good, overall I thought the course could have been tightened up a bit. I felt like the quality of speakers in regards to the usefulness for the audience was a bit uneven. Some were excellent, while others I think missed the mark. I would have liked to see some \"practical\" assignments to be worked on in groups, perhaps developing and critiquing a mission statement, going through a theory of change exercise, an exercise featuring an overview of budgeting or financial statement analysis, etc. to have some more concrete takeaways.",
    "Didn't feel that Peter Crane was the instructor which is why I didn't rank him as such.",
    "It's hard to rate Dean Crane as an instructor, as he was seldom there. Mr. Sawyer led the class. The class was a speaker series, so most instruction from Mr. Sawyer was limited to his introductions and facilitation of speakers and questions, which he did well.",
    "The 3 credit coursework was far more valuable than the lectures. I don't think I would have gotten much out of it if I was only doing the 1 credit option.",
    "Very useful class to build leadership",
    "This course had one perk- access to a wide array of speakers and professionals. Other than that is was mostly a waste of time, and incredibly frustrating with undercurrents of sexism, racism and classism. This course single handedly cast a negative experience on my first semester at FES and the politics behind how the school allocates money and resources. Valuable lessons that seemed to sprout up: if you want to be successful marry rich; people who come from money become successful; those in the upper class will continue to deal in business with the upper class. Many of the speakers could not relate their work back to the environment or importance of this field. They were all great people but showed little diversity in thought, background, or life experience (ie- they were all white, rich americans). Sawyer seemed oblivious to the needs of his audience, to the sexist comments he was making and his interactions with female speakers and he continually held the class past allotted time. It seems that he was not teaching this course for the students. This course served only as a showcase for his connections and the 'wealth' of his friends. I strongly advise future students not to take this course if it is repeated in the same way.",
    "I felt that this class was only valuable for those who were getting into the nitty, gritty of starting up a non-profit organization. For the rest of us it did not feel relevant to go over such details without context particularly if one is not going to take on such an endeavor.",
    "The course was basically: \"How to start\/run a non-profit for rich white Americans from the southeast\" Many of the lessons failed to account for the privileged position that the speaker had in order to ever be doing what they were doing in the first place. It is easier to fundraise when your dad is Ted Turner than when you are a first-generation college grad from the south side of Chicago. The lessons aren't the same, and the ones we received often weren't widely applicable.",
    "Structuring Success was a valuable course with practical tips and advice from experts on starting and running and non-profit or business.",
    "Frances Sawyer did a great job helping facilitate and occasionally teach this class.",
    "Chris Sawyer was very invested in this course and seemed to be very committed to helping as many students as possible. It was great to have Dean Crane involved, but he wasn't as involved as Chris Sawyer.",
    "Professor Sawyer offered an interesting perspective on the course material and brought top-flight speakers in to present on various aspects of non-profit leadership. For a technically, science-oriented person as myself, this was a great introduction to these topics that I otherwise wouldn't have received at F&ES. I liked that there was a 1 credit option, which allowed me to add this to an otherwise full schedule. I liked Professor Sawyer's presentations in particular. He has a lot of experience and I appreciated how he balanced his home life and his work. It was discouraging that so many speakers implied or said that you can't have a family\/home\/work balance in this line of work. Chris, however, seem to strike this balance, and I think he can be a good role model for many of us who see a full life as more than just work. The flaw with the course, from my perspective, is that it assumes a particular type of success - that of building an organization. This is probably relevant for many of us, but I think at least the recognition of other ways of being a leader (cultural, in a community, etc.) would have strengthened the material presented."

    "There were about 3 interesting classes out of the whole semester. It was great to hear from FES grads who are out there starting nonprofits, and it was interesting to see the projects my classmates were working on. I also enjoyed and learned a lot from Wendy Paulson's presentation.",
    "Resources\/speakers",
    "- Access to visiting speakers, though this opportunity could have been made more explicit. - Instruction from a variety of professionals. - The opportunity to work with an organization to help write their business plan.",

    "Some of the guest speakers were great. Some honestly were incredibly boring and brought no new information.",
    "Certain lecturers had engaging ideas and gave students concrete, usable advice that could help inform future business endeavors. Emphasis on concrete advice rather than general recommendations, many of these were useful but ended up being repeated frequently.",
    "I thought that the final night of student presentations and feedback was the most dynamic, practical, and interesting part of the semester.",
    "We got to listen to great weekly talks from a variety of players in the environmental movement.",
    "The opportunity to meet successful professionals in their fields and certain lecturers had great, concrete advice to give students.",

    "The course gave me overview of how to be successful in this competitive world",
    "I enjoyed when Jack Saywer came in and talked about the legal aspects of starting an organization. I thought that was most helpful.",
    "Chris Sawyer's comments, and some of the individual speakers",
    "Four speakers were useful to myself: Ted White, Fred Rich, Vincent Stanley and Bryan Garcia.",
    "Good perspectives and guest lectures.",
    "It was fantastic to hear candid presentations from such high leadership in the various organizations that were represented. I liked how each presenter was tasked with discussing a different topic regarding structuring and launching a successful organization.",
    "There were a few interesting speakers. It was nice to get to interact with the speakers, although we were actually almost never given that opportunity.",
    "The opportunity to met so many people with great careers and that Prof. Swayer was able to bring them to us. Great combinations of speakers and great lessons.",
    "I think this course is very valuable because it provides basic knowledge of how to make positive change in the world by either (1) creating our own organizations, or (2) how to make existing organizations better.",
    "The various examples of what has worked for different leaders in a variety of professional settings.",
    "The visiting presenters from various organizations.",
    "Some of the speakers that were brought in, such as Wendy Paulson and Vincent Stanley, were wonderful and provided tangible advice and insight into the complexities of working within environmental organizations and companies.",
    "Some of the speakers were quite engaging. It was interesting to learn about conservation case studies from the Southern US, a site for conservation activity I hadn't much discussed and didn't know much about before this course. It was also a very nice study hall time.",
    "Gave me a chance to work on a project I'm passionate about. Great feedback from Chris about the project, kept the ball moving well.",

    "The speakers are successful people, so it is interesting to get insight into their world and what they have to do every day in order to achieve their goals.",
    "Exposure to top notch expertise in the non-profit field. The course was well organized and touched on all aspects of successfully starting and running a non-profit organization. I really enjoyed the last class meeting and the opportunity to see how students in the class had developed their ideas for starting their own organization.",
    "High quality guest speakers",
    "The speakers were great. They were always well-prepared and addressed material that was specifically relevant to the course topic of the week. All had many years of experience in non-profit management and\/or business, and they were invariably willing to share their knowledge with students.",
    "Good exposure to a diverse array of issues with non-profit management.",
    "Many of the speakers were excellent, and they were capable of sharing their experiences in a way that imparted knowledge. This class offered more practical and real world examples of how to build an NGO than many classes at FES.",
    "The fact that the structure was based on a long series of different guest lecturers provided us with many different perspectives. While there were some that I valued more than others, it seemed that for the most part different students had different favorite speakers.",
    "I liked Professor Sawyer's presentations and comments. See above. The attorney (Jack...) was exceptional. He was a very clear communicator and the content of his presentation is critical for most of us."

   "question_text": "What aspects of this course need the most improvement?",
   "comments": [
    "I would have liked to see more younger guest speakers who were in early stages of their careers. I'm concerned about things like how to get started establishing a network, how to make the first steps to getting access to funding, and how to have my idea be taken seriously by people who might act as gatekeepers to resources. Many of the lectures seem like they will be helpful once I reach a fairly senior position in an organization, but aren't as helpful as far as advice on how to get there.",
    "The speakers were very repetitive. I don't need to be told in ten different ways that good relationships and a clear purpose are keys to success. There's more to a successful nonprofit and social mission than a good board of advisors\/directors, but the latter is almost ALL we ever heard about. I kept going to each session in the hopes that THIS one would be different and informative, but I was almost always wrong. Mr. Sawyer asked us to \"respect the speakers' time\", but he himself habitually failed to respect anyone's time. He gave unnecessarily long and rambling speaker introductions and would run over the end of the class period with another long and rambling PRE-introduction to next week's class. Part of his introduction was always an admonition that we students should be abjectly grateful for this opportunity. OK, I'm grateful, yes, but I'm also paying handsomely for the privilege. I felt like I was hearing an over-promising sales pitch every class session. Perhaps it was different for the 3-credit students.",
    "More outside reading \/ practical advice",
    "- Greater diversity in speakers. Virtually all older white males. - Greater opportunity to launch a project. - Class was poorly advertised as it gave the impression students would have an opportunity to launch a project.",
    "This class needs to make room for people who 1) aren't male 2) aren't white and 3) are operating at varying levels within the non-profit world. too much emphasis was put on folks whose budgets are huge and experience is many years. Inclusion of mid-level employees, and folks with less money would give a more rounded class.",
    "A greater variety of socio-economic and racial backgrounds in the speakers would have been appreciated. I think almost everyone was white and wealthy. What if you're not white and wealthy before starting your business?",
    "Lecturer presentations and content. It was unclear if lecturers were chosen for their presenting ability or their connections. As said earlier, certain ones were so dry and their content vague enough that many students could not engage in their sessions despite being physically present.",
    "(1) Diversifying the speakers to include, particularly to include more women and people of color. (2) More clearly linking lectures from week to week. (3) More opportunity for participation during class hours (perhaps a short workshop during each evening the class meets).",
    "Content sometimes felt repetitive. Some speakers tended to focus on their accomplishments, rather than the tools they used to get there.",
    "Lecturers may need to be screened prior to presenting. If they were, perhaps outside input on their presenting ability might be helpful. Although all were leaders in their field, some were far more capable than others at translating useful advice to students. There was a lot of presentation, but much of it felt like talk and several sessions left students with very few concrete takeaways they could realistically use.",
    "This course stood front and center in terms of public attention (online presence, the Dean's contribution, buzz) and budget. I was dismayed that there was such an underwhelming lack of diversity of opinion, background, and experience-- in entirely transparent ways, it all always came back to Mr. Sawyer and his connections. I value and respect that perspective-- but it feels far too much like nepotism, and when considering the budget allocated toward this class (that could have been distributed more equitably among other courses that achieved more) it was troubling. With a few notable exceptions, this course only served to reinforce extant stereotypes: white Yalies start with privilege and stay on top; women leaders are brought in to speak about volunteerism and appeasing people for fundraising, but not top-level or critical operational management decisions; success is uniformly qualified by prestige, power, and net worth; and that if you (can afford to) lavishly take care of your friends and network, it will come back to you in good ways. Further, these stereotypes are precisely what some of us are working to counter, and what the FES administration claims to want to promote. By celebrating and supporting this course so widely (and deeply), this course feels like a serious misstep in FES's purported goal of supporting a more diverse community.",
    "If this class is taught again next year I would like more technical skills such as how to write a business plan or basics of accounting. I see this class as an opportunity to share with forestry students the basics of what we would learn at SOM.",
    "A diversity of views from people of different backgrounds and paths.",
    "Instructor moderation of speakers needs to be shorter.",
    "Time management. Often the classes went over on time. The \"lectures\" were incredibly slow. There's little continuity from one class to another in content.",
    "While this might be a sort of painful truth about the world, it seemed like most of the folks who presented were very wealthy and had the financial latitude to take either the time or money to launch these projects\/initiatives\/organizations. The flipside is that I think most top leadership is wealthy, so that might just be a harsh lesson of the course. I know it was discouraging to many students though, who are wanting to launch something upon graduating and don't have a financial safety net.",
    "The main instructor, Chris Sawyer, is not concise or very clear in his lectures.",
    "The people invited were celebrities in their fields, but it was not academically rigorous. This is a field full of theory, application and case studies, and we got basically none of it.",
    "Would have been nice if the dean actually showed up to some of the classes. He kind of oversold it, calling it \"the dean's course\" and then came to one class.",
    "the class always ended later than expected. People with family obligations should leave before the class ended, which was pretty annoying.",
    "Prof Sawyer could work on limiting the talking to important points.",
    "The types of people who were brought to class were all very \"similar\". At times it was difficult to relate, especially as a student who won't have a lot of the advantages that many of the presenters had. Not to say they didn't all have to work extremely hard to get to where they are today, but it was often times difficult to make a personal connection with the guests.",
    "Some of the concepts being discussed were high level and seemingly general for those of us that haven't participated on Boards or have minimal experience with a Board structure. I think there needs to be more discussion of these concepts and their connection to our next steps in life. This need was evident in some of the question sessions where the speaker seemed unprepared to answer these types of questions raised by students.",
    "I was under the impression that the course was going to be much more applied and concentrated. I expected to get actual skills from the class, but the talks were vague and I didn't feel like I learned anything that I couldn't have read in a book. I was also disappointed at the lack of diversity in the speakers.",
    "Hoo boy. This course made big promises it failed to keep. We were told that we were going to learn how to operate our own organizations, a bold aim for a 1 credit. However, the course was a speaker series, so any learning that was going to take place was left in the variably capable hands of the speakers. Almost all of them where people who had lucrative careers as lawyers or what have you before founding xyz organization (or magazine) - not a highly relevant career trajectory for most of us FESers, and fairly one note to boot. If FES wants to offer a course that actually teaches us how to run non-profits, I would scrap this format entirely.",
    "I thought the lectures weren't directly related to the actual work we were putting together. Also, just about every speaker was a rich white Southerner, more diversity would have been nice. There were also a bunch of speakers who were just doing good things with their family's fortune, which is fine, but doesn't really help those of us who weren't born with millions.",
    "Can't see any so far",
    "Few speakers were not able to adequately answer questions",
    "Everything: diversity of panelists in terms of race, work experience, sex, background, class; more forethought to what 'success' is and what lessons they actually want the students to walk away with.",
    "The quality of each session depended on the guest speaker. However, nearly all of them delivered learning points in a clear and illustrative manner.",
    "The introduction and conclusion of each class can be shortened to 10 minutes each.",
    "I think it should have been made more clear who the class was structured for form the beginning and not marketed as something that was valuable for most. I also felt that more thought could have been put into finding the speakers - it was a very homogenous group.",
    "The course has little diversity in the speakers. They are wealthy, white, Americans, mostly from the Southeast. They are in similar social circles and have little insight on what it is like to be poor running an organization or to be running an organization somewhere else on earth (or the U.S.).",
    "There were a couple of speakers that were not quite up to the level of the others. In particular the discussion on how a board works with the organization. Might want to rethink a couple of the speakers.",
    "The diversity of speakers (in terms of work background and field, but also personal background, geographic location, race, etc.) needs to be improved. Secondly, I would have liked to have had more opportunities to interact with my classmates. We only did this a couple of times during the course, principally in the last class session. It would be helpful to have a component that allowed us to interact at least 3-4 times during the semester since the class itself represented a range of experience in managing non-profits and businesses.",
    "This course seemed really great at the beginning of the semester and then steadily went downhill. I love the IDEA of the class, don't get me wrong, it's just that the execution of the class was extremely poor. I appreciate what Chris was trying to do but I had a number of concerns with how it was taught: 1) We don't need to be reminded every class of what an honor it is for us to be listening to Speaker X or how useful we will find this class. Let us judge its value. 2) Many speakers did not seem to be well-informed of who their audience was. More customization to our interests and fewer biblical references would be a good start. 3) The lack of diversity of speakers was astounding. Not just their ethnicity\/income level but also their experiences. Why was everyone rich?!?! Raising money for a non-profit, for example, is vastly different if you're not Ted Turner's daughter. 4) Some speakers were not particularly good lecturers or Q&A participants. For a lecture-based class, speakers need to be chosen with this in mind. Would be great if we could divide someone who's good at their job from someone who can actually give a lecture. 5) Chris Sawyer is a very nice, clearly successful man but his lecturing was incredibly rambly. Concise and organized lectures are really great when class runs during the dinner timeslot. 6) I appreciate that this class was designed to be a large class open to many folks but I think, given its goals, a small class with close discussions with visiting speakers would have been far more effective.",
    "Simply having students attend a lecture once a week is not constructive enough. The course didn't always seem to have a clear focus because some speakers told war stories, others tried to explain the how and why of their organizations' mission, and others spoke broadly on leadership. For a more integrated, successful class I would require some sort of homework, journaling, discussion section, or other avenue to make students talk about the issues at hand. It would help the class feel as though it were building towards something instead of being only a collection of interesting speakers.",
    "There were a few speakers that, while they might have impressive resumes and skills, they were not great at speaking about those issues in this type of setting.",
    "I do not see myself as working in the leadership of nonprofits. It was not altogether clear to me when I signed up for the course that this was the focus. I think a clearer articulation of the courses assumptions and goals would be helpful. That said, I'm glad I took the course for 1 credit."

    "I think this course loosely fits my program at the Div school; but I did not take this course simply because I thought it would fit, I wanted to expand beyond the norm and so this course was a great fit.",
    "It doesn't fit but it was an interesting diversion.",
    "This course has great potential, FES has some but not many basic business courses that are accessible to students with no background in business. It fits this niche and would be a fantastic course if a bit better structured.",
    "Students from a variety of backgrounds can be exposed to leaders in environmental and other business areas. This is theoretically helpful to give non-business and business students alike a firm footing in the field. In practice, however, this was not entirely met although certain lectures such as Patagonia, the alumni startups, and others were very useful in giving students things they can use and consider.",
    "I have a plan to start an NGO and the course taught me how to do it",
    "Though this is not directly related to my studies, learning how to organize and inspire people to work with you is important to know for any profession.",
    "It does not fit in - I just thought it would be interesting to take the course.",
    "The course was pitched as structuring success with a focus on leadership. It was really an introduction to board management without descriptions relating to leadership.",
    "I, of course, would like to be in a leadership position someday within an organization or variety of organizations. I feel that understanding the human element inherent in these roles is very important and this class allows for that element to be presented in an accessible way.",
    "This class did not add to the value of my education. Environmentalists are notorious at treating management as an art rather than a science, focusing on the issue rather than the business. This class just reinforced that. It did not help great a new generation of savvy operators, just sloppy, haphazard idealists.",
    "It was interesting to learn more about different organizations, since I am not interested in creating an NGO, this really did not fit into my program.",
    "I think I would like to build my organization some day.",
    "I have worked for a couple of non-profits and have aspirations to potentially lead one in the future. I can see some of the issues presented in class being relevant at that time. I also think it is helpful just for working with non-profits and understanding the power dynamics that exist.",
    "I doesn't really. Ah well.",
    "The three credit version of this class offered me the opportunity to work on and get feedback about a project I am trying to start. That was incredibly valuable for me.",
    "Getting to know the story of the guest speakers, having them provide answers to questions related to leadership was a good way to strengthen my leadership skills.",
    "This was not helpful at all except for the 2 contacts I made.",
    "It did not fit into my overall learning. I did not feel there were any take away messages that i can take with me and use in my other course work. I did enjoy hearing the endeavors of my colleagues.",
    "I thought I would learn valuable business and management skills from this course that would help me. I was wrong.",
    "I left the class feeling like I now know enough to try to develop my own non-profit organization.",
    "I think it's critical to have practitioners like so many of the guest speakers come to FES. It offers an important perspective on how to accomplish the theoretical goals we dream up at FES. A focus on how to run an organization is nice addition to the curriculum.",
    "I have an idea of my overall goals in this field, but I'm not sure what form reaching those goals will take. There's a good chance that it will require me to start my own non-profit or NGO or figure out how to work on my objectives within an existing entity, in which case, the skills from this course will come in handy.",
    "It was accessory to my program. I took it because I like Chris Sawyer's way of teaching and I thought it would be a good intro to the topics covered, and it would save me from having to find time in my otherwise booked-up schedule for classes like that."

The billing of the course fit this very well and I feel I did get some of this but not as much as I was expecting.",

    "I hope to start an organization in the future. The skills in this course will help me do so effectively.",
    "I thought it would be about working together and thinking about leadership in terms of surrounding yourself with people who will help you go high and do more. I thought it would help me think about the type of organization that i would like to work in and how i could fit into the structure in order to be successful. I did not plan on building an NGO board anytime soon.",

    "As I mentioned above, I was a little disappointed that very little of the discussion addressed early-career concerns.",
    "No. I had high expectations for the course but they were disappointed. The course was totally oversold by Mr. Sawyer's initial \"pitch\".",
    "yup",
    "Below expectations.",
    "No. I did learn quite a bit from certain presenters, but was disappointed overall with what I felt I took away from this course. More concrete advice would be useful, a lot of things were talked about but it didn't feel like there were as many takeaways as there could have been.",
    "No. As previously stated, some lectures were very valuable and did fit the intent of the course. These should have been the norm not the exception. It was difficult to tell if lecturers were chosen for their ability to really contribute to the course or based on their connections. They may have all fit the intent of sharing leaders of the field with students, but the ability to communicate effectively how students could shape their own careers using the lecturer's example was present maybe 50-60% of the time. The concept of this course was fantastic and most students were very excited, but knowing many of them I can safely say many had the same disappointment in the result.",
    "I found Brian Garcia and Jack Sawyer's lectures to be informative and more in-line with my expectations for the course.",
    "Yes, it was awesome",
    "No this course did not meet my expectations because I was expecting to learn more technical skills needed to start an organization. Most of the speakers in this class offered more amorphous information and mostly talked about how they got to the point they are today. Though that is valuable to hear, their talks could have been more helpful to us.",
    "Medium",
    "No.",
    "No. It was too \"startup\" focused.",
    "My expectations were met.",
    "It was not very helpful for me.",
    "No. Not by a long shot.",

    "Yes, and a little bit more. I had the opportunity to listen and learn from professionals valuable advice. Very interesting the last video of the last class.",
    "Yes!",
    "Yes and no. I did gain some ideas that I think are applicable, but I think rather than being new ideas the course served more to reinforce things I had already heard or experienced.",
    "I would have liked to learn more background about the details of how the presenters got from students to board members. Often it seemed as though they were verbally verifying skills that I should put on a resume. None of which were too shocking. But, a presentation on how to express these nuances of an individual would be helpful. In a past writing course, they often quoted \"Show, don't tell.\" And, I think this would be helpful to express and deliver to students seeking such careers. While I would agree that we made it to our current positions because we understand the above mentioned concept. The problem seems to be how to express this in a short window of time to individuals that have drastic differences in perspective from ourselves. Lastly, we could stand to benefit from lectures from individuals who are intermediate on the spectrum from student to successful. For example, how do these individuals fund raise and find support without reputations that precede them? That said, I think the course did meet my expectations and the skills gained will be useful in the future.",
    "For a one credit course, yes. I expected exposure to concepts more than practical skills and that is what I feel I gained. If this course is offered again, I would recommend after each lecture the instructor guide students to which courses- whether in SOM, Law, or FES- would expand on the concepts presented in case students want to learn the topic in more depth.",

    "I was pleased with the work I was able to get done during this course, I think it definitely helped keep my project moving forward.",

    "Very disappointed, didn't feel like I really gained any serious experience and skills that would prepare me for non-profit work.",
    "Not quite. I loved the class, but I wanted more discussion. I know bringing in such high profile speakers means that opening the class to many students is important, but there wasn't nearly enough student discussion or writing on topics to fully utilize the material.",

    "Do not take this course unless it is revamped entirely. Really research the speakers, question Sawyer and Crane on why they are offering this course and what hard skills you will be walking away with. Like a lot of FES- this course is deceptive so do your research.",
    "Only take it for 3 credits if you are really interested in starting\/running your own NGO. Taking it for one credit is still a huge time commitment as the semester progresses and the demands from other classes rise so make sure you are truly interested in the topic; enough to give up this time.",
    "only take it if you are currently starting up an organization. and maybe just meet with Mr. Sawyer.",

    "Look to SOM non-profit classes until FES can redesign this class. Consider the shorter offerings in TSMs, etc. This class ended up feeling like a waste of my time, sadly.",
    "It's worth two hours each week. You'll be exposed to great thinkers and doers. But don't expect to walk out of a lecture knowing how to do something. It's an introduction to various components of leading organizations, but the impetus is on the student to follow up with topics and speakers that interest them.",
    "If you want to create an organization, business, or large project, you'll learn about lots of the needed skills and make some great contacts in this course.",
    "I was under the impression that spending one evening a week in a course wouldn't be tough with my schedule. Turns out, it makes a difference, and several of the last few weeks I felt very stressed about taking that time away from my core courses. I took both evening classes taught by Dean Crane - I think next time I would choose one and leave the other evening open for school work. If this course had been more central to my career path I would consider taking it for 3 credits, mostly to get more time and attention from Chris Sawyer, who has a lot of useful experience in these matters."
