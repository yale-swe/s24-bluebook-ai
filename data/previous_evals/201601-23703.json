    "A very chill directing class focused primarily on hands-on industry advice and figuring out how to get our foot in the door in professional theatre. We spent most of the class drinking coffee and sharing our directing experience with each other. We also presented some scene work in the class and discussed it. Be ready for a very different structure from a traditional Theatre Studies class -- there's much less structure and theory here but, in some ways, a much more honest exploration on what it actually takes to be a director in the real world.",
    "Definitely a great class to take as a junior or senior, serious about the work of directing.",
    "I would absolutely recommend THST 301 for anyone seriously interested in the theater arts, including playwrights, since Jackson works so closely with so many writers in new plays. The class covers a wide range--from the metaphysical to the practical--all in a seamless flow.",
    "Must take if you have the slightest interest in directing."
