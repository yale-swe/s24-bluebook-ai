    "The course offered a great look at energy by technology type.",
    "The only comment I could suggest to improve the content and the pacing of thecourse would be to pick up the pace ever so slightly. Bill does a wonderful job of explaining concepts and the material is carefully selected and excerpted for discussion in class. Still, due to student questions and the seminar setting for the class, delays invariably slow down the pace and some material is cannabalized due to lost time. Just slightly fewer slides--or time allotted specifically for discussion during class-time--might alleviate this time-crunch when the schedule starts to get slightly behind."

    "Question 4: More knowledge could be created from the course if certain topics were given more class time. Devoting one class to the coal industry, for example is an incredibly light treatment of a very complex and deep subject matter. Also, the industrial ecology concepts relevant to these industries were at times lightly applied. Though this was an advanced industrial ecology seminar, I do not feel a great famalairity with how industry ecology provides additional understanding to the parts of the energy industry we studiedThe professor was very accessible and took great effort to provide knowledge to the students.",

    "The course could focus more on industrial ecology and emphasize certain topics be covered. At times, guest speakers or student led discussions were too broad and didn't help create any specific understanding on the importance of integral features of the industries being studied.Feedback on our work would have been helpful. Students received no grades on reading responses, student led roundtables, or our presentations.",
    "Wish there could be more research based discussions.",
    "Lecture pacing- we would run out of time for discussions and round tables.",
    "The student led discussion mostly only took time away from the more content filled lectures and in-lecture discussions. The incentives to participate in the discussion led to some students contributing for the sake of contributing.",
    "Again, maybe a little more structured discussion to prevent the interruptions (all positive) that come during the lecture or presentation.Additionally, although it's hard to keep guest speakers on time and on subject, perhaps a little more careful massaging of the guest speaker's time will prevent overruns and will preserve class-time that guests won't eat into. In my opinion, Professor Ellis' lectures are just as valuable as anything a guest speaker has to say!"

I wouldn't have been able to write such a large report without a teammate's help.The disadvantages were the typical challenges of working with a teammate: differing expectations for the quality of the deliverable, communication challenges, and unexpected events holding up progress and causing delays. Nothing new--just the challenge of working with another person on a co-authored report."
