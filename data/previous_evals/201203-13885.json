   "comments": [
    "The lectures were helpful, but the group readings were monotonous. One or two group readings would be fine, but the value of doing them decreased rapidly. I would have liked an in-depth reading or lecture on study designs\/procedures related to SBS. I was very happy to go through the IRB application process, and the research paper\/presentation were great assignments. However, I don't think the final was particularly valuable. Since so much effort was put into the paper\/presentation (and that's where I felt I learned the most), I think those together should have been the \"final.\"",
    "Getting to do our own research project was a great experience and important preparation. However, I do not think we got a lot out of the group readings.",
    "The course is good, but needs to be more geared towards public health, it primarily focused on psychology, which is an important aspect of social and behavioral sciences, but not the only part. More focus on paper writing, and maybe less on discussing publications, but Joan is already aware that this would be useful and plans to incorporate it next year.",
    "The course has potential but needs a lot of work. It should focus on HOW to do research well instead of being so theoretical. I think students would benefit on learning how to do a systematic literature review, and how to assess whether a source is good quality research. The articles that we review are not all specific to public health, and they don't have to be, but they should be interesting\/somewhat relevant to health issues (and not all psychological).The final project was the best learning experience. I think more class time should be spent on learning how to use SPSS. I don't think exams are the best way to grade for this class, especially the material covered on the final exam.",
    "Too many group readings. I do think they were helpful, but there were just too many. I think 3 would be the maximum I would give. I liked the new format of them too.The big research project we did was interesting and helpful. I don't really think a final is necessary for the class. I put in a lot of time on the final paper and presentation and the final did not seem really that necessary.",
    "Strengths: Provides the opportunity to do a real research project on a topic of your choice (in a group); gives abundant experience in reading research articles, provides the opportunity to learn certain data analysis systems you don't get exposed to in other YSPH courses (like SPSS).Weaknesses: The pace of the class was slow in the beginning. Many YSPH students already have some background in research, or have taken Epidemiology where you learn most of the method design styles, and a lot of the initial basics lectures seemed a little excessive. Also, the readings (especially the group readings, which were mandatory) were very time consuming; I spent much more time on this class than I expected.One critique last year was that the class was on psychology topics, not public health topics; this was still true this year.Ways to improve: Certain lectures (explaining what an experiment is, having us do a qualtrics survey) might not be necessary, especially if most students in the class have taken some YSPH coursework before. Changing lectures to be more discussion based\/interactive would be another way to gauge student knowledge and lead the class in an appropriate direction for thespecific group. Cutting down on the group readings (or specifically choosing short articles) would be nice. Making some of the topics for the week public health based instead of just psychology based would give more options for appropriate articles to choose.",
    "Strengths=1) Making a project throughout the semester. You learn about all the steps of a research project. 2) Writing the prospectus was one of the most useful things, especially since we have to do an almost identical one for the thesis. 3) Learning about APA was also useful since no other class deals with these format issues.Weaknesses= 1) Too many small assignments. The group readings did not seem to contribute much to the course.Improvement= I would have liked to do more readings. For example, instead of learning about community based research through the group readings, a reading that addressed this would have been more useful.",
    "The group reading session is helpful for me to learn so many topics and research methods. Selection of lectures are really thoughtful. But there were too much topics and most of them are just barely touched.",
    "The course is actually very good. It teaches students how to conduct research studies and experiments through surveys."

   "comments": [
    "Instructor: Joan Monin \u00a0It is very apparent that Joan cares about her material and the students in the class. She was always well prepared and very easy to approach with questions\/comments. It was nice to be invited in her lab and have her integrate her research into the course. However, sometimes the assignments did not always seem to link to what we did in class (some assignments seemed superfluous -- group reading--, while others would have been very valuable to discuss more in class -- SPSS analysis\/survey design\/scaled measures).",
    "Instructor: Joan Monin \u00a0Joan is extremely laid back and flexible. She's extremely sensitive to students' needs, and is always there if you need her. She went out of her way to bring out the best in our project.",
    "Instructor: Joan Monin \u00a0Joan Monin is amazing. She is very approachable and open to hearing anything you have to say. She was incredibly helpful with all of the course work and went above and beyond to make herself available to help her students. She asked our opinions on the course about midway through, and took our constructive criticism very well and incorporated our ideas to gear the class more towards aspects we as students felt were important for our education. Joan presented all class information in a way that was easy to understand, but did not dumb anything down for us as Ihave encountered in other classes. As someone with no public health or psychology background, I felt this course was very informative and easy to understand, and also interesting, I genuinely enjoyed the topics we discussed.",
    "Instructor: Joan Monin \u00a0She knows a lot about good research and is always willing to help! Her lecturing needs a little improvement, especially since the material is a little dry and boring",
    "Instructor: Joan Monin \u00a0Prof Monin was really nice and approachable. She was also very eager to help in our projects.",
    "Instructor: Joan Monin \u00a0Strengths: Very enthusiastic about the subject, responsive to e-mails, provides helpful suggestions for your projects, asks for mid-semester feedback and makes changes based on it.Weaknesses: Lectures are difficult to listen to without any interactionImprovements: Make lectures more discussion based. For example, I thought the lecture on survey questions was very helpful; however, I think we would gain more from the lecture if we had a group conversation and brought up our own points on what we thought some issues with survey questions were (with you leading the discussion to make sure we cover all the main points, providing a handout, etc).",
    "Instructor: Joan Monin \u00a0Great! She was very responsive to feedback. She always responded her email in a timely manner. She was available for her students and answered all our questions. She is also a nice person in general so it was nice to go to her class. She provided detailed feedback on our papers so we knew the areas we should improve upon. She learned everyone's name, which is something I really appreciate. She is also very good at encouraging her students.",
    "Instructor: Joan Monin \u00a0She is great. She is always helpful and her schedule is very flexible to meet our needs. She knows every students very well and I think she invested huge effort to design the class.",
    "Instructor: Joan Monin \u00a0Professor Monin was great. She was always nice and helpful."

   "question_text": "How would you summarize this course for a fellow student? Would you recommend it to another student? Why or why not?",
   "comments": [
    "THe course provides an overview of the components of conducting a social\/behavioral health study. I would definitely recommend it to someone who wants to get experience in the IRB and research paper writing processes. I would not recommend it to someone who wants a deep understanding of study methods.",
    "I would recommend the course for the research project. But I do think the course needs to be amended - i.e. eliminate group readings and go over material that will be covered on the tests more thoroughly. Also, I don't think we need to have a final exam, since the final paper was so much work. Justthe midterm would be enough.",
    "I would recommend this course. Although some of the coursework and class discussions can get a little dry, the professor and TA and other students made it fun. Doing an entire research project from idea and hypothesis generation to data collection, data analysis, paper writing, and actually presenting before an audience was an invaluable experience. I had never done the entire process before and I am POSITIVE that will be a helpful experience not only at YSPH, but also in my career.",
    "I would really only take this course if necessary for a requirement. I thinkshe does a good job teaching it, but also just don't think it is necessary unless you have to take it. In some ways, doesn't seem like enough material to fill an entire course.",
    "This is a new course that teaches the process behind running a simple research project. The main project is a group research project (likely survey-based) that you will design and complete within one semester, including gaining IRB approval, analyzing data, etc. There are many small assignments throughout the semester including summarizing\/critiquing research articles and short worksheets.I would suggest this course for a student who wants more education on how to conduct a research project; however, if you have already done a research project in the past or have extensive education ondoing research, this course may be too basic for you.",
    "The class involves a lot of work, but you learn so much in such a short period of time.I would recommend that SBS students take it during their first year since it gives them an introduction to important SBS research concepts. Since you carry out your own research project, you learn about all the different steps involved. After this course, doing the thesis does not seem so scary anymore!",
    "I think it is helpful for students who do not have prior research experiences and want to have a overiew of research methods",
    "Lecture twice per week. Reading assignments and summaries due basically every week. Big research project and writeup due at the end of the semester. Midterm and final-not difficult at all."
