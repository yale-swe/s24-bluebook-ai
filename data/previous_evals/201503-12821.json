    "Overall I very much enjoyed the course, particularly doing the readings and working on the final paper, and I would definitely recommend the course, and the graduate sessions were interesting and useful. My main difficulty with the course is that during the class itself it felt very much directed towards, and directed for the benefit of, undergraduate learning. It was difficult to engage in graduate-level discussion of the interesting issues raised by the readings during the class itself."
