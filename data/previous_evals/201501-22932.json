    "Make sure you have the time to shoot and process 35 rolls of film. If you have a busy semester, do not take this course.",
    "Art 136 is a great into class for anyone remotely interested in photography. It's super fun and one of my favorite classes I've taken.",
    "It's hard. Take it. Totally worth it.",
    "This is a great course to learn basic techniques of film photography and to learn how to view and capture the world in a different manner. I learned an incredible amount in this course, but it is definitely a big time commitment.",
    "An introductory photography class that focuses on 3 main areas: 1) how to take photos 2) how to develop\/print photos, 3) the history of B&W photo. Great class to take if an art major, as it touches on not only photography but other mediums as well, but also great to take if a non-art major (a majority of the class was not and they enjoyed it). I would recommend this course to another student if they are at all interested in art or photo; even if they are not they will most likely be interested by the end of the course. Good stuff!",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. You will not receive a better introduction to photo history or photo techniques in any other art course, and it is a foundational jumping off point before you take almost any two-dimensional course -- take this before any other photography classes\/film classes\/drawing\/painting classes. You will learn so much about light, framing, subject matter, and just the brute amount of time required to really get an art form. This class does have a lot of non-condensable time though -- you really cannot rush the process of developing film because there is a set amount of time required. to make negatives will take 45 minutes. There's nothing you can do. I spent about ten hours outside of class a week, which is manageable and enjoyable, but be forewarned. Take the class though. You absolutely will not regret it."
