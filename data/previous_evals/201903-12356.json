    "How to read efficiently How to read smartly How to look for information in what you're reading the value of footnotes and bibliography how to write a 15 page paper",
    "I definitely learned a lot about the history of Hong Kong and southern China. I wouldn't say it's that comprehensive - even though the professor says you don't need background in Chinese history to take the course... your life will be much better if you do already have academic experience in this field. I wouldn't say I developed any skills. Unless you're already a seasoned history major, you don't gain skills or knowledge pertaining to history as a discipline. There's no real guidance from the professor on how you should be evaluating sources, reading primary\/secondary sources, and developing a historical argument.",
    "I gained a solid understanding of Hong Kong and its historical relationship with China and Guangdong province. The course gives a balanced view of the city and why its politics have become contentious today. If you're interested in modern China or Hong Kong specifically, this class will give you a historical perspective essential to understanding current events amid the conflicting stories you see in the media.",
    "This class gave both broad knowledge and understanding about Hong Kong, China, and its connections. I came in knowing very little about the region, and I left feeling comfortable discussing Hong Kong and China.",
    "I learned a lot more about the border relations in the more distant past. I also become more critical in reading primary sources.",
    "Knowledge about the historical relationship between Hong Kong and China. We learned to write our own independent research paper on the two places",
    "Learned skills for utilizing and analyzing historical sources; gained historical knowledge and context for the region across a variety of topics",
    "I learned a lot about China, Hong Kong, and their complicated interactions and past.",
    "I learned about Hong Kong and China's shared cross-border history, and how the political, cultural, and social relationships have changed throughout time.",
    "Ability to read from different types of source and really do a close reading"

   "comments": [
    "Denise has a very laid back teaching style in the sense that the value of the class will be based on the students in the class. A lot of us lacked basic history background, which should be supplemented in the beginning of the semester.",
    "I felt like this course had many glaring weaknesses and few strengths. First off, it shouldn't be open to non-history people if the professor isn't going to provide any guidance on how to work as a historian. We had a weekly blog post (probably to encourage discussion during class) but it never generated any interesting discussion. We also never got any feedback on these blog posts. This would be fine had we actually had assignments throughout the semester that we could have received feedback on. But that wasn't the case. The final paper is worth 50% of your grade and you also have to submit an annotated bibliography and primary sources analysis. These were all due in November or later. So I didn't really learn much or even know where I was lacking. This class also met for two hours on Friday afternoons, which was painful. People were pretty zoned out by then. Honestly, this class might have been much, much better if it'd been a different room of people. Professor Ho isn't the type to interject or critique her students' opinions, even if they're saying something blatantly ignorant or wrong. This was a weakness of the course, because if you don't already have a strong background in Chinese history, you're not going to know what you're talking about. And even if you do have a strong background in Chinese history, you're more likely than not going to draw pretty racist conclusions. It just wasn't an engaging course. Professor Ho is very nice, however.",
    "The readings provided progress historically and avoid focusing too heavily on the present, which might be disappointing for some given HK politics in 2019. However, the city has been incredibly unique and internationally contentious throughout its history, and the readings for each week were interesting in different ways. Writing the final paper was also a great learning experience, since there's a wealth of English-language primary sources available for Hong Kong and thus far more topics that are easy to research relative to other cities in Asia (if you don't speak Chinese). As for critiques, discussions were a bit less lively early in the semester because some of the readings lacked context and implicitly assumed a bit of background on Hong Kong and China that some student's didn't have, especially regarding the city's geography -- however, Prof. Ho already has heard this feedback and will likely provide a bit more in terms of background lectures and\/or more overview-focused readings in the early weeks the next time the class is offered. The discussion format also began to feel a bit rote toward the end, but there may be some changes in this regard as well. The reading load is heavy, but I didn't have trouble finishing the pieces by the time the class met each week if I planned well. All in all, great course given that this was the first time it was offered -- Prof. Ho is very knowledgeable, having spent significant time in HK doing research, and the class will likely only get better. Would recommend to any student interested in understanding the historical dynamics that have shaped East Asia.",
    "The readings which comprise different selections of chapters from different authors allowed us to get different perspectives on different topics. It was a really interesting and engaging way to discuss broader themes. A little more background on both Hong Kong and China would be helpful because some of us came in with much less information than the others.",
    "The strength is that the class requires a high engagement of students so we learned a lot. We were given enough guidance for our final paper. The weakness is that the readings were a lot and we were not able to discuss in depth of the readings in the class. Besides, I feel like some of the readings were not the core of our topic and I do not understand why they were chosen. It would be great if there is more primary (non-governmental) sources. I also hope that there are more guidance from the prof. instead of 80% led by students so that we can learn more from her knowledge, The structure of the course was also a bit unclear and we ended up repeating some content of the previous classes.",
    "Strengths is Denise Ho shes very knowledgeable. Weakness was this was the first time the course ran, so the readings were quite scattered at times. There are no formal lecture slides and at times content was mixed and convoluted. Would be better to have more structure and lecture time because it was mostly student run",
    "Strong course material addressed a number of issues and provided extremely engaging discussions. Some of the material could be organized in a way that facilitated understanding of the temporal and spatial contextstudents less familiar with the region would have benefitted from more introductory material at the beginning of the course.",
    "This course focused on a very interesting subject, and the discussion was often very informative. Having students prepare all the questions in groups took an incredibly large amount of time, and didn't facilitate student learning as well as it could have if Professor Ho wrote the questions, as she has more knowledge on the subject. Beginning with some more lectures about the general background of the topic would have also been helpful. Additionally, the reading load was often extremely high and papers were sometimes repetitive, which felt unnecessary. Additionally, receiving feedback on our reading responses would have been helpful so students knew how to improve or what Prof Ho was looking for.",
    "I enjoyed the content and assignments for the course. I would have also enjoyed some lecture-style sessions, because sometimes the discussions ran long and students didn't have enough context.",
    "I think the reading selection and Professor were fantastic. Organization was very good. One thing I did not enjoy was the student led discussions because I wouldve liked to hear more from Professor Ho."

    "Yes, if classes were restructured a bit and maybe if some breakout sections were added to get to know the class better.",
    "I wouldn't recommend this course to another student. It just wasn't engaging and it was structured in a way that made it hard to know what you're even doing wrong. A lot of people in my class weren't history people and it was pretty obvious from the way they read and talked about sources. And that would be totally fine if we had all gotten feedback or guidance throughout the semester... but we didn't.",
    "Yes! Would recommend to anyone interested in Asian urbanism, Chinese politics, or really any topic related to China -- Hong Kong provides invaluable insights in understanding the country and its modern dilemmas.",
    "Totally would recommend I learned a lot from this class and Professor Ho is awesome, kind and knows so much! She gave each of us the opportunity to really understand the broad themes of the class. Whenever she facilitated the discussion, she would allow people to speak but would also come into the conversation to provide important analysis, background, or answers to question.",
    "I would recommend it to students who are interested in the history of Hong Kong and Southern CHina and had previous knowledge.",
    "Maybe, it was good but not great. Lots of reading and its student run. Moreover there was very little direction for the final paper which makes up the whole grade so it can be a lot",
    "Absolutely; Prof Ho is a great teacher and this class allowed students interested in a variety of fields to be engaged.",
    "Yes! I think the topic is very interesting and worth-it to study, especially if Prof Ho makes a few structural changes. She is a good professor and takes student feedback. She is available to meet with students, and I think that learning about this topic is fascinating and important.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course if you're interested in Hong Kong\/China!"
