    "Required.",
    "This class wasn't too bad, but it can be boring at times. You probably won't learn a whole lot if you've already taken AP statistics or some other introductory stats class.",
    "again, wouldn't recommend to a non-econ major. for an econ major, its fine",
    "I would not recommend this class. It's just terrible!",
    "Yes",
    "Take it only if you have to. I got very little out of this class. It is hard.",
    "It's a requirement for the econ major so whether or not I recommend it doesn't matter but the material is relevant and interesting.",
    "Terrible class, only take if you have to for the econ major.",
    "If you're an econ major, you have to take it, but otherwise, forget it. This class made me change my mind about being an econ major...suffering through another term of this BS was not worth it.",
    "Pretty handy skills to learn and decently taught... Yes!!!!",
    "The material is pretty interesting and was by far the most practical course I have taken in the economics department. The first half of this course is basically a repeat of AP Statistics (think probability and hypothesis tests)--really easy, especially given that the midterm was open book. The second half, while not hard, was substantially more confusing. The final was a mess, and was the hardest thing anyone saw all semester. Overall, it's an easy class, which makes the grade distribution not ideal, but still not as bad as past years. David Atkin likes to spend half of each lecture asking whether anyone in the crowd of>100 would like to answer his questions, but he managed to present the material in a pretty interesting way, with lots of case studies. Gabi is BY FAR the best TA; her sections were more helpful than lecture and she's so nice!",
    "Not unless you have to.",
    "Buy the textbook and do the reading if you have to take this course; this class should not have been very hard, but was incredibly boring, had unfortunate assignments, and the final felt like a nightmare. I think the curve makes this better, but if you aren't an econ major take stats or AQA instead or watch a few videos of khan academy",
    "Take it if you need to.",
    "Econometrics is basically the same as any intro stat class besides the fact that most of our problems are business themed. Having a prior class in statistics definitely puts you at an advantage because Professor Atkin's lectures are boring and often confusing. This being said, the material is fairly easy to learn and many people succeeded without going to class. It isn't too much work, but it is definitely not an exciting class.",
    "overall, econometrics is one of those classes all econ majors have to take, but very few enjoy. that said, prof atkin is definitely considered one of the better professors to take this course with. overall, its very hard to know what to expect on his exams. for the midterm, the exam was much easier than the problem sets. however, the final exam was unbelievably unfair and difficult and nothing like the problem sets or the practice problems he put online. if you are looking at this evaluation, then you probably are an econ major and have no choice but to take this class, but just be warned that the exams are really different than the homework or practice problems.",
    "If you have to take it, take it. If you don't, don't. They are better taught classes that you'll will probably enjoy and learn in the lectures.",
    "If you are majoring in economics then yes, because you won't get the degree without it. If you just want to take it for kicks and digs, then no.",
    "It's a requirement, but it's not the worst. Take the skills it will give you seriously, because learning how to use Excel and Stata will come in handy.",
    "Overall, the workload was not too bad and the midterm was reasonable. However, the final did not test the student\u00e2\u0080\u0099s knowledge of the course and was unbearably hard.",
    "This was good! Atkin teaches Metrics in a quite engaging fashion, and the class was generally painless if one put in the work. It can be a bit hard to stay engaged in this class because of the dryness of the material, but this is definitely a good way to take stats if you need to.",
    "You have to take Econometrics if you are an Econ major, but this class was the worst experience for me. Take it with another professor if you can. Midterm was very easy, final was ridiculously hard. We didn't really learn much in the course, and was unfairly tested on the materials that weren't properly covered in class. Regression assignment was a terrible experience, where we had to figure out how to run regressions by ourselves, because we didn't really learn anything in class and were required to turn in a regression project in teams of 4-5 people.",
    "Don't take it unless you need it for the economics major.",
    "You gotta take it if you're an Econ major. Not a horrible class as requirements go, and the content is important, but it could have been presented in a much more clear way. The content is pretty much the same from AP Statistics, if you took that you should be fine. Atkin speaks English well, which not all the profs do, so factor that into your decision.",
    "Yes, if interested in answering economic questions with data analysis. Or if required, obviously. It gives you a good appreciation for data, but also a very shallow understanding of econometrics. For the more math-minded (or for people more interested in the theory or explanation behind data analysis), take Econ 135\/136.",
    "POOR. Laughably easy problem sets where point deductions were made for arbitrary reasons, boring lectures, and exams that were only difficult due to the confusing nature of the questions.",
    "Only take it if you're an economics major. I was on the fence economics\/history... now I'm a declared history major wishing I hadn't put myself through this class. The material is dry and the grading is tough. Be careful.",
    "An introductory statistical methods class. The review of probability themes and their application to statistics was useful. The second half (constructing a regression model) was some what useful but could have been better taught. David Atkin is a clear and understandable lecturer.",
    "Econometrics is basically like a statistics class. If you like math and probability, then yes, I would recommend it. But if you don't need the requirement and you're not a math person, you should look into other Econ courses instead.",
    "Lectures do not give much insight into anything, especially considering that at least 30% of the time is spent in silence waiting for someone to answer the questions posed by Prof. Atkins. The most important concepts come right before the midterm and after\u00e2\u0080\u0094the beginning is not tested on as much. Be ready to teach yourself how to do Stata and attend section with David Gelvez.",
    "ECON 131 is obviously required for every econ major. If you've taken AP Stats before, it will be fairly easy for you and the first half of the semester will just be an overview of it. However, if you haven't taken AP Stats, don't despair. Professor Atkin was decent at explaining the concepts and would do example problems in class so everything was very accessible as long as you paid attention in class. I know many people got annoyed at how he would pose questions to the class with little response, even though all of us knew the answer, and I felt bad for him because almost everybody was too apathetic to respond to him. However, as a teacher, Atkin is not bad. We had 6 problem sets, a final group regression assignment, a midterm, and a final. The midterm was so easy that the curve probably worked against most people. The final however was a lot harder and covered material that was never covered in the problem sets and will hopefully reset the curve to normal.",
    "Econ 131 is statistics applied to Econ. Although it is clear that the applications of the material learned or discussed in this class is very interesting, learning it was not.",
    "Ehh not a great class, and the lectures were hard pay attention to. The regression assignment was one of the worst days of my semester, because I felt like we were ill prepared and it was not good.",
    "Only seven problem sets overall and a project at the end. Problem sets are pretty easy but a few require a little bit of time. The project at the end was a little annoying but not horrible. The midterm was easy and the final was pretty hard. Not a very stressful course, especially because the problem sets were mostly in the first half of the semester. The material isn't very difficult, although the regression stuff at the end is kind of tricky and it never seemed like there was enough time in class to give the topic thorough enough treatment.",
    "David Atkin is not great. He mumbles in class, and the lectures are not very interesting. They are also not very necessary; as long as you go to section and make sure you understand the lecture notes, which are pretty comprehensive, you should be fine. Econometrics is interesting though, so give it a shot if you want to learn more about statistics. The first half of the class is really easy if you've taken AP stats before, but the second-half does provide some new information so you won't be totally bored.",
    "if you have to take the class, i guess you have to. if not, this is not a fun\/interesting class. you kinda need to know the material though since it is important in analyzing data.",
    "Econ major, you will have to take this class no matter what. Here is what you will like about it: Professor Atkin has great powerpoints and his lectures are pretty clear, he is probably the best professor to have ever taught this class in the past three years, the TF Gabi (Gabrielle Santangelo) is amazing, econometrics can be cool once you understand the intuition and see patterns (but you'll need a good TF for this), econometrics is necessary for econ research or a Wall Street career, exams are open book, midterm was straightforward but you can make stupid mistakes on it so beware.Here is what you won't like about it: a bad professor may be teaching it in your year, all of your TF's may be bad (TF's are important for this class, believe me, so go to section unless you took statistics before), they won't let you keep or review your midterm because a lazy future professor wants to use it for his class (and how much are your parents paying for your Yale education again?), final exam is hard, you need to understand regressions and dummy variables really well for the final exam which was not covered in class all that great, there will be self-teaching involved and while the textbook is great for the early material it's bad for the regressions material.",
    "Econometrics has a lot of applications. However, you may just want to stick with intro stats if you're not too invested.",
    "The course was a survey of simple statistical techniques. If you have taken AP Stats in high school, this class will be a breeze. The only addition thing learned in the class is multiple regressions. It's a shame that the Econ department doesn't allow those that scored well to place into a more advanced statistics class. Despite the lack of enthusiasm from the students, Professor Atkin did a great job teaching the material.",
    "Only take it if you have to.",
    "Only take this if you have to- it is not an enjoyable course, especially if you've never taken a statistics class or don't especially like math. The curve is also pretty brutal. The problem sets and midterm aren't awful, and the final project, while not very much fun to do, is pretty straightforward- but be careful when studying for the final. It's worth 45% of your final grade, and it's much more difficult than anything else the course throws at you.",
    "This is an incredibly hard class. Do not take it unless you have to. Try to learn everything on your own. No a great class and incredibly boring.",
    "If you are an Economics major, you have to take some form of econometrics, and ECON 131 is a manageable, useful class. It doesn't delve too much into probability theory or abstract math concepts; it is focused on applications of statistics and econometrics. The problem sets aren't too difficult, but lectures can get tedious at times (but that's true for almost any required large lecture Econ course).",
    "The things you learn in class are interesting. But this class was a headache. I struggled with all the assignments and the exams despite putting so much work . It was very frustrating.",
    "I'm glad I took it - but I certainly didn't love it. It is what you make of it -- for example, in learning STATA, you can do the bare minimum or experiment and learn a lot more.",
    "Take it with Atkin and take it if necessary for your major or is critical to your understanding of economic models.",
    "Unless you are an Econ major, don't take this class. It is unnecessarily confusing and the tests are quite arbitrary. It you are interested in this type of material, take a stats class instead.",
    "Take it only if you need it. Be prepared to study all of intro econometrics on your own. Curb your expectations. Buckle up. You're in for a rough ride.",
    "Take it if you have to. Statistics is a dry subject but one that most educated people really should know about, so I'm glad I took it. But don't expect it to be riveting and fulfilling. Just pay attention and try to learn each concept as it's taught--if you do this, you'll find the class pretty easy.",
    "You do learn a lot from this class (you will see that reading academic papers becomes much easier since you will finally be able to fully understand the results section) but it could be frustrating sometimes. Lectures were quite boring, even though Atkin was relatively good at explaining the material. Problem sets and the final regression assignment are hard. Both the midterm and the final are open notes but the final was hard.",
    "Very poor class. Lecture was uninteresting and there were long periods of time each lecture where the professor would ask the large lecture hall questions which either nobody would know or want to answer and if someone did answer, it being a large lecture hall, half of the room couldn't hear the answer but the professor would move on regardless.Much of the class also was about working with STATA program which was not effectively tested on the final",
    "This class will most likely be of little value to you. There is not much material to learn and it is for the most part easy to understand. I can almost guarantee you that the class will be poorly taught and will have little focus on the parts of the course that actually matter come test day - like problem solving. You can work with other people on almost every assignment, so make sure that you have smart friends in the class.",
    "You have to take it so have fun. It is a course with very little work that no one goes to class --yet because it is open notes the curve ends up screwing a bunch of people.",
    "I went into it expecting that it was going to go well and that I was going to learn a lot. And I did not. It was a difficult class with little reward. I might be an anomaly, you could say an outlier, but I believe that I am right that this was a wider trend for those who regularly attended this class. Not worth taking it with Aitkin, unless he seriously adjusts the way he teaches the class.",
    "Lectures are well organized and information is useful. Atkin's final is absolutely impossible.",
    "As someone who isn't particularly strong in economics, I would say that this course is definitely doable. I took this course without any background in STATA or statistics, and found that I could follow along (though it took effort). Weekly p-sets, one midterm, one (time-consuming) regression project, one final. Weekly p-sets took anywhere from 2-8 hours. Exams were open-book and notes. Your grade in the course will be determined by the curve - which was rough, at least after the midterm, as the vast majority of the class did extremely well. You will mostly learn from the p-sets and section. Econometrics is not an exciting course, so choose a professor based on his or her teaching ability. Atkin is a good lecturer and, in my opinion, is better than the rest in making the material clear.",
    "Not very interesting, but not boring either. Useful skills; a little hard to follow and the class seems slightly disjointed.",
    "I would not recommend this class to another student. You don't learn things in this class that you can't learn in Statistics.",
    "You have to take this as an Econ major.Just know that Atkins is a bad lecturer and v few practice problems are given, making it difficult for anyone to prepare for exams",
    "Take it with Prof Atkin and make sure your TA is Gabi!",
    "ECON131 was a good overview of statistical analysis. If you have taken other statistics before this will be an easy course, if not, there is no need to worry, Professor Atkins is reasonable in the pace of the course. Iwould recommend it for the sake of exposure to these things. There is a lot of hand-waving involved when it comes to formulas of populations and samples, but if you're ok with that, then by all means take the course. The problem sets took way longer than I thought they would take. So for those, start them EARLY.Professor Atkin was a good teacher. Considering the breadth of material he had to cover in one semester, he did really well. At times, the explanations weren't too clear but sometimes people weren't willing to ask clarifying questions, so it wasn't really his fault in that sense. One can tell that Professor Atkin is really smart in his field of study but sometimes he can forget that this might be a student's first ever statistic course. He tries to be as straightforward and simple about the concepts as he can, and for that I am grateful. My only complaint was that the final was ridiculously hard.",
    "I would recommend the course with Atkin for majors and non-majors. The class is usually not taught well and this was the first time in years it was taught decently well. The class is more applicable than JRS' intro-stats because you learn STATA (a program actually used in the real world, unlike Minitab) and you see how statistics applies to real life situations. I took AP Stats in high school also but in this course, for the first time I understood how to do and analyze data regression. I would suggest doing the reading for class before class (it clarifies Atkins lectures) and reading the case studies before class so you'll get more out of lecture and be more prepared for the regression analysis (15% percent of your grade, stressful, but rewarding).",
    "Do not take this class unless you have to. It was one of the worst lectures I have taken at Yale. The class ended up taking so much more time than was necessary because it was badly taught and the textbook was horrible too. We could have learned the information much more easily and much faster had the professor been better at lecturing. Even though I attended lecture, I usually did not get much out of it because Professor Atkin was very bad at conveying information.",
    "I'd rather gouge my own eyes out than take this class again.",
    "Yup, it's a good course. Pros: engaging lecture, mostly relevant and reasonable p-sets, useful material. Cons: it's hard to know what to study for the 2nd half of the course for the final. The midterm was very straightforward, while the final was somewhat harder. Overall both exams were reasonable. Other: If you take good notes in lecture, book probably optional. I did not buy it and I felt fine.",
    "I loved the concepts that were taught in the course, but felt that the teaching itself was wanting -you will definitely need to find a good TA to get through the material if it is new for you. Professor Atkin was definitely pretty relaxed during lectures, but I felt like I could not learn much from them. Furthermore, because all exams were open book and open note, he expected a pretty high level of conceptual understanding from us, which I felt was incongruous with the level at which classes were taught.",
    "Good for general knowledge, but not a great course overall. The final counts for a huge percentage of your grade. And the final was insane.",
    "It's not really a course you'd wanna take for fun. Nothing too difficult, but the lectures are pretty dry and the material not all that exciting. A stats course more than anything Econ related",
    "Take it if your an econ major obviously, but there's not much appeal to it otherwise.",
    "Take it to learn some of the useful applications of statistics in regards to economics. The material seems easy at times, but the curve is not so great and the final was very hard. Definitely form study groups for the weekly problem sets and for the group projects.",
    "Have to take it.",
    "I would recommend this course to even non-Econ majors- basically anyone in the social sciences. You will learn a lot and most of it is directly applicable to understanding research papers in a variety of fields.",
    "You have to take this class but it is very difficult and if you have never heard of regression or hypothesis testing before you are going to have a bad time.",
    "I recommend this class.A very substantive course on how to deal with data. Three parts of the course are probability, hypothesis testing, regression.I really liked the course because it teaches you a legit methodology you will be able to use in the future if you pursue economics or any social science that handles data in general.",
    "Yes I would. I think pure Econ majors should take 131. The material is not hard at all and you spend minimal time (max 2 hours a week) on psets. However, you can only pray that your professor tests you the right way.",
    "If you're an Econ major, you pretty much have to take this class. I wouldn't really recommend it if you don't have to take it.",
    "Important material to know and learn, very low commitment, not too difficult, lecture attendance not necessary",
    "This class was awful; it was a lot harder than it needed to be. The exams did not reflect the problem sets or projects, and no past years' materials were provided. Studying was very difficult for this class. The final exam was extremely difficult and asked thing we never covered anywhere (lecture, projects) before. I wouldn't recommend this, but if you're set on being an Econ major, you gotta do what you gotta do.",
    "No.",
    "Metrics is one the most practical courses in the Econ major. Anyone who hasn't taken statistics should take this course. That being said, the class is tough and requires a good amount of work. Material gets exponentially harder later in the semester and the midterm and final are on tough curves. Practical but tough class",
    "This class was ok. Pretty tough final.",
    "Take it if you have to, I don't know how professor Atkin compares to others, but the exams were excessive.",
    "Learning how to interpret and understand statistics, probability, regressions etc. is an important skill and this class provides some foundation in this area. The professor gives good examples to supplement the math, but I didn't feel that I got an incredibly deep understanding of the material.",
    "Economics 131 01 is an economics class that focuses on the fundamentals of econometrics. I would only recommend this class for an individual who is an economics major. If one is interested in this type of work one is better of taking statistics or getting a textbook and teaching the information to themselves. The first part of the course focuses on statistics and probability. The second third of the course deals with regression analysis while the last part of the course explores econometrics. If one is very interested in the material they are free to take the second part of the class that is offered in the spring.",
    "Wasn't as easy as I expected. Project grades were pretty arbitrary. Professor tries his best in lectures, but students unfortunately aren't responsive to his style of teaching of asking way too many questions during lectures (would have worked better in a seminar or MBA setting). Finals were surprisingly really hard - make sure you stay on top of the final materials and not slack like I did.",
    "Econ 131 is a pretty chill class if you take it with Professor Atkin."
