    "take this course with shankar if you are interested in physics after maybe 200 or so..",
    "For anyone interested in majoring in Physics, this is a great class to take; Shankar is one of the best Physics professors around.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. Professor Shankar is the best teacher I have come across in the maths\/sciences. Prepare to work very hard, and without help from a textbook, so take good notes!",
    "it's a fun class. i found it a little slow, coming from 260, but it picked up and i learned a lot.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS IF SHANKAR IS TEACHING IT! PROFESSOR PARKER WILL LET YOU COUNT IT TOWARDS THE INTENSIVE IF YOU TAKE IT AND 420 AND 430. THIS CLASS WAS THE BEST CLASS I'VE EVER HAD AT YALE IN MY FIVE SEMESTERS HERE!",
    "Absolutely. This class was understandable, entertaining, and covered all the important topics in mechanics. Professor Shankar is the best professor and his lectures are entertaining and easy to understand. His homework and exams are hard, but very fair.",
    "If Shankar is teaching it then definitely. The syllabus is basically physics 200\/201 + Lagrangians and Hamiltonians + more in-depth relativity and thermodynamics. Shankar is such a great teacher though that the material still seems fresh and engaging. If there's a different professor I'd be a little more hesitant.",
    "Shankar is amazing. It's a lot of material, which can throw major and non-majors for a loop (we did high-school mechanics, Lagrangian mechanics, relativity, and thermodynamics). If you don't need this for your major, I'd take it as long as you're prepared for great lectures but a tough curve on exams. If you're deciding between the regular and intensive physics major, explain to the DUS your situation and start off with what your gut tells you...you may be able to switch after the first semester.",
    "This course sets you up for the Physics major track, revisiting old mechanics problems with more emphasis on understanding what the laws you are using actually mean. It starts to get you into the mindset of trying to understand and untangle the relationships of physics as opposed to blindly solving problems, although there is of course a lot of that to do. The workload is manageable, the grader actually helps you if you can't figure something out, and the material is of course interesting, provided that you like physics."
