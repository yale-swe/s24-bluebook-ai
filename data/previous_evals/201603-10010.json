    "Rev. Burt's strengths are enthusiasm, pastoral modeling, and authenticity. Some of the wisdom nuggets she has shared with us (people have a right to be angry if you do must cancel something in order to provide care for yourself, that is part of the equation). wow. I think areas to work on are removing herself from the discussion and drawing out student engagement.",
    "The mid-year eval covers this.",
    "Kyle has been great to have as my practicum facilitator! Very good at explaining assignments, facilitation discussion, and helping us reflect deeply on our ministries.",
    "Very sensitive to facilitating communication in a very diverse yet small group - we were all coming from different \"planets,\" with some overlap in terms of denominations, but even there, from very different contexts. Kyle took care to get people to understand one another's stories, facilitated feedback in constructive ways, and developed a strong sense of trust and bonding, in spite of some wide differences in some instances. I would have liked the practicum sessions that Kyle led to get more into the meat of case studies, which I expressed in my other course feedback form, and I am hopeful that the work that Kyle has put in to this semester's practicums will help us to reflect on those case studies with more depth.",
    "Daphne is the \"glue\" in our group, pushing people to get the most out of the experience, creating a \"safe\" space for any response, and making sure we are on track. The only \"weakness\" I would identify is that she could be a bit more forceful about being our leader and a little tougher on us.",
    "personable supportive",
    "response is above on kyle.",
    "Created a great community of learning and support. Helpful in advocating for students and encouraging appropriate boundaries and self-care.",
    "I love having Bill as an instructor! He has done a great job at facilitating our group, allowing us to share our experiences and our selves.",
    "Strengths: Understanding where we were all at in the year. Katie was also great at going with the flow. If the day needed a switch up in content, she was very flexible in making this decision with us. She was a great instructor!",
    "Katie is the best. Full stop. She is supportive and attentive and I think I hit the jackpot in terms of Practicum leaders.",
    "Our section meetings were great--we were able to talk freely and get helpful feedback.",
    "good at facilitating discussion. valued our discussion more than the assignments which in this case was good.",
    "Tracy's great. She brings out the good discussion when it's there, and allows for quiet reflection when needed.",
    "She's great - very welcoming, attentive and reliable. Thursday is always a safe environment.",
    "Kyle was effective in helping us to form our small group and then in moderating our discussions.",
    "Strengths: caring, compassionate, thoughtful, and honest. Weakness: can't think of any!",
    "She allows for the group to guide the discussion and is very organized, which I really, really appreciate. Sometimes activities seem to not be beneficial or helpful, maybe that is just the first semester, and it may be unrelated to Daphne's particular set of strengths or weaknesses."
