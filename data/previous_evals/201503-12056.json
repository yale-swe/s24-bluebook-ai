   "comments": [
    "Definitely. The student's written and spoken French will improve. The class is well-organized and the selected texts and movies contribute greatly to French improvement.",
    "The French department never disappoints, and this class is no exception. My writing improved significantly, and this course does a great job of explaining the finer grammar points that always confused me. Professor Sherak is wonderful! Be prepared for a lot of work. Listen to Professor Sherak when she cautions you from taking 5 courses with this one. Just because this class doesn't meet everyday doesn't mean it is not as work intensive as the other French courses.",
    "French 150 is an amazing course if you are looking to improve your writing ability. It also allows you to read some very interesting texts and learn advanced vocabulary and grammar. However, despite being 3 times a week, it is a lot of work. But, in my opinion, very worth it and better than both 130 and 140. Also, professor wise, Madame Sherak is an AMAZING teacher and mentor. I think my experience was so great largely due to her.",
    "This is another excellent course from the French department. It emphasizes grammar, discussion, and literature\/film, although it spends slightly less time on grammar than the previous levels. Madame Sherak is passionate about the books and movies we watch, and understanding toward her students--her class was warm and welcoming, and she even took our class to the Yale University Art Gallery to look at French art. She's a wonderful professor. The course is consistently demanding, but you'll learn a lot!",
    "French 150 is a class for those who want to learn advanced French grammar (and are ready to self-study for it--a lot), those who want to improve their writing by writing a lot, and who are ready to commit themselves to an intense language course. The class is centered around different readings and books, through which diverse vocabulary is learned. There are 5 large essays, 3 tests, 2 oral exams, and a final exam. It is a good class with great professors--just beware: it is very intense and time-consuming.",
    "This is a very challenging course, no walk in the park. It has a heavy work load and a lot of writing; however it is completely worth it in the end. Your grammar and pronunciation will be ameliorated, along with your speaking skills.",
    "Well-organized, well-run course. Youll work both on solidifying grammar skills and reading and writing longer, more sophisticated pieces. The workload is significant but all of it is useful. Relatively frequent exams, which means they are short and all the topics are recent. A few medium-length essays all of which you have a chance to revise with corrections. Mme Sherak is fantasticvery friendly, accessible, and an excellent teacher. I highly recommend her section!",
    "Madame Sherak is, hands-down, amazing. Her enthusiasm is infectious and warm. Her ability to create meaningful discussionwith very discussable texts in 150is much appreciated. She is accommodating, charismatic, tough, and generous in the ways that the best professors are. The content and texts of FREN 150 are engagingchallenging, but centered on logical clusters of vocabulary necessary for discussing everything from politics, to art, to music. You'll read political and social satires, French historical fiction, and famous plays, and you'll watch pretty interesting (although occasionally dry) films. Writing is not just about basic coherence any moreit's about developing real style, fluidity, and cogent and complex ideas and analysis. It's your last grammar class, so you start owning your French. The course is decidedly rigoroushonestly, about the same amount of work of FREN 130 or 140, despite only meeting three times a week. If there is any downside, it is that the COURSEPACKET NEEDS TO BE UPDATED\/BETTER ORGANIZED. You cannot skimp on the workload, but it will be infinitely worth your while after the semester is over. tl:dr take 150 with Sherak because she's the bomb.com but be prepared to do a lot of work"
