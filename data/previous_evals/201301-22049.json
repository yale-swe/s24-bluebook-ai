    "Ultimately, it was a lot of work, but that was more about jumping through logistical hoops than anything else. Great content, of course, largely courtesy of Professor McGinley.",
    "I certainly would recommend the course, with my comments taken into account. The research project alone would be a great semester, with general readings on African-American theater as the backdrop. Again, the combination of intense research and weekly readings could have been better construed.",
    "Take it. Unfortunately, Professor McGinley will not be teaching it so i'm not sure it will be the same. But I think it's definitely a great class to take if you need one of your \"theory\" credits for the theater studies major (which is not the reason I took the course). If you are not a theater studies major we wary that it will be mostly theater studies majors in the course so they may reference so things that you will not understand. Regardless, everyone has something to offer this course and the discussions in this course so don't let your major limit you if you are interested in it. You'll read some great plays in african american theater and have some great discussions on what african american theater is exactly (there are no absolute answers)."
