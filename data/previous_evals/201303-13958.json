However, both instructors provided very interesting ideas, were very available to students, and gave good lectures\/perspectives on the course material.",
    "The combination of an academic and a practitioner teaching this course was incredibly valuable. This is the first course Ive taken with a practitioner and I wish all my classes could be taught in a similar fashion. I would recommend any students that have an interest in forest policy to take this course. The field trip to the UN changed my view of the institution and I really appreciated that so many negotiators sat down and talked frankly with us about their work. That experiences was invaluable."

    "Learning from other students",
    "The field trip to the UN, and guest lecture opportunities",

    "The deep-dive into international forest policy and the forest convention history was really useful. Also the weekly responses were a good space to interact with the course materials and explore the concepts in relation to our own interests.",
    "The best aspect was being exposed to both the academic and practitioner views on forest policy. I really enjoyed that the class, which could have easily been very abstract, focused on the practical aspects of the field. Jan and Ben were fantastic and I would highly recommend that this course be taught again.",

   "comments": [
    "The course was full of interesting and useful information, but it could have used some more structure. It would have been helpful to have a well-articulated outline for the course at the beginning. The first segment should probably cover the theoretical underpinnings of the subject matter. The remaining segments should clearly fit into a roadmap so that it is always evident what piece of the puzzle they are filling in.",
    "Giving feedback to students' weekly reflection paper should happen promptly. Also, assigning more articles from practitioners' point of view will be really helpful to understand the differences and find ways to fill the gaps.",
    "Clearer class structure from the beginning. Convey concepts simply. We spent most of the class very \"zoomed in\"- \"zoom out\" every once in a while and remind us why this is important and how one thing relates too another.",
    "INSTRUCTORS -instructors were very unorganized for the first two months of the course. lectures were disorganized, professors were late and unprepared for class, homework assignments were not readCONTENT -too much time spent on political science theory and not enough on practical applications of forest policycourse might have been useful for people doing forest governance research or setting international policy, but it was not useful for people working at the local or even the national level.course should have used more case studies and capitalized on student experiencesreadings were repetitive and limited in opinion",
    "Providing information and class materials well enough before the class. Most of the matereals are provided in the last minuites",
    "Course organization, clarity of topics, more time and leeway for student discussion (with out an instructor taking the discussion over again, which happened frequently when discussions occurred, instead of students being able to engage with each other, student's comments were usually immediately responded to by the professor, which I feel detracts from a desire to engage in discussion, myself). Timeliness on readings, and clearer expectations and faster feedback to weekly responses.",
    "The class discussion often did not reflect the weekly responses. There was also some organizational issues where our responses weren't really even read until later in the course, so they were not incorporated into lecture. I think it would have been nice to have more structured discussions with more student input in shaping them.",
    "More structure at during the first few weeks would have helped me, but this improved over the course. More student led discussions would have been useful as well.",
    "Each class could use more structure--a short lecture followed by class discussion of readings, theories, practice, etc. would be ideal."

    "I thought I would learn about the topics we covered in greater depth, and this is what I was hoping for, coming from a forest governance background. However, it was great for what it was able to accomplish within the needs of the class (where people have varying backgrounds on the topic)."
