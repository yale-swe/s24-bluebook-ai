   "comments": [
    "We read six texts, from the Odyssey to Walcott's Omeros, in order to study the progression of the epic through time and the literary tradition. In class, we discussed the context and background of the texts and analyzed both particular passages and the works as a whole. We wrote three essays on those works as well as six (shorter) reading responses.",
    "A wonderful course; it was indeed epic.Since it was a seminar, the entire class got to be very close, and the discussions helped me to really understand six works that I would not have appreciated nearly as much if I had I read them alone. Each epic is a work that you probably should read at some point, and this class is the perfect setting to do so. Other than the reading, there are some short and ungraded reading responses and three medium length essays, so it is a very manageable amount of writing for a writing credit. Professor Pravinchandra is amazing--she does a great job of guiding the class discussions without overpowering them.This class is agreat option if you think you would enjoy DS but don't want your entire schedule to be taken up by it; Epic is basically a standalone version of DS Literature.The one big caveat is that there is quite a bit of reading. We read six works, each of which could occupy an entire course in its own right, so you will have a painful time if you dislike this type of literature. However, if you are willing to put in a bit of legwork, you will definitely not regret it.",
    "English 130 is a fantastic way of getting to know the classics. It's certainly not easy, but at the end of the semester you will look back and be so very proud of yourself for getting through everything, especially James Joyce! Professor Pravinchandra too is an incredible professor, always friendly, always willing to help!",
    "A ton of reading (wonderful books), some literary analysis (not tedious), and lots of interesting discussion. Well organized and enjoyable.",
    "Summary: Discussion about the books we read, which are Professor Pravinchandra's definition of epics. Some of them in fact are. Others are not."
