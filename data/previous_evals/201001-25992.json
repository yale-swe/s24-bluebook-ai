    "The course is enjoyable and covers fascinating topics in recent Chinese history. Strengths include the kind, fair, engaging, knowledgeable, and accessible professor (\u8607\u8001\u5e2b) and the relaxed atmosphere; weaknesses include sometimes lecture-like sessions. I would recommend the course to anyone who wants an easygoing course in advanced Chinese.",
    "It's a good class for people who are seeking to keep up with their chinese, but do not want too heavy a workload",
    "definitely, great advanced course that isn't too time consuming that lets you keep up with the language.",
    "Yes, especially if you have some background in Chinese reading, I would definitely recommend this course!",
    "Not as good as Wei Su's first semester, which isn't saying a whole lot. The best part of both courses is the text, but you can pick that up on your own. Overall, not a great course, and if you don't have lots of initiative you probably should just take a semester off Chinese. Or find another course!",
    "It's great because it only meets twice a week.",
    "Take it.",
    "Chinese 159 is a low-pressure course that helps high-level students maintain their Chinese ability without taking too much of their time. It is not a good move for someone who just wants to improve their speaking. The vocabulary is very useful, however."
