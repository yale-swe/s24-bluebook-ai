    "In this class, I gained insight and knowledge beyond my expectations. Through the course, I learned and was encouraged to engage and learn from my fellow students across discplines--art history, music, art. My love and understanding of material culture and craft has grown, evolved, and developed by learning from a professor who clearly loves and is incredibly passionate and knowledgable on the subject matter."

    "I would recommend this course to another student. The syllabus was well organized to offer students with a wide variety of perspectives on the subject of the course. The opportunities to experiment with making vessels, make use of the facilities at West Campus, and visit the Peabody collections made the class incredibly engaging.",
    "Professor Cooke is one of the most thoughtful, caring, and engaging professors I have ever met. He values his students opinions and insights and is able to provide knowledgable feedback to them. The course provided students with a deeper understanding of the subject matter of vessels through off-site visits to studio spaces. Additionally, we went to Yale West Campus's Art Gallery to access art objects off-campus. These visits provided students with a much deeper understanding of the subject matter. This is one of the best courses I have ever taken to date. I truly believe anyone---art historian or not---would greatly benefit from taking this course."
