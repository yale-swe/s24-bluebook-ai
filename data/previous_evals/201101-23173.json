   "comments": [
    "A good QR. Easy, but don't put off the homework too much.",
    "A great QR, take it",
    "Take it",
    "Yes. Especially if you need a QR.",
    "If you can manage to get in and want to breeze through a QR then take this class.",
    "If you can get into this class (which I'm sure will be very difficult), it would be a mistake to turn your spot down. Basically it's just weekly problem sets, 2 midterms and a final. Perfect for someone who is terrified of the math department.",
    "Good way to get a QR",
    "If Professor Khare is teaching it, then yes, definitely. However I am not sure he is because I think he is moving to Stanford next year. It is definitely one of the best QRs out there, if you do the work and go to office hours, you will be absolutely fine.",
    "Take this class if you want an utterly painless QR.",
    "Easiest math class at Yale",
    "Again, although challenging, this was a very interesting course and would certainly recommend this course to any fellow student interested in math.",
    "I would definitely recommend Math 107 if you need to get a QR. The workload is not bad at all and the topics are interesting and not too challenging (much easier than calc, stat or any other QR i've heard about) there will be a different professor this year though...",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to a fellow student. The class teaches you lots of new material that you can definitely apply to real and everyday life. Also, the professor is great.",
    "Good way to get a math credit and learn a few \"magic tricks\"",
    "Yes, take this course if you need a QR and if you have NOT taken any math or sciences at yale...if you have, you will find it painstakingly easy. If you have not, this course will be easy, but also a refresher, so stay on top of work because if you let it slip it does actually become hard.",
    "yes!!! take this class! not hard at all",
    "BYes, the material is basic, information you may have learned in middle school and high school. That being said, you will be surprised by how much you have to relearn because you haven\u0092t put it to use during the years you\u0092ve been using to stock up on social science credits and avoid QR credits. There were many students in this class who seemed to struggle, despite the ease of the material; however, it\u0092s easy to excel in this class simply through putting in some hard work and going to office hours. The students who did poorly simply didn\u0092t put in the work to learn. I liked the practical nature of this course, and for a QR credit, it simply can\u0092t be beat. I highly recommend it!",
    "This is a great QR, you learn useful things and the work isn't overwhelming.",
    "Absolutely. This is a GREAT CLASS! If you can get in then take it. Covered some very interesting material, most of which will actually be helpful post graduation (unlike Calculus if you are not an engineer)."
