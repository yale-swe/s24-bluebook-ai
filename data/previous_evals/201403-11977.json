   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this class. It is extremely interesting and not that challenging. The professor is super nice.",
    "I would summarize it as an introduction to modern astronomy and cosmology that is intended for an astronomy or astrophysics major as opposed to someone who had mild interest in the subject matter, due to the math and problem solving involved. I would recommend this class because I personally was very interested in the subject and found that the class only furthered my interest.",
    "I would recommend this class if you have a decent background in math and want to explore being an Astrophysics major.",
    "I would not recommend this course to a non-STEM major or anyone without a background in physics. The course is a bit disorganized; I have confidence, however, that Professor Edwards (who is a very nice and intelligent person) can improve it in the future. Google and your classmates are your friends when it comes to the problem sets. Get a textbook to study for the exams. The observation project is annoying, especially if you have a Mac. Beyond that, it is not all that difficult. Class participation is required and is factored into your grade. Class, however, can sometimes be entertaining. Definitely talk to the professor throughout the course and give her suggestions if you are having difficulty keeping up with the material. There were a couple of philosophy majors in this class. If there are any if and when you take it, ignore them: they will only make the class more annoying for you. Bear in mind that they probably are as frustrated by you as you will be by them.",
    "It was very interesting material and the sequence of information presented made sense, but I the class wasn't organized as well as I had hoped. The problem sets often asked for us to perform derivations involving integrals when we never did any in class, and they would also have us solve problems we had barely covered. Instructions for the final project were uploaded in multiple files instead of one comprehensive list, for example, and I felt that about half my energy in the course was devoted to trying to understand what was being asked of me rather than actually working to find an answer.",
    "Yes, it is not too work intensive and gives a good introduction to the subject."
