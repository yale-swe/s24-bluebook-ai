    "Great class. Lots of reading, but all good material. Professor Russett is great and clearly knows a lot about the subject. Take it if you have any interest in the period.",
    "Absolutely. This year there were only five students in the class, so it took a fair amount of work to keep up, but nearly all the readings were worthwhile. Take it from me--I rarely do readings for class, but I did as much as possible for this one and it was totally worth it. The class focuses on the cultural history of the 20s and 30s. Not historical facts so much as samples of the important movements of the period. If you like the 20s and 30s in America (they're my favorite decades), this is definitely the class for you.",
