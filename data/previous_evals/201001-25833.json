    "I had a very positive experience in Italian. Even though the course had just been changed for the semester, I was happy with the emphasis on Italian culture, art, film, etc. \u0097 especially since it meant we would be finished with the book early in the term. Our class was very enthusiastic and Alexia did a great job balancing language study and academic study. I liked that we had many different and interesting assignments, including poetry presentations, a trip to the art gallery, a final project presentation, and even a research paper, rather than weekly compositions and test, which is the norm in a language class. I highly recommend Italian 140.",
    "A few weeks of grammar followed by cultural activities focusing on film, art, literature, and poetry.",
    "Highly recommended. It's a good transition between the grammar-intensive L1-L3 and the more culture\/speaking-based L5 courses. Low stress as well.",
    "Take Italian 140 if you want to continue your study of the language. The workload is much lighter than when the class met everyday. Be prepared to write a lot, though. There is a focus on more modern culture in the tv comedy episodes and movies that we watched.",
    "I would recommend this class. If you have completed L3 and are considering whether to continue your study of Italian or not, I encourage you to do so. This class is much less time intensive than L1-L3: it only meets three times a week, has a lot fewer assignments\/tests and no final (though it does have a final paper and presentation). It is a great way to keep up your Italian. In the first half of the class, we finished the textbook and nicely wrapped up all the annoying grammar. In the second half of the class, we read poetry, prose, watched films and went to the art museum. Very laid-back environment which serves to strengthen your knowledge of the language without much stress.",
    "i would absolutely recommend continuing in italian to this level. this class was a lot of fun, though there was work, it was manageable.",
    "Italian 140 is a lot of fun especially since you cover more cultural material although sometimes the material has to be covered very quickly because there are only 3 days.",
    "It's a class that really helps improve proficiency in Italian."
