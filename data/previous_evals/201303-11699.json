    "This is an amazing course! Amazing professor! Fascinating material! Take it!!!!!!!",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to someone who has very limited knowledge about the Islamic world and wants to find out more. The course is very comprehensive and moves along very fast, but the expectations are more than reasonable, and so the material is not intimidating at all, even for someone like me who is reluctant to read newspaper articles on MENA since my knowledge is so limited. This course changed the way I look at the world--the rise of Europe and the 'multiple modernities' concept really challenged the way I originally think. Take this class!",
    "Definitely take it! Great course, my favorite at Yale so far! You learn so much! I never imagined myself being so interested in Islamic culture until this class!"
