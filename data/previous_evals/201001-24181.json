   "comments": [
    "Yes, I think it's a good class to take - it's not too much work, so you actually end up doing all of it, which is nice to be able to actually discuss with your peers. It is somewhat repetitive in that the subject matter is not very broad, but it's a good course to take.",
    "This is a wonderful class. You're most likely to get in if you have previously taken American Cultural Landscapes with Dolores Hayden, or are a senior in the American Studies or Architecture majors. The readings are engaging and don't take much time; the only real assignments are when you lead a brief class discussion about a reading and an end-of-term research paper.",
    "It's a good class, and a good accompaniment to American Cultural Landscapes, but I'm not sure I learned a ton more about the suburbs.",
    "I would highly recommend this class for students interested in urban studies. Dolores Hayden is an excellent professor, and her enthusiasm for the material is contagious. The workload is both manageable and varied with an opportunity for students to present in class and to pursue a topic which interests them for the final paper."
