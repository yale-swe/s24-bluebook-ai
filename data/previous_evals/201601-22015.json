   "comments": [
    "Take this class! Seriously. Listening to professor Blight narrate the Civil War era is a delight and every lecture is like story time. It's amazing!",
    "yes - for the lecturer!",
    "Absolutely take it, even if its the only history class you take at Yale.",
    "Must take",
    "A classic.",
    "Great overview of the time period I came into the course knowing little about the era as a whole and I got exactly what I wanted to out of it. A large amount of reading, but most of it is interesting and worth it.",
    "Don't take this course if you're interested in the actual Civil War or military history. It is definitely an Af-Am studies class, which isn't bad, but you will be approaching history from a social lens which is very different than other ways of viewing the war.",
    "Good class! Blight wanders a bit in his lecturing, but it's a great way to get an understanding of why the nation tore itself apart for 5 years. I already knew a lot about the Civil War, and this lecture taught me more. If you remember high school AP US History, you'll be fine for the IDs though on the exam.",
    "This is a great course where you learn about the Civil War, but more importantly the way its remember and how that effects the US today. Make sure you get a good section leader. Although I enjoyed the class and Blight's lectures, I did not like my section because I felt like we didnt have good discussions.",
    "Be warned, if you are an international student, do some prior reading. Professor Blight naturally assumes everyone in the class in an American and therefore throws around names and events that you might have never heard of before without offering an explanation. That being said, this period of history is fascinating and you will learn a lot. The workload is not too arduous but the reading is heavy. A good history class even by Yale's standards. I would recommend watching Blight's online lecture series from 2008 as an alternative\/supplement to lecture, because in class he often gets completely side tracked with random stories, and if you're not familiar with the content, you'll have no idea what is going on. The online lecture series however, is much more focused on the material and I think covered a lot more than we did in class.",
    "Amazing lecture. Blight is a treat. Assigned readings are a bit excessive, but you don't have to do all of them in order to do well. Outside of that, with two papers and a final, the workload is quite manageable. Highly recommend to anyone who wants to learn more about the Civil War!",
    "Civil war and reconstruction is a fantastic class for anybody with an interest in American history. Going into the class, I didn't know a lot about this time period, but I know I feel so informed and interested in the era. Professor Blight is fantastic and his lectures are very engaging. The readings are quite long, but they're super interesting. I would definitely recommend it to a friend!",
    "Given the discussion about the legacy of the civil war at Yale and in American this year, anyone who is seriously commuted to that dialogue will take this class.",
    "Definitely take--material is super comprehensive and interesting and Blight is an amazing guy.",
    "Simply put - do not take this course. Waste of time, waste of a credit. It pains me to see non-History majors delve into the humanities for a chance to experience \"fun and interesting courses,\" then get stuck with a course like this. Lectures are confused and jumbled, you would learn more by reading Encyclopedia Britannica online. The amount of reading is ridiculous and nobody ever does it, leading to unfruitful and boring discussion sections. Professor Blight never ends his lectures on time, and due to the tangential and inarticulate style of his lectures, always packs the most important information into the last ten minutes. So if you have another class right after his, expect to never be on time. I wish this class would have been everything I expected, but it was a huge disappointment. I cannot stress enough, especially to non-History majors, how much the quality of other courses in the Department eclipse this one.",
    "You should take Civil War, if just to learn from an expert on the Civil War.",
    "TAKE IT FOR DBLIGHT.",
    "This was a really great class. Blight was one of the better lecturers I have had and the reading list was fantastic. Lecture ran over consistently, which was frustrating, but still a hugely enjoyable and interesting class.",
    "Civil War and Reconstruction is an interesting and relatively easy lecture course that provides an interesting lens through which to learn about an important period in our country's history. However, there is definitely a lot of reading--although you can get by without doing most of it. Blight's lectures are fun and he is very passionate about the material.",
    "Solid history course",
    "HIST 119 is a comprehensive study in the causes, course, and consequences of the Civil War. David Blight is a wonderful lecturer (with very well-timed gesticulation). His lecturing style might get exhaustive by the end of the semester (especially since he tends to go over time), but in general, he is an incredibly thoughtful human being who seems to approach history from all angles. Take this class if you have an interest in the American Civil War or just cultural history in general.",
    "10\/10 would recommend to a friend. Fun course! Interesting, and generally pretty casual. Your life will be easier\/better if you do all\/most of the reading.",
    "I enjoyed the course to an extent, but found it a little too focused on storytelling. Although the subject matter was interesting, and Professor Blight was fun to listen to, it seemed like we spent too much time hearing interesting stories from the time period, rather than exploring broader trends. Also, the amount of reading was a little unreasonable, and I feel like most people in my section just pretended to have read.",
    "This course is wonderful. Professor Blight gives an interesting lecture that is more than just dates and facts. While I had learned about the Civil War my entire life, this course made me think about its events and aftermath in a way I never had before.",
    "It is a class taught by a passionate professor with an above average workload and a difficult final exam.",
    "Take it! Great class.",
    "Great lectures and a fun weekly section -- interesting, useful, and not too much work.",
    "One of the best classes I've taken. Professor Blight is an incredible story teller and more knowledgeable than most anyone on the civil war and reconstruction periods. The reading is pretty copious but interesting. I would recommend this course to anyone.",
    "Definitely take this class! It is a must for every Yale student."
