   "question_text": "What knowledge, skills, and insights did you develop by taking this course?",
   "comments": [
    "I gained a lot of perspective on how we think about the environment and environmental thought leaders. The different perspectives represented were great for developing a comprehensive view of environmentalism.",
    "A better understanding of environmental history and environmental movements around the world.",
    "I gained a sense of the breadth of the field and the rich variety of voices. I guess this coursed helped me develop a more nuanced perspective toward environmental issues.",
    "We covered the following topics throughout the course Native American perspectives on land; Thoreau, Muir, Pinchot, and Leopold beginning the (yt, masculine, privileged) discussion on nature and the environment in America, Rachel Carson and modern environmentalism. We then moved from this history to modern issues of Urban ecology and city planning; International governance; environmental justice; Food and values; Environmentalism in India; and the history of ecology, religion, and the humanities. It is not just a class where you learn history or study values in just a purely academic setting. There is an emphasis that history and values translate into the present and into daily life. Values of intersectionality, relationality, and historical legacy permeate the class.",
    "By taking this course I learned a lot of global issues regarding environmental resources, and more importantly for the States I became highly informed of environmental movements in the history and what values did\/do they carry. Without this insight it would be difficult to apply any of my thoughts globally without learning much of the local one. As an international student, who did not receive an education in the West, I affirm that understanding local history is very important especially in understanding why people started caring about the environment and what were the motivations.",
    "The course provided insights into value systems and environmental history that I had not previously encountered. The composition of the class is unique and generates discussion from diverse viewpoints.",
    "I think one of the skills I really developed in this class was how to ask good questions. Every week there was an opportunity to ask experts in the field questions and also a chance to ask your peers questions. I think this system was not only humbling, but really caused a greater level of engagement with the material. I also learned so much from my classmates about how to use our unique skills and interests in order to think about environmental problems.",
    "This course was very valuable in developing a reflective environmental practice, assessing the values embedded in the environmental space, and learning how these values have influenced and changed management over time.",
    "Great question! I was the oldest person in the class (female, 59) and I can honestly say I learned a great deal from both Mary Evelyn and John. Our TA, Anna, was incredible: supportive, responsive, and helpful. The range, depth and scope of the course topics was outstanding and directly applicable to my work as an Executive Director of a land trust in Massachusetts. I couldn't have ever come up with the diversity of topics we discussed in any other course.",
    "As an FES student, it was fascinating getting to interact with and hear from students in the Divinity School. I think I benefited simply from the exposure I got to members of the Yale community (and beyond) whose perspectives, priorities, etc. are often so different from most FESers. Plus, getting the chance to learn about subject matter like philosophy, religious studies, nature writing, etc. was neat; it was refreshing to learn class material that exercised a part of my brain (i.e. the less-science\/more-humanities part) that is probably underutilized."

   "question_text": "How well did the knowledge, skills, and insights gained in this class align with your expectations?",
   "comments": [
    "I think the way each speaker approached their subject was so disparate that it was a little difficult to mesh all of the lessons learned together, but the class otherwise very much met my expectations.",
    "They aligned well.",
    "Fairly well. I anticipated more of an overview of the history of the movement but I enjoyed the very practical contemporary voices we read",
    "It definitely provided me a hope that actions can be done and collaborative contributions matter, and therefore work the way as planned. And practicatl side was my expectation which I find is fulfilled.",
    "The quantity of topics at times made the class feel like a superficial examination.",
    "Very well! This class went about and beyond my expectations! One of my very favorite classes at Yale!",
    "Very well",
    "What I learned--the knowledge, skills and insights gained--far surpassed my high expectations. All the speakers were real-time mission-ready and I can say I honestly learned to 'think' more like an environmentalist.",
    "I didn't have many expectations going in, but I'd say I found this course (its material, progression of topics, etc.) well done and enjoyable."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of the course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I think a few of the speakers-- Jonathan Rose in particular-- weren't the most compelling. I also didn't love the transition away from class discussions. I found I often learned more from my classmates than hearing from a single guest for two hours, and I would've appreciated the opportunity to interact more with other students. The class was very strong otherwise.",
    "The course was structured around guest lecturers, many of whom didn't have much to add, or at least weren't specific enough to provide learnings within a two hour block. It was much more interesting and engaging when John and Mary Evelyn led discussions. Additionally, the information flow was very uni-directional. I would have loved to learn more from my peers, and their diverse experiences.",
    "This is an amazing course.",
    "I think a more unified arc would have been nice. Some work could have been done to weave differing ideas together week in and week out. I loved the reading though and all the speakers were challenging and insightful in there own right.",
    "This class is super. Professor Grim and Tucker are absolutely wonderful. Discussions are well-self-regulated and very interesting from an undergraduate's perspective. There was concern at the midterm that the reading responses of ~400 words were so long so it was reduced to just ~200 words. Honestly I did not understand why it needed to be so little, but hey I'm not complaining!",
    "Strengths: Class discussions, various speakers with the expertise and background, diverse reading material, challenging questions by discussion facilitators and even visiting Beinecke Library. Weakness: I wish we had more time for discussions, but having many students makes it harder to put them in charge of questions that takes up most of the class time, although it is also valuable to spend our class time with our speakers that bring so much to share with us.",
    "Strengths are the class discussion and interaction, as well as the knowledge of the professors. Weaknesses are the Canvas discussions, which feel forced and ineffective, and the hit or miss speakers.",
    "Strengths: instructors brought such a level of positivity and hope it really lifted the class atmosphere. Their approach and choice of guest speakers was truly awesome. I learned more in this class than any other environmental studies course I have taken at Yale (and I have taken quite a few!) because of the high level of interaction with my peers! Weaknesses: The weekly responses were a bit long and narrow, but the instructors actually did a great job of recalibrating them mid-semester and by the end it was really a good system that kept you honest without being a burden.",
    "Mary Evelyn and John were excellent facilitators for class discussion. The course could be improved by bringing in more speakers of color.",
    "I really didn't see any weaknesses. The strength was that two professors taught the course with individuality and expertise while jointly relating the same overall message of humility, expertise, kindness and professionalism.",
    "The strengths have to do with Profs. Tucker and Grim they are truly wonderful teachers, and that's because of their genuine passion for these topics and their profound kindness as human beings. I can't think of a weakness of the course."

   "comments": [
    "Make sure you take the time to read your classmates' discussion responses--they're often very compelling and informative.",
    "Definitely take it!",
    "TAKE THIS COURSE! Professors Grim and Tucker are so incredible. And as an undergraduate, it is very refreshing to interact with people who, at the very least, are in a different Yale bubble than undergraduates are. The discussions in this class are so interesting, and the speakers and readings are well-suited for student learning.",
    "Always remain engaged and take a full advantage of visiting speakers as well as your instructors since they have much greater network and connections with various individuals that may serve students' goals.",
    "A good class for the diversity of viewpoints and high-level topics of environmental values. Self-directed final project which gives flexibility to explore topics of interest to the student. Speakers can be hit or miss.",
    "Stay engaged! If you do the readings and really come in with an open mind you will learn so so much!",
    "Take the opportunity to make the final project personally resonant to you. The professors are very open to creative projects and are supportive of a range of learning styles.",
    "1. Be sure you know how to use Canvas for posting responses! And once you do, expect to learn a lot from other students who have also posted. I loved reading my classmates' perspectives on topics covered in class.",
    "If you want to venture outside the FES bubble, this class is one excellent option to make that happen."
