    "I understand pchem!",
    "The class started by dissecting what entropy means, before examining the implications of this on the micro- and macroscopic scales. I learned some of the math behind chemical and biological behaviors. I got a better sense of how we can develop mathematical models of behavior, using just the pertinent information (\"coarse-grained\").",
    "Wow. I learned a whole lot in this class, and I think, maybe, after many many years, finally sort of understand entropy.",
    "I learned a lot about topics I had no familiarity with before, like statistical mechanics, thermodynamics, and quantum mechanics. I also improved my quantitative reasoning skills, which were a bit rusty since I hadn't taken any math classes since multivariable calculus freshman year. I really appreciated the mathematical rigor we applied to the study of chemistry. I also found many of the MATLAB models we ran fascinating.",
    "The third unit was very good, I think I have a deeper understanding of how molecular motors work, and what drives their motion on a micro level, which is most of the time not consistent with our macroscopic biases. However, units one and two were incomprehensible, and I think we too quickly tried to build models that we were based off of physics\/chemistry knowledge that we did not possess. There were no \"basics\" to work off of, and most of the material was so niche that there was no way to find other resources to study from or learn from. It saddens me to say that I don't think I will remember any of the things we have learned from the first 2\/3 of the semester. The next question asks my level of engagement with the course, but it was extremely hard to be engaged with this class when the material was almost incomprehensible, and the resources available for us to study were so limited, scarce, or esoteric.",
    "Not only did I learn physical chemistry, but I also now view science and the world as a whole in a different way.",
    "I learned about models in which biological processes can be applied, and how to create this models.",
    "This was a good course on the fundamentals of physical chemistry, as well as how those seem to play out in practice -- that is to say, an intuitive grasp of how models function, and how physical knowledge can be transmitted to modelling and prediction.",
    "I improved both my quantitative and intuitive understanding of thermodynamics. For example, before I took this course, I didn't really understand the importance of entropy. I didn't get why we sometimes assessed the favorability of reactions with enthalpy, sometimes with entropy, and sometimes with Gibbs free energy. I thought of Gibbs free energy as some strange combination of enthalpy and entropy. Now, I just think about it in terms of the entropy of the universe: free energy is just a way of measuring how the entropy of the universe changes. I also understand entropy itself better than before. I hadn't thought about \"the information theory of entropy\" before taking this course, and now I think I have a better understanding of what, fundamentally, entropy is. We learned a lot about using statistical mechanics to model physical processes. The one thing I feel I sort of missed out on is kinetics. Reaction kinetics are crucial in biology, and I would have liked to come out with a good understanding of what a rate constant really is.",
    "I feel that I developed exactly what was advertised by the course name: an understanding of physical chemistry, with applications in biology. I could honestly just copy and paste the syllabus from the course into this answerif you want to know what you'll learn just read the syllabus, the course very much follows it. What stood out to me was: a better understanding of statistics as it applies to the microscopic world; an appreciation for the usefulness of models, and the fact that models are only as good or as accurate as you make them; a familiarity (definitely not fluency) in matlab; and the ability to analyze biological\/biophysical systems through a thermodynamic and\/or stat. mech. lens.",
    "I learned how to use Matlab and how to take more organized notes.",
    "Changed the way I think about the world. Entropy and the physical laws that follow from it were absolutely mind-blowing. To see the world as a collection of probabilities is truly a different world-view. The course also helped connect mathematical derivations to scientific concepts, leading me to see the value in math as a way to understand the world. The biggest take-away from the course was that enough time spent banging your head against a topic can really lead to some kick-ass revelations and insights."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "strength - teacher engagement with student weakness - material felt a bit disjointed. i can do individual pchemistry things, but don't have a nice coherent view of physical chemistry",
    "One really major strength was that there was an appropriate level of math, physics and chemistry for the mostly biologically-focused students. The biological applications that the course was anchored around did a good job of helping to concretize concepts. Professor Ganim was very dedicated to making sure students could digest the physical chemical concepts at hand, and he was very patient with explaining what I'm sure to him must have been a very rudimentary level of physical chemistry. Overall, I thought Professor Ganim was very professional, helpful, and clear in teaching the class. I would say that the major weakness of the class was its attempt to integrate biology (i.e., DNA melting\/pulling, not molecular motors) while still trying to include straight thermodynamics\/statistical mechanics (i.e., ideal gas law, engines, etc). It was pretty dissonant, for example, to one day be looking at the Otto cycle then the next look at how myosins walk, especially since the whole point was that on a microscopic level motors *don't* imitate macroscopic motors. Maybe in the future the class could be either more focused on biophysical concepts, or on the fundamental physical chemistry, which I think would allow for a better continuity in the class. The other major weakness of the class was the exams, which demanded a very different type of thinking than what we focused on in the problem sets and in class. It would reduce stress for the exams if we had more conceptual (exam-type) problems to work out in advance, either as practice problems, pset questions, or in-class exercises. The exam-type questions we would do the day before the exams were helpful in this regard, but not sufficient to prepare for all the concepts that were being tested on each exam. Overall, I thought the class was okay. I had to take it for my major, and it certainly could have been worse, but it also definitely has room to grow and improve over the coming years. One inherent problem, I think, is that most of the people who have to take the class are just not that interested in physical chemistry, and so unless the biological\/biophysical slant of the class is really scaled up, I don't think people are ever going to be especially excited about taking the class. With that being said, Professor Ganim did a good job making this class as painless and interesting as might be possible, and I really do applaud the amount of time and effort he put into the class. I think he in particular did a great job, even if the topics that underlie the class don't especially interest me.",
    "It was not very clear what students were expected to learn. There was a general disconnect between lectures and exam questions. There were too many gaps in course material that made it extremely difficult to follow along",
    "I really actually loved everything about this class, particularly the grounding in papers\/current research and modeling more than textbook material. I also really appreciated the casual atmosphere of the class and its discussion-based nature.",
    "this is a course that is definitely in its first year. It often felt like there wasn't a coherent topic we were learning about but rather just a disconnected group of ideas.",
    "I learned so much from this course, but I had to put in a lot of work to do so. I believe starting from the fundamentals before diving into the derivations or models we did would have been really helpful. For example, many of us had never really learned basic thermodynamics in general chemistry, or had any idea what free energies were. Starting with a basic definition of things like entropy, heat, work, coarse-grained models, canonical vs. microcanonical ensemble, etc. would have been a huge help. Also, the order of topics should have been reorganized so that we learned all the concepts relating to thermodynamics first, then statistical mechanics, then diffusion, instead of starting with stat mech and then coming back to it at several different points throughout the semester, which made it more confusing for me to connect the dots and distinguish the different cases from each other. I liked learning about the models we used, but I was often confused about how to apply the basic concepts behind them to new situations and how these concepts related to each other. More practice problems would have really helped in preparing for the exams. Overall, I really enjoyed the course because Professor Ganim made class interesting, and I have no doubt that the course will only become better in future years.",
    "It's an interesting class and Ganim is a very passionate and interesting professor who cares about the wellbeing of his students. Because I took it the first semester that Ganim was teaching PChem, it was a little rough and there were a lot of gaps between what he expected us to have already known and our actual background in thermodynamics and statistical mechanics. Nevertheless, he was always willing to meet us during office hours and help explain to fill in said gaps. In the future semesters, this is going to be a great class--it was just a bit difficult being the first undergrad students Ganim has taught in a while.",
    "The strengths of this course was that is presented us with new ways of thinking about the world of biochemistry. We finally were able to build models of DNA, protein folding, and molecular motors, topics that are presented in normal biochemistry lectures but usually with a general \"this is how it works, not let's move on.\" Professor Ziad was also very receptive to his students and was always happy to answer questions, stay after class, and meet outside of class. However, the weakness in the course was that I think it assumed people had to high of a background in chemistry and physics. Most people in this class at Yale have a background in biology and biochemistry, but our exposure to chemistry is limited to general chemistry, and general college physics (which by the way in PHYS 170\/171, the life sciences version of the physics class which I imagine most people took, thermodynamics is not even a topic covered by the class). Another weakness was the shear lack of support or resources for students in this class. The textbook was not helpful, we had little feedback on psets and tests, and most of the time the class was lost. Even the TAs admitted most of the time they were not keeping up with the class and therefore could not help us put what we were learning into perspective. The class experience could have been so much more productive if we were given enough materials to study from, but all we could do was sit in lecture and hope for the best.",
    "The course was generally very unorganized. The notes from class to class were not very cohesive and in class group exercises often extended to the end of class, preventing us from going over the problem at hand and leaving many students still confused. The problem sets required MatLab, which was neatly integrated to reflect the unit objectives but often approached with a guess and check method since he never provided any background information or tutorials for the software. Finally, the exams were often much longer than what should have been given for a fifty minute period and their questions were quite out of line from what we had covered in class or the problem sets. Overall, the course was poorly structured but has the potential for significant improvement.",
    "This course is very interesting and you learn the implications of the sometimes abstract material.",
    "The strengths were in how Ziad structured the course and was responsive to our feedback. The biological models he chose were those which he had all worked with on some level in our biochemistry lessons, so exploring them from a statistical mechanics viewpoint was fascinating and appreciated. I liked the matlab component because it did provide a visual for the course material even if at times it was frustrating and the variable changes appeared to be random.",
    "Throughout this course I gained a broad understanding of, essentially, why biology works the way it does. This course did a fantastic job of using models to explain physical phenomena, especially through MatLab, that really helped me develop a deeper understanding of the physics of biology. I think these discussions of models and also talking about how we developed them and where the parameters come from were hugely helpful. One weakness of the course I felt was the somewhat unstructured lectures. It seemed like there wasn't much of a plan or timeline that we were strictly following, which had benefits (it certainly helped facilitate discussion and left room for us to ask questions about the topics we were confused on, leading to a more personalized learning atmosphere), but also made it difficult to study for exams when we couldn't have a more formulaic structure. The final exam review question sheet given to us at the end was hugely helpful, and perhaps even giving one of those after each module would have helped add some structure.",
    "Strengths were that the professor clearly cared about his students and about making sure we were leaning. He was a good professor and able to keep the class always interesting. Weakness is that it was never completely organized, and didn't correspond to any readings in the textbook. Class time was the only place to learn the material; there was rarely any place you could go (i.e. Textbook or internet) to enhance your understanding aside from office hours.",
    "Could be better organized to show how all of the pieces fit together; as it is right now, the lectures are a little bit scattered and do not relate to each other as well.",
    "Strengths: Excellent vision, clearly passionate instructor Weaknesses: Clearly the first year this course was taught. Lots of little inconveniences, and the course didn't quite \"flow\" as well as it probably will in a few semesters.",
    "From what I've heard, Prof. Ganim took a truly abysmal course (rated a shocking 2.0\/5 on CourseTable before he took over!) and turned it into a good, solid physical chemistry class. Unlike many professors, he really, truly cares. He totally reinvented the course, writing brand-new problem sets, MATLAB programs, exams, quizzes, and videos. He was willing to spend hours on end with me in his office. His dedication is the main reason I took this class instead of CHEM 332 and I have no regrets. The material was incredibly interesting, and cutting-edge. A lot of the sources we used were published quite recently. I learned a lot of stuff (like the Muoz-Eaton model) that CHEM 332 students never did, and I think we understand statistical mechanics better than they do. The problem sets were really, really excellent. The guided derivations really gave me a good understanding of various concepts, like the origin of Gibbs free energy. The MATLAB portion of the course was incredibly interesting and helped me gain an intuition for the concepts. Without the problem sets, there are some concepts I would never, ever have grasped (for example, the Langevin equation). Similarly, the quizzes helped me to realize what I did and didn't understand. I'm not sure if I took full advantage of this early in the class, but the last quiz prompted me to review a whole bunch of concepts I didn't fully understand (like the P-V and T-S diagrams of thermodynamic cycles). Since this is the first year Prof. Ganim taught the class, however, there are a few kinks that still need to be worked out. Here are some things I think could be improved for next year: -The course sometimes felt a little scattered: I didn't always understand how each class related to the previous one, or to the textbook. -Curtail class discussions. I appreciate that you tried experimenting with them and I think that short discussions can be helpful, but we should not spend half of a class discussing one problem. You know the material better than anyone else in the room, and we're there to learn from you. Similarly, I appreciate that you want to make sure everyone's following along, but when you take ten minutes of questions, often people start to ask questions that don't contribute to the class discussion. -Don't let people grade their own quizzes. At the end of the day I think it's a waste of class time. Five people inevitably raise their hands and ask if some incredibly specific answer should count, or if they can give themselves half a point. (I've been guilty of this too). -The class time you'll save from this could be put to a lot of use. You could have time to cover kinetics as well as thermodynamics, which I think would be extremely useful to biochemists and biophysicists. You could cover the important relationships between conjugate variables, which we mainly covered in the textbook and which it took me a long time to understand. You could spend more time going through any derivations that are too complicated to do as \"guided derivations\" for homework. You could spend more time giving specific examples of how to distinguish between a Brownian ratchet and a power stroke. -At the start of the year, I didn't feel that the practice problems given in the textbook were relevant to the exams. There were some concepts for which there were no practice problems at all (like the Muoz-Eaton model). Especially for concepts that are fairly new or taken from primary literature, I think it's important to give some practice problems. Next year, that should be easy-just give them our old tests. -Some of the MATLAB portions of the problem sets could be reworked (especially the Otto engine program, which was incredibly difficult to use). There were also some instances where I was able to do the problem set, but didn't really understand what was going on. Even if we can't code, maybe you could require the students to summarize what the simulation is doing in English.",
    "I really liked how the class put concepts from physical chemistry into practice and showed real world applications of them, especially in terms of biological processes. However, the class had very little structure that was hard to follow, and although the material was interesting, it was not taught in a way that was conducive to learning. It lacked the strength of a normal pchem class, which has a set curriculum that can be followed instead of almost random concepts that were hard to connect to each other.",
    "TL;DR for students trying to get an idea of this course: this is a great course and you will learn a lot. You will probably hear from the grapevine that it's a bit hard to follow and sort of unclear what exactly we're supposed to be learning; that's because it's a new course. It'll continue to improve every year and I would recommend it. Strengths: -the course covered lots of material that was, for most of us, entirely new. A lot of college is re-learning old things more in-depth (achem all of bio), but a lot of this (stat mech, quantum) is very novel, and I appreciated that. -the three units are very well chosen, so that each has a central biological focus that allows for concurrent teaching of a new topic in pchem. -Professor Ganim is always gracious, takes time to answer questions, will email us with supplements when class wasn't clear, and is altogether a great teacher. -There are lots of supplementary readings provided -The textbook covers the introductory material very well and very thoroughly, so you can spend as much time as you need to learning what, exactly, temperature is, even if you only spend 20 minutes on it in class. -The quizzes are designed to give you an idea of what's going to be on the tests, and at what level. I really like this, because the class is, again, new material for us and frankly has the potential for very out-of-left-field tests. Weaknesses: -Despite the three units being well-chosen and clearly delineated in terms of the biological applications, the pchem-direction of the class was not very transparent. Let me clarify. In organic chem, for instance, we spent a few weeks at first on acid-base, electron-pushing notation, and a review of periodic trends. Then that clearly translated into the next portion of the class, when we studied basic mechanisms for alkene reactions. Or, for another example, in the Bio modules, we would spend a few weeks on a clear topic, and then move to another. In this pchem class, it was never really clear what parts of pchem we were learning. For instance, the first unit was all about statistical mechanics and probability distributions, and then the second suddenly transitioned into being about thermodynamics. Looking back, even though the distinction is clear to me now, dedicating 10 minutes at the beginning of class to make the jump would have clarified so much. Basically, I think the units should be more explicitly defined in terms of pchem, in addition to the biological questions, and I think Prof Ganim should take some time at the beginning of each unit not to just pose the biological question, but to discuss the field of pchem that the unit focuses on, how it connects to the previous (if it does), etc. -I think Professor Ganim spent too long in class on small-group discussions. Some were useful, like the one about the 1850s and the First law of thermo. Others were better left to sections, like derivations involving calculus . The class is only 50 minutes, and sometimes we would spent 30 or 40 on these discussions, and then would run out of time to discuss the answer. -For my taste, Prof Ganim also moved too slowly in general through material in class. He was very willing to take lots of questions, which is important because again, this is very new material to most of us. However, I think as he teaches the course again and again, he will just need to answer those questions in his lectures, without having to make students ask them. I got the sense that he was intent on not just talking at us; he wanted us to be engaged and ask questions. This worked well, but at times, for certain topics, I wished he had just had a solid, fast-paced 50-minute lecture that we could take notes on, and ask questions about in office hours or section. Running out of text here but other points: -parts of psets a bit busy-work-y, ie plugging in numbers to matlab codes. -Communication between TAs and prof could be better -first pset should include a calculus refreshr",
    "This class required little to none mandatory reading, which was nice, but also maybe why the material was so difficult to deal with. Most STEM classes go off of a textbook, but this class was rather open ended and difficult to track. Sometimes it was unclear what we were required to know. We often spend a lot of the class discussing in small groups which is not helpful, as most of us don't know what's going on. This class was too open ended and the professor believed we knew more than we actually did.",
    "Strength: relatively flexible, not too much work, caring professor, cool material. Weakness: I didn't think the Matlab portion was very useful. I think it would have been a much better use of our time to go through the math behind the concepts we covered as homework. I found the grueling pain of going through the mathematical details outlined in the textbook to actually be helpful in understanding the concepts and giving them a credibility that is hard to achieve by just seeing them in class explained as qualitative concepts. So more math and less Matlab would have been good.",
    "This course needs a little more fine tuning. From what I have heard, the teaching seems to be way better this semester than it has ever been in the past. Professor Ganim is an incredible instructor. He is patient, straightforward, and thoughtful of his students. My suggestion would be primarily with the tests. The homework, material, and reading were all very cohesive and high-impact, but I often found myself lost or pressed for time on the tests. I preferred the quizzes' style since it seemed to flow better with the material. The tests often had us jumping through mental hoops that those of us with weaker stat-mech\/thermo backgrounds take longer to perceive. I would look into having the tests outside of class time so that there is more time to take the tests. I thought the final was more fair than the midterms. I strongly think there should be review\/open-floor question sessions for all of the exams, and not just the final. Having that review session really helped me see what to focus on."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "CHEM 328 with Prof Ganim is fine. You learn the basics of thermodynamics and statistical mechanics nand apply them every so often to biological situations (DNA melting, protein folding, molecular motors). Workload consists of one pset each week, which were fairly straightforward, and three exams, which were pretty conceptual and hard to study for. I suspect this class is better in its current form than in previous iterations (i.e., with Prof Baxter or Prof Yan), but if you're mostly interested in biology (like me) you'll probably be mostly uninterested in this class. Credit where credit is due: Prof Ganim makes a really admirable effort to make this class engaging and accessible for a room full of non-physicists\/non-chemists, and he's definitely one of the most responsive\/accessible\/all-around nicest professors I've had in the sciences at Yale. If you have to take pchem you could do worse than this class.",
    "Not with the way it is currently taught. Professor Ganim is extremely intelligent and helpful. However, the course was not taught in a way that is comprehensible. The course perhaps assumes a much higher background knowledge of thermodynamics and statistical mechanics than most students in the class had.",
    "Honestly, Ziad is great; the material is interesting if you like more quantitative substance.",
    "No. Only take it if you need to. There was no way to study. It seemed like all we were learning were random facts.",
    "No, you will be beyond lost in this class. The textbook is not helpful, the TAs are clueless, and the material is so esoteric that you cannot even use outside resources to help you. The class also assumes you have a background in solid chemistry and physics, when you're probably only a biochemistry person. You probably have to take this class for your major, so just sit through it, be patient, and this too shall pass.",
    "I would not recommend this course given its lack of cohesiveness throughout.",
    "And once again, like the 99% of times in my Yale STEM career I was the guinea pig for an underdeveloped class. I wouldn't recommend this class, but if you are an MBB\/CHEM major, you'll have to take it. Don't get me wrong, Ziad is a kind, genuine, and understanding professor. From day one he created a warm environment for his students and made himself available for office hours, email questions, you name it. This class has been around for ages, but Ziad was a new professor. This means the lectures, psets, and exams were all taken by myself and my classmates for the first time. We were given a roadmap of the things we would vaguely \"learn\" but it was hardly communicated what types of physical chemistry problems we were expected to know how to do. It was only during exams where I finally had a feel or what I was supposed to be able to understand and know but by that time it was too late. I blame the MBB and CHEM department for failing to outline \"what do we want undergraduates of our discipline to be proficient in?\" Or \"By the end of their physical chemistry class what skills do we want them to master?\" I left the final exam knowing disjointed concepts and facts and a vague understanding of the subject I had been studying for 3+ months. My recommendation is as follows. If only 15% of the required textbook is relevant to the course, get a new textbook or make your own. Readings, often expected to clarify things, did hardly nothing to my understanding. It's hard to be confused but even worse when there is no concrete text that you can turn to, so what do you do? You sit in that confusion. For the scientific papers in the reading there should also be more follow-through. They need to be hashed out in section, quizzed so that we know what we need to know, discussed in class. If an exam problem is expecting us to analyze data we need to have practice in class. PSETS need to be more problem based. We did a combination of derivatives and matlab simulations, none of which actually appeared on the test. The pset models need to be scrapped and matlab should be overseen in section or class. There also need to be more practice problems in general! I understand that Ziad was often creating things as we went but that left students at a disadvantage, because you can only test your knowledge when you have a representative problem.",
    "I definitely recommend this course. The material is so interesting.",
    "Take this course if you need to take it for your major. I don't know much about the regular pchem class so I can't compare it to that, but the new bio pchem was professor this year, Prof Ganim, was new and did a great job of being enthusiastic about making sure we were learning. I think there were quirks to the course since it was his first time teaching that'll hopefully be figured out in future years. If you want a good grade, you *must* attend class. The textbook doesn't give a good understanding of the material, and getting notes from someone will never give you the whole picture.",
    "I really enjoyed this course -- if you would prefer to be graded by you ability to apply skills rather than your ability to understand content, my guess is you will enjoy it too. The exams were a bit unpredictable, but I thought it was a fair trade-off for a more substantive way of going about the class (as opposed to a traditional lecture).",
    "MB&B students are already required to take physical chemistry, but I think it's useful for other biology students as well. It really gives you a better intuition for a lot of concepts that are very important in biology: chemical reactions, how proteins fold, entropy, etc. For example, I did not fully understand the relationship between entropy and free energy before I took this class. If you're reading this review, you have likely already decided to take physical chemistry and are now deciding between CHEM 328 and 332. I encourage you to shop both classes, but ultimately if you're a biology student, I'd recommend this one. Prof. Ganim works really, really hard, and is very dedicated to the course. He writes all of his own material, makes Youtube videos of derivations, and will sit with you for hours to go over anything you are curious about or don't fully understand. The material is interesting; although we didn't cover some important stuff that was covered in CHEM 332 (kinetics, for instance), we talked about some cutting-edge stuff that they didn't. I think we spent a lot more time modeling processes than they did; for example, we discussed the Muoz-Eaton model, which allows you to predict whether a protein is likely to be folded or unfolded at a given temperature. In addition, this course exposes you to MATLAB. You don't actually need to write any code yourself (Prof. Ganim writes it) but you can play around with his code and you'll likely pick up a little bit yourself. This was the first year Prof. Ganim taught the course, and there are a few flaws. The course felt a little disorganized at times.We spent too much of class time on class discussions: at the end of the day, he knows the material better than we do, and I would have rather had him cover more material. The practice problems weren't particularly relevant to the tests, which were pretty difficult. However, I'll cut him some slack, because I heard the course was truly terrible before he started teaching it, and he basically had to rebuild it from scratch. Besides, he's a hardworking guy and I strongly suspect he'll fix some of the glitches before he teaches it again next semester. A few words of advice for the course: -Read the textbook in the beginning. The reading lessens and becomes less critical as the class goes on, but you really need to understand the first bit (ESPECIALLY the chapter with all the relations between conjugate variables! I think it's 6 or 7). -Go to class. A lot of the material you learn is pretty cutting-edge stuff (like the Muoz-Eaton model). It is NOT in your textbook, and he posts some but not all of the slides on the website. If you don't go to class, you will have no idea what is happening. Also, you will miss the pop quizzes (they're a tiny part of your grade but you don't want zeros). -Do ALL the problem sets. Start early, work hard, and check in section or with friends. They're a big part of your grade and are more relevant to the exam than anything else. (The practice problems in the textbook were not very relevant. Hopefully, he'll give you our old exams as practice next year). -Study for exams by doing practice problems. Practice qualitative stuff (especially knowing the general shape of graphs you've studied, like free energy curves and P-V\/T-S diagrams for heat engines) and quantitative stuff (homework-like problems, finding entropy of things, etc.) He gives you an equation sheet on the test - you may want to ask him what's on it so that you don't waste time memorizing those equations.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course. You're probably taking for a major so you don't have a choice, except between this and the normal pchem class. I would say, compare their syllabi. This course is exactly as billed on the syllabus. It requires you to put in some outside reading (I highly recommend just googling the topics and using inurl: .edu to find online versions of pchem lectures. My favorites were from Ucolorado and u Arizona, iirc), but that work and the understanding it will bring you is its own reward.",
    "Don't take this unless you have to. And even if you have to, you're better off taking the Chem version one. This class was way to open ended and tried to make difficult and often confusing connections to biology.",
    "I'd recommend this course with the condition that you are ready to do your own extra work on it to get something out of it. The course is essentially an introduction to statistical mechanics via a biological angle, which is very cool indeed. But there is a lot of math and study that you must go through in order to get to a very profound and rooted understanding of the concepts. I think that is the only way to do well in this class: to reach a thorough understanding of the concepts, not to just half-ass it. 9 problem sets, occasional pop quizzes, 2 midterms, one final. Ganim is a fairly chill professor, but he does care about the students a lot. But you mustn't follow his chill if you want to do well. He doesn't emphasize the math a whole lot and tells you to focus on the big concepts, but the exams really require a very grounded understanding of the concepts, from math all the way to big idea. So don't be fooled. You'll need to act a lot on your own initiative to learn the material and reach an understanding that makes you say Eureka!",
    "Awesome class that seems to be better taught than it has been in the class. Not too much material, but you will need to spend time with it. 328 is definitely different in terms of structure than a traditional pchem class. Take it with Prof Ganim, he is an awesome instructor who actually makes sense! The tests are a lot more abstract than the material leads you to believe, however."
