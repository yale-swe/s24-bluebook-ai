    "Learned a lot about interpreting structures of proteins and various methods to assess protein function.",
    "I learned all about drug development and the process required from finding a potential drug and target to a marketed drug. I learned about the different techniques used, and specific real-world cases where they were used.",
    "This was my first exposure to protein kinases, so I learned a lot about this family of proteins.",
    "Learned a brief overview of kinases, different techniques to study proteins, and protein crystallography."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: very useful if we want to become more familiar with how and what a protein structure can be used to answer functional questions; Weaknesses: sometimes material was repeated; it could be better structured if professors coordinated their lectures more",
    "Strength- cool topic. I like how a bunch of different ways to approach drug discovery was looked at, and that the professors teaching each section were directly involved in the research so were able to provide real examples. Weaknesses- at times, due to the fact that each lecture was separate, it seemed kind of disjointed. I liked how the kinase section was grouped together, but maybe the other lectures could be ordered in a more coherent way.",
    "A weakness of this course is that having so many different instructors makes it hard to get any clear themes across. It was difficult to figure out what we were going to be tested on since every instructor had different expectations. There was also a lot of overlap between lectures, since it seemed like there wasn't a lot of communication between instructors on what others had covered. Overall, I think students would benefit from this class being more organized and being taught by fewer instructors.",
    "The first half was fine. In the second half, it was clear the m2p2 students had a great deal of knowledge about protein kinases, so maybe it was my fault for not realizing how behind I'd be.",
    "Weaknesses: The lecturers seemed bored by their topics and did not seem excited to have to teach. Material was not presented clearly. Foundational concepts during the technique-based portion of the course were not explained (i.e. real versus imaginary space\/Fourier space during the crystallography portion). In general, lecture slides jumped around and did not tell a story. Exams should have been constricted to the 1.5 hour timeslot of the course if not separately scheduled as a final, even if that meant not having a question for every single lecture. Not every exam question needed to have multiple parts, which added time to the exam. A lot of professors assumed that all students were in the Pharmacology Department, which was not the case as the class is cross-listed under several departments. Strengths: Ben Turk's lecture.",
    "Hope there could be less instructors in this course. Less topics but deeper."

   "comments": [
    "Yes. It is useful though it could be improved.",
    "Yes. Cool topic that is important but not touched upon in my program (MBandB), that I think is important to know, using techniques that we do touch upon in our courses.",
    "I would not recommend this class to someone in my program. The content seemed disorganized, and there wasn't continuity between lectures or between instructors. I don't feel like I learned a lot in this course.",
    "I would not recommend this course to another student. The syllabus makes the class look interesting and beneficial for someone who wants to study proteins, but the class itself was not enjoyable."
