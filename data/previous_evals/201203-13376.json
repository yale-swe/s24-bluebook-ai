   "comments": [
    "Pretty solid course. The readings are not super exciting, though I enjoyed Shakespeare and Donne. Professor Hurley was very enthusiastic and relatable, which made section more fun.",
    "For those taking it on a whim, no. For those with a more durable interest in English literature, yes.",
    "I really enjoyed the course, but a good part of that derives from enjoying the poetry. If you are not an English major and just looking for a class for kicks, this might not be it. If you are an English major, you must take Major English poets, and you should take it with Professor Hurley.",
    "Required for an English major. Besides that, you get to improve your critical analysis skills for literature. The reading, the comprehending and the writing is all demanding stuff, for sure, but it's worth it.",
    "A great background of English poetry. Professor Hurley was really strong on Chaucer and section was a lot of fun.",
    "ENGL 125 was far better than I thought it would be. Chaucer and Donne were great, Shakespeare was alright, and Spenser was... well... you only have to deal with him for a few weeks. It's not THAT bad. You'll survive.Shop around though because the professor makes the class. I was lucky to have a phenomenal professor and phenomenal classmates, so I had a great time.",
    "I would recommend English 125 to another student because of the very interesting course material and exceptional teachers. Yale is most known for its humanities programs, and Yale's English program is not something to be missed by any major at the university. Chaucer alone has had remarkable influence on writing in the English language, and adding in Spenser, Shakespeare and Donne broadens the scope of the class, showing the development of the language from the Middle Ages to the Renaissance.",
    "I enjoyed this course far more than I thought I would. The readings aren't bad. Professor Hurley is great, even at 9 am. As with most English classes, sometimes discussion from the other students, and myself as well, was a tad lackluster or repetitive. Take it though. You read important poets. You learn from the papers, which aren't too terrible. Sometimes it's frustrating, but even when at Yale, you can always turn to sparknotes, or jstor, or your professor if you have someone awesome like Professor Hurley.",
    "I would take it, especially with Hurley. The readings aren't particularly fun at first but you'll enjoy them once you get past Chaucer. Readings go quicker after him, too, so if you can hack it, I would take this course."
