   "comments": [
    "Despite the shortcomings, this class really is worthwhile. The texts are amazing, if boring and long, but again, they are amazing! This is that upon which our civilization is based!",
    "Covers 1500 years of history, lots of reading.",
    "This class has WAY TOO MUCH READING. You will not be able to do all of it. Professor Slanski has ridiculous expectations for what a student can do in a week; it's simply unattainable. The class is worthwhile and your writing will improve, but to keep up with all of the readings is a Herculean task.",
    "I enjoyed a lot of the reading and learned a lot about ancient society and culture. However, H&P is the weakest of the three sections because it's unclear what it's supposed to be. History? Historical method? Political thought? Felt disjointed to go back and forth between the different approaches. Needs to be redone -- split up into clearer sections (like Literature and Philosophy) and\/or adding more religious texts. Definitely needs more historical context of the work (the mini lecture right before finals was not very helpful).",
    "I would absolutely recommend DS. The program is amazing. I would never have read many of the authors we read in H and P if it weren't for DS, and I'm so glad I did. That said, be prepared for a lot of reading.",
    "Yes I would recommend this class to another student because I found the reading and discussions very interesting.",
    "It was a good class. I would recommend the class to another student: Prof. Martin was great at making sure we not only understood the texts but also at making us question the texts: what ideologies they put forth, how they've been used and abused throughout history, etc.",
    "I learned a lot from Directed Studies, but it's not for everybody. If you want a good, general overview of the Western canon, DS is perfect. However, if you don't like feeling rushed and would prefer to get to know the material in more depth, you could feel frustrated. Especially with H&P, don't come in expecting a standard history course. It's a mix of historiography and political thought with much less history than you'd expect.",
    "Inthis course, you will read some of the most important works of history and politics (from Herodotus to Aquinas) in a short amount of time. This course also focuses strongly on writing. Professor Martin is very engaging and has many interesting points of view on the works discussed. If you have him, don't change."
