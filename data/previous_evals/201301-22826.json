    "A great class to introduce you to the world of engineering. Touches on all disciplines. IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN ENGINEERING YOU MUST TAKE THIS CLASS! Tons of fun, but sometimes the workload is pretty heavy",
    "It is a great course to take to learn if you are interested in engineering.",
    "This is a very fun class, different from a lot of others you might take at Yale. Don't worry about the lab, most of the time you'll enjoy it anyway. The projects are fun and it's rewarding to see you final products as you create them. You are introduced to a number of skills and will most likely find one part of the class really interesting. I highly recommend this if you are at all considering engineering\/applied sciences. I'm an English major who took the class on a whim because I had a physics background, and I don't regret it for asecond. Looking into a double major now.",
    "Absolutely recommend. One of the best classes I've taken at Yale.",
    "I would definitely recommend ENAS 118 to a student interested in any type of engineering. In general, it is very difficult to find a hands-on course that doesn't have very stringent prerequisites. Accordingly, ENAS 118 is the perfect opportunity to explore various types of engineering without having to reach a high level of proficiency in math and science courses. The topics you cover, particularly the use of Matlab, SolidWorks (CAD software), and arduinos, are very fun and relevant to real world problems and issues. It's also a great way to become acquainted with the CEID and learn how to use the 3D printers!Finally, Professor Dufresne is very passionate about the material and is a fantastic instructor.",
    "ENAS 118 is simply one of the coolest classes I have ever taken. Dufresne and the TAs are super helpful and will do anything and everything they can to make sure you enjoy the class and learn the material. No midterms, no essays, no final exams, no tests. For every unit you go through you get a problem set or sometimes 2 depending on the unit, that you can complete fairly easily. Or you can wait to the last minute like most of us and then go to the TA office hours the night before they're do and complete them then. This class will give you the foundational skills to become a modern innovator: 3-D printing design, programming, prototyping. Don't be worried if you don't have a strong math\/science background. Literally, anyone can take this class and get a whole lot out of it for not a huge time commitment. The only negative side is the lectures can get kind of boring when there is too much useless facts thrown at you that you won't even use in the lab.",
    "ENAS 118 is a wonderful course that I recommend for engineering and non-techincal students alike. It is innovative, creative, fun, exciting, and overall amazing. Thanks to Professor Dufresne, you will undoubtably call this your favorite course at Yale.",
    "It's a very fun class. Some useful skills (MATLAB and Solidworks), some fun ones (Arduino programming, 3D printing), and some drier units (environmental and biomedical engineering). The final project is a lot of fun, there were great clients this year, and hopefully that will continue. Not a lot of work. Occasional problem sets, which took anywhere from 30 minutes to 5 hours, and more when you're working on your project.",
    "I would definitely recommend the class. It was a great way to survey te engineering degrees if you were interested in one of them or even just considering engineering in general. It was a nice mix in my schedule as it gave me a class were I could actually apply what I learned hands on, which is different from most classes at Yale. TAs were super amazing and were around to help all the time and were extremely knowledgeable about everything. Professor Dufresne and professor Fahmy were really approachable. Also, the Final Project was a great way to tie what we learned up in a really interactive way. I learned so much through this class.",
    "A great way to see all aspects of engineering",
    "I had absolutely no experience in engineering before this course, and you should not feel like you have to before taking ENAS 118. It is perfect for people who just want to play around with 3D printers andarduinos (we got a free one!) while learning basic engineering principles and hanging out in the CEID. The HW assignments can be time consuming at times, but overall this was an easy 5th class for me that I really loved.",
    "If you are at all inclined towards the engineering disciplines but are undecided, take this class. It was a lot of fun and an entirely manageable workload considering that it is an engineering credit.",
    "It's an inconsistent workload and the class is being figured out, but it was really fun and engaging.",
    "I really enjoyed this course. It was a great survey course that taught fundamental engineering concepts and programs for use in the engineering fields. There were amazing teachers and the course was interesting even for non engineering majors.",
    "Great class!!! Take if interested in engineering!",
    "This class will probably adjust a lot because of student feedback, since it was a first-year program, but in general: it was a very fun intro to engineering (and to the CEID, which is a great workspace), but I didn't feel like I was learning a lot--possibly because I was a little more certain than I should have been about which branch of engineering I was interested in, so I found some of our units much less interesting than others.Working on the final projects was a great experience, though, and I'm glad I took the course for that alone.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class for anyone even slightly considering an engineering major. It provides an overview of many of the engineering fields. As opposed to a lot of the science and math lecture classes that are prerequisites for engineering, lessons involve a lot hands-on learning. The Professor and T.A's are so enthusiastic, and the project for each engineering field covered is fun. Plus there are guest speakers, field trips, and the final project, where you create a solution to an actual problem given to you by your client.Also, you get the benefits of using CEID resources. A really fun, engaging class, now I definitely know I want to major in engineering.",
    "If you don't know exactly what type of engineering you want to do, take this class. It'll get you excited about engineering and help you figure out which discipline most appeals to you. If you have any interest at all in engineering, take this class. It'll make you want to major in engineering.",
    "It has been my favorite class at Yale. What other class lets you play with the 3D printer one week, visit a water plant another, and then build a functional chicken coup with a laser cutter the next? I had no intention of being an engineer when I started, but this class has really changed my mind. With no quizzes or tests, it made learning more fun than forceful. The labs were very nontraditional and were actually fun. For the final project, you get to solve problems for \"clients' from the Yale community. Take this class!",
    "ABSOLUTELY -- a class relevant to EVERYONE at Yale in a really cool, resourceful space too.",
    "Take it! So much fun for all all and any majors with even the vaguest interest in engineering. You will learn gain so many new technical and technological skills. Really, take it!",
    "I'd absolutely recommend this to any student who is marginally interested in engineering, even if they don't have a very strong scientific background.",
    "Definitely take this class if you are a STEM major that is swamped with pre-requisites and huge lecture classes. You learn some very valuable skills such as MatLab, Arduino, SolidWorks, and 3D printing.The class is very easy (especially with prior programming knowledge) and just a lot of fun.As a survey course, I feel like it is supposed to help you narrow down what you want, but it does the opposite. You don't feel like you get too in depth in any one disciplin, which makes it hard to really understand what is each type of engineering.But take it if you have a free spot or just want a chill, useful, awesome class.",
    "I would definitely recommend enas 118 to anyone who is interested in engineering. It is an extremely fun class where you are exposed to the different engineering disciplines that Yale offers. In the end you walk away with a taste of a myriad of essential skills such as using Solidworks, Arduino, and Matlab, in a way that you can easily delve into deeper if you are interested. You also gain a bit of knowledge, a taste, in the different disciplines, usually by focusing on one specific topic in each discipline. Unfortunately, because the modules do not go into much depth (and because they were all so exciting!), the class was not particularly helpful in helping me decide which engineering discipline to pursue. Rather, it validated my desire to be an engineering, illustrated what engineers do, and taught me how to think like an engineer, especially through the final project. The workload of the class was low, excluding some hiccups in the beginning of the year and the final project. Therefore, its possible to take this as a fifth class. Professor Dufresne is fantastic professor who is full of energy and cares about his students. Professor Fahmy is also good. This is a fantastic hands-on course that helps shift Yale Engineering in the right direction.",
    "ENAS 118 was one of the most interesting and helpful classes that I have taken at Yale. It gives a great sampling of all the types of Engineering offered and helps give an idea of what majoring in each field would be like. The projects that go with the topics aren't too time consuming and are generally very rewarding. The class is very well taught, Professor Dufresne is one of the best professors that I have had at Yale. He is enthusiastic and engaging. If you are considering becoming an engineer, take this course.",
    "This class was amazing. Prof. Dufresne is one of the most dynamic teachers I have ever had, so passionate and understanding and honestly pumped about the class and engineering. We basically spent about 2 weeks doing a crash course on each branch of engineering (ie, meche, ee, biomedical, environmental, etc.). It was very evidently made for freshmen still deciding a major, as we talked about the courses offered in each major on the first lecture of each unit. At the end we did design projects in teams for real clients that came to us from the Yale community, and it was amazing to do such a hands-on project as a freshman. I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND this class.",
    "An overview of many different kinds of engineering, this course offered the opportunity to learn the basics of each engineering discipline before exploring the more specific practical applications of the discipline in labs and homework. I would recommend this course for anyone who wants help deciding which branch of engineering to pursue.",
    "YES TAKE THIS CLASS. One of the best classes I've taken at Yale, and it's a shame that this is the first time it's offered, because if I took it freshman year I would definitely have majored in Engineering. I'm still glad I got to experience it. I'm inspired to Master in mech E.",
    "ENAS 118 is a unique course. It was not very time intensive, and there will be weeks in the first half when you will be bored because you are not very interested in the kind of engineering that is being discusses. The second half you will work with a client on a project, and that is a great experience.",
    "Definitely take if at all interested in engineering or even if not. Great, great, great class! Not really exaggerating, almost everything about it was awesome. The labs were great, the field trip was great, the final project was great. It had a few boring lectures, but all classes do. Lots of perks (free arduino, ceid membership if dont have already, 3d printing access). Best class I took last year! You learn how to do lots of cool stuff, (Solidworks, arduino, 3d printing, etc.) especially if you never were exposed to any of this stuff in high school. No background required. This class is how school should be -- really, really fun, never wastes your time, never have to worry about homework or grades or tests, and learn a ton of cool stuff.",
    "ENAS 118 is a fun survey course for anyone who is interested in learning more about engineering but does not have a lot of prior practical experience with making electrical\/mechanical stuff. If you have prior experience, you may find yourself bored; otherwise, I highly recommend it. But recognize that this is not a rigorous course by any stretch, and that you will not learn anything particularly deeply. It is designed to inspire you to pursue further interest in engineering, and to give you basic facility with engineering practices."
