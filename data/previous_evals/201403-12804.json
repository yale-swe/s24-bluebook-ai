   "comments": [
    "The theme and syllabus for this class are amazing. I read so many texts\/watched so many films that I otherwise would never have found. Class discussions were usually pretty good, although they could get a bit dry and tedious at times. Prof. Creswell is incredibly accomplished and a wealth of knowledge. He can be a bit inaccessible\/distant at times, but this was also his first semester teaching at Yale which might account for some of that. Also keep in mind that this is more \"literature\/film and revolution\" than \"art and revolution\" in general.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. The texts\/films were, without fail, excellent, productively difficult, and intriguing. I did not have any background knowledge of the revolutions and time periods study in Cuba, Algeria, Morocco, and Palestine. Luckily though, the professor has a ton! and readily provided enough to make classroom discussion feel grounded without taking away too much focus from the artworks.",
    "I would absolutely recommend Art&Rev to another student. The texts are really phenomenal, and the chances that you will come across them in any other circumstance are slim to none. Professor Creswell is amazingly knowledgeable about the subject, and the workload is not at all overwhelming. I think that Professor Creswell could have encouraged\/facilitated a more active setting for discussion, but in general, it was an amazing context in which to learn about certain historical movements which I knew little about, through the lens of really brilliant writing and film.",
    "I would recommend it to anyone interested in non-Western literature.",
    "I would highly recommend this class IF you shop it and like the contributions of the other people who will be taking it with you. Material is very interesting, ideas are thought-provoking, and Creswell has high standards for analysis."
