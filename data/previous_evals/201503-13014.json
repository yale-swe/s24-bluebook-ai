    "THST 325 was an excellent course for someone hoping to get a brief but well-informed survey of South Asian theatre from Sanskrit to now.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course! A great way to get to know an area of theater that's completely unfamiliar. Professor Pamment is great, and the work is very manageable. A mid-term paper and a final presentation a project, as well as each student leading the class one week - a format that I really enjoyed, because it made the material much more accessible.",
    "Professor Pamment is only here for a year so you will most likely not be able to take this course but if for some reason you ever can, I would for sure say take it. This is one of the best courses I have taken at Yale both in terms of the material it opened my mind to and in terms of the way it was structured. If you take advantage of the final project to explore a topic of your own, you will get even more out of the class."
