   "question_text": "What knowledge, skills, and insights did you develop by taking this course?",
   "comments": [
    "This course does an excellent job of honing critical reading and reasoning skills. The articles on the syllabus are dense and sometimes require a great deal of effort to understand fully, especially the ones that deal with economic concepts. Professor Horan expects that everyone comes to class not only having done the readings, but also that everyone is prepared to compare major concepts and themes, as well as to think of potential problems with the readings. She has high expectations for in class discussions and writing assignments.",
    "This semester in Urban Politics & Policy, Ive noticed that in order for inclusive policies to catch fire in urban communities, concerted local action among these communities is also necessary. That is, a bill or legislative act can only do so much. It was definitely an enriching experience. It would have been nice if we could have read more policy readings written by people of color since many of the topics that we discuss speak on the conditions of people of color.",
    "Policy analysis, literature review writing, lesson planning.",
    "Urban governments aren't radical, and I'm not sure that they can be.",
    "A lot of theory surrounding how we look at urban policy issues. I'm not sure I left the course able to create policy, but I am far more able to criticize policy in its potential downfalls and uneven effects",
    "I learned about the frameworks in which to theoretically analyze urban politics. Also about the issues of police reform, regionalism, and the rebuilding of New Orleans and how to confront them.",
    "I learned a lot about the conflicting interests and parties in the urban politics landscape and different ways to frame and understand those struggles. I did not previously have a good understanding of what specific roles local government served and this class was helpful for fleshing out my understanding. I was also able to learn about how class and race intertwine and act as major factors in the urban politics arena. I developed skills of interpreting the major claim and argument in political science articles and analyzing assumptions and logic utilized.",
    "I was able to gain an entirely novel understanding of the workings of politics, at a municipal as well as state and federal level. I found the theoretical frameworks we learned about especially engaging especially when applying them to understand why various policy issues have been approached in the U.S. the way they have. I am very grateful to have taken this class.",
    "I learned a lot about myself, and how I fundamentally struggle to parse through dense academic writing. Slogging through the course has helped me develop the skills i need to become a better reader and a better student."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This course was very good at weaving the readings together in ways that allowed us to understand their contexts fully. A weakness of the class was that, at times, there was a correct answer that the professor was looking for when there wasn't only one answer to the questions that she was posing.",
    "I think a course like this depends a lot on the group of people taking it and on the teacher's ability to not let one or two students derail the discussion.",
    "Strengths: Cynthia Horan, engaging reading and conversations, methodical and comprehensive essay topics",
    "I think it is an effectively taught political science class. The instructor is clearly very knowledgeable and the readings are very informative. The organization of the class is very effective. I do not think it is an African-American studies class (at least how it was taught). As an Af Am major (the only one in the class) I often felt like I was one of few talking about the things I wanted to learn about in the class and like I had to stretch the conversation in order to have the discussion touch on race and Blackness. Readings could touch more on race and different perspectives on it within each issue.",
    "The strengths of this class have been the level of challenge and level of engagement expected of us when taking the class. I believe that writing reading comments has given me the opportunity to explore deeper the texts I read and ask important questions. I enjoy the seminar presentations. I would say one weakness was the lack of articles on race. Although in each section there are a designated few, this is not adequate for presenting a full range of perspectives and ideologies."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "I would certainly recommend this course to any student interested in urban politics or even politics more generally. The first half of the course delves in to the most common academic frameworks used for analyzing urban politics, with focuses on the role of neoliberalism, economic development, coalition building, the role of citizen input, and NGOs. The course is definitely difficult (the readings are lengthy and\/or there are many readings every week, on top of weekly reading responses), but if you put a lot into it you're definitely going to come away from the class with an entirely new perspective on political problems facing cities.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student who is interested in analyzing theoretical policy frameworks. If you want to gain reading comprehension skills concerning policies that affect communities of color, then this is the class for you.",
    "Yes. Good course to help understand constraints of urban policy-making. Professor Horan is incredibly attentive and devotes a great deal of time and attention to helping her students get the most out of the course.",
    "Unsure. I think I'd tell students to temper their expectations. I heard going in that the course would mind-blowing and radical. It's a political science seminar. Don't expect anything too radical.",
    "yes! anyone interested in urban politics, or policy in general should take it.",
    "This class really teaches you to understand urban politics and hot to analyze them very well.",
    "It depends. Only if they are like me, I think the class fits a very specific leftist niche for students who are patient and attempting to bridge the gap between social justice and policy solutions.",
    "Yes I would. This course challenges you in ways that enable you to expand your intellectual understanding and writing skills.",
    "Yes I would. Very difficult and at times disorganized, but it really pushed my thinking about politics generally."
