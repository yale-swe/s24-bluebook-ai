    "It's an open-ended discussion of sculpture. Assumes some prior exposure; leaves you to your own devices.",
    "Yes I would recommend it if you have some familiarity with art and the discourse that surrounds it- if not- at least an interest in the theory of art- it's not enough to just enjoy \"making things\"",
    "I would recommend this course to students who want to become more familiar in the shop and who would otherwise not have the time or confidence to use the shop during monitor hours. By the end of the course, I felt like I was able to use the shop freely and ask bigger questions about how material, form and scale played a role in my conceptual goals and larger projects, so I would recommend this class to someone who could continue to take advantage of these newly gained skills once the course ended (a sophomore, junior, or first year grad student)."
