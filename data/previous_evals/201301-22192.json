    "I think ASTR 155 has the potential to be a great class. As long as you don't take it with Louise Edwards. The concept of the class is actually really interesting - However, the execution of all of it was extremely disorganized. You are not taught how to use the programs necessary to analyze your data. You are not given helpful advice on how to construct your lab report. The problem sets do not reflect anything discussed in class. Everything is graded quite harshly, which is ridiculous because you are essentially teaching everything to yourself. The amount of work you do is atrocious given that this is a half credit class. I think this class needs to be revamped entirely before it can be considered worth taking. Furthermore, professor Edwards was somewhat of a nightmare to work with. She was really disorganized and very very unapproachable. I don't doubt that she's knowledgeable in her field, but she truly is a terrible professor. I've tried meeting with her several times to go over issues with problem sets and lab reports, and I have found that my time has been wasted. She is not approachable at all, and actually gets really defensive when you try to raise concerns with her. Her feedback on problem sets and lab reports is vague and unhelpful; she also is extremely untimely with things, and it often takes her an extraordinarily long time before she actually returns your work to you (which is frustrating, because then you get docked for making similar mistakes in the work you've submitted since turning in that original assignment). Her lectures were mediocre and did not at all reflect what she apparently expected us to know (which was what we were graded on in the psets). This class was very much a learning experience for me because it really taught me to not rely on my professor for any sort of help.",
    "A good class in that you get experience using the observatory's 16\" telescope and collect some pretty interesting data and make some nice pictures. Prof. Edwards is nice, but definitely not one of my favorite professors. There are 6 labs, and three to four problem sets--it ends up being significant work for only half a credit.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to anotherstudent. You will learn A LOT. It is probably more time consuming than a .5 credit class suggests, but if you love physics\/astronomy\/space, the effort is more than worth it.",
    "No. Too stressful, too frustrating, too badly-taught.",
    "Yes! Take this class! Sure, it's pretty time-consuming, but who wouldn't want to image nebulas 1200 light years away from Earth and to empirically determine the distance to a star late at night at Yale's observatory in a small class (with whom you'll end up bonding A LOT) under the guidance of an enthusiastic, passionate professor? Trekking up to the observatory late atnight became a sort of meditative experience before studying the scope and history of the universe in the labs. Admittedly, the labs and problem sets were very time-consuming, and I sometimes found myself trying to use unfamiliar software to complete the assignments, but looking back, I'm really glad I took this class. I took it CR\/D, which allowed me to appreciate the topics we discussed in class while not having to worry about my grade, and I'd definitely recommend doing so. Professor Edwards is super accessible and really friendly, and she's one of those rare finds in Yale's intro science courses who's interested in doing good, solid science. Lectures were pretty fast-paced, but you learn a lot, too. If you do end up taking this class, get to know your classmates ASAP; start a group email thread\/text because you'll need each other to get through the course. Don't let yourself miss this opportunity! Yale classes can be so theoretical and abstract that a practical, hands-on-the-telescope kind of class like this is really refreshing.",
    "Take it if you love to learn more about astronomy, but if you aren't an astro major or never took it before, prepare for a steep (but possible) learning curve. It'll be a bitch, but totally possible to get an A. The problem is, it's a lot of work for a half credit. but if you love astronomy, this is a great intro class."
