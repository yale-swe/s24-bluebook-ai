   "comments": [
    "Well if you're taking this course after HEBR 110, you've got to. If you've placed in, go for it. You learn a lot and it's pretty fun. If you're deciding on taking 110 and looking ahead to see what L2 is like, I'll repeat what I said earlier. It's challenging but fun. I was not a native speaker or have any ties to the language at all. I took it as a random language I was interested in and wanted to learn. Go for it, you'll have a lot of fun, the work is worth it, and you'll walk away familiar with one of the most amazing languages taught at Yale.",
    "You'll know the present and past tense for 4 of the 7 verb structures by the end of L2. It's a fun class, Dina is great, and after finishing this I feel like I'll be at least able to function on a basic level in Israel this summer. Yay Hebrew!",
    "This class is a good continuation of the first semester (L1) Hebrew -- it expands on many of the same concepts, teaches additional grammar, and prepares its students more for the harder levels of the course. There is a lot of homework, especially since it is a daily class, but the homework is instrumental in retaining information. Doing a good job on the homework and journals is often the largest part of studying for any quiz or test. Dina is a great teacher who is always around for extra help or to answer questions, and all in all Hebrew is a really enjoyable and interesting class to take.",
    "If you're reading this eval, you probably already took L1 Hebrew and thus don't need much convincing to take this class, so instead, some words of advice. Make flashcards or something, anything to keep up with words week to week. It was easy to do well on weekly quizzes by looking at the words the night before or even the morning of, but by the end, I feel very shaky about going to a higher level. A few other notes: you'll have a few short oral presentations and one larger final presentation that can be done in pairs if Dina approves. There's a lot of freedom to write and talk about things that interest you, which I love. Also, most of my class is going to Israel over the summer to do an assortment of awesome things, so keep that in mind as an endgame.",
    "Great class, helps you take the step from basic hebrew to more advanced hebrew, would recommend to al students interested in hebrew",
    "Lots of Hebrew in little time - totally worth it!"
