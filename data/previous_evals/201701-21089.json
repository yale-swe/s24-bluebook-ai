   "comments": [
    "This course taught second year Russian in one semester. Compared to its first semester counterpart, it covered grammar far more extensively and made me feel confident in my preparation for third year Russian.",
    "Not only did I learn an incredible amount of vocabulary and grammar, but I also learned the nuances of Russian spoken language. This is wonderful course that is extremely thorough.",
    "In the second half of intensive first year Russian, you do a pretty comprehensive review of the grammar from last semester (so don't worry if you missed some concepts--they'll all be covered again, from how to say someone looks like someone else to negation to genitive plural). A lot of new grammar is also introduced. There isn't much increase in the amount of vocab you have to learn per week, but the workbook assignments get longer."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "As the class is historically smaller than when I took it, this usually is not a problem. However, valuable class time was sometimes devoted to answering questions about unrelated semantics of Russian culture and I felt this time could have been better used.",
    "The amount of time the instructors spend on each topic, for the pace that we go at, is really amazing. There could be more time spent practicing speaking skills, but I also understand the necessity of learning fundamental grammar.",
    "The teaching in this course is EXCELLENT overall. I think it would be helpful if we could somehow have more oral assessments. We had a voice recording assignment at the beginning of the year, but it was never repeated.",
    "A generally amazing class where I learned a lot, especially grammar. I think that it might benefit from some medium\/long writing assignments, to really get a sense of our writing level, as well as some more small speaking assessments or projects."

   "question_id": "YC409",
   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "I would only recommend this course to a student if they were serious about learning the language. It is a large time commitment to do well in the course and if proper time is not devoted to practicing it can be difficult to keep up.",
    "If you're serious about learning Russian, you should absolutely take this course. If you're not, you should not.",
    "If you're reading this, you probably already took the first half last semester. Take this class if you did the first two semesters of Russian already! And don't be afraid to make up soap operas about your class in the dialogues on your tests every week!",
    "Professor Muravnik and Hashbat are two of the most engaging, kind, and enthusiastic educators at Yale. Russian grammar is by no means easy (especially at the intensive pace), but through their patient explanations and constructive feedback I can definitely see a huge improvement in my Russian abilities. Also, despite it being an intensive course, I didn't find the workload to be too much more than my other courses. I looked forward to this class every morning and I will miss it greatly next year. I 100% recommend this class to anyone interested in Russian.",
    "An amazing class! Really the best way to learn Russian -- the class goes along at a quick steady pace but is never too fast. Prof Muravnik and Minjin are both phenomenal and incredily warm teachers."
