   "comments": [
    "Fun class, you learn to really think about art. Sam kindof walks you through the basic techniques and then puts you in front of a model and sayd \"here, draw\". He lets you do whatever you want with any materials that are there, which is really cool and definitely got me thinking more creatively. Also, drawing from a live model for the first time was really cool.",
    "YES! This is one of those courses that you absolutely have to take before your yale career is over. Even though I didn't feel like I was actively being taught how to draw, my work is much stronger now. I learned stuff without feeling like I was learning stuff. It was really a fabulous break from the hectic yale life, and Sam Messer is one of the coolest professors I have ever met.",
    "Yes; Sam takes a great approach for true beginners in trying to teach them how to think about visual art rather than drilling techniques. Our class was almost half seniors who wanted the opportunity to draw before leaving Yale (and a class with almost no homework). It's a nice way to start the day, and a good addition to your schedule.",
    "Yes definitely recommend",
    "It is a great class if you want to draw. Take it with Sam Messer because he is the best and really teaches you how to approach drawing.",
    "This is not a traditional drawing course. It takes a more philosophical approach that focused on how you approach drawing and visual language. This approach was fantastic, and I definitely got a lot more out of that than I would have had it been a purely technical course. That being said, at times, a bit more focus on drawing techniques, but not too much as to detract from the true strengths of the course as is, would have been nice. I really enjoyed the course and it was a really supportive environment. The assignments provided good direction and opportunity to explore different ideas. You can spend however much time you like on the course and will be able to get something out of it.",
    "Take it if you can get into the class. You'll learn a little about drawing and rehearse that small amount you learned over and over. I had high expectations for a relaxed yet enriching class, and it was just the \"relaxed\" part.",
    "This course is a fascinating and thoroughly enjoyable introduction to drawing, not simply as a technical form, but as a whole visual language. Sam incorporates more conceptual elements of drawing than rote practice of technique, which creates an open and mature atmosphere and room to make ART. There is tremendous freedom in this class, which creates environment that encourages you to think deeply about what you are doing and to re-conceive of what drawing even means.",
    "Basic Drawing has a nice structure - you begin with some foundational exercises and build into a more expressive and free-form practice. The real drawback is the lack of accountability for your work, which at a certain point is pretty demotivating. But for someone who's pretty self-driven, it's a great class.",
    "A great experimental drawing class that will help you learn to think outside of the boss.",
    "I would recommend basic drawing to any student. It is a great experience and a nice change of pace. It is both relaxing and stimulating.",
    "Great course. Basically you draw for four hours a week. We also did some sculpting and painting.",
    "Take this course if you have ever had an interest in drawing. It's fun, relaxed, and instructive. A great way to begin the week.",
    "I would recommend the class to someone interested in drawing and learning different techniques in a chill environment. The class doesn't have any outside work except for sketching in a notebook so it's not a hard course.",
    "Everyone should take this class.You will learn something whether you haven't drawn since elementary school, or if you've been drawing since you could hold a pencil. Professor Messer's approach to basic drawing is very interesting\u0097we moved back and forth from 3D to 2D, from observation to abstraction. The class room environment is very relaxed, but you still learn a great deal, especially if you put the effort in.You will not only learn how to draw, but also what it means to produce art and be an artist."
