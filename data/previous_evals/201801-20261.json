    "developing better writing habits",
    "I learned the necessary tools I need in order to succeed in an American Studies graduate program.",
    "First, we gleaned a variety of methodological frameworks that are used in American Studies. This allowed us to learn how different scholars with different methodological training are currently doing work in the field. I also learned about the publication process, which is crucial for graduate school. As a class, we exercised the writing process, learned how to draft an article for a specific journal, practiced writing the abstract and the query letter to editors, and even learned about the review process.",
    "How to write, organize, structure and elaborate a publishable paper.",
    "Interdisciplinary research methods was an invaluable course. Professor LaFleur and Professor Barraclough not only provided individualized and necessary training in research methodologies, they also were able to provide our class with familiarity and knowledge of the field.",
    "This course helped me develop a daily writing practice for the first time in my life and pushed me to become a more \"public\"\/collaborative writer by letting others (peers and professors) into my writing before it was polished. I noticed the quality of my argumentation improve with this consistent feedback - I especially appreciated having the opportunity to meet one-on-one with a professor at every stage of the writing process. I was able to talk through my ideas as they were taking shape while also discovering new directions for my work that emerged in conversation."

   "comments": [
    "the Belcher text was less helpful than the one-on-ones",
    "Strengths: As a co-taught course, I was able to learn from two, not just one, amazing scholars in American Studies. Since we are all very different learners and educators, it is always great to see how to different professors manage a co-taught class. Weaknesses: I was not given feedback on certain assignments (query letter, 5-year CV) and I felt it would've been helpful.",
    "The course improved My writing.",
    "The only weakness was the textbook used in the course. While parts of the book were incredibly generative and helpful, other sections created needless extra work. That being said, Professors LaFleur and Barraclough were adept at adjusting the text to the course. The strengths were the depth of knowledge provided by both professors about the field. I worked closely with Professor LaFleur in particular, and found her line edits and generous feedback to be particularly useful in my professional and scholarly development. Working one on one with Professor LaFleur was the course's greatest pull for me, I was able to incorporate her comments into my research and she pushed forward my ideas in new and interesting ways."

    "yes, with the above revision",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone interested in American Studies. Not only was the material interesting, but the professors were incredibly supportive and really want you to succeed.",
    "Yes, as a first-year graduate student in the interdisciplinary field of American Studies, this class was very important for my growth as a scholar. Both Laura and Greta are excellent mentors, passionate about the field, and willing to teach you what you need to know to succeed in academia. I am so grateful they designed this course!",
    "Yes. I think everybody in the humanities and social sciences should take this course.",
    "Yes! This course was a fantastic foundation for coursework in American Studies. Both Professors LaFleur and Barraclough posses intellectual strengths that compliment eahother and create and intellectually rigorous environment. I would recommend this course for students who are looking for an opportunity to gain experience writing and thinking alongside their Professors.",
    "Absolutely! I think every AMST PhD student should have access to this sort of methods\/research intensive pro-seminar."
