    "Yes! If you're a musician, it's a must in more ways than one. It was a valuable course, though sometimes more than I had expected. It definitely gets harder as it progresses.",
    "Music 218 is a fantastic class. Definitely take it, and take it with Sarita. You learn strategies for melodic dictation, first diatonically, and then with accidentals and modulations. You start with single line melodies and move to two parts and then start listening to actual pieces of music. Additionally you work on sight-singing and a lot of harmonic dictations. Sarita is an amazing teacher who is really funny, caring, and energetic. The best part of the class is there is no homework and it is entirely practical (I think I have a grand total of two pages of notes from the entire semester) so you spend the whole class singing and listening and dictating. The only downside is the half hour keyboard lab once a week. Figured bass is hard, and the amount of time you get with the instructor each week is not nearly enough to master it. But it's still really useful to know. Definitely take this course if you love music and want to get better on whatever instrument you play, or even just become a more active listener of music you listen to. And I can't stress enough how great Sarita is. She's the best.",
    "This is a wonderful course for anyone musically inclined. It has changed the way I listen to music. However, I would strongly suggest that students interested in the course join Professor Kwok's section, as she is the reason I was able to succeed in this course. I needed a lot of help and she was in fact the one who offered to meet me outside of class. The class doesn't have regular assigned work aside from the keyboard labs, which vary in the amount of work they require.",
    "This is a prerequisite for the music major, and the skills taught are arguably more important than theory for the performing musician. This course teaches a tremendous amount only over the course of the semester, and you leave with a real sense of accomplishment (and the ability to dictate almost any melody you might hear)",
    "I highly recommend this course to anyone who wants to improve his or her musical ear. The keyboard lab is also a great way to improve basic musicianship.",
    "Take it, take it, take it. Not at all necessary to take 210 concurrently; though it's recommended, I was totally fine. Anyone with any interest in improving their listening skills and musicianship should take this course. And don't slack on the keyboard practicing; they won't push you but it's super helpful."
