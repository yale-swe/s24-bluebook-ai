    "A solid knowledge of Hilbert and Banach spaces, spectral theory, and weak\/weak-* topology.",
    "I learned TONS about functional analysis: Hilbert spaces, Banach spaces, operators, different topologies on vector spaces, and a lot of other results and subtopics. In addition to the material, I think my skills of analysis skills (analysis as in the field of math) improved and developed.",
    "In Math 325, I learned Functional Analysis, and got particularly strong grasp on the concepts of Banach Spaces and Hilbert Spaces as well as of linear operators on these spaces. I also in general learned how to tackle ridiculously hard math problems and proofs."

   "comments": [
    "Minsky is its biggest strength. No room for improvement here.",
    "Overall this is a very good course. The lectures were often a bit fast though, not giving enough time for me to grasp everything, but some of this I think is that there's so much material to cover and so little time.",
    "Good lectures, tough but fair problem sets and tests. Professor minsky is also very helpful in office hours.",
    "I only wish this course had more applications to PDE's",
    "The homework, the exams and the textbook are incredible and brilliantly designed and chosen. While the lectures were also nice and clear, I think the course had more material than I was able to keep up with, so I always felt behind in lecture and unable to follow. This could be entirely my fault though. Afterall Professor Minsky makes an effort to make sure students are caught up and prepared for lecture via the courselog. On the other hand, perhaps the course was a bit too faced pace for most students. One suggestion might be to cut back a bit on material relating to LCS and TVS and semi-norms and keep the scope of the course focused on Banach and Hilbert Spaces, but dive deeper into application or other results for Banach and Hilbert Spaces. However, obviously the pace of the course should be dictated by the average level of the students next year and not my experience or ability.",
    "I thought the course was overall pretty strong; the problem sets seemed to be well related to the course and were returned in a timely manner. I appreciated the policy of being able to turn in up to two problem sets up to a week late. I also appreciated the the midterm and final were done in take-home format, since it's nice to get to poke at some slightly more difficult problems and to be able to turn in work that is somewhat polished for such exams. I found that the feedback on the problem sets was not particularly useful - mostly it seemed that the feedback I got regarded the omission of lemmas that I found were too trivial to justify disrupting the flow of a proof to explicitly prove. Maybe it would help to make the problem sets a little more difficult. (I think the length of the problem sets was good - but some of the questions seemed a little on the easy side)"

    "Any course with Minsky is a lifetime opportunity.",
    "This is a very good, and challenging course. Minsky is a great teacher, so if you get the chance to take this with him, do it. The material is really interesting. Compared to other similarly advanced math classes (high 300's), the material in class is slightly less challenging (at least for me). On the other hand, the psets are rough! There usually is one really challenging problem that can take hours. When I took it, it seemed like most of the class was up quite the night before problem sets were due each week. Minsky assigns take home exams, which are similarly difficult. If you've taken 305 but not 320, you should be prepared for this course, but it demands a high level of mathematical maturity.",
    "Take this class. Good lectures, tough but fair problem sets and tests (they can take a substantial amount of time). Professor minsky is also very helpful in office hours.",
    "I would definitely, especially if Minsky is teaching it. Just take whatever Minsky is teaching.",
    "This is a hard class and you have to be willing to work hard if you want to take it and do well. The class gives two challenging takehome exams which each took me 20-30 hours to complete. The homework and exam problems are generally neat and elegant. Minsky has a talent for asking questions that are hard enough to challenge you and make you feel proud for solving but not so hard that you cannot eventually solve it. I am glad I took this course even though it was not always easy, especially because functional analysis seems to be a door to a lot of higher level mathematical analysis."
