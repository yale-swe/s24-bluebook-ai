   "comments": [
    "This is a great in-depth introduction to civil wars, how they work and how to study them. It's definitely intensive and a class you absolutely have to pay attention to, but it's very well laid out and fascinating.",
    "I would recommend this class if you want to be forced to deeply research an obscure war from every possible angle and to learn more about how to unravel the complexities of a topic as broad as civil war. It is a lot of work and frustrating at times.",
    "Great class, one of the best I've taken at Yale. A good amount of work but if you pick a case that you're genuinely interested in the work doesn't seem bad at all. Some weeks I legitimately looked forward to writing the weekly 2-page memo. Stathis knows more about this topic than anyone you know knows about anything, period. He presents it in a way that is both interesting and accessible.One thing to be wary of: if Andres is the TF, the grading will be inconsistent, arbitrary, and, on the midterm, excessively nitpicky. That being said, don't shy away from the class just because of that, or else Andres wins.",
    "The course is different from most others at Yale, for better or worse. If you like independent research, this is a great course--you pick a civil war from the last fifty years or ongoing, and apply each week's lesson to that war in a weekly memo. The memos can be as time-consuming as you make them, but doing the research over the course of the semester makes the final report a breeze. The course requires self-motivation, and you won't really have a sense of your grade in the course for much of the time. Professor Kalyvas is a dynamic lecturer who has done groundbreaking research in the field--he's an expert who is eager to share his knowledge--though he does not put slides or notes online, so take good notes! His lectures often include questions and insights that no one else in the room picks up on, but which afterwards seem obvious. He loves to call on you at random and expects you to know the answer. If you don't mind being caught unprepared, it is actually a great way to learn your case and the material. Overall, a course whose subject material could not be more important to the world at large, and a class with great appeal to a self-motivated student.",
    "Amazing course. Even if you aren't a Global Affairs major, it is a great way to really learn about a country. Teaches you how to conduct research and write a paper in a short time frame.",
    "Violence and Civil Strife is a wonderful class if you want to learn about what happens in a civil war. Even though it is a political science course, it is very direct. There isn't much philosophizing and you run through theories in lecture. It is very much a listen and learn class, but you can ask questions. Stathis does call on people, but it's not nearly as often as other reviews said. No section, which is nice, but the classes feel very long.The work can be a lot, but it's manageable. The readings are essentially optional and only supplementary, because you read about your war instead. Every week you learn about a new aspect and the memos are related, but you only get the prompts on Wednesday or Thursday and are asked to turn it in by Sunday at 8PM. It's horrible! The research usually takes a long time, and I ended up spending every Sunday on the memos. Any other day would be better. Overall, I felt I learned about many aspects of my civil war that I would not have known to look at otherwise, but that I lack an understanding of the sequence of events that happened within the war.I'd recommend it. Great lecture and fascinating.",
    "Great class. It's much more interesting for me to do independent research rather than assigned readings.",
    "One of the most thought provoking and insightful political science courses I have taken at Yale. Definitely take the course if you are willing to put the time and effort. Allows for independent study on civil war of your choosing and no mandatory assigned reading.",
    "Yes definitely take it. This is by far one of the best classes in the Political Science department. If you are interested in wars (civil wars in particular) then this class is a must. You'll learn all the intricacies of civil wars from top to bottom. Prof. Kalyvas is one of the best political scientists in the world who deals with various aspects of political violence. He was an awesome instructor and I always looked forward class. The weekly memos are engaging. The mid-term is very different from any other exam you might have taken in a poli sci class it makes you apply the theories instead of just asking you to restate them by rote memorization. Basically this class was very rewarding. You should at least shop it and give it a shot!",
    "No- did not learn that much more about the subject and had a very high workload.",
    "You will learn SO MUCH in this class, but only take it if you know you can devote A LOT of time to it. Everyone gets to pick a civil war that they will spend the rest of the semester studying. Every week the professor will introduce new concepts in class. You will write weekly memos about how those concepts apply to your civil war, and you will do all the research about the civil war yourself. (These memos are basically short research essays.) I would recommend picking a war you already know something about. There will also be a midterm (it's easy) and a 10-15 page paper due during Reading Week that synthesizes all your knowledge and analysis from the memos and research. It's a lot of work, but you get a feel for what real political scientists do and you get a great introduction to the discipline.",
    "This is a great class with a great professor. One of the few classes where each and every lecture is enjoyable. The format of the class is interesting, with little to no readings but with a lot of research, and I think I learned a lot more from this style.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone interested in the study of war since civil wars have become the prominent form wars take in the nowadays. You also learn a lot about the different conflicts that have taken place recently in various countries and explore deeply one conflict of your choice. Because of this not only do you get to learn about theory, but also just current and important events",
    "This class is an excellent introduction into political violence. The class covers the theory of political violence while allowing you to get in depth knowledge of one case study.",
    "Yes! A great course! Professor Kalyvas is very engaging and lecture was always great! The main focus of the class is on civil wars and their respective onsets, actors, fighting, violence, and conclusions. Each student chooses a civil war to focus on for the course of the semester and becomes an expert on their topic. The workload is manageable and spread out over the course of a semester. Theweekly memos may seem daunting, but they are only two pages and graded on a check\/check plus\/ check minus scale. The midterm and final paper are fairly straightforward. I would recommend this class to anyone interested in learning about civil wars and civil war trends."
