    "An engaging seminar. Take it if you can.",
    "Perfect class for people who don't have much prior knowledge about reproduction\/gender studies.",
    "TAKE THIS IF YOU CAN.",
    "Whoever you are, you should try to take this course. Even if it has nothing to do with your academic interests, I promise you it will make you think in whole new ways about reproduction, about gender, about the roles of kinship and family in society. Reproduction affects everyone, even those who don't want kids (think about the stigma against people, women in particular, who say they aren't interested in being mothers), and it is such a complicated issue that integrates biology, medicine, sociology, anthropology, public health and media. Look at the New York Times today, and I guarantee there will be something about reproduction in the first two pages. Professor Almeling is a wonderful professor, really funny, engaging and approachable, and she leads discussions very well. This was definitely one of my top three favorite classes I've taken at Yale.",
    "Great course! It was hard getting in this year - all junior & senior SOCY majors and all grad students got in, and seniors had to write an essay. Each week covered a different topic of reproduction - pregnancy, infertility, birth, surrogacy, gamete donation, etc. The discussions were lively and the professor did a great job at managing the conversations. Gives you a great perspective on how reproduction is used in the state and in people's lives.",
    "Amazing seminar. Three mini papers and class participation! Some of the best seminar discussions I have had at Yale! Take it no matter what major you are.",
    "Everyone should try to take Politics of Reproduction. It is a topic that is pertinent to all, men and women alike. I learned so much, not just about typical topics like abortion, but about the medicalization of the whole process and reproductive responsibility. If you want to grow as a person, you should take this course. And it's a non-intense writing credit, so there's no downside!",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS!!!!!!!!! IT WILL CHANGE THE WAY YOU THINK AND LIVE FOR 100% THE BETTER!",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to anybody mildly interested in rhetoric and constructs surrounding reproduction. I've told all my classmates to take it- it should be offered every year, so maybe Rene can pass it off to someone else next year if she's not here??",
    "Yes! An eye-opening survey of topics related to reproduction, an issue that affects everyone. This seminar made me wish I studied sociology sooner.",
    "Take it if you can! Love the different people that take the class. You learn so much.",
    "Take this class! It's totally worth it!"
