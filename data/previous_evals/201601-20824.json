    "Span 120 is like Span 110 kicked up a notch. It's still a wonderful intro course despite being challenging, and I feel like after two semesters of intro Spanish at Yale, I've learned so much and can now hold a simple conversation in Spanish. I recommend this class! The Spanish department at Yale is so wonderful and worth it; you learn a lot and still have a lot of fun.",
    "Spanish L2 requires work, but is very rewarding.",
    "If you need it",
    "Great course. Grade is broken down into smaller chunks than SPAN 110 which makes it more manageable and, in my opinion, easier to do well in the class. If you did 110, you know the drill. If you're starting at 120, just make sure you keep up by doing the work each night, make Quizlets for vocab, do the extra grammar practices, etc. Pretty straightforward and very enjoyable overall, coming from someone who took Latin in high school and hated it. DEFINITELY take with Profesora Sab. She is great, always willing to help, and extremely enthusiastic. Spanish Department is very fair in general. Can't go wrong.",
    "Excellent & informative class that will give you basic Spanish skills in a short time while holding your interest.",
    "Yes, take it if you have taken L1. Take it with Lourdes. She is the best.",
    "The curriculum is wonderful and varied, but homework many hours of homework.. WIll require much effort.",
    "Spanish 120 is harder than Spanish 110. There is more homework but the homework is less repetitive than L1's. The class does a good job of forcing us to speak Spanish without preparation. I learned a lot of Spanish this last semester. I highly recommend the course with Profesora Sab. She's so funny and energetic and truly enjoys getting to know her students.",
    "A very well organized and structured class with a clear syllabus, not too much work, and learned grammar well. Prof Sab is so enthusiastic and happy to be at every class and encourages students to see her at office hours. Seems as though the only way to get enough practice speaking is by immersion."
