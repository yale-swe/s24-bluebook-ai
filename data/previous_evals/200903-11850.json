   "comments": [
    "Take it if you are already very proficient in Japanese, or if you are fluent at speaking but not very good at reading.",
    "It definitely demands a high literacy and fluency in the language. I would recommend the class to any student who has reached the basic standard, and to those who want to develop a more sophisticated knowledge of the language.",
    "This level of Japanese course is entirely focused on improving your writing and presentational skills. There is very little attention given to learning new grammar. However, you will still be taking kanji quizzes at the beginning of each class (the number of characters is kept very manageable). Overall the class is designed to foster discussion on the reading or on the in-class presentations given by students. - Be warned that unless you feel comfortable speaking at a conversational level you might feel overwhelmed by some of the students.",
    "The readings are interesting, and I especially appreciated learning about Murakami Haruki.Hiroe Sensei is very knowledgeable and has much to offer in terms of both Japanese culture\/society and technicalities of the language.",
    "Fifth-Year Japanese is a pretty good way to keep your skills up, although there is not enough writing practice and not enough review of basic but easy-to-forget vocabulary from earlier Japanese courses. Professor Hiroe is experienced and knows his stuff. He\u0092s always available to meet, which is helpful. The class is not as lively\/energetic as the earlier years. Typically, each class begins with a Kanji in Context quiz. Then, there is a speech or news presentation from an appointed student, then a discussion of the subject presented, and then areview and discussion of the yomimono (reading material). This routine can get a bit monotonous, but on the whole I am glad I took the class to keep up my Japanese. You\u0092ll encounter a good number of heritage learners in this class, and it helps your accent to listen to all of them. Also, there is no final exam, which makes the experience a lot less stressful."
