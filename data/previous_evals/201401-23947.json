    "Some of the speakers were great! Peter Tyedmers, Jennifer Blesh, Bill Mebane, and Fred Kaufman were the standouts.",
    "Erin Schnettler, the TF did a phenomenal job organizing the speakers for this class and the opportunity to go out to dinner with the speakers after they spoke was far and away the best part of the class. This gave me the chance to follow up and go in depth on a variety of topics and it gave the speakers a chance to get to know the students more. All were excited about talking with Forestry students and excited to hear feedback about their talks and innovations, and I hope that this can continue onto next year as well.Allowing each of the students to explore their own innovation and then present to the class was also a great way to share ideas and allow the diverse interests in the class to be explored.Learning about risk analysis and learning how to use metrics and methods of quantifying risk was valuable aspects of the course.",
    "This class allows a lot of flexibility and independent inquiry. It enables students whose interest in food may not be well-represented elsewhere to pursue questions that interest them.",
    "It's one of the few ones on food!The LCAs of various food systems were valuable.I didn't know anything about the importance of aquaculture before - learning that was useful.",
    "I liked our discussions toward the end of the year.",
    "Guest speakers, diversity of thoughts from presenters and classmates",
    "Discussion sections were engaging and brought out a lot of great critical thought, especially as the semester progressed.",
    "The guest lectures were well planned.",
    "Guest speaker based seminar series are my favorite",
    "The memos we wrote were really interesting, because we learned a lot writing them and got to hear a lotof interesting ideas from our classmates when they presented! Class discussions were also interesting, especially later in the semester when the structure became a bit firmer. The guest speakers were also great!!!!",
    "I loved hearing from all of the guest speakers. Having guest speakers allowed us to cover a wide range of topics--all of which I found fascinating."

   "comments": [
    "Need a course facilitator\/instructor more familiar with the subject, if possible, which would also give the course some continuity from year-to-year, hopefully.",
    "I think it's important to have more structure to the Wednesday classes when we didn't have a speaker. Classtime discussions could be more directed at critiquing the discussed innovation and coming up with alternatives or solutions to risks and barriers. There were several classes when we broke up into groups and had smaller, project-based discussions before coming back together as a class and I thought this was an incredibly effective way of engaging with the course materialI also think that the speaker experiences could have been improved if each student were to come up with a list of questions to submit the day before the speaker came and then the TF could circulate these questions to the speaker to prepare them. Instead of using almost the full time for a speaker and only the last couple minutes for questions, using half of the time for questions would lead to a richer and more engaging experience for all.I would also recommend giving students better and stricter guidelines for final papers. There was a wide variety both in the subjects of the final paper as well as the quality of the final presentations, and it would be good for everyone to have clearer standards to comply with.",
    "The structure was a bit disconnected at times - a natural hazard to a guest speaker-based course. It would also be interesting areas other than technology and a format beyond the standard 15-page report.",
    "It's hard to have a good discussion based class when many students (including me sometimes) are so naive.More basics taught early on would be useful.",
    "More readings (guided with more critical thinking about topics, not just background reading).",
    "I would have liked additional discussion time following lectures.",
    "Some of the speakers were not so great.",
    "There needs to be more focus in the discussions on Mondays.",
    "Although very relevant to modern innovation and global food systems, I think the choice of speakers and content in general overlooked the idea of food system improvements and the idea of how they can be adapted or improved for the future, instead focusing on how things currently are without any suggestion that they need drastic overhaul if we are to address the food problems of today.",
    "Organization of class structure",
    "This is most likely a logistical issue that comes from accommodating so many different guest speaker schedules, but some of the modules were a little bit scattered. There wasn't a flow from one guest speaker to the next. Again, that could be largely unavoidable."

    "I really liked the link between the guest lectures and class discussion. Class discussion provided a good balance between factual content and open discussion of the speaker& theme. The speakers could be a little hit-or-miss at times, so this forum was a great 'debrief.'",
