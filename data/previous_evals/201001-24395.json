   "comments": [
    "What is well-being, how do we measure it, what role should policy play in helping us improve our well-being, given human behavioral irrationalities. A really interesting look at behavioral economics. Class can be a little unstructured, and writing a reading response w\/someone else is a pain, but it's not too high stress, and is a very unique and interesting class. The people in it - including the prof - are very high caliber even by Yale standards.",
    "The class is structured around participation. The whole class is just one big discussion about whatever the topic of the week is and the professor, while very knowledgeable, did not teach much.",
    "You look at real life applications ad new research in the field, making it super interesting and actually applicable to real life.",
    "I would recommend this to another student as a pretty informative and easy senior seminar, but it's really about how much you put into it. Too bad it's not going to be taught again",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class. Its great for any interest, and has a very interdisciplinary feel.",
    "yes, it was boring, but probably better than every other econ seminar you could take in spring.",
    "Econ 460 is a great option for the senior seminar. You have full control of the workload since the reading is really dispensable when it comes to class discussion -- too often co-opted by poorly-thought snippets of pop-psychology. Do not expect to gain anything from what is said in class. That being said, I would suggest taking it -- and not because it can treated as a gut. Firstly, the topics are genuinely stimulating and worthy of being meditated upon. Secondly, rarely will you find a class that is as interdisciplinary. Notions of welfare are loose and as such, a multiplicity of academic perspectives can illuminate the subject. Thirdly, Jamison is great professor (he is probably one of the most intelligent people in an already intelligent department) and a great guy. Take it.",
    "The class is very interesting, as one studies the field of behavioral economics from a very critical and academic point of view. But it is mostly based on student participation, which I believe detracted from the class. I would have liked to hear more of the professor's organized and deep insights.",
    "This class deals with some interesting topics, but the structure of the class was somewhat incoherent. I think this is mostly due to the relatively new nature of the material--behavioral economics is a relatively new field. For each class meeting, two pairs of students present the articles assigned for the class, and then this is followed by class discussion. This means that doing the reading is not really mandatory unless you're presenting, which can be a blessing or a curse. Discussion was not always interesting. I would say that if you believe in behavioral economics, this would be a great course, but if you're somewhat of a skeptic like me, then I don't know. But it will certainly make you view economics through a different lens.",
    "It's an interesting class, people will really get into the discussion. You'll have a lot of fun discussion, read a lot of compelling articles. It's a good, more humanistic capstone to an economics education. Nicely dovetails economic and psychological concepts.",
    "I really enjoyed this class. The readings are fun, and not too heavy, and the class discussion is always engaging."
