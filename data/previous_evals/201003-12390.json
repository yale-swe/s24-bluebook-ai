    "Music 222 will help you improve as a singer and performer no matter what your skill level is going into it. Richard Lalli is WONDERFUL and truly cares about each singer; he does not compare you to the others in the class and appreciates your individuality, making it much less nerve-wracking to perform and get criticized in front of the class each week. The class is absolutely manageable, but the more work you put into it the more you will get out of it. The weekly coachings with Sara Kohane are absolutely incredible; she is a brilliant musician and coach, as well as a truly compassionate person; I feel privileged to have had her as an accompanist and instructor. If you have the opportunity to take this class you definitely should.",
    "if you're interested in music and you want the chance to perform classical solo pieces in a relaxed environment, definitely take this class!",
    "In class we listen to music, learn IPA, and at least one person sings every week. You'll work one-on-one with the coach and you'll build a decent repertoire. You'll love this class, even if you've never sung opera before.",
    "It's really good in that it makes you learn repertoire very quickly. I expected a course that looks at technique to some extent and didn't get any of that, but I do think learning repertoire is a good process for any singer. The class has a variety of levels, so it's worth auditioning for for less confident singers. The big issue for me was the timing! It was at night, which was not convenient for scheduling rehearsals during the week.",
    "A course to study art song and its performance. You will give one or two concerts and perhaps perform in a master class with a visiting teacher. The course is light on homework (papers, research, etc) but adequate voice practice will surely make up for that. I would absolutely recommend this to anyone who is interested in improving or honing art song performance and gaining an appreciation for art song.",
    "MUSI 222 is a course in learning classical repertoire. Class consists of listening to everyone else sing, which is really boring. At the end of the course, you'll have memorized about five songs. Not really worth it.",
    "This is a good course if you'd like to improve your performance practice. Professors Lalli and Kohane are brilliant musicians and kind people. They will help you improve.Do be prepared to work - this class is a different (and rewarding) kind of work from other classes, but learning rep, learning IPA, and perfecting your performance takes time and effort.",
    "It is a relatively broad exploration of classical vocal music. The intermittent writing assignments are completely useless and sometimes class feels rather unproductive if Prof. Lalli does not offer very substantive notes, but generally the course offers good exposure to classical music from various regions."
