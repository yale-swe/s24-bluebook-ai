    "I would recommend it (but it's required anyway) - you will read a lot of difficult material, but will emerge a much better scholar and thinker, even if you aren't a music historian.",
    "It's a required course, but I would absolutely recommend it. It really broadened the way I think about the way history is written.",
    "Yes absolutely! A truly unique course that arms you with knowledge of historiographical issues that aren't often discussed in such depth in music courses.",
    "I would summarize it as a fiery trial that might not be the best for you physically, but will be very good for you academically if you make sure to dedicate as much of yourself to it as you can. I would wholeheartedly recommend it to every single other Music Department student because it's a required course for everyone, and not taking it would probably get you kicked out or something."

   "comments": [
    "Even though this seminar focused on music historiography, and thus was nominally the \"music history proseminar,\" it was incredibly helpful to me as an ethnomusicologist. I know have ways of thinking through the historiographical issues inherent in any ethnography project. Definitely very helpful and really enjoyed the course!",
    "This course did exactly what a proseminar should. It introduced us to the important parts of historical musicology while encouraging us to think deeply about the writing of history.",
    "This course really deepened my knowledge of music scholarship by drawing my attention to historiographical issues that were largely new to me. This is invaluable knowledge to have going forward.",
    "In terms of my personal interests, it only rarely had much of a relation. But in terms of deepening my knowledge of the state of the musicological field and the types of debates that might fly around the tables of all the trendiest music historians in fashion today, it was a huge help. Much of what we read was by authors whom I'd either never heard of or had heard of but had never read a word of, and it was great to become at least somewhat familiar with them, and to learn which ones to avoid forever and which ones are actually quite fascinating once you get to know them a little. This was, as I understand it, more or less the purpose of the course: showing us an array of the thought out there that we'd probably contend with and be expected to understand, and teaching us how to deal with it. And so, in light of that, I think it did its job well and taught me much that was useful."
