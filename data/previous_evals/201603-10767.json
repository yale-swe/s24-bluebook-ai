    "Oh my goodness, I feel that I have been so enriched by this class. The works alone are amazing and should be on everyone's literary bucket list. They're beautiful. I now understand and am aware of many references to these poems in more contemporary literature. They are inspiring. My skills as a critical and comparative reader have grown immensely. My writing and skills of argumentation have also gotten more nuanced and sophisticated, thanks in part to the works, but also Mr. Brisman's thoughtful feedback.",
    "This course provided a broad and deep knowledge of the work of the Romantic poets and the values they espoused. It also held students accountable for their statements, pushing them to form well-developed and thought out sentences and opinions.",
    "Thanks to the attention from Leslie Brisman both my writing and critical reasoning improved immensely."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Know that though this is a seminar, Mr. Brisman will do much of the talking. I didn't mind because he has such insightful things to say, of course. The readings were very manageable, and by the end, you will have read a decent chunk of the huge Romanticism anthology used in the course, as well as all of Wordsworth's Prelude. You're reading and engaging with all the great Romantics.",
    "The main strength of the course is the discussion led by Mr. Brisman and engaged with by the entire class that pushes the students to develop a clear reading of the works, understanding them in relation to sensations still present today. The feedback on essays is also extremely helpful, as Mr. Brisman and the teach fellow hold students to a high standard by examining each paper's argument as if it were worthy of publication and evaluating in a way that feels like a conversation rather than a prescription.",
    "More attention could have been paid to Byron, and slightly less to the Prelude.",
    "Taking Romantic Poetry with Professor Brisman sends one wheeling out of the classroom looking to explain a new discovery, perhaps Wordsworth's myth of memory, to an unsuspecting passer-by. That's the strength. A weakness to some might be that students participate in the discussion less often than in many seminars, particularly at the start of the semester. But this is largely a by-product of most students holding their breath to listen to Brisman. Improvement? I have a hard time imagining any means of improvement. (One could hope for one more day with Byron, but I'm not sure what else could be cut.) The method of final examination (which featured a review of the entire project of reading Romantic Poetry) seemed ingenious, which I mention only because this was a new addition to the course."

    "YES! Mr. Brisman, like the works we read, is amazing. You will learn so much about the texts, as well as ways to approach them and questions you should be asking. If the works aren't reason enough to take the course, learning from Leslie Brisman should help you make your decision. The course requirements are designed to allow you great flexibility: the three papers over the semester have to add up to eighteen pages, two of which reference outside sources. The guidelines are not very strict, and you can choose your own essay topics. The final is very manageable, as well.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to a fellow student if they were looking for an exciting class that uses good poetry as a lens to examine the issues that are important to everyone.",
    "Yes, given that you are sincerely interested in literature.",
    "I would recommend Professor Brisman's course in a heartbeat. As prerequisites for the course, I suggest a fledging love of poetry and an acquaintance with the Romantics. But given these two elements, Professor Brisman can transform your view of the world and reveal these poet's most poignant thoughts on nature, man, and inspiration. Taking Romantic Poetry with Professor Brisman is an opportunity to create your own Spot of Time and have your intellectual life changed. Three pieces of practical advice: Do read the syllabus carefully and take the advice there to heart. Leave time to re-read the assigned poem before class starts. And sometimes asking the right question can be more important than having the right answer. Take the course; take it with Professor Brisman."
