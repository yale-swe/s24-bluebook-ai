    "This class will likely be much different next year because Professor Quick will be leaving. I think there is a lot of potential for this to be amazing, but Haskell is a pretty tedious language and I don't think I'll ever use it outside of this class, so there are probably other classes that give you more applicable skills. For Computing and the Arts majors who have to take it, it is a nice, relaxed class, not too difficult, and interesting enough.",
    "Take this class if sound construction interest you, do not expect to be making music etc. It is about how sound can be generated through computation. Expect it to be frustrating at points though, not necessarily because of difficulty but more resulting from oddities of haskell and other programming tools.",
    "Professor Quick is leaving so not sure how much of this will be useful information. I came into this class not know much about music or Haskell, and I'm not sure how much more I know now. The material isn't presented in a way that would make one inclined to be more interested, and the text (written by Hudak and Quick) is very obtuse. The homework assignments are really manageable, though.",
    "I would recommend this class if you're interested in music and CS. The course content is really fascinating and we get to use a language called Haskell which is a functional language similar to Racket used in CPSC 201. Lectures with Donya at 9am were not particularly engaging, but I thought the course content was interesting and has great potential in future iterations of the class.",
    "A broad introduction to computer south synthesis using functional programming. Little hand holding lot of self direction."
