    "TAKE THIS. chauncey is lovely, the material is interesting and impossibly important.",
    "Definitely recommend this class for all.",
    "There's a ton of reading to do, so beware. Overall a good class, you'll learn stuff you definitely didn't know beforehand even if you don't do the readings",
    "I would DEFINITELY recommend this course. It takes you through the history of gay and lesbians but also opens up lines of communication with family and friends and the Yale community about such topics. Great.",
    "Definitely take this course!",
    "I would strongly recommend this class for any student. People with sexual orientations and\/or gender identities other than straight\/cis would especially benefit from this knowledge, but straight allies learn valuable lessons too. I wish this class were available to the general public. I considered myself fairly well-informed on the issues surrounding the equal rights movement for LGBTQ people before I took this class, but learning about the history of the movement and of the community was eye-opening. The workload is average, and the tests are not difficult as long as you do the readings. The knowledge you get from this class is very much worth it.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. It's an alternative approach to history that illuminates an entire group of people who have a history that isn't studied on a wide scale.",
    "It's a great course that covers a topic that most students would never learn about, except in the context of modern day gay rights movement. The workload isn't bad and all the material is just really interesting.",
    "YES. Please take this class. I had no idea all the rich history around this movement. And it really wasn't as specific a topic as it sounded. I learned a lot about topics like feminism, gender theory, religion, McCarthyism, and post-war America just because they all influenced gay history. I shopped some WGSS classes in addition to this class because I wanted to learn more about feminism, but I'm so glad I picked this class. I ended up learning what I wanted to know about feminist history but also so much more. It's a different way of approaching WGSS than the obvious. It's really a mind-expanding class.",
    "best class ever",
    "Great history course covering the history of lesbians and gays and their political movements but starting before people really realized the history starts. Great lectures.",
    "I've loved the scope and variety of this class. It has consistently kept me engaged and fascinated week after week. This is a vital area of history that is commonly ignored and looked over. Professor Chauncey does an incredible job with this class! It's no surprise that Professor Chauncey has the reputation he does. He is an incredible lecturer and teacher. His ability to engage, entertain, teach and move all at the same time is amazing. I feel incredibly fortunate to have been able to take this class.",
    "The BEST class I have taken at Yale. Before you leave Yale, you have to take this class.",
    "Absolutely a must-take. Professor Chauncey is amazing, very knowledgeable and with a personal connection to the material which makes his lectures even more engaging. There's a fair bit of reading, but it's all very interesting - I actually found myself looking forward to reading it each week. You have never learned about history like this, and the topic is so very relevant today. Take it!",
    "I would absolutely recommend it to any student. It is so informative and interesting.",
    "Having really only taken \"top-down\" approach history courses before, I absolutely loved taking this cultural history course. I was worried that the subject would be very narrow, but in reality, gay and lesbian issues impact everyone in a community, whether or not they are aware of it. I was stunned at how much I didn't know because of censorship and general lack of information, and my eyes were really opened by this course. Definitely take it! Chauncey is an extremely entertaining lecturer and really cares about his students.",
    "I would recommend it, especially to non-WGSS majors who are gay, have gay friends, or are interested in gay politics at all. (Let's face it, this is Yale...this applies to everyone here.)",
    "I'm not sure if I would recommend it or not. I enjoyed the class, but I'm not sure if I would take it again. I feel like I've learned some pretty specific information but I'm not sure that it really changes the way I think about things.",
    "TAKE IT. You will learn so much about Gay and Lesbian History, about culture, and about identity. It helped me find myself.",
    "Few classes at Yale actually make you a better person. In this class, you will read and learn about very important, current things, and you will become a better person. You must take this class before you graduate.",
    "This is a great class. I took it Cr\/D and it was a great decision. If you want to attend Chauncey's lectures but don't want the stress of reading all of the course reading or the stress of a midterm and final exam - which were tough - then definitely consider taking it Cr\/D. Great content, solid lecture.",
    "I'd recommend it, but it's not all it's cracked up to be! Make sure to do the readings toward the end of the course (60s onward) -- they're the most interesting ones and the material doesn't really get discussed in lecture.",
    "TAKE IT TAKE IT TAKE IT.",
    "Professor Chauncey is a phenomenal lecturer! I loved this class. I learned so much that I didn't even know I didn't know. Its a great way to break up a QR heavy course load, or just to take for fun! That said, its not a gut -- its definitely manageable, but there is a substantial amount of reading, a midterm, a final, and two papers.",
    "I took this class credit\/D as a freshman because I wanted to learn more about my community's history and I'm so glad I did. Definitely broadened my prospective on many things.",
    "take it only if you are interested in the subject.",
    "Take this class. You'll learn a LOT about historical attitudes, gay activism, and gay community-building, etc.Professor Chauncey is a great lecturer. He's extremely organized and covers a lot of material in a short time span. The readings are interesting and informative, although I wished they covered more about people of color. The course is well-designed: lectures do not rehash the readings. Plus, he plays associated music before and after every lecture (last song of the course was Ke$ha's \"We R Who We R\").",
    "Absolutely take this class! This is the first class I've had at Yale that's made me cry-- in a good way. If you're gay, you have to at some point during you're Yale career. This is stuff that you have to know. If you're not, you should take it anyway. The material is fascinating!",
    "YES. This class is flawless. Chauncey is amazing. Take this class. It is a survey of lesbian and gay history in the United States, and you should definitely take it, for it will give you so much necessary perspective on the evolution of notions of sexuality in this country. The readings are all amazing. Lecture is like a symphony--Chauncey will make every class seem too short, and you will never want to miss a single lecture. The TFs are fabulous. Everyone should take this class.",
    "Whether you are gay\/straight\/trans\/male\/female\/dog\/gerbil\/whatever, please take this class. I went from knowing absolutely nothing about gay history to considering writing my senior thesis on it. It's such an important and relevant history to learn, and not what you would necessarily expect (i.e. progress is not linear). Every lecture is structured well (and begins and ends with music) and section tends to be a lot of fun debating. The readings are really long, but worth skimming to get a general understanding of the material and so you can answer quote IDs on the final.",
    "I would definitely recommend it. The workload is very manageable (just two essays, a midterm, and a final) and the class is very rewarding!",
    "I took this class because I'm gay and wanted to know the history of my people. I got what I wanted and thought about new ideas and concepts along the way. I am very glad that I took this class.It is biased, one-sided, self-indulgent course that inflates to high heaven the importance of consummately unimportant people and events, but I guess that's part of the fun. It's a guilty pleasure, just like everything else in gay culture.",
    "US Gay and Lesbian history is a really interesting class, and its pretty legendary at Yale. Just for that, I would take it. Chauncey is an amazing lecturer-- very funny and engaging. The class covers information you wouldn't have learned anywhere else, and definitely provides a new perspective on history. It is rather reading heavy. I got away without doing most of my readings because the discussion in section is occasionally rather general (about themes rather than specifics) and because I already knew a bit about the subject, but you will be doing A LOT of reading. And you need to know it for the exams, so keep that in mind. But really the class is rather easy, only two papers, a midterm and a final. It's fun! I would take it again.",
    "This is a good class. I'm sure you're reading lots of other reviews telling you that. I missed a lot of lectures because I was taking this class credit\/D. But it was really good stuff.",
    "I recommend this course with every fiber of my being. Absolutely amazing professor that cares about you despite the size of the lecture course, incredibly interesting material that directly affects the discussion of LGBT rights today, and a catalyst in the development of my own identity as a gay American male in the 21st century. But even if you don't identify as LGBT, the course is still just as interesting and relevant!",
    "Take this class. The amount of reading you have to do is pretty standard, and I'd even say it's less onerous than most social science or humanities courses at Yale. It's also usually really engaging. There are one or two books that you'll wish you didn't have to read, but the rest are really interesting\/eye-opening and the documents (especially the ones that focus either on Yale or on more contemporary issues) are worth buying the packet for. Chauncey is a great lecturer, striking a balance between informative material and entertaining examples that illuminate the more theoretical side of what he's talking about. The papers are easy enough, and you get the choice of which two of the three assignments you want to do, so if you're good at figuring out when you're going to be busy during the semester there's flexibility built in.On top of that, even someone who's had a lot of exposure to queer history and queer theory is bound to get something out of a semester long course that focuses on the US. Chauncey is a leader in the field and some of the things he presents in lecture are based on original research, so there's no way you'll leave the course thinking you wasted your time.",
    "Great class, but make sure you get a good TA.",
    "Just go to the first lecture. You'll end up taking the class. It should be required before graduation.",
    "This class is great, of course. It is a fantastic way to learn about US History and teaches you things you might not learn anywhere else. The reading does get heavy at some points, but usually it's interesting stuff.",
    "Amazing. Whoever you are, whatever your interests are, take this course. It is an incredible minority history course and an often unforgettably touching experience. It is an honor to learn from Professor Chauncey, whose teaching style and breadth of knowledge are incredible, and he draws from cultural history to add elements like relevant song before and after class. This is a stand-out course.",
    "I would definitely recommend it. If you are gay, bi, or straight, it's such an important part of our nation's history that we really aren't exposed to in more traditional history classes.",
    "TAKE THIS COURSE!!! It was an extremely interesting history course with well thought out lectures, fascinating readings, and a great professor\/TAs. The papers were interesting (especially the oral history paper) and the lectures were brilliant.",
    "Take this. THIS IS SUCH AN AMAZING CLASS. The best. Chauncey is a badass\/sweetheart and the course material is so interesting. This is the first time most of the information presented to me in a history class has been new, and learning it from Chauncey is just so inspiring. YES YES YES. Everyone must take this. There are classes here that are overly hyped but this is not one of them, it cannot be hyped enough. Regardless of your sexuality or gender, you have something to learn from this course, so do it.",
    "This is a great class. Professor Chauncey is an engaging lecturer who brings in Yale as often as possible. Also, this truly is an understudied history and one of the \"only at Yale\" classes you can take. It's a little harder than I may have bargained for (definitely not a gut), but it's doable. I took it as my fifth class and had to study more than I had expected, but all in all, definitely thought it was worth it.",
    "A fantastic overview of gay and lesbian history, that will cause you to view the subject in a different light. You don't need to do the readings to get a good grade, but you'll want to because they are extremely interesting.",
    "I definitely recommend it! This is the first history class I've taken at Yale, so I can't compare it to others, but not only did I learn a lot of cool history, I learned things I could connect to my life.There's a lot of reading. But it's not necessary to do all of it. The real beauty of the course is Chauncey's lectures. Section can be pretty cool too, though. And I loved all of the screenings. Don't skip those!",
    "YES TAKE THIS CLASS. Such a good class. The material is not something you ever encounter in most history classes, and Chauncey does an amazing job of presenting a lot of material in away that makes a lot of sense. Also, Chauncey is AMAZING and works so hard to get to know all of his students. Take this class before you graduate.",
    "If you want to start learning about U.S. Gay and Lesbian History, take it!",
    "This course is very interesting and unique material taught by a professor who is one of the most knowledgeable in the field.",
    "US Lesbian& Gay History is important; take it. As it is a survey course that covers a couple hundred years of history, you may leave the course wishing we'd spent more time on certain subjects or gotten more in depth on particular periods of history. However, the broad understanding of gay history that you will leave the course with is a very good thing. The reading is great, Chauncey is great... just take it.",
    "TAKE THIS COURSE. You won't regret it.",
    "Take it if you want a reasonably demanding Hu, if you're interested in how history is written and rewritten by those outside it, if you like celebrity lecturers (Chauncey briefed the court for Lawrence v. Texas and testified at the Prop 8 trial), if you're a queer person or ally, or if you're considering a career in law or government, since understanding a historically oppressed group and its experience will be valuable to you.",
    "Absolutely. It highlights a portion of history that is normally overlooked. Every lecture was enjoyable. Chauncey is my favorite professor. The midterm and final were pretty fair. You write two papers, one of which involves interviewing your relatives, which was fun.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student, but I would say: definitely do the reading. First of all, it's almost always interesting and worth it. Second of all, if you haven't prepared, it becomes very clear in section, and that's never a fun feeling.",
    "This is a great class. Lectures are very interesting and Chauncey is really great. The reading is heavy but you can get by skimming for the main ideas. Papers and tests may seem a bit daunting but are actually very manageable.",
    "Yes. If you can take it before you graduate,do it. Even if you Credit\/D it. Learning about a history that so many people could care less about but is so important to many others is a reward in itself.",
    "Great course; great professor; great material; great lectures. The reading is not necessary for the tests or papers, which might sound nice, but it was actually a bummer because I ended up not doing most of it. This is definitely a class in which you can do well without doing most of the work, but it's also one of those classes where the amount you get out is directly proportional to the amount you put in. On the weeks when I did do the reading (and paid attention in lecture), I learned a tremendous amount. So basically, take this class if you think you're self-motivated enough to do the work. If you're not, you should probably still take it anyway, but don't expect it to be life-changing.",
    "This class is just what you would expect it to be. Chauncey does a great job of covering gay issues over, mostly over the last century. You can learn a lot, but the themes and topics do get rather repetitive over the course and section can often be a huge waste of time.",
    "a class about homosexuality from early colonial time to modern day, focusing on the 20th century. It's a phenomenal class",
    "Great class. Lectures and readings are incredibly interesting. Chauncey has this down to a science. Such an important history to immerse yourself in, if you're straight or gay.",
    "YES! I would definitely recommend the course!",
    "This was my favorite class at Yale. It absolutely lives up to its hype. The content is fascinating, and Professor Chauncey does a great job teaching about it. The readings were interesting, as were the films, lectures, and the sections too! As far as I know, all the TFs were really good.",
    "Fantastic course. The tests aren't impossible to study for but the papers are a bit tricky for people used to analytical writing. Really interesting and important material that everyone should learn! Great.",
    "TAKE IT IF YOU CAN, it will open your eyes to a wealth of history you never knew existed. Even if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve had a lot of queer\/feminist material in the past, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll still benefit from this broad survey of LGBT history that reaches back before there was really a conception of \u00e2\u0080\u009csexuality\u00e2\u0080\u009d at all. You will come to understand how the broader concept of history itself is not always an onward and upward movement towards enlightenment and progress but has instead shifted constantly over time, backward and forward, which is vital to understanding the place and importance of current LGBT activism. Chauncey does an excellent job of discussing lesbian\/gay history in the context of a larger historical framework and analyzing the shifting landscape of the niches of LGBT communities in the United States over the last few centuries. I am so glad I got to fit this in before I graduated.",
    "Absolutely.",
    "This course is fantastic! Chauncey is a great lecturer, and all of the TFs are fantastic! There's a lot of reading, but I found all the readings to be engaging and informative; they were well worth the time. TAKE THIS COURSE.",
    "Take this class if it sounds appealing to you by description.",
    "I woud recommend this class to others. But be forewarned - it's a lot of reading. In order to manage all of it, skimming is probably your best bet.",
    "Amazing history lecture about gay history and how it has been interwoven into American history since the 1600s.",
    "Take it. Chauncey is phenomenal, the material is interesting and non-trivial, and what you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll learn is likely to give you quite a bit of perspective on the current sexual culture (or any current culture, for that matter).",
    "It is definitely a good class and you will learn a lot. However, speaking as a gay man, I think this class is overrated. I wouldn't say it is one of the best classes at Yale, as many people told me before.",
    "You will learn so much, you will love it while its happening, you will laugh and cry and make lighbulb faces. Take it. Chauncey is a fantastic lecturer the content is relevant to your world and your life, and the assignments and well thought out (you get to interview your family which is pretty cool).",
    "Take this class! It is mind blowing.",
    "I can unequivocally recommend this course. I'm a science major and it was a blast. You will learn a lot and get a perspective that you will otherwise likely miss out on.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. Knowing about this part of history and the role Yale played in it was so interesting. I am not a WGSS or History major and I found this class to be one of my favorite classes at Yale.",
    "Definitely take it! It's not an easy A by far, and admittedly, you'll find that some themes and concepts are repeated to death at times, but it's a great course overall.",
    "This course is absolutely incredible. Chauncey is an amazing lecturer, the subject matter is fascinating, and every minute I spent reading or studying felt so rewarding. Take it.",
    "Phenomenal course. If you have any interest in gay history, even if you know nothing about it (ESPECIALLY if you know nothing about it), TAKE IT. If you have any interest in any history, TAKE IT. The historiography of how we view homosexuality is fascinating.",
    "I was very skeptical of the course at first. But I've heard such good rumors that I took it anyway. The rumors are right. The course is great! For most people this won't be the most important course you will take in college, but it will be enjoyable and intellectually rewarding.",
    "Great class! A must-take for any Yale student before they graduate.",
    "Take this course if you have any interest in the subject matter. It's a very important part of American History that is not often taught, and it was awesome to take the course from professor Chauncey, who is excellent. Some of the readings seem a bit redundant and contain a level of detail only useful for those really interested in queer studies. However, it's very easy to skim in this course, or even to skip some readings altogether and still get the gist. A solid 5th class.",
    "Great class, course load isn't too heavy: ideal for a fifth credit.",
    "A broad yet thorough history of gay and lesbian life in the United States. Would definitely recommend; I would say it is one of those classes at Yale you HAVE to take, if you have room for it. Take it if you're gay, take it if you're straight, take it if you're whatever -- it'sjust a very interesting dialogue about an interesting demographic of people, and helps you understand American history from another angle.",
    "Yes. Absolutely take it.",
    "This is a great history lecture. Chauncey is incredibly engaging. The class isn't much work or very hard. In addition to learning a lot of interesting history, you also learn to think about history in a new way. Chauncey is very big on not using the categories of the present to evaluate the past. Its very eye-opening. If you're lucky Adrien will TA again.",
    "Take this class. Just take it. Not only will you learn a huge amount about the LGBT community, but you'll come to see American history and the human experience in a new way. Also, its a really manageable amount of work.",
    "I would suggest.",
    "This is a great class if you're interested in gay and lesbian history. I didn't love it, but mainly because the subject doesn't interest me all that much (I took the class on a whim). But if the subject intrigues you, it's a wonderful class, and Chauncey's lectures are engaging and informative.",
    "Absolutely! The best class I've taken at Yale. Since the topic is so relevant to current events, it's fascinating to get a better perspective of gay history, especially from Professor Chauncey, who has both conductedgroundbreaking research in the field, as well as played an important role in recent court cases (e.g. California Prop 8). The workload is pretty reasonable - one personal\/informal paper, two 5-page papers, a midterm, and a final. The exams are easy if you prepare for them. There are a lot of readings, but they're all enjoyable (and skimmable if necessary). I cannot recommend this class enough. Shop it, and you'll be hooked after the first lecture.",
    "The best part of the class is Chauncey's lectures - he is an extremely engaging lecturer, and you will enjoy going to class (though if it's in the same place as this year, there's no internet in the classroom). The downside is that there is just a ton of reading.The subject matter is pretty much what you would expect - a fairly comprehensive history of gay men and lesbians in the US. If that interests you, I would recommend the class.",
    "Recommended as a good survey course of a field with which many students will be familiar. The course features breath over depth but is interesting and enjoyable nonetheless.",
    "An excellent lecture class. Take it, take it; everyone says so, and they are right. It is fascinating, and all the readings are fascinating; you will learn so much from Chauncey, your section leader, and fellow classmates. Many good conversations will be sparked with friends and families.It is generally framed through the lens of the white-gay-male, though it thankfully frequently questions that portrayal of history. Lectures and readings on women, Blacks, and Latin@s are frequent and awesome (on Asian Americans and Native Americans, less frequent). Note that the title is accurate; expect content on lesbians and gays, but not much about bi, poly, trans, intersex, or asexual people.",
    "Amazing course. Definitely take it if you can.",
    "This is a wonderful class. Professor Chauncey has so much to share, lectures are engaging, fun. The sections are really helpful and add a lot to the course, which is not always true for big lectures. You can basically decide to put in and get out as much as you want. I found it very easy and important to engage with the history in a personal way. Great class!",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. Do it, do it, do it. Are you kidding? It's GEORGE CHAUNCEY! He's AMAZING! You'll have a midterm and a final, both fair and relatively straight forward if you pay attention in lecture\/section (not difficult, when the lecturer is so great) and do at least some of the readings. You'll have two 5 page essays that aren't that bad (although if you do the family history one, get started on it early than you think you need to) and a pass\/fail 2 page ethnography. I think it's a bit difficult to get an A (although that probably depends on your TA), but an A- or B+ is easily attainable for a reasonable amount of work. But seriously don't worry about this stuff and just TAKE THIS CLASS.",
    "Take it! So important and very enjoyable. You learn a whole lot and study under a fantastic professor who has a great way of engaging students, covering history, and humanizing its subjects."
