    "How to be scientifically literate, immunology skills",
    "It's pretty much exactly what it sounds like: we learned about the science of immunity and the microbiome, and discussed the social implications that accompany them.",
    "A lot of new, interesting information about the immune system",
    "Learned more about the human microbiome and what makes up our immunological responses.",
    "Learned about the various immune responses the body elicits once invaded by an antigen. Also learned about the history of diseases, vaccines, and other topics in the world of immunology",
    "I learned about my bodys immune system the different kinds of immunity, the cells involved at each level, etc. a variety of diseases, and the microbiome. A bit of policy regarding immunology was taught too.",
    "learning about the world of immunology",
    "I learned more about the field of immunology in some depth, and feel I have a solid grasp on the basics of the subject, in addition to some of the more nuanced aspects.",

   "comments": [
    "Clearer about her grading policy would be nice, so we know where we stand. Liked that she focused on the skills and topics and broader picture.",
    "Strengths: Professor Kavathas is an absolutely wonderful professor who will do everything she can to see that you succeed in her course. I believe this is the only undergrad course she teaches, so take the opportunity to be taught by her while you still can! The course format was also a strength -- generally, it would be half lecture on a concept from immunology (very science-y), and half seminar-style discussion of the readings (that's where the social science people got their time to shine). Weaknesses: the workload fluctuates a lot from week to week, so you really need to stay on top of the syllabus. P-sets are pretty routine & uniform in length, but some weeks the reading is 5 pages and other weeks it's 100. Also, the lectures often made little sense to me as they were happening since they were pretty fast-paced, but Professor Kavathas provides a course booklet that explains everything & also recaps the lecture from the class before at the beginning of each class, so it's still possible to grasp if you don't understand it in the moment. Just don't do what I did and wait until the night before the midterm to read through the course booklet & comprehend everything.",
    "Strengths: Professor Kavathas is great. Interesting readings. Good conversations.",
    "It was taught very well although in the beginning guidelines for grading were not very clear.",
    "Strengths; Dr. Kavathas is a great teacher: shes very kind, patient, and engaging and provides interesting material every class Weaknesses: no obvious weaknesses, sometimes I felt that the pset grading needed to be clearer",
    "I am not a STEM person at all but this was one of my favorite classes this semester! Paula is so kind and knowledgeable and really makes sure you understand whats going on",
    "Very good seminar sessions\/ facilitates a community within the classroom",
    "I think everything was pretty good, though feel the pace of the course slowed after the midterm.",
    "Lectures went a bit fast but professor kavathas was amazing at explaining things on the board"

    "Yes",
    "Yes!!!!",
    "yes. Very interesting class and great teacher",
    "Certainly-- if you want to have a more than basic understanding of how the human immune system works.",
    "Yes! This course is incredibly informative and really necessary. I promise, the things you learn in this course will be useful to you your whole life. Professor Kavathas is very kind and knowledgeable, too.",
    "Yes! It is extremely interesting and something people dont know much about"
