   "comments": [
    "French 110 03 is a baseline French course. I think that if you have no backgroud in French or other languages previously that it would still be a difficult course to join. Most of my class enjoyed the course however I personally did not and can't say I would recommend it to someone who is only taking a language to fulfil a requirement.",
    "After a semester, I can already have a conversation in French, write and feel confident about what I know. Lots of work, but worth it if you really want to learn a new language. Doing the designed work is key. I would recommend to sign up with a French tutor in addition to practice pronunciation.",
    "I would recommend French 11003 to another student, but I would warn them that it does pick up pace very quickly, and it is necessary to find time to study for weekly tests.",
    "I would recommend it if they are ready to work very hard but remind them that it will definitely pay off. for someone who has never learned French on high school, the class must be very difficult. I took 3 years of French in high school and this class finished at about the place where I finished in high school. I would recommend the class to someone serious about learning French. great teachers and great lessons.",
    "French is by far the best language to start learning at Yale. The instructors are incredible and extremely energetic. I recommend this class to anyone who is considering taking on a language. It is well worth the daily classes.",
    "Yes!"
