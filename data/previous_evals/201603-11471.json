   "comments": [
    "I became familiar with atomic physics research in a real laboratory setting, and I gained a lot of useful skills.",
    "I developed research experience and an increased capacity to self-organize and solve genuine problems with no standard solutions.",
    "I learned how to conduct cosmology research and write a scientific paper.",
    "it's just research.",
    "I learned about molecular focusing and rotational cooling.",
    "I learned many topics relevant to topological phases of matter, in a research setting. I learned how to manipulate toy models to extract topological information, and methods to understand the structure of topological phases. This was a very insightful experience for future research in the field.",
    "This is a great course!! I loved having the opportunity to delve deeply into research I was excited about. I learned so much about what research requires -- its ups and downs -- and can't wait to continue next semester.",
    "I developed organization skills, furthered my abilities in report writing and learned how to manage my time to achieve my research goals. I also learned more about the field in which I'm doing research.",
    "This course is what you make of it, but if you work as much as you need to to complete projects, you will find that independent research is the best way to learn data analysis, programming, experimental design, and many other fields as well as the specifics of the field you are researching."

   "comments": [
    "Would have been nice to have some type of feedback on how I was doing during the semester.",
    "Really depends on your advisor",
    "This course would be better if instructions for the assignments were more specific, or at least made explicit that the format is very open ended.",
    "again it's just research.",
    "This is really what you make it, because it is so free form.",
    "The weaknesses of this course are few and far between, particularly if you have an adviser that you like. It would be nice to have some mechanism to get regular feedback but I understand that this might be rather complicated given the large number of advisers. It would also have been nice to meet a little more regularly with the larger class and Prof. harris just to be a little more aware of what exactly was expected, but at the same time it was also nice that the course was kind of up to the students and advisers.",
    "I think the course is good the way it. Maybe spreading the final presentations over an extra session would be helpful, because it ends up taking one full day for everyone during reading period, and this is a lot when you're trying to study for your finals and to work on your other final projects. Otherwise, Professor Harris does a very good job leading it and the course structure is fine.",
    "I wish that there was more of a community within the students doing research each semester. When I got to the end of the semester I found that I knew only those who were in my lab and a few others from things like physics club talks."

   "comments": [
    "Research for credit is not too stressful, but at the same time can be a great opportunity to gain useful skills, especially if you want to go into physics.",
    "Of course, this is a required course for the major, so I hope everyone who needs to take it takes it!",
    "Very important to find a project you care about. You should also try to find a professor you will like working with. research is what you make of it. you can do just the bare minimum or you can take it very seriously, maybe publish your findings, and have it be the start of your career",
    "you gotta take it.",
    "Yes, Do research!",
    "It's required for the physics major and a great intro for people who want to go into research careers.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course, particularly if you are still a sophomore or junior -- I wish I had started research earlier on!",
    "If you want to do research in the future, get started on it as soon as possible. Taking 471\/472 is also a good break from your typical physics coursework.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who is interested in physics. Even if you aren't using this class for your major, take it anyway, it brings a lot of insight."
