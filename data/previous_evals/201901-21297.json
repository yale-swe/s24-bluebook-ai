    "Strength: offers deep analysis of research papers",
    "The sessions are formatted to discuss 2 papers assigned the week prior through sequential analysis of the figures and conclusions of the work. This makes the journal club very easy to follow and learn from. Students who have not participated in a similar forum before will be able to grasp how science is explored at the academic level. You learn how to read and think critically about science. Perhaps a little background in the form of a short summary on the field could be provided with the papers to form the basis for the reading prior to meeting for discussion the following week."

   "comments": [
    "Yes. It is a interesting class in learning new and cutting edge research of nucleic acids.",
    "This is a great elective for MCDB majors. Very low workload and the professors are really friendly.",
    "The seminar was an excellent course to cap off my study of biology and provided a reprieve form the usual tedium of rote science traditionally seen in lecture courses. It offered the first true capacity for learning science in its original medium of communication. I would highly recommend this course to anyone who has been engaged in research and thus likely has been reading papers already, as well as to anyone who has not encountered such material in its rigorous form before."
