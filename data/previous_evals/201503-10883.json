    "This course is mostly what each student makes of it. It offers great tools (including the opportunity to read classic texts as well as recent studies), but be prepared to leave it with many more questions than answers about sympathy itself. (Which probably means this is a great course!) I would recommend this course to anyone interested in the reading list, committed to further explore selected topics by themselves, and - most importantly - with already an idea in mind of what role could this course plaay in the bigger picture of their own research."

   "comments": [
    "The course offered me the chance to explore a theme tangentially related to my main discipline, but strongly connected to my research interests. Especially the final paper offered me the great chance to explore a topic that I had been eager to consider for quite some time, to my utmost satisfaction.",
    "Definitely provided a new and interesting structure in which to read works that I had already read or had wanted to read."
