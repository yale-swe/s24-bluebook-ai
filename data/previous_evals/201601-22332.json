   "comments": [
    "Definitely recommend. Great instruction in chemistry that is pharmaceutically relevant",
    "The class is dynamic and interesting but breaks down into two seven week case studies more or less. The first portion of class focused on the most commonly utilized chemistry on industrial scale pharmaceutical and the secocnd portion on the process of drug discovery, lead optimization, and drug approval process.",
    "Yes, definitely! I would recommend this course to any students who are interested in medicinal chemistry and drug development.",
    "highly recommended! light work load, learned a lot, and really enjoyed the material. lots of exposure to material outside academia, which was nice.",
    "This class is great because it provides views on two parts of drug discovery: The reactions and the overall process. Highly recommend anyone interested to take Synthetic Methods as a prerequisite",
    "Basic knowledge of hetercycles and drug discovery. Yes, I will.",
    "The course is quite enlightening for those interested in the considerations going into drug design.",
    "The topics depend on the instructors. I would recommend this class to another student if the instructors are the same. Otherwise I would recommend them to see if they are interested in the topics of the class first."

    "heterocycle coverage was great along with the window into drug design",
    "Yes the course did deepen my knowledge in my discipline and profession. The was done by exposure to a different method of synthesis based different priorities like cost and waste management. This course applies directly to my dissertation and research in total synthetic chemistry.",
    "Yes, this course is of great value to my research.",
    "The synthetic part is extremely useful for my training in organic chemistry. The medicinal chemistry insight is also inspiring for my research project.",
    "This course gave me some systemitic knowledge.",
    "The course helped me think about how the natural products targeted in my work may have to be derivatized to improve pharmacological characteristics, i.e. how I might design structure-activity relationship studies.",
    "The class covers different topics related to drug development, which is related to my research interest. It contributes to the basic knowledge I need to know for my research."
