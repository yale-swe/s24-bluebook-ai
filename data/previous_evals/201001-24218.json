   "comments": [
    "Necessary, but beneficial. I got to work on something I loved. The seminars are not always very personally helpful, but I was glad to get to know the other art majors better. Great getting to know your advisor and working through stuff together. Some critics didn't give very much helpful critique at the review, so that portion felt very fruitless, but the rest of it was solid. The project was about the process, so the review was a horrible climax, but everything leading up made it worth it. It is what you're willing to put into it.",
    "Yes. Feedback is supper important.",
    "you're going to have to take it. start early. i mean EARLY. get ideas down, your advisor is your friend so dont think of them like a professor you have to report to for deadlines. get an early crit if you can and try to get an interdisciplinary crit in at some point.",
    "You have to take it.",
    "Great class.",
    "definitely a nice way to round out the art major experience",
    "This is your senior project. Nobody takes the presentations too seriously but it's always cool to get an idea of what people in all the departments are doing.",
    "Having gone through the senior project, I can honestly say that the format of the course could do with an overhaul. That each student speaks only once means that the group never sees progress, and generally only sees a list of ideas and a lot of confusion. Making the project year-long would be far more effective, or else bringing in professors and not just other students to advise their peers would be helpful as well because the discussion too often took the form of IF I WERE TO DO THIS PROJECT INSTEAD OF YOU, THIS IS WHAT I WOULD DO which lead several of u to rethink our own projects entirely and to ultimately feel detached and less than satisfied with the result. I would recommend that any student considering the senior project in art change his or her major to something that is ultimately more satisfying."
