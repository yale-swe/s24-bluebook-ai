   "comments": [
    "Take it. Movies (yeah, Amores Perros-like, well, most) and a cool professor who cooks you Brazilian food at the end of class. Take it!",
    "Yes!!! Great 5th class to take if you need one, just make sure you actually watch the films, otherwise there's no sense to taking it.",
    "Would definitely recommend. It is very time consuming with two films for each class, each film usually closer to 2 hrs. But if you're willing to put in the time for the movie you will see a lot of good movies -- and even the ones you don't like you definitely appreciate more after Paulo explains them -- and learn a lot without even realizing it. It fits a lot about contemporary Latin American culture and recent history. Definitely easy to relate to and perhaps more interesting if you are Latino, but the class is taught in English and Paulo makes it accessible and still interesting to students who aren't from Mexico, Brazil, or Argentina. I think it was a fun class and Paulo is a fun professor to have.",
    "Take it! You will learn a lot and have a ton of fun in the process",
    "Take it!",
    "This class is excellent! Between the amazing professor and the fascinating films we watch, I just absolutely loved this course. I have never taken a film class before this one and I am actually glad, because I feel like there is no other film class that would have been as great as this one. Take this class! It is definitely worth the time!",
    "Are you interested in Latin American Films? Do you want to improve your Spanish and Portuguese? Take this class if you are will to watch 4 films a week. Most of them are extremely interesting and revealing.",
    "Regardless of whether you have taken any Latin American class (or language), you should take this class. The films provide a view into our neighboring countries to the south. If anything is confusing, the lecture with Professor Moreira will give you a solid background in how this movie came to be, why it ended in the way it did, what political influences were involved in its production. This class was a joy to be in.",
    "LAST 245 was by far my favorite class of the semester. The way the course was set up was really conducive to not only enjoying the movies but really understanding their deeper cultural context. I have only compliments, and no complaints. It was a little difficult at times to keep up with watching four movies a week, but I also think that having two movies made for interesting discussion and lecture.",
    "LAST 245 is a great course and has a pretty manageable workload. It presents discussions on various films from Latin America throguh lectures of 1h30 that meet twice a week. Before each class the students must watch two movies - hence four movies per week - that will be discussed and explained during the lecture (all movies are available on ClassesV2). By the end of the semester one will have watched almost 50 movies from Mexico, Brazil, Argentina and others, which deeply contributes to one's understanding of the contemporary Latin American cinema. *WORKLOAD - VERY MANAGEABLE There is little to no reading, and the students will only spend time watching the movies for each lecture. Each student must write, during the semester, one review (~1 page) for one movie and one synopsis (~2 paragraphs) for a different film watched for the class. Each student will also be assigned to one extra movie, for which they will write both a synopsis and a review. Finally, there is a final paper (~10 pages) on virtually any topic that relates to the movies and discussions presented during the semester.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to anyone from any major."
