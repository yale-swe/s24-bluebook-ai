   "comments": [
    "This course is a very fun and interesting class for those who are interested in the world of cancer biology. I would recommend this class to another student because I thoroughly enjoyed the semester I spent in this class.",
    "This is a great class. I would 10\/10 recommend it to people who are very interested in biology and\/or biochemistry.",
    "Yes! If you come to Yale and want to be involved with medicine\/biological sciences, I strongly recommend this class. Sandy is such an amazing resource, and a wonderful teacher. Make sure you are willing to learn the scientific details of cancer and its pathways (a solid biology background is not needed, but incredibly helpful), because while this class does discuss policy and legislature that has to do with cancer, it truly focuses on the science.",
    "Topics in Cancer Biology was my first introduction to any area in molecular biology. Sandy is a great and extremely enthusiastic teacher. My favorite part was getting to read seminal papers in cancer biology and I think a big strength was that high expectations were held for us while at the same time the class being reasonable and on the chill side.",
    "This class is heavily focused on the biological pathways of cancer, and there is great emphasis on reading scientific literature. However, we also do discuss social and economic consequences of cancer, research, and future scientific developments, and I believe those discussions are also very fascinating. That being said, I would not recommend this class to someone who is not interested in the biology of cancer. It's not just a general \"Oh, this is how cancer works.\" It goes into a lot more depth than one might expect at first.",
    "This course is a very thorough introduction to cancer biology and the research that is shaped many cancer treatments. I would definitely recommend this course to other students because it eases students into understanding complicated research.",
    "I definitely recommend MB&B 050 01 if you are interested in learning about one of the most complex and pressing diseases that remains uncured. I recommend having a good biology background, but the course is definitely worth taking and you won't believe it's over by the end of the semester.",
    "Lectures on a particular topic in the cancer field, reading of a scientific paper with accompanied questions, and lecture\/presentation on that paper."
