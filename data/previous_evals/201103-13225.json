   "comments": [
    "I really enjoyed these sessions as they are a great opportunity to learn about what the faculty are working on and understand some of the research that is going on at the school of public health.",
    "I would prefer if there was specifically a SBS discussion section and a separate CDE section. Perhaps do every other week and invite both groups to both sessions but make the section that is not your concentration optional.Also, nearly every other concentration gets real food at their seminars, while we get cheese. I won't complain because we do get some food, but it would be very nice if we could also get lunch - even once or twice a semester would be awesome!",
    "It's helpful to have a seminar series that covers relevant research conducted by the faculty. However, the time slot is a difficult one. It follows three hours of required courses for first year students, and precedes several courses in the division. Finding a better time for the seminars would definitely have made it easier on me this semester, since I often didn't have time to eat lunch between classes. Alternatively, serving a more substantial lunch would solve the problem.",
    "I'm really not sure why this is a required seminar. Not only do I find it silly that CDE and SBS are combined, as many things that interest SBS students are of little interest to CDE students and vice versa, but I find that the content to be lackluster, and the presenters often were not excited about presenting. An opportunity to expose us to new and exciting public health work instead seems to be a class that takes the easy way out, just asking whatever professors are available to give a rundown on their work. No offense, but if I were particularly interested, I could always track down the professor myself, since not a single presenter was outside YSPH or YSM. In general, I feel this is a waste of an hour every other week.To hear a community\/non-research perspective might enhance the course.",
    "While I appreciate the aim of the course, I was not particularly happy with the course as I experienced it. This was mostly due to the fact that CDE and SBS are combined, which I don't find to be particularly useful. While some of the lectures did address SBS issues, I strongly believe that these two divisions should be further separated, and there should be an independent lecture series for SBS. There is a wealth of SBS research at YSPH, yet I feel as if I missed out on a majority of the great work being done, due to the divide between SBS and CDE topics. Although all of the lectures were well-done, I feel like YSPH is missing an opportunity to provide a even greater diversity of shared work and ideas by combining CDE and SBS in these lectures. Ultimately, I believe I would have enjoyed the course much more had this been the case, especially given the upswing in interest in SBS.",
    "There were some interesting speakers but in general the topics covered were not of interest for me.I think that providing substantial food is very important if the seminar is to be held at lunch time. I had classes right before and right after this seminar, and sometimes did not have enough time to get food or to warm up the food that I had brought. One day I decided not to come to the seminar because I was feeling faint and needed to eat. It's just not fair to students to occupy their lunch hour but not provide food.",
    "I personally like the seminars that are more inclined to chronic diseases.",
    "The presenters were interesting and have done amazing research.",
    "Fine. Not great, but not awful. Perhaps CDE and SBS could be split up? The seminars offered by more SBS-focused professors were far less interesting to me (a CDE concentrator).",
    "The course featured some very good speakers and delivered on its promise of exposing us to interesting work being done by Yale faculty.",
    "The seminars were interesting, but I could maybe like some that focus on public health practice and careers for those who stop with the MPH (do not continue on to a PhD\/research career).",
    "cannot get all the knowledge, but the lectures are inspiring",
    "provided a good overview of what professors\/Yale community members were doing related to CDE and SBS",
    "The course had various people in the department give talks about their research, I enjoyed this.",
    "Great way to learn about current research by Yale faculty, etc.",
    "CDE\/SBS seminar well presented - good to get a first-hand look at Professor's research projects and areas of potential collaboration.",
    "Interesting lecturers, but I would have liked to hear talks from people outside of YSPH. Also, we need better refreshments.",
    "Please provide lunch if this course is scheduled during lunchtime, and immediately after another required course.",
    "Some of the lectures were interesting. Nice to learn whats going on at Yale.",
    "It was nice to have some real world perspective of individuals who are doing research related to material we are learning.",
    "-provided a variety of guest speakers that captured a lot of different public health interests-more food than cheese plates? maybe?",
    "The course was a great way to expose us to different topics being researched at Yale in the CDE department.",
    "This course provided an excellent and thorough overview of nutrition and chronic diseases. The subject matter was interesting. Sometimes the slides were a bit long and drawn out, where there could have been more interaction with students. However, the professor was quite knowledgeable and I enjoyed hearing from her at length.",
    "It was great getting to know research that professors are doing in SBS\/CDE. Great intro and overview for new students.",
    "I really have not enjoyed the seminar much- the speakers are much more CDE focused or they are SBS staff, whom I have already met and talked to about their research. Is it impossible to find any other speakers?",
    "Bringing in more outside speakers would be nice.",
    "A great experience that continues to expand my understanding of various disciplines within Chronic Disease Epidemiology.",
    "",
    "It's OK. I wish the group wasn't so big. Having CDE and SBS combined is a disadvantage, though I understand why it's done. Also, the choice of lecture topics felt rather haphazard. I was really interested to see work that had bearing on our divisions, but we saw presentations -- like the lecture on hepatitis C transmission -- that didn't bear on either of our divisions' orientation or subject matter.",
    "I enjoyed hearing lectures on the work different people around the school are doing- the lectures were a great addition to my other classes. The only downside is that I have class right after, and this class is during lunch, but without real food. Maybe if there were fruit in addition to the cheese, it would be better?",
    "More focused on CDE, and not on SBS",
    "Some professors appeared deeply invested in the presentation of their research through the seminar setting, while others appeared less prepared and invested.",
    "I find the seminar useless and the topics are not really interesting.",
    "I like the idea of getting to know the research that is being done by our faculty. However, I would have liked more SBS-related lectures. One thing to improve is the speakers speech time. Some of them take the whole hour to share their work making it difficult to ask questions."
