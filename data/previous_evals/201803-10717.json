   "comments": [
    "The biggest takeaway was how hard it was to do a solid philosophical analysis, but MDR really helped elucidate the process.",
    "A lot of reading and writing. How to think logically about arguments. How to chug through a ton of reading in a day and manage to absorb some information.",
    "I learned so much from this course. It was a fantastic opportunity to learn introductory philosophy in a small setting.",
    "I had never taken a philosophy course, and I thought this class was an excellent introduction to philosophy. Without a doubt, this was my favorite class of the semester and the one I constantly updated my family and friends about from home. I was grateful to improve my ability to analyze and make arguments, especially in papers. We discussed in-depth not only the core tenants of each philosopher, but were able to challenge that philosopher's weak points.",
    "This course gave me a wealth of knowledge regarding the important philosophers of the western tradition as well as helped me develop skills in critical thinking.",
    "How to approach dense philosophical texts, how to identify what's important, how to craft a philosophical argument and write a philosophy paper",
    "I absolutely loved this course. I came in with no knowledge of Philosophy, and left with the ability to write a philosophy paper. I feel that I now have a pretty good grounding in Philosophical thinking.",
    "I gained valuable insight into the nature of philosophical arguments. I learned how to critically evaluate different arguments and how to synthesize between different arguments. I also enjoyed learning about many different philosophical views on big questions.",
    "A solid grounding in ancient Western philosophy; the ability to effectively analyze arguments; the principle of charity; and a deep appreciation for the power of analogies.",
    "I developed my ability to absorb and understand complicated texts and learned how to reconstruct a philosophical argument in an essay. I also learned how to see the intersections and divergences between a number of great texts throughout a long period of time. The philosophers that appealed to me gave me great insight about myself and the way I am inclined to see the world.",
    "My writing skills and critical analysis\/critical thinking skills have greatly improved. Through the intensity of Directed Studies and mandatory weekly papers, I have seen the drastic transition from my writing coming into Yale and my writing now. Also, because of the seminars accompanying the reading, I can think deeper about readings and retain main concepts.",
    "I learned I love philosophy even though I have never taken a class in it before. My professor was amazing, and I am so happy I took this class which may have decided my major.",
    "The ability to examine and interpret important and occasionally difficult philosophy texts in a way that facilitates understanding and discussion; the ability to trace common intellectual threads through works separated by hundreds of years and thousands of miles; the ability to use this knowledge in interaction with the other disciplines of Directed Studies to enhance meaning."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "No weakneses",
    "Some professors are amazing (like Michael Della Rocca) but some others do not create a very conducive space for discussion. Experience might vary greatly with the professor you get.",
    "I thought we didnt spend enough time on a few of the books, but that is the nature of DS.",
    "I thought this course was engaging and intellectually stimulating, and the lectures were always very informative. More so than other Directed Studies classes, we received a comprehensive education on the material at hand and were still able to evaluate its contents in detail afterward. I'm not sure I have any great weaknesses to indicate. I do wish we spent more time on the later philosophers in the course, especially Anselm and Aquinas. As a student, I could have seen one less week of Aristotle to accommodate for this, or just decreasing the philosophers in the last third of the term. It was not difficult to keep up on readings for this class, but the additional discussion time was much-needed.",
    "The rich dialogue that the class engages in is a great strength of this course. A weakness might be the fast pace that this class requires; we often sacrifice depth for breadth (but that's just the trade-off with doing DS).",
    "Better time allocation between authors (got really rushed at end towards monotheist thinkers)",
    "I thought the course's strengths were the small size and the wonderful professor. No weaknesses come to mind.",
    "I found Michael Della Roccas teaching to be a major strength of the course. His teaching style made the course much more engaging and digestible. However, the amount of reading was incredibly difficult to keep up with.",
    "The broad array of texts and philosophers covered over just four months is a strength, as is the seminar format; like all DS courses, its only weakness is perhaps a lack of depth during certain reading heavy weeks.",
    "Strengths: -Due to the high volume of reading required, I can read higher quantities of text quicker while retaining more. -Due to mandatory seminars twice a week, I am more comfortable voicing my ideas among my classmates and professor. Weaknesses: -Because it is required (through DS), there is less freedom in choosing classes. -More time to digest the dense texts would be great.",
    "I loved every aspect of this class. Please don't change a thing.",
    "The material overall tends to be very broad, and this affects philosophy moreso than the other Directed Studies classes, as the difficult content always seems to be a bit strangled for room (sometimes going over three or more philosophers a week, which does not allow any depth when discussing their ideas)"

   "comments": [
    "Yes.",
    "Yes! Fast-paced course with lots of writing that really forces you to do the readings, understand the text, and be able to find insights within it. Maybe not for someone who reads slowly.",
    "Yes absolutely. The professor was simply amazing and DS has been a rewarding experience.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course; overall, it was a wonderful introduction to philosophy and all of the professors are excellent and knowledgeable about the works we are reading. For me, philosophy is definitely the part of Directed Studies that has seen the greatest growth in interest and passion from me.",
    "Absolutely. This class gives you a great introduction into western philosophy and helps you develop important skills for critical thinking.",
    "Definitely, especially classes with this professor.",
    "I would, no hesitation, recommend this course to anybody. I felt that it broadened by horizons in an important way, and allowed me to read really difficult texts with the support that I needed to understand them.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student on the stipulation that it is taught by Michael Della Rocca.",
    "I would wholeheartedly recommend this course to all students, with the caveat that DS Philosophy is often the most unpopular element of the triad - my wholly positive experience with the course hinges upon my fortune in being placed into a very particular section (with talented peers and a sublime professor).",
    "Yes, definitely! I learned a huge amount and really enjoyed the depth we managed to cover across so many texts.",
    "Yes. It is great for strengthening writing skills and gaining critical thinking skills. It is also a good class for defining an interest in Philosophy. Although I no longer want to major in Philosophy, I at least have a firm understanding of it and grounds to back my claim of not wanting to pursue it further.",
    "Please, for your own sake, TAKE THIS CLASS. I loved it and you most likely will too.",
    "As long as one is interested in the subject, the course can be very engaging and gives a good baseline for further exploration of philosophy."
