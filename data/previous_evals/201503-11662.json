   "comments": [
    "Yes, I'd definitely recommend LATN 110 to anyone who's interested in the classics, in history, in civilizations, or those who are looking for a credit to use anywhere.",
    "I would recommend this course! If you truly have an interest in reading Latin literature, and not just fulfilling the language requirement, I think you should enjoy this course. You will be shocked by how much you will learn in a single semester. I don't know if Meghan will still be teaching this course, but she is a wonderful teacher!",
    "You learn a wild amount of latin grammar quite fast: challenging and rewarding. You have to work at it everyday usually 1-2 hours.",
    "LATN 110 is a solid introduction to the Latin language. I came in knowing nothing more than basic pronunciation. By the end of the semester, you can go from knowing nothing to being able to translate and understand sentences, paragraphs, and poems from actual Latin texts as well understanding the necessary parts of speech, syntax, and 400+ vocabulary entries. There is daily homework which can be difficult to balance with other coursework, since it often cant be done ahead of time. Nevertheless, the daily practice is ultimately one of the most beneficial ways to learn and practice the concepts youve learned during each days class. I found that keeping up with the homework (and always memorizing the vocabulary!) is also typically sufficient preparation for the quizzes (usually a weekly grammar and\/or vocabulary quiz), midterms, and final exam. I would definitely recommend LATN 110 to anyone interested in learning Latin, especially if you have no prior experience. Its very thorough - like any language it will require work, but by the end of the semester you will have learned a lot! Personally, it was my favorite and most rewarding class this semester.",
    "This class is a straightforward language class apart from a lack of listening and oral exams. There is a lot of grammar and syntax covered, and homework is assigned every night but it is overall very manageable. There is a lot of reading towards the end of the semester as we put together all the elements that we have learned into a coherent translation of Latin, which means that we get to read many famous authors that should excite anyone interested in the classics. I would recommend this class only if you have an interest in the classics and a love for Latin itself as the language won't be used in a contemporary setting anytime soon.",
    "The class is a careful, well-paced study of Classical Latin. Though it may seem excessive to meet five times per week, the daily interaction with the language is a great way to learn."
