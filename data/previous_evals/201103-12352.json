    "Zulu 110 is great! I would definitely recommend it to anyone and everyone who wants to learn a new and interesting language. The professor definitely makes learning such a different language much simpler and enjoyable.",
    "Zulu 110 is a fun, interesting, and very informative class. I would highly recommend it. Not only did we learn a great deal of isiZulu in just one semester (I would feel confident meeting Zulu people and speaking with them about transportation, food, clothing, etc.), but we learned about the history of the Zulu people and many aspects of South African culture as well. I genuinely looked forward to class every single day, and I always left class a happier person. There is barely any homework outside of class aside from a few partner dialogues and a few individual exercises, but we still learned a tremendous amount. At the end of the semester, I actually enjoyed taking the final exam."
