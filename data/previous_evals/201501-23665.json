    "The readings were generally engaging and thought-provoking. It was also nice that most of the readings had been written recently, so that we as a class could get a good introduction to the current state of scholarship in this area.",
    "The reading list and the other students in the course. I was so inspired by my classmates and extremely impressed by their thoughtful comments. Discussion was awesome. I really enjoyed the reading list: it covered a wide variety of topics and had a little for everyone, and it exposed me to some really interesting environmental debates and topics that I don't get elsewhere at FES (indigenous rights, mining company activities, debates about \"expertise\").",

   "comments": [
    "We should have spent less time deciphering the intent of the author, and more time talking about how we can take these readings and theories and apply them to our own work.",
    "The class size was a little bit large for a discussion-based class.",
    "While I enjoyed having different students run class each week, I would have liked to see Samara and Karen step up more and keep the discussion more on track. I'm new to anthro and this style of class discussion, so this may be normal, but I felt like the debate meandered way too much and I would have liked more structure to discussion. Or at least varying the style.",
    "I think the papers were of an awkward length - a little too long for a reflection paper. I now your courses in the past had weekly 1 page papers or something? A difficult balance to strike, I think I would have liked to write perhaps 5 papers of 4-6 pages on 5 weeks of my choice, so I could choose which readings spoke to me most. Connecting the different readings came very naturally, though sometimes the limitation of connecting the readings just within the \"block\" of readings that the papers were about was a little restricting. A note on the discussion format: As I'm sure you are also aware, there were some people who rarely spoke up during discussions. I don't know if there is anything you could have done about that. If it's because they were uncomfortable with the discussion format, maybe clarify even more at the introductory class what the format will look like. I liked that in the last few classes we had some situations of just going around the room to hear everyone's comments individually, which I think worked well, and could have been put to great use every now and then throughout the course."

It was also a great class to reflect critically on how we (personally and as a society) are biased in our knowledge preferences."

    "Unfortunately, this class will not be offered again since the instructor is leaving. It's a real loss to F&ES that this happened. I am afraid that students will miss out on this wonderful class (and Professor Hbert's excellent mentorship) because of poor faculty leadership at F&ES. It's hard to take the school's commitment to interdisciplinary research and training seriously when they keep cutting social science faculty and marginalizing women in adjunct teaching roles or through failed promotions (even when they are promoted elsewhere among colleagues in their own discipline). Let us hope this changes in the future...",
    "Unfortunately FES made a poor choice and let Karen go so this class won't be offered again in all likelihood. If it was though, students should definitely take it! FES needs more classes that encourage students to debate and challenge the status quo of environmental discourses, and especially more courses in the anthropology\/qualitative- this was a great one for that."
