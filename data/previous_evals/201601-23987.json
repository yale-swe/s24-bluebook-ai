    "An exploration of how power, performativity and social change connect to each other and why it's important. I would highly recommend this class to anyone interested in seeing how theatre can function in non-theatrical fields and why it's important. I honestly would recommend it to anyone who is seriously thinking of working in theatre upon graduation.",
    "YES! You should definitely take it especially if you are interested in any of the following: power, performance, WGSS, race theory, or how to make \"beautiful trouble.\" :)",
    "Everyone should take a course with T.L. before the graduate! She is a breath of fresh air on this stodgy campus. I learned as much from her pedagogical style (there are many ways of knowing, teachers are not always at the \"top\") as from the great reading and watching list she put together. Take this course!!",
    "WGSS 241 is an introductory course to performance theory, applied toward activism, social change and emancipation. I would highly recommend it to another student interested in how academic theory can be applied towards practice and performance.",
    "Although I greatly admire TL as a professor, performer and scholar I did not enjoy this course nearly as much as I hoped I would. Despite very important questions and topics, discussion never took off and was quite boring. TL makes a great effort to create a welcoming space in the classroom, and allowing us all to get to know each other as every class begins with people going around and saying their name, pronoun, how they're feeling and something that stood out to them about a video we saw in class or something in the readings, but by the time everyone had gone around I had heard everyone speak but nobody actually responding to each other, no real efforts at discussion or conversation. By then half the class or more than half the class is over and without approachable discussion questions the rest of the class was never too interesting. I think TL is amazing, and meeting her is maybe reason enough for some to take this course, but did not enjoy the actual class time. I really loved the opportunity to engage in an action project at the end of the semester and learned a lot from this process driven work, but that was the highlight."
