    "Much of this same material was covered in Landscape Ecology.",
    "Q4 - the workload was very high compared to F&ES standards (which are generally low, in my opinion). It is refreshing to find a course that demands highly of the students, however, the deadlines for some assessments were not well planned and we ended up having to deliver 2 papers with 3 day difference, which made that week a very tough one.Q9- the syllabus mentioned 3 labs that ended up just being discussions instead of hands-on activities. If they are not real labs they should not be advertised as such.",
    "Questions 2, 6&8: This course was taught with a strong ecological and evolutionary Biology bias which i thought was great for me. The course was however brief on the social front of conservation i.e. the people-environment interface such as in collaborative decision making; community participation in conservation planning and implementation. The course was good in the area of how to communicate to a decision maker such as a Politician. Generally, the Professor thoroughly pursued \"evidence-based\" i.e., conservation with sound scientific basis throughout the course.",
    "This class was somewhat mixed--some sections were well taught and very interesting while others seemed a little scattered. Overall it tried to cover too much ground and so didn't get too in depth on any subject. Best parts focused on ecology and science, was a little weaker in the policy or economic sections. Dr. Schmitz can be somewhat intimidating in class and seems a little annoyed with us, but is obviously passionate about the material."

    "I like the broad range of concepts covered in class.",
    "The concept assessments required critical thinking and there were no rote tests.",
    "The depth of the course. This is a very good concentration course.",
    "- liking science and policy (or at least attempting to)- very applied assignments- no stressful exams",
    "The lectures were really interesting",
    "1. The subject matter - this is the only course of its kind at FES.2. The assignments really pushed the student to delve into the sci. literature to learn about and grasp the material3. The final concept assessment was one of the best assignments a teacher has ever offered4. I appreciated the complementarity of the mid-term (sci-based review) and the final project (policy oriented deliverable)5. Schmitz brought in practitioners to discuss class topics and to meet with students. Really great\/valuable experience.6. The course pushed students to think about their role as sci\/policy makers, gave them increased familiarity with the sci literature\/research, the freedom and flexibility to craft their own projects, and great lessons to challenge them to think critically about conventional conservation practices - outstanding.",
    "The intensive literature review for concpet assessments were a major hightlight of the course, i think this is what i learned most in class. the best thing about this course is the up to date readings we have, and the latest ressearch in the realm of ecology and policy.",
    "The insistence on \"evidence-based-conservation\".",
    "The broad topics covered.",
    "Os is an excellent lecturer and he covers a very broad range of topics. Some students wanted more specificity on a smaller range, but this was good for me.",
    "Assignments provided the opportunity to pursue research on specific topics of interest. Professor Schmitz set an ambitious agenda and covered most of what he set out to cover.",
    "It kept abreast with the current knowledge of the subject. The instructor tried to disapprove the conventional approaches to conservation and presented the new idea\/thinking on different facets of biodiversity conservation. He insisted on evidence-based conservation to minimize the costs of committing type II error. It is one of the very useful class I have taken at F&ES.",
    "The organization and broad topic coverage",
    "Really liked the final assignment. Taking a challenging conservation issue, researching and presenting all the scientific evidence, and then using that piece to draw a policy memo with action steps for decision makers, was a real worthwhile assignment.",
    "Learning practical tools and skills for biodiversity conservation, and getting to hear from practicioners in the field, and see how the policy and science interact.Also, the final paper\/project was a very interesting assignment that I got a lot out of.",
    "The big term assignment was a good project and most people learned a lot--it was well structured into the two sections and was great to get much of it done early in the semester. I liked the mix of freedom to chose a topic that was relevant to your own interests, but also some structure about possible questions to look at."

   "comments": [
    "We shouldn't get the \"I'm really disappointed in you\" lecture when the instructor gives very broad and general instructions for assignments. I felt like is was not very effective teaching.",
    "The expectations for the first concept assessment was very unclear. We were presented with what amounted to a trick question, and were berated by the professor when most of us did not realize it was a trick question.",
    "Smoothen the workload throughout the semester (perhaps less discussion sessions, plan deadlines better...)",
    "- a way to force us to remember the information we're taught since there are no exams- more instructions in the beginning on what the professor is looking for in assignments",
    "The assignments and clarity of the assignments. There was really no need for the amount of research that was assigned. I believe it was actually detrimental to learning the course content.",
    "Material is covered too quickly (on the per class-session and semester scale).Lessons should be tied together more explicitly.Prerequisite or recommendation for Excel-based experience should be noted in course descriptionConsider inviting an economist to introduce ecosystem services and then discuss with Os how this can\/does align\/deviate from other ecological perspectivesThe theme of stewardship should be integrated into the semester - a key point but seemed rather abrupt in its introduction at the end of the semester",
    "i was confused of the perspectives in which we were taught- i am not sure if it was mainly prof's personal opinion or the general public's viewpoint. i would like to know the more objective scientific knowledge. concpet assessments were a bit unclear in terms of their wording, i was unsure to which direction to work on. but this had improved towards the last few CA.",
    "1. Some context on conflict resolution and conservation issues. An example of the latter could be human-animal conflict. It could also be animal-human conflict.2. Some lectures and discussions on conservation and sustainable development.",
    "Clarification of expectation. More important than the material covered or teaching quality, expectations of the students and of what the class would cover were not aligned with what ended up being covered or done in the course.",
    "Really we need a broad intro course like this and them more specific courses fleshing out some of the concepts.",
    "The class might be split into two iterations, one geared toward MEM students and one for MESc students.",
    "I know Professor Schmitz is trying to meet the needs of multiple students by making the class accessible to those with less of a conservation background and by covering multiple topics. I still think the course would be better if he focused in more detail on fewer topics.At time there was some miscommunication between the professor and students as to the expectations for assignments. I think we may have done better more quickly had the professor been more explicit about his expectations.",
    "The instructor needs to be a little friendly from the start. Initially, he was so intimidating. But as course progressed, he became friendlier. I understand that he was trying to be polemic to provoke students to think and fix ideas.",
    "Lighten the work load a little. More time on ecosystem services.",
    "Expectations should be laid about from the beginning as to precisely what the instructor wants for a \"quality\" assignment. I believe the first assignment, the buffalo population problem, was a bit confusing as to what was expected. Also, perhaps a little less breadth of issues for biodiversity conservation in order to delve more deeply into a few \"key\" concerns for the discipline area. I felt that towards the end of the course, concepts became very broad and generalized, leaving few concrete ideas for ways forward.",
    "At the beginning of the semester, I was unclear on the expectations for some of the assignments - this improved later on. Also I would have liked to expand on some of the topics of the first several weeks of the semester.",
    "Expectations for grading were not always clear. There was no syllabus in terms of overall number of assignments, when they would be do, etc., which was a little confusing. We never really got into any of the topics in depth. Sometimes Os gets a little out of his element. Also, the discussion section was not very useful and took up a lot of time. Much of the material was almost lifted directly from previous classes (including slides)."

I think this is an inappropriate discussion to have with her students, especially during sections she was leading.

However, taking the course in the first semester was quite heavy for me in addition to my three other heavy writing course work. that said, i still think this course had changed my rooted concepts in many ways. this serves as a fundamental understadning for me in ecology and biodiversity.",
