    "I think there was too much busy work in the beginning of the semester. I think the precedent study\/scale drawing should be one week and of a precedent pertinent to the project proposed by the student. The students instead should build a joint or manipulate actual\/specific material in actual dimensions within the first month. I also think that the student's true abilities should be evaluated and matched to a process and form early on. It should never be the expectation of the student that the instructors, though knowledgeable and helpful, should complete or do significant portions of the fabrication work. The student's aspirations should be cut with their own motivation and level of expertise (aka reality and the respect\/development of craft).",
    "Nice to start out measuring existing chairs to get a sense of scale - which is a lot smaller than you would think!",
    "the course organization was good: being a fabrication course, I appreciated a lot of time was scheduled for individual design reviews and fabrication",
    "The material of the course has been very clearly presented.It involved a concise study of precedents and discussions of how the acquired knowledge would apply to each student's specific project.",
    "The body of materials was not big but adequate enough for a fabrication course. The main assignment, the design and construction of a chair, was well structured and closely followed by the instructors."

   "comments": [
    "My expectation was to produce a chair that I liked, and learn to fabricate furniture and see a design through to fruition, and this expectation was met.",
    "I expected to learn new methods of fabrication and my expectations were exceeded.",
    "I had high expectations in terms of teaching quality and commitment, totally met. I waspositively impressed by midterm and finals jurors.",
    "My expectations for this course have been significantly exceeded.In the beginning I hoped to explore certain issues relating to the project of fabricating a chair. I have since discovered many interesting things that do not only concern the design of furniture, but in addition to that, problems that involve fabrication techniques and technologies, material application of tectonic ideas, ergonomical issues involved in the conception of a chair, and many more.",
    "I expected to learn new fabrication techniques and to be exposed to design problemsin a one to one scale (prototyping), with the support and advice of the instructors. My expectations were met excellently."

   "comments": [
    "This course was very valuable to me, not only to see that I am cabable of fabricating my designs butalso in discovering the parrells between designing architecture and designing furniture, and just how fun the latter can be.",
    "It is a very valuable course, although I wish it had been in general more structured and focused.",
    "It was really valid to me. It was challenging and remunerative.",
    "This course has been particularly valuable in my education at Yale so far.We architects fail to recognize the importance design has in fabricating the environments we inhabit. Furniture design, especially chair design, is a very complex and quite difficult part of architecture. I believe that having been exposed to this context of production and the many problems that arise during its practice, has been a great learning experience",
    "The freedom in the course was very refreshing when compared to the stringent requirements in all other classes. Josh and tim allowed you to explore whatever subject your were interested in and then hlped you push that idea as far as you could. In the end I produced and object with my own two hands which gave me a great boost in my design ability.If anything I am now very comfortable working in the shop and using machinery.",
    "The course was very valuable for my education."

   "comments": [
    "Great having such available teachers, very interesting design discussions throughout the semester.",
    "The instructors are highly skilled in fabrication but I think there could be improvements to the way they critique work, organize the course and interact with the students. At times there was a real lack of professionalism which led to certain tensions between the instructors and students. There was a lack of communication and structure in terms of scheduling - often it was assumed that changes to syllabus could be made informally.",
    "Great availability, high level preparation and professionality.",
    "Timothy Newton and Joshua Rowley have been exceptional professors.They have presented the project with great clarity and have been extremely supportive in our research and fabrication process during the course.They posses immense knowledge of furniture history, design and fabrication. They have been very helpful in, not only understanding the issues that are involved in making a chair, but in conveying the many techniques and technologies involved in this production.I believe that this course is a very important elective in the architecture curriculum. I think it greatly adds to our knowledge as builders and hope that I will have the opportunity to take it again to continue my exiting research.",
    "Josh is very direspectful to students. He plays favourites, has a bad attitude and is very immature, creating personal relationships and personal vendettas, instead of focussing his energy on helping and guiding a student through the fabrication process. He literally sabotages the work, consistently misses deadlines after agreeing to them and works very slowly. Josh has no respect and no regard for student time, making appointments with students and ignoring them. Josh claims to hold expertise in both fabrication and in design butis unable to back up his claims. His design criticism is completely useless, neither helping nor inspiring the student or the design, but is very disrespectul, insulting and attempts to belittle the student and their work.Tim has a very good understanding of design and gives good design criticism. Tim presents his ideas and criticism in a firm and deliberate manner, though still maintaining a professional rapor with the student.",
    "The instructors stimulated the personal quests of every student, and, as a result, a wide range of designs and fabrication techniques were tested in the course. This variety was very enriching."

    "Desk crits in early stages.",
    "Focused the syllabus, structure the course, be a bit more directed with the overall project. Group meetings for the first half of the semester were often too drawn out and unfocused, these could have been cut down to smaller groups or transitioned into individual discussions more quickly.",
    "do it again",
    "Extremely disorganized and unprofessional in the way they conducted this course. Often displayed attitude towards the students if they were not working as much as they considered acceptable. Also, there was a general lack of expertise in terms of how chairs are made, unless it involved metal or wood in rather straightforward ways. If this class were to be taught again, I would suggest considering the following\u0097introduce some sort of constraint\u0085type of chair, material used, focus on specific fabrication\/design techniques OR have each studentchoose a material process to focus on, study it alongside a series of precedents that employ such a process. Additionally, submitting a design at the inception of the class, rather than spending 2 months exploring design alternatives would have been helpful. Too much time was wasted in the beginning on design and unhelpful precedent studies, more could have been spent on fabrication tests, material tests, visits with furniture makers\/mfgs.",
    "Instead of playing politics and creating personal vendettas with students, Josh should think about working with students trying to help them, and make their projects as successful as possible, instead of trying to prove how it will fail. Josh must change his attitude.Outside fabrication experts should be brought in for the fabrication process to give students fabrication advice and work with students on the fabrication component of the course.",
    "Some extra theoretical information, like a brief history or genealogy of modern and contemporary chair design, can add to the course.Inviting designers as guests (small lectures) during the semester can also be a positive asset."
