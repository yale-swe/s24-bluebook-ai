    "I wouldn't not recommend it but if it's not necessary I wouldn't suggest others take it",
    "It's a pretty standard multivariable calculus course. I would recommend this to another student because it's fun and probably fulfills a requirement.",
    "This class is difficult and the problem sets are time consuming. Overall, I did learn a lot during the semester but it required extensive outside-of-class work. The pace of the class seemed fast to me.",
    "It's a rough, fast-paced multivariable class-- take it only if you really like math and are willing to commit on doing work on your own.",
    "If you have to take it, take it. If you don't, don't.",
    "I would recommend it to a student who took AP BC or higher. It is a good yet challenging next step.",
    "Yes but with caution due to the work and its difficulty.",
    "Math 120 is a very intensive introductory course. I would recommend Math 120 to students who are very serious about math and about taking upper level math courses in the Math Department.",
    "Math 120 is conceptually interesting but challenging. Indeed, the difficulty of the material accelerates dramatically as the semester proceeds. If you are thinking of taking this course, make sure to shop several sections in order to find a teacher whom you find to give clear explanations of the material."
