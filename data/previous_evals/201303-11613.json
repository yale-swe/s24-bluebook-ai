    "Good science class. Fun. New topics. Not as easy as everyone says it is. Huge lecture class.",
    "This class was misleadingly hard if you want to do well. Midterms came out of nowhere and sniped you with their difficulty. Problem sets were tough, but as long as you go to optional section you should never get below an A. The class was fine, but I'm not sure it's deserving of it's easy reviews. There's enough people in it that you can find friends to commiserate with but I wish it had been more interesting.",
    "I don't recommend this class unless you're interested in\/good at the subject. I came to dread this class, even though it wasn't my hardest, just because there's a lot of tedious work and the class isn't very rewarding.",
    "It is a class on natural disasters and how likely we are to die from them. I appreciate the knowledge, and don't know why I can't control the weather now that I know how it happens. I would highly recommend this class.",
    "Yes, I would recommend it, particularly if you are more of a humanities person.",
    "This course is perhaps one of the more deceptively easy courses at Yale. Problem sets? Not a big deal. Midterms? Horrendous. Particularly because the class seems to be trying to strike a balance between your typical gut class and an actual introduction to geology and meteorology, as explored through natural disasters. Don't rely on workload to choose the class. The professor doesn't want it to be a gut. I wish that had been clearer from the beginning, especially with regard to the uncurved midterms, which really changed everything. It's terrifying to go from scoring in the high 90's on problem sets to low 80's on midterms...and then to hear that they're uncurved. That said, (I'll stop bashing now), take this if you're serious about the subjectmatter. If you are, you'll have a great time!",
    "As the name would suggest, this class is a natural disaster. Like me, you are most likely a former DS student, an English major, or just someone who wouldn't be taking a science credit unless you absolutely had to in order to graduate. You've probably heard that \"Natty D\" is easy and you'll totally get an A. Well, bad news bears guys. The gravy train has ended, the professors have caught on, and this class has been made extremely more difficult. Not only is the material mind-numbingly boring, but psets are tedious. The difficulty in this class lies in the extremely odd grading. Different test problems are graded bydifferent TAs. Some seem to just have a stamp giving full credit while others take off tons of points for seemingly no reason. Moral of the story: don't take this course for your science credit. Take something else. Hear Issues Approach to Biology isn't bad.",
    "Take this class, It's awesome.One of the best classes I've taken here. Teaches you things about the workings of our planet that in a way everyone should know, and gives you a broad perspective on people and our role here. Prof. Bercovici is a great lecturer, passionate about teaching, and explains the material in an interesting way with movies, animations, props, and experiments on Fridays. He actually cares about the students, which is a rarity, and wants to teach them rather than just get the class over with. He even teaches sections himself to make sure students understand the material, which is very helpful.",
    "Definitely a cool class worth taking, even if you're not interesting in geology. I had no idea that I would like geology so much. Its a good science credit, and is an extremely popular class on an extremely relevant topic, considering out current global climate situation.",
    "If you are actually interested in Natural Disasters, this class is a good one to take, but the problem sets do require a lot of work each week, and the exams require a lot of study time because they are not similar to the problem sets.",
    "Yes, this is an easy and interesting science credit",
    "This is a good science credit. Beware that it is a fair amount of work. The problem sets are definitely manageable - if you go to section, they will give you all of the workings and sometimes the answers (it is taught like a class, so you can just go and sit and write them down) but you also usually have to spend a couple of hours figuring out some of the things that they leave out afterwards. Exams are also manageable, so long as you learn all of the facts etc. Just make sure you learn how they want you to answer their questions, because sometimes they call you out for small things.It's good for what it is - I wouldn't take it if I didn't need a science credit.",
    "This was not a good class. Powerpoints were very disorganized. During class, we moved very quickly and it was hard to pay attention. The midterms were unnecessarily difficult. Problem sets could be tough, but sections were helpful. One of the TFs was particularly good at explaining concepts. I would not recommend this class unless you are very interested in the topic.",
    "Yes. This is a good science to take for non-science majors.",
    "NOT A GUT. Interesting but definitely a lot of work. Psets do not relate to the exams at all and are very time consuming.",
    "Don't take it if you're actually interested in the material--take a higher level G&G course instead because you'll actually get more out of it, probably enjoy it more, and do about the same (or even less) amount of work. The fact that it's such a popular class really kills the learning environment, and, although it is considered THE gut science class, it's not that easy--grading for 350 students means your answer has to be exactly as written on the answer key to get any credit.",
    "Interesting but class size makes it hard to learn and enjoy. The review sessions each week with Bercovici were well worth going to, and he really is funny it's just a tough crowd.",
    "A good class if you're a non-science major looking for a science credit. Pretty interesting, professor is good, material and tests aren't that hard.",
    "DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS. The previous reviews said this class was funny and relatively easy, but it was certainly not so. The weekly psets are impossible to do by yourself and this means you have to attend the \"optional\" discussion sections. The two midterms were pretty difficult and the questions were always vague. The final, which I just took, was an epic disaster (Bercovici& Long have some sort of sadistic humor). Save yourself the trouble and find another class.",
    "A fine class- interesting enough. Science concepts aren't bad, math is sometimes tricky for just a SC credit.",
    "Yes good science credit but not super easy. Math problems aren't really explained well in class but section is good.",
    "The workload is ridiculously low. Just go to lecture most of the time, go to section where they GIVE you all the answers for the pset, don't bother buying the textbook, skim your notes quickly before each exam - and there you have it, a SC credit and an A. That's not to dismiss the class, though, because the content really was very interesting to learn\u00e2\u0080\u0094and the concepts themselves can actually get really complicated\u00e2\u0080\u0094but because the professors were so lenient with us, they never put any of the hard stuff on the exams.",
    "Great class, take it for your science credit. Homeworks are hard- but there is section to help with that. Exams are fair, Professor Bercovici is great too",
    "take it",
    "Take it. It's a good not too difficult science credit, especially if you're a humanities major who finds equations daunting. I took it credit\/d\/f and regretted it, as I went into the final with a solid A. I actually missed a couple of lectures too. If you go to at least one section a week and see the course tutor for questions you'll be fine. It's also an interesting course in it's own right. Natural disasters affect everyone and understanding them gives you an interesting perspective on global events. Also now I understand the beauty of geology jokes.",
    "Psets were way harder than I expected. Midterms were graded kind of arbitrarily; it really depended on which TA graded yours. Eh was alright overall as a science credit.",
    "Very superficial introduction to basic geological concepts, disasters, etc. I took some good general knowledge away from the course, but it was nothing I couldn't have learned on my own from reading textbooks or looking things up online.",
    "worth taking",
    "THIS IS NOT A GUT SCIENCE. I REPEAT--NOT A GUT SCIENCE. PROCEED WITH CAUTION.",
    "I would recommend it, and I would recommend taking good notes and doing the home works along with the lectures so that you don't have to relearn as much when you're studying. There's also very little math especially on the tests, which I wasn't sure would be the case.",
    "Harder than you are expecting but don't let that be a deterrent. Make sure you go to the sections cause they will do the problem sets for you.",
    "G&G100 was a great lecture. Like many students, I took it simply because I needed a science credit, but I actually got a ton out of it \u00e2\u0080\u0094 which I really didn't expect. The class represents the perfect opportunity to learn some scientific concepts that become extremely interesting when you apply them to the context of natural disasters. The course is kind of ingenious in that regard: the scientific material is applied clearly to natural disasters, which will be relevant to most people at one time or another over the course of their lives. Whereas other science classes for non-science majors aim to just teach the introductory, foundational material of a given discipline, this class applies theory to something very accessible and the whole thing becomes more worthwhile as a result.I do think the final units of the class were a little disorganized and not as cumulative as other sections of the course might have been. It seemed like some of the final lectures focused on random material like the origin of life, etc., and it wasn't always clear how the concepts we were learning tied into the natural disasters theme.",
    "A great science credit. The problem sets can be difficult but definitely worth itand the sections are really helpful in problem solving. Definitely take this class for interesting general knowledge and a good science credit!",
    "Take it. Just do it.~p~e~e~r~ ~p~r~e~s~s~u~r~e~",
    "It is a science course that discusses the causes and some of the science behind Natural Disasters. The class consists of problem sets, two midterms, and the final. Problem sets are a lot harder than the material covered in lecture but if you go to section (there are three section times available), you will do fine in the problem sets. Both the midterms and final are reasonable. Powerpoints are posted online with class content. Reviewing powerpoints and old problem sets for a couple of hours and you'll do fine in the class. Its not a complete gut but not that hard of a SC credit.",
    "My GPA's worst nightmare",
    "Good science class. interesting. Hw and tests aren't super easy though. Need to put in studying. I would recommend going to class because you actually learn the material and Bercovici presents it well",
    "yes definitely, good science credit",
    "Great class for a non-science student to take.",
    "Great science credit for non science majors. weekly psets, and they're mathy, but definitely not too difficult.",
    "Definitely take it. It's relevant and straightforward and you will learn a lot with not much effort.",
    "Take it! A wonderful way to get a science credit. Not as good as Ornithology, but still quite fun and you learn a lot. Not very hard, and a reasonable amount of work.",
    "I would recommend it for a science credit.",
    "Yes.",
    "It's a gem",
    "A great Science credit. You'll find out by the end that you actually understand how weather\/general earth science works, which is good knowledge to have \u00e2\u0080\u0094 definitely more \"useful\" than other options for non-science majors. Weekly problem sets, two midterms, a final \u00e2\u0080\u0094 mostly about conceptual understanding. Low stress, can be fun, good course.",
    "Loved this course! Great science class for non-majors. Not actually about just natural disasters; we also covered topics like population and the origin of life, which was equally interesting. Actually challenges you on the problem sets and makes you think (in a good way) -- not a drop-dead boring gut the way a lot of other non-science major science credits are. The assessments are very fair -- just be sure to actually study, because they're not automatic As in any way!",
    "Weekly psets are the hardest part of the class. If you go to section, they will help you out on them",
    "Fun, interesting, pretty chill. The Psets are written short answer questions and physics (no experience required).",
    "The material covered in lecture is not too difficult to learn, but the problem sets are much harder than anything done in class. If you go to section, it should be fine.",
    "The material was interesting, but the class overall was very disorganized. The lectures were not easy to follow, as there were too many tangents, and it was hard to tell what material was important for the tests. Despite being advertised as one of the easier science courses, I ended up having to put quite a bit of work in the class to do well.",
    "Fairly easy class, but the math sections of the tests can be tough.",
    "great course for non science majors",
    "Natural Disaster's is not a gut: it's a manageable science. You will need to use some basic algebra\/physics and know concepts. Sections are very helpful for success in the class, though you won't learn much from lecture.",
    "Studying geological, meteorological, and cosmological natural disasters.Yes, because it's like Bill Nye for college students; extremely interesting information.",
    "This class was a bit of a mixed bag, and perhaps not everything that it's cracked up to be. The professors are truly wonderful people and very caring. They get to know students in a huge class, infuse humor, and are very knowledgable and passionate about the subject matter. However, do not be fooled: the class can be quite difficult at times. Problem sets are very difficult to complete without the help of review sessions (which are 3x\/week, to the class's credit) and involve a lot of physics. Tests also include some of this as well, but to a lesser degree. There's nothing wrong with this type of class; it is just misleading given the class description. In fact, after the 2nd midterm, topics included everything BUT natural disasters in the scientific world.",
    "Take it! Workload is not too difficult and the material is interesting. Not a total gut SC credit, but if you put in the time and effort you'll do a good job in the class.",
    "This class was horrible. I've been waiting all semester to write a review about it. It has a reputation for being an easy science credit, but it is not. I don't mind working hard, but the Problem Sets had us multiplying obnoxious numbers for the sake of it. Class was boring. There was little reason to attend, because the material covered was exactly the same as the material on the PowerPoints. They didn't really connect to the class. Also, the anti-cheating policies put in place (like no typing) slowed down my productivity. The class tried to cover way too much material (floods, earthquakes, meteors, etc.) which meant we couldn't focus on any particular area in any detail. All in all, this was a poor science credit to take. Take a real science class. That's what I should have done. I regret taking this class.",
    "Definitely take this course. Great class for non-science majors who need to fill the requirement but still want to have fun in class.",
    "This isn't just about earthquakes and volcanoes. Be prepared for plate tectonics, cosmological events, and physics. I would recommend this if youre looking for an interesting, non traditional science. This is NOT a gut.",
    "Science for non science majors - kind of surprisingly hard - but ways around it",
    "Take this class! Great science credit and really interesting material! Professor B is awesome",
    "Do not take this class it is harder than advertised.",
    "Overall, a pretty easy science credit if you're a non-science major. Homework is a breeze if you go to section, and the exams are pretty fair. Prof. Bercovici is awesome and a really fun guy, and going to lectures are worth it!",
    "You can very a good grade in the class, but you have to put in more work than you may think. The psets take a full night a week to complete. Two or three days focused studying for the exams and you'll get an A.",
    "Great science credit. Interesting and manageable.",
    "This class is certainly not a gut!!!I wouldn't recommend it as long as it stays a big lecture class. The lectures are too tempting to miss, because the content itself is not that hard. It's the P-sets that are problematic. They involve a certain understanding of physics and math that was beyond what we were informed of.The midterms and finals aren't too bad if you learn the material (which you can mostly do without going to lecture and reading the slides afterwards).This would be a really great class if it wasn't so invisible. Section is optional, so there was no need to actually interact with the professor or teaching fellow.Shop the class. But, be wary of these things\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 It's not an easy A (even though your friends and the YDN will laugh at you for taking it), but I guess it's a science credit that's not actual science...",
    "Weekly problem sets about math and then lectures twice a week about geology. Yes.",
    "This class was more difficult than I expected. The problem sets are difficult and require a good amount of time. If you are not a math\/science person, this class will be difficult for you.",
    "Excellent course. Would highly recommend for someone looking to fulfill a Science credit.",
    "The exams for this class are jokes, and as long as you go to the problem sessions the problem sets are really easy. Definitely a great science course for non-science majors. The material itself is actually fairly interesting as well.",
    "Don't take it! Too smart to be a dumb class, too dumb to be a smart class.",
    "I would recommend it, because help is readily available so you can succeed if you reach out to the many resources available.",
    "Overall fine course if you need a science credit or are a G&G major. I actually learned a lot. Maybe not necessarily as much from class, since they went through the slides REALLY QUICKLY and the slides had a lot of words on them. But I learned a lot through actually studying for these tests. The tests were also straightforward enough so you had to study a lot but were rewarded if you actually studied. All in all, recommended. Also there's a field trip where you go hiking and a spring break trip. That's a nice perk!",
    "Great course, not too much work and the work is all straight forward. Very informative and fun class.",
    "This class isn't as easy as people make out. It is very physics heavy in the problem sets and there is a wide range of content to cover. That being said, the concepts aren't difficult to understand and there is no extra reading.",
    "This course was unexpectedly difficult, mostly because the material was presented in an unclear manner. Lectures and powerpoint slides could have been more direct. Problem sets had a lot of math, which wasn't really tested on the midterms. Also, the professor mentioned he wouldn't test factoids, but more on mechanisms and understanding of processes. This was misleading because on the final, we were given names of historical floods and asked to name causes. Also, there was no curve which was also annoying.",
    "Natural Disasters is a solid science credit for non-science majors. Lecture could be boring sometimes, but overall I learned a lot and did not feel overwhelmed by the material. The weekly problem sets contained a frightening amount of math, but they explained what to do very thoroughly in section. There are two midterms and one final, and you need to be really well prepared for them.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course for anyone who wants to get a science credit (or just take a science class) even though science isn't one of their strengths. The material covered in class was thorough and interesting, and I thought the level of difficulty was pretty reasonable for someone without much of a background in science.",
    "Broad subjects, quite interesting, quite easy",
    "Not a gut! Dave is really great and should get more credit than he does for this course but this is not an easy A or even A-. The way I see it, I'll be lucky to scrape by with a B.",
    "The professor gives you everything you need to learn and do well- posted lecture slides, problem set help sessions, exam review sessions. The questions, especially on the exams, are more about broad concepts than factoids. If you start studying a few days in advance and have a good grasp on the major concepts, you'll be fine. I recommend it for a science credit. Plus, EVERYONE takes the class for either a credit or for a science credit so you have people to study and do psets with.",
    "Definitely take the class! Especially if you don't wanna take a hard science.",
    "Awesome class, learned a lot of really awesome material, straightforward exams, highly recommended!",
    "I would recommend this class to another student who is looking for a good science credit with a manageable workload.",
    "Natural Disasters is overall a good course, with some strengths and weaknesses. The professors were phenomenal-- super engaging, funny, and genuinely interested in their fields. The weekly psets for the class were a pain; I had never taken physics before, which I think caused me some additional trouble. They were surprisingly challenging and time consuming; I found it absolutely necessary to go to the weekly sections to complete them. There was also very little correlation between the lectures and the psets, which was hard for me. Overall the lecture in this class was great and super interesting, but the course is generally much more math-heavy than I expected. I took this for a science credit, and it is a good one-- but beware, it is not a gut!",
    "This course is more difficult than it at first appears (and I say this as a Computer Science major with a strong background in math, chemistry, and biology), not because the course material is difficult but because questions can be confusingly worded and grading can be harsh. Other reviews will probably say that it's not a gut course, but I'd argue that it's a straightforward science credit (and is pretty simple, provided you put in the required work).",
    "I would. It's not unbelievably \"gutty.\" You need to do the required preparation for the two mid terms and final, but if you go to class (just monday and wednesday, the Friday class isn't necessary), and study for a few hours before the exams you'll do fine. You don't really need to do the readings, and if you go to the optional sections, they will walk you through the psets. Overall, a good class (you do actually learn some interesting things) and a good way to get a science credit.",
    "I didn't really like it that much, it's a good science credit but you won't necessarily get an A",
    "This was a great course! The material that is covered is interesting and engaging. There also isn't too much work expected of you. The problem sets are straight forward, and the tests are very fair. If you can, take this course!",
    "Natural Disasters studies not only natural disasters, but also their implications, histories, and other topics such as the formation of the earth, the solar system, and the formation of life. I'd recommend Natural Disasters to someone who thinks he or she would be vaguely interested in the topic, or to someone who is not great at science but is looking for a science credit.",
    "Natural Disasters is a fantastic Sc cred for those who are willing to put in some work. Don't go into this expecting it to be a gut, though. The problem sets are challenging and you definitely have to study for the tests. As long as you're willing to put in some effort, the course is very rewarding and you can learn a lot from it.",
    "If you're looking for a Science credit, this is one of those that will inevitably pop up on your radar. It was a decent class, and unlike some others, is not so super easy that it is insulting--much of the material is actually pretty useful knowledge. The exams and problems sets were fairly graded, but they do take a little bit of effort to prepare for.",
    "I would recommend to students who also had a solid math background. The SC credit is deceptive as all homework involved some quite difficult problem sets.",
    "This class isn't nearly as much of a gut as it's hyped up to be. The second midterm was really unfair, and nothing is curved. The slides are pretty expansive, and he tests you on minute details while claiming to just care about broad themes.The material is really interesting, though sometimes unfocused (at the end we got into biology and human evolution ... what does that have to do with natural disasters?) He hosts a neat field trip to West Rock and supposedly the Spring Break trip is fun.PS Expect long, busywork-filled homeworks.",
    "I recommend Natural Disasters to anyone interested in G&G, but not sure about the major, or anyone who needs a science credit. It is a great, broad introduction to the department and a generally engaging course. Take it if you can!",
    "A physics and geology course which becomes, at times, intensive in nature. If you're not particularly interested in the topic or are just taking the course as an easy\/gutty science, don't do it - you'll get more than you bargained for.",
    "I thought this class was a great science credit. It was pretty interesting, and I learned a lot about the causes and mechanics of natural disasters. The professor was engaging though I think he often tried to cover too much material in a single class period. There were three section meetings each week that were not mandatory so that was a great resource to have to help with homework. The tests were straight forward and focused more on how things work than details. As long as you study, it's not difficult to do well on the tests. There were two midterms which isn't ideal, but it helped to stay on top of all the information.",
    "A great survey of geology and not too challenging. Great for a science credit.",
    "Solid class, but weekly problem sets amount to a lot of work. Concepts are easy to understand but math on exams was difficult at times. Do not take this class if you think you're gonna cruise to a good grade.",
    "Good class and you learn a lot of interesting material, but by no means a gut. Problem sets are easy, because there are office hours every week where they go through all the problems and tell you how to do them. However, the questions on the midterms can be tricky and there's never enough time to finish in 50 minutes so make sure you study hard for the final to make up for it. You often have to learn the material on your own because Professor Bercovici speaks way too fast in class. That said, a very interesting class to get an SC credit.",
    "FrattyD",
    "Super easy but interesting. Take it if you need a science credit.- you don't ever have to go to lecture- no section- psets just ask you to either plug numbers into given equations or to copy facts from lecture slides- tests only ask general concepts and no specific facts or formulasAlso, if you are one of the best students and never forget to hand in your psets, then you'll be able to go to the spring break trip to Hawaii or the Caribbean...",
    "Yes. The subject is great. The material reading is clear and intriguing. If you work hard you can do well.",
    "Not too tough of a SC credit. Weekly problem set, and two simple midterms.",
    "the math is difficult but the conceptual concepts are fascinating",
    "Take it. Easy class.",
    "Well I dropped it so...",
    "Not hard so long as you keep up with the material. Pay attention in lecture, go to section, turn in psets, study a little for tests and you will do fine. Professor Bercovici is a great teacher. I took this class for a Sc and was very happy with my experience.",
    "Annoying. Boring class",
    "Although the homework may seem intimidating, the sections really help. Also the topics covered are really interesting and I would definitely use this for a science requirement if you need it.",
    "Interesting",
    "DEFINITELY! The material is fascinating and timely. Both professors give great lecturers. The TFs (esp. Joe) who do sections are god-sent. Exams can be a genuine struggle, but preparing for exams was always a joy. Memorize the PowerPoints and how to do ALL the homework problems--you still might not ace the exam, but if you put in the work, you should get an A overall.",
    "Not a gut. But perfectly doable. Go to section and you will be fine!!",
    "One of the better and easier science credits. Students come from a wide range so don't assume curves will save you. One problem set a week, which is manageable and the TFs are always willing to help.",
    "If legitimately interested in what factors contribute to the formation of natural disasters, this is the class for you. A good class for completing distributional requirement, but takes effort to understand material in-depth enough to do well.",
    "Highly recommend! This was an excellent class: interesting material, well-taught, fair exams, reasonable workload. The professors and TAs were so helpful, holding problem solving sections every week for homework and review sessions for exams. Professor Bercovici and Professor Long are awesome- they even took the time to organize a weekend field trip to West Rock, which was a lot of fun. They really wanted to you to get something out of their class, to understand the big picture, and didn't kill you with detail which was a breath of fresh air. All in all a great experience.",
    "I would recommend it to another student. The material is interesting and manageable.",
    "material is somewhat interesting, not very tricky. weekly problem sets can be annoying but are easy and can be done very quickly, especially if you go to the problem sessions. midterms and final come almost entirely from lecture slides. overall, it's an easy and simple science course for the humanities\/social science student.",
    "It's a quality course for non science majors but the problem sets don't pertain to the class. You have to go to the extra review sessions to do well. I would recommend to others.",
    "Yes! If you don't need a science credit, probably not, but this class ended up being super enjoyable. It's not that difficult, and I found myself talking to my friends outside of class about what I had learned.",
    "Great class, definitely recommended.",
    "If you are looking for a science credit, and you have limited scientific knowledge, this is the course for you.",
    "Natural Disasters is a great course for non-science majors who need a science credit. The lectures and power points are very in-depth. If you ever need help with a problem set, you can go to section.",
    "It honestly depends on whether the material interests them. If not, it can get tedious. But it is very concept-based and relevant to the way the world works.",
    "I recommend it, but it's not as easy as you'd think.",
    "This class is not a gut! The problem sets take at least two and a half hours per week, and the exams definitely require studying.",
    "I went to M\/W lectures but probably didn't need to because it didn't help much on homework or tests. Seemed like most people didn't have enough time on the midterms. Homeworks weren't too hard but most went to Thursday night section having done none of it.",
    "Lectures three times a week, two midterms and a final. You go to one of three optional sections for homework help each week and that's about it.",
    "This is not a gut class! However the TA sessions are essential and important. They really help on the P-Sets. Make time for the TA sessions if you are going to take this class!",
    "Good course! More challenging than it looks. As long as you review major concepts, you'll be OK.",
    "Yes I would recommend this class. Professor B is amazing and really funny!",
    "Natty D is a good class and an okay science credit. I'm majoring in the opposite of Sc classes (English\/American Studies) so I was really just trying to find something really easy and maybe moderately interesting. GO TO SECTION ONCE A WEEK, because they help you get through the psets sooooo much. I did badly on the first midterm (didn't keep up and studied the wrong things -- there was practically nothing from psets on the exam) and so I ended up signing up for a tutor before the second midterm, which was really helpful. My tutor was able to go through lecture slides with me and break down the concepts into pretty basic terms (which were all we needed for the exams anyway). Prof. Bercovici tended to go more into depth than was necessary and, as a person with a truly limited science background, I couldn't always keep up. For anyone with a decent grasp of basic chem\/bio concepts (plus a little physics for the psets) this class shouldn't be bad. But if you're a person who really doesn't do well in science classes and took some mediocre ones in high school (aka me), you'll probably be better served by trying to get into a science-for-humanities-major seminar. ALSO, sidenote, there are a ton of former natty d classes' resources on the internet that I didn't know about until after the exam, so if you take the class those will probably help you a lot.",
    "An interesting science course for someone who possibly does not plan on majoring in the sciences and wants to learn about our worlds natural disasters, among other things.",
    "It's an okay class. Pretty good for a SC credit but other than that I wouldn't recommend it.",
    "I would recommend this class to people who need a science credit and are looking for an interesting, but manageable class. However, if you don't have a basic physics background (high school level) you will have to attend the optional section for the problem sets. This class is not a gut, but is not difficult and is very interesting.",
    "Solid class to learn about current natural disasters and their effects.",
    "Relatively easy science credit, but the p-sets are tedious. Go to section and get help and you'll be fine.",
    "I took it to get a science credit and an easy A, and would probably not recommend doing so. There are easier science classes, and this class could be very frustrating at times, especially the weekly homeworks that had to be hand-written. That said, it's possible to get an A without ever going to class, so while it takes up most of your Thursday evenings, it's not a huge burden. It seemed like Prof Bercovici was attempting to make the class more serious.",
    "Not a gut.",
    "I would say it is more demanding of a science credit than people think. You really need to study and learn the material, especially the math.",
    "Natty-D is a convinient if not gutty science class - if you go to lectures and section and do your homework, you are all set. Homeworks do take time every week, but they are easy and they get done. The exams are similarly not horrible at all.",
    "look to this class if you want a science credit and you aren't a science major",
    "No, didn't think it was that interesting. There are better classes to take as a gut.",
    "This is a good science course for non-science majors, but I would not consider it a gut. The math is not hard but do require an understanding of the book and\/or lecture. Overall, I recommend this course. Professor Bercovici is an entertaining lecturer, and the subject material is interesting and new; I had never studied any of these particular concepts before, though it helped to have studied both chemistry and physics.",
    "A great course where you learn invaluable information about the way our earth works. It isn't a lot of work, but I've walked out so much more knowledgable. You must take this class.",
    "Absolutely take this class. It's really amazing how much knowledge you have by the end of the semester.",
    "You're probably considering this class because you need a science credit. I'm not sure how I feel about Natty D. On the one hand, it was relatively easy, and the problem sets\/workload was extremely manageable. But at the same time, it was boring as hell and I didn't feel like I learned all that much. Professors Bercovici and Long were great, though, and very approachable.",
    "A great science credit for non-science majors. Even though the material is fairly easy to grasp, it still requires a lot of work. It's a rewarding class - if you do the work, you can get a good grade. I would definitely recommend it to another student.",
    "G&G 100 is an interesting introduction to the way the Earth works and how\/why natural disasters occur. The topic is very relevant to everyday life, and because of this it can be really engaging and fascinating. Throughout the course, we discuss not only natural disasters (hurricanes, tornadoes, fires, volcanoes, etc) but we also touch on theories of the solar system's and Earth's formation, as well as some other interesting topics (such as the Earth's magnetic field, the development of life, the evolution of the atmosphere and environment...) The weekly psets are not too difficult, and the course offers optional section three times a week. There are 2 midterms and a final, which are similar in difficulty to the psets."
