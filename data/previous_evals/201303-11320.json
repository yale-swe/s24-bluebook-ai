   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this course to aspiring novelists or beginning writers. For someone at a more advanced writing level, the regularity of writing will tone the fiction muscles as well as inspire new ideas for longer pieces. Maybe YOU will decide to length one of these exercises ON YOUR OWN...outside of class! For beginning writers, this was a warm environment in which to explore some of the nuances of fiction writing.",
    "Would definitely recommend this class to anyone interested in growing as a creative writer and really delving into the writing process. I loved writing a short story every week and reading great works of fiction.",
    "By all means take this course if you want to learn what fiction writing is about. The readings are very interesting. The discipline of having to write your own short piece every week is useful. You will write 30 to 40 pages by the end of the course. That seems like a lot, but it adds up pretty painlessly at the rate of three pages of fiction each week plus two longer pieces. That being said, it is a 100 level course and if you have done some writing before you might be happier with the 400 level courses if you can get into them.",
    "Take it! If you're interested in writing, it's a really great class. Although I'm still not as comfortable in fiction (versus nonacademic non-fiction), I never felt out of my depth but I was definitely pushed.",
    "I think this is a great class for anyone to flex their writing muscles and learn some cogent principles in the craft. Read, write, read some more and comment; I think it's a lot more powerful for an inexperienced -to-junior writer than a workshop seminar. I would say that every writer should have a craft class, and this is a nice pick. That said, those who are not looking to be writing concentration but still enjoy writing, even if it's new to them, will love it as well and find it enriching.",
    "Workshop class, you get the chance to write Many different pieces but may not get as much feedback as you like",
    "Short piece due every Saturday morning which if you procrastinate ruins your Friday night. Long seminar once a week which is quite tedious as you just discuss the reading and everyone vies for participation points. Two revisions the whole semester which is the only thing you get feedback on from the professor (and the only grade you see). You post your stories and get comments from other students which can sometimes be helpful, but all in all this class will not improve your writing that much. However, you will produce a lot of stuff which is nice-you just have to put in the effort. Not that demanding a class and something to take if you don't want a challenge.",
    "I would not take this class with Prof Hopkins. He was enthusiastic but very frazzled. I felt we did not delve deeply into the works we read, did not find class discussion very well guided, and did not get beneficial feedback on my writing."
