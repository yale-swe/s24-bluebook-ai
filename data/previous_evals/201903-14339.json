That being said, although at times the homework was difficult and took up a lot of time, Professor Liu did a good job of reducing the amount of problems so that the homework became fair, although still hard. I would maybe spend a few minutes at the beginning of class reviewing material from previous classes that is necessary for the current class."

    "This is a very good beginning class for algebraic geometry.",
    "If you've taken commutative algebra and want to see more of it, take this course. This class is very rewarding if you put in the time. Be ready to go to office hours or to supplement the class with a couple different textbooks because Hartshorne's book can be difficult (and frustratingly leaves some important facts to the exercises).",
    "Yes, it was useful to go through the basics of sheaves, schemes, and cohomology.",
    "Yes absolutely, if they are prepared to work.",
    "This course is very challenging and it takes a lot of commitment to really master. Although the only prerequisite is commutative algebra at the level of Math 380\/500, I feel that there are really a couple of other implicit prerequisites. First, one must really know commutative algebra really well, maybe even a little beyond what was learning in Math 380\/500, or at least be able to learn it on the fly. Some of the homework problems beg for some of the facts in commutative algebra that were maybe only mentioned in my modern algebra class, such as various forms of Nakayama's lemma. Also, it would help tremendously to have taken classical, undergraduate commutative algebra. We speed through this material in a few weeks (Hartshorne chapter 1) so we can get to the more advanced material, and I feel it would have helped me tremendously through the whole course if I had seen this material before in greater detail."
