    "This class started off too difficult, and then didn't progress in difficulty. I think instead Edgar needs to begin the first couple of weeks with really really basic examples, like perhaps we do the first problem set in excel so people can see what matrices look like during linear algebra transformations. Then after a couple weeks of simple stuff, when the whole class is on the same page, then we can accelerate more quickly into asking more complicated questions and answering them using IOA.",
    "The readings were dense and would have been difficult to digest before the class lecture discussion. In addition, the problem sets were too frequent and did not allow for adequate feedback between problem sets. Edgar Hertwich is brilliant and knows the material, but could improve his communication skills and spend more time explaining the concepts.",
    "I think this course is so valuable to the F&ES curriculum, but I think it needs some restructuring. The course should keep one lecture and one lab section - this was so valuable to learning MatLab. I think there needs to be a session on learning linear algebra and matrix multiplication and the math behind the work required for the course. I also think there needs to be more explanation of what we are doing in MatLab and what it means. It felt like we were just supposed to figure this stuff out on our own outside of class and come into class and already know it - when most of us had never see MatLab before nor done any linear algebra.",

    "1. Exposure to technical carbon modeling skills that helped build meaningful bridges between the theoretical aspects of climate and carbon to the quantitative. 2. The applied math course at FES was very theoretical, in contrast with this course that covers - in part - similar content ie matrices and actually helps one build meaningful intuition in working with these values. 3. The course helps one develop the ability to easily work with large meta-data sets",
    "Learning Matlab, and gaining insight into tiers of production.",
    "Understanding the input-output process of calculating carbon footprints is valuable, and learning how to use Matlab was a great skill.",
    "I loved that there was a lab component to this course - I feel like I learned a hard skill and a new software, which I was looking for.",
    "The data files provided was very nice.",
    "The final project was the most useful and interesting aspect of the course.",
    "Relevance- it is critical that we have a course that will allow students to understand concepts or methods of quantification within the climate change discourse on a deeper level. I really valued having the opportunity to take a deep dive into what carbon footprint modeling really tells us and how it can be used or misused in climate mitigation strategies. It is critical that we have this level of depth at FES."

   "question_text": "What aspects of this course need the most improvement?",
   "comments": [
    "This course is very helpful for those students keen on climate at FES and is useful in addition to the policy classes on climate and carbon. However, because it was a new course, I think it took a bit of time for us to build a certain level of intuition but once we were able to, the remaining classes were very enjoyable. I think that, while some classes such as the Applied Math class can be to a certain extent theoretical, they can, given the right TA support, be useful in just helping with understanding basic matrix operations as this is what the first portion of this class addresses. However, this course can still achieve this if it is allotted a module training session outside of the allotted class time.",
    "Lecture classes needed more variety. I suggest that sometimes the class splits up and prepares two different journal articles that we then debate in class. Or one week instead of a problem set the readings require a written response that we discuss in class.",
    "Explain the concepts and processes in more detail and with more clarity. Spend additional time covering linear algebra at the beginning of class so everyone is on the same page.",
    "Better explaining\/showing\/teaching the fundamentals of the industrial ecology analysis we did in class. We need to really learn what the different matrices represent, how they are added\/multiplied, and how to write the code in order to get the answer you are looking for. We had a few quizzes in class and after the first quiz some students did not perform well. Instead of giving us an answer key and giving us a session to learn what was done wrong, we were just given the quiz again. This did not allow for maximum learning and understanding of the content.",
    "Making linear algebra course as a prerequisite would have been good because we had to waste the first few classes going over basic matrices. And some people were still confused on simple matrices calculations... If we could use those class times on actual carbon footprinting calculations not linear algebra, I would have been able to learn more.",
    "The classes could benefit from some student engagement or discussion time to break up the class time between teaching and student led discussion.",
    "Course requirements would be helpful- this course was a bit above my level."

Elementary knowledge of matrix operations is important Incredibly helpful for those students who are keen on specializing in climate and energy at FES, in addition to the policy classes. It is also a great complement to the Energy Systems Analysis class offered in the fall as well as Climate and Society offered in the spring.",
    "This is a challenging class, and the instruction is inconsistent. Wait another year while they work out the kinks before taking it.",

    "You will have to do a lot of the learning on your own time (about linear algebra, matrix multiplication, input-output tables) as this is not well explained in class. If you are comfortable doing this, then you should definitely take this class as you will learn a great hard skill!",
    "Please take a linear algebra class..",
