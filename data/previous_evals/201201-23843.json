    "Strengths: inter-graduate school collaboration with Forestry and IR students, practical application, hands-on work with a purposeWeaknesses: Not always the most efficient use of class time, would have liked more in-depth discussions about the readings",
    "Strengths: trip to HaitiWeakness: we did not get to learn too much about sustainable development as a whole but more just about the country and culture of haiti",
    "This class is a unique opportunity to work closely with professors and students from other graduate programs. Overall the class covered a wide range of topics from history to anthropology to forestry to public health, but Haiti was the always the underlying theme. This class is what you make of it, and you will miss out if you don't take full advantage of the diverse lectures, field trips, readings and other learning experiences it offers.",
    "Strengths were the professors and TA - all were incredibly supportive and knowledgeable. They were encouraging and provided us with a wealth of knowledge about Haiti.The hands on experience of working with a client in Haiti was also a strength of the course, as well as the lectures that taught us about Haitian history and context of where we were working.",
    "This course is excellent for Public Health Students with a global focus who are seeking to gain practical experience in the field. It also provides a great overview of health system strengthening, provision of care in limited- resource settings and program design."

    "Student consultancy for Hospital Albert Schweitzer - develop proposals that fit their goals",
    "If you have to take one course at Yale, this is the course to go, the field trip to Haiti was absolutely one of the most amazing experiences of my life.",
    "This course provides an amazing learning experience, but what you get out of it is largely dependent on the effort you put in. This class deals with real issues and the projects can have a real impact. Traveling to and working in Haiti was the highlight of the course, but the preparation before and group work after tie it all together.",
    "Yes - I would recommend this course to fellow students. It was experiential learning and provided all of us with an opportunity to work on the ground and abroad - an opportunity most other courses do not allow. Thank you to the professors for making this possible!",
    "Students interested in gaining practical experience in a global setting will really benefit from this class."
