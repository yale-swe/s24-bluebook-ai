    "This course covers the basics of electronic materials. Very valuable class for an electrical engineer. Workload includes psets about every other week (sometimes weekly), midterm, final project, and oral final exam. Take it if Prof. Han is teaching it. He's very helpful in class and in office hours.",
    "Take this course. It is interesting and manageable in any course load.",
    "I would take it - you learn some cool stuff and the final presentation on a topic of your choice gives you the chance to apply some of the stuff you learned."
