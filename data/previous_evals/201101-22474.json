    "Definitely take this class if you have any interest whatsoever in jazz history--Professor Veal is fantastic, it's not an overwhelming amount of work, and you'll hear a lot of music and learn about a lot of musicians who aren't often studied. (Don't expect the class to focus on big names that you've heard of, though; it's more about the avant-garde and non-mainstream figures, but that makes it all the more exciting).",
    "WORKLOAD:--> four 3-5p papers (grading not too strict; just include a lot of specific details and you'll do fine) out of seven possible \"units\" (you choose four over the course of the semester, which is nice)--> weekly section (really chill, sometimes fun!)--> one final paper, 10-15p (not very difficult to do after the four papers)************************************************************************************CLASS:--> lecture for about 20-30 people, with some class participation (you might get called out), lots of musical clips played in class, usually we watched a full video every three weeks--> warning: there was a no-computer policy instituted in the last two weeks, so you probably won't be able to have a laptop if this is offered next year",
    "It was an awesome course. There's not enough courses on popular music history, be sure to take something with Michael Veal.",
    "Highlighting many special jazz musicians through readings, movies, and song selections.",
    "Take this class! Professor Veal is really chill and the class is a little back-loaded (suggestion: do the listening response papers early). You'll listen to insane and ridiculous music, but actually understand it.",
    "TAKE IT (or anything with Professor Veal). It was definitely something I visited on a bit of a whim in shopping week, and ended up being one of my favorite classes at Yale!"
