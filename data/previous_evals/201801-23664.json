    "The four key areas were all well-supported: listening, speaking, reading, and writing.",
    "I learned A LOT of Spanish by sitting in a classroom setting and learning through speech",
    "Basic Spanish",
    "I learned basic speaking skills in Spanish ( past and present tense) and enough vocab to have a small discussion in Spanish",
    "I went from not knowing any Spanish at all to being able to speak comprehensible sentences in Spanish.",
    "This is an AMAZING course to add to your schedule! I learned the (very) basics of Spanish vocabulary and grammar and had a blast doing it. This course also felt like a stress relief from other courses -- just the routine of it, the daily homework, and the wonderful classroom environment that Professor Alexandrov created.",
    "I went from knowing essentially no Spanish whatsoever to being able to hold a basic conversation in Spanish, speak for five minutes during an oral exam, and write short, 1-page essays. It was pretty rewarding!"

   "comments": [
    "Strengths: extensively covers all necessary intro material. Weaknesses: could use more mixed media, i.e. videos and music from outside of the textbook. The class would have to slow down a little bit to allow the time to build this in.",
    "I love the structure of the Spanish department. I think the periodic tests and the textbook we use make it really easy for students to accumulate knowledge.",
    "It was very fast-paced",
    "The professor was really helpful and she gave me feedback that helped me improved in class.",
    "Great course.",
    "Strengths: Professor Alexandrov was wonderful always enthusiastic about teaching, patient when correcting our mistakes, and clear in her explanations of grammar topics. Class was very well-organized and it was clear what was expected of you for each assignment. It's honestly pretty difficult to think of any possible improvements to the class. The one thing I can think of is that it would be nice to get more practice with conversational speaking. I know some other languages have weekly office hours outside of class intended specifically to practice speaking with a professor or TA. This, or pairing up students to practice speaking outside of class, might be helpful."

    "Yes, for anyone who has a compelling reason to want to learn the language and is willing to put in the daily work.",

    "Yes, it involved learning Spanish fast",
    "Yes, the instructors are really helpful and it's a useful language to know",
    "Yes - I needed to fulfill my language requirement, and this course was very fun.",
    "Yes absolutely! Especially with Professor Alexandrov, she is an absolute dream of a teacher!",
    "Would definitely recommend! Professor Alexandrov is wonderful, the workload is regular but reasonable, and attending class was generally just a fun experience. It's pretty rewarding to go from having no Spanish knowledge whatsoever to learning a lot rapidly and efficiently in this class."
