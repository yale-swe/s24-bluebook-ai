    "In structure, The Classics and Modern Theory is very straightforward. Just a standard seminar: weekly readings, two hours of discussion, two shorter papers and a term paper. The readings are really very interesting and closely interrelated: I thought of them in something of a \"footnotes to Nietzsche\" type of way, even though many of the works departed from him and are significant in their own right. We touched on psychoanalysis, feminism, deconstruction, anthropology, sociology, etc.; something of a survey of twentieth-century (continental) philosophy - but only those parts that related to the Classics. I actually thought this was a very clever idea: the classical texts linked the works together in a way that made them easier to analyze, understand, and compare. I know this isn't insightful advice, but: take it if you're into it.",
    "Absolutely! Take it if Professor Billings offers it again. You won't regret it if the syllabus looks mildly interesting to you, if you are not afraid to talk theory, or if you are looking for a class to read some of these thinkers. Prof. Billings led very good discussions which led to many profound comments and facilitated learning from your peers. All in all, it was excellent!",
    "Amazing. Professor Billings is an incredible section leader. Be aware that at least some familiarity with Sophocles and Plato is expected, and a background in classics, philosophy, and\/or lit theory is very helpful. The class is reading heavy, with dense, confusing texts and weekly reading responses. Billings is great at helping you through them, though, and it is totally worth it to put in the effort. There are two short papers, which Billings encourages you to have some fun with, and a final paper.",
    "A fantastic class on literary theory and one of the most interesting classes I've taken at Yale. I would highly recommend it, but know the texts are challenging.",
    "The Classics and Modern Theory was my favorite course this semester, and maybe my favorite course I've taken in three semesters at Yale. Its strengths were the incredible reading list, which was a mix of Left and Right philosophers (it's interesting, how the literary can become political, and that was definitely one of my favorite themes of the course) constructed with an eye to a cohesive dialogue (particularly in the beginning and the end, the philosophers we read from week to week were deliberately and explicitly engaging with one another), as well as the way in which the we constantly engaged with the themes of the course. What does it mean, for something to be classic? How should the power relations in a society be structured? How much liberty can we take with a text written 2500 years ago? These constant threads guided discussion through what can be incredibly complicated texts, without ever feeling overwrought or contrived. Professor Billings is clearly an incredibly knowledgable and passionate scholar, and an incredibly well-meaning professor. He guided class discussions well, incorporating the weekly reading responses to give students a chance to argue their reading of a text while at the same time moving the argument in a different direction. Though he's young, he isn't preoccupied as some professors are with trying to seem cool or hip- he's there to study and teach the texts, and while he isn't the most approachable, he's very helpful when it comes to coming up with ideas for papers, particularly for the final paper.",
    "Take any course Prof. Billings teaches. He can make literally anything interesting and relevant, and runs a mad good discussion. This syllabus happened to be particularly engaging. A lot of reading, that you were expected to really do well.",
    "A really really great class. Professor Billings is fantastic; the readings were fantastic (definitely hard, but not overwhelming). What distinguished it most for me though was probably how incredibly high quality the actual class meetings were; I feel like I got at least a good overview of every one of the very complex thinkers we treated, and in addition to that a really intense and engaged discussion of the details of the work. Really emphatically one of those incredible seminars that never feel long, where everyone makes thoughtful comments, professor's involvement is at all the right times...The very interdisciplinary nature of the class also cool...meant it attracted a lot of different people with different backgrounds and areas of special knowledge and interest...",
    "The seminar brings out of Modern thought the Classical traces that can often be overlooked and also examines the direct engagement by Modern thinkers with Classical texts. I would recommend the seminar to anyone who has a passion for the intellectual history of Modernism with special interest in the Classics."
