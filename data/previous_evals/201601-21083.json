   "comments": [
    "Programming and Entrepreneurship is a good class that teaches the fundamentals of web programming and the basics of entrepreneurship. It's not too much work, but your experience will vary widely depending on your group project. The group project takes up the majority of the class time in the second half of the semester, so pick wisely.",
    "This class was AMAZING!! I definitely recommend it to anyone who is interested in developing coding skills and learning a lot about entrepreneurship. The course is as hands-on as it gets! I think it's a great course to take after CS50, because you'll already have the necessary technical skills and the course covers very important CS topics that weren't covered in CS50 (Git, NoSQL DBs, Heroku). Kyle is an amazing professor and the TAs were great! The lectures were very engaging and the projects were great to help you learn all the material covered in class.",
    "This is great class if you get a good team for your project, so make sure you know if they're CR\/D\/Fing or not to gauge how committed they'll be later on in the semester. This class was not much work and there were no required exams. Lectures were also really fun, especially with Kyle Jensen! We also had optional \"hackathons\" (basically TA help sessions) every week with free dinner, which was awesome.",
    "This is a GREAT course. Not only you get to learn a lot about programming and how to setup a website quickly, you also get to know a lot of the management side of things, and you get to apply it all in practice.",
    "This class has changed radically from last semester! Do not use the previous reviews to decide whether or not you are interested. This class is AWESOME; not only is the teacher, Kyle, funny, intelligent, and down-to-earth, but also the several TA's are cool and accomplished. My coding skills have increased exponentially, and I can say with confidence that I would not be clueless in the start-up world. TAKE THIS CLASS!",
    "I would recommend it if they sort of have an idea that they're planning to work on. I also think some experience with web dev is definitely helpful, and ultimately it depends on whether the idea is something you could see yourself working on. Achieving real world traction in a classroom environment is very challenging, mostly because it seems pointless to get all that traction and then not continue to work on it. It also seems pointless to generate traction just for the sake of the grade. It's an issue that anyone taking a start-up or entrepreneurship based class needs to know - usually the hardest part comes after what is taught in the class.",
    "This is a very good course for learning some practical web programming. I would take more than one programming course before you sign up for it though.",
    "This is a great class. They're changing it up a bit as it's very new (the 2nd or 3rd year it was taught), but here's the main gist: if you're interested in the tech business, but don't have a lot of experience, there's probably a lot you don't know. Maybe you don't have the coding chops to build web apps or understand the stacks\/technologies used in the industry, or perhaps you don't understand marketing and startup finance. You'll get really good exposure to these things in this course. I won't tell you that you'll get the technical skills to get hired at Facebook, but you'll at least know what to learn in order to get there, or to build your own startup. If you're not really invested in this stuff though, either Cr\/D\/F or maybe don't take it, as you get out of this class what you put in. Great to take with a group of friends since the final project is building our own startup.",
    "A must-take if you're into computer science! A lot of work, but totally worth it! One of the most useful and applied courses I've taken! Start the assignments early, because they will take a while to finish...",
    "You'll be ok if you have prior experience building apps, using web frameworks such as node.js and django, constructing pages in bootstrap and html, and coding in python and javascript. Class focuses on business too much at the expense of technical support, and TAs are very unhelpful so be prepared to figure out the coding independently. The semester project is to build and launch an app as if it were a startup, and your experience depends greatly on what you choose to do and who you do it with. Start talking to people early lest you get stuck with a bad team. Be prepared for a lot of outside work, so only take it if you already know you like both programming and entrepreneurship.",
    "Kyle kept the course very casual and the class was very fun to attend. Sometimes the course wasn't structured entirely well, but it didn't really detract from the experience.",
    "It is a good class and if you learn things in a structured way then do it. Although if you are trying to start an actual startup and have the technical skills this may not be useful for you.",
    "CPSC 113 gives you the foundation of entrepreneurship and starting a startup while at the same time giving you guidance as you start your own. I would definitely recommend CPSC 113 to another student as not only is it a fun class but it allows you to come out with a working project and startup.",
    "I would recommend CPSC 113 to any student wanting to gain a robust introduction to web development after an intro computer programming class. I would also suggest that you have some prior programming experience because the class can be super difficult for someone having no experience with the material.",
    "absolutely not. This class is CS50 for hipster web techs and it doesn't teach anything useful with regards to programming OR entrepreneurship",
    "Unless you are taking this class with friends and at least one of you has a strong coding background, this is probably not the course for you. I came from taking CS50 in the fall, and I was definitely not prepared to program a fully functioning app that could \"realistically have at least a million users after one year\". If this class changes its structure, it would definitely be worth it - Kyle is awesome and he really cares about his students. However, in its current state, it's not an easy course for people who are \"beginner\" coders."
