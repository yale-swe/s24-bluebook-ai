   "comments": [
    "Learned so much and was asked to think in a non US-centric way for the first time in a Yale course.",
    "I learned a lot in this class about Latin American history, filmic techniques, the theoretical background of the films from this period, politics in Latin America, how these politics relate to the politics of the United States, the importance of defining the terms I use, how to think about the present in the context of the past, etc.",
    "I learned a lot of Latin American history and political thought, and also a good chunk of thought about film (mostly in the context of Third Cinema).",
    "Where to even begin... the content of this course is something you will find in very few places at Yale. Latin-America is not taught in the way it should be. You dig into the politics of the revolutions in Central and South American counties through the lens of film, but you emerge with so much more than that; knowledge about the global south in general, in depth political histories of numerous latin american counties, a deep appreciation for filmic tactics that differ greatly from what we normally see, communism socialism capitalism... the list goes on and on. The greatest insights you gain from this class though are critical thinking skills, which sounds generic but Fradinger delivers them like no other. She makes you think about every term you use, and forces you to consider our terminology and predispositions carefully and deeply.",
    "I learned so much in this class, it's hard to know where to start. I didn't know anything about Latin America before taking this course, and so to learn about the processes and experiences that have defined the lives of working people on that continent, especially from an unfiltered, non-Yankee point of view, has changed my worldview, and inspired me to become politically involved for the first time in my life.",
    "What I need to say is that this course changed me and the trajectory of my life in a way that no other has. Cornel West talks about paideia; about deep education that teaches you how to give up certain assumptions so as to undergo transformation and become more politically awakened, more spiritually sensitive, more morally courageous. I know that this course was exactly that, and I will spend many years living up to the promises I learned to make to myself in it. In short, in addition to getting a deep feel for the political horizon of possibility in Latin America and beyond, in the 1960s and beyond, I learned how to be a better person BECAUSE I was learning about these continuing histories. I mean that. I really mean that. That is not something that happens often in a classroom, and I will be deeply grateful for the rest of my life.",
    "I learned how to watch, read, and analyze film attentively. within and outside of historical and political contexts. While this course was specifically about Latin American cinema from the 1960s and 1970s, I am sure that these skills are transferrable to other types of film, from the Global South or not. This course also really taught me how to participate in a dialogue and deconstruct an argument to its fundamental definitions - feminism, authority, power, Latin American, radical, etc. This course opened my eyes to parts of the history of Latin America that I claimed to understand but really did not - resistance to governments, changes in authority, the U.S.'s role in the region, and the photographic and videographic evidence today of the era. This course very positively blew my mind.",
    "I learned so much in this class. Not only about the topics, but about so many other things that I would not be able to relate to it without the professor and the TA. I was also able to be in a Spanish section that allowed me to fully express my self and put my thoughts out there like never before. I highly appreciate professor Fradinger opening that section and Diego (TA) for being so insightful and helpful. I also bonded with my classmates in a way that I have never experienced before. I knew everyone's name and I felt like we made a nice connection. The way I see everything has completely changed and I thank professor Fradinger for that. My Yale experience was the best yet thanks to her!",
    "This class is truly amazing. As a primer in the sobering trajectories of Latin American history, a chance to see rare + incredible films (many of which are VERY rare and ONLY available here), and a model for fostering serious intellectual discussion among students, there really nothing else like this class. TAKE IT!!!"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Great course!",
    "This course is one of those amazing classes that can basically take over your semester if you let it. I think it was extremely important because it made so many of us in class think differently both about the past and the way that we have been taught it. It involves a lot of long hours together watching really masterful and complicated films, which are historical documents. I think that the readings assigned were very important to help us see the context of the film and the thought process. This was especially important in a comparative context, because we could put the filmmakers in dialogue with each other.",
    "Strengths: great material, great teaching, great discussions, flexibility and approachability of professor\/TF Weaknesses: would've perhaps been nice to have a bit more diversity in ideology among students...discussion was plenty substantive and contested as is, but it would've been interesting to see more left\/right debates",
    "The course is absolutely wonderful, but it is definitely a class that can follow the saying: you get what you put in. Moira gives many readings that are relevant to the film and the directors, but often the tasks of giving historical context are left for the student \"presentations\" that last about fifteen minutes. The films and the discussions get you thinking about these histories and art in ways you never have before, but its really on you to do the extra background\/context building. It could be good if that was done more in class before the films were shown, but nonetheless a great way to dive into the intricacies of Latin American history through the lens of film.",
    "The strengths: the movies were unbelievable, class discussion was lively, the professor was passionate, probing, and committed to her teaching and the classes learning. the weakness: it is my belief that the individual presentations took up too much of our classtime and were not uniformly or even primarily helpful in contextualizing the film and our discussion. It's a weakness with a caveat, becaue if the strengths hadn't been so great, the opportunity cost of the presentations would not have been as great either.",
    "Not a weakness in sight In the class we talk a great deal about form and content; to create a new revolutionary cinema, it is not enough to turn your camera to new content - the form must change as well. I think this applies to the course structure as a whole. In order to teach revolutionary and revolutionary cinema, you cannot use the same old Yale College seminar forms where you check in the start of class and check out as soon as 2 hours are up. The seminar is a true community, where everyone wants to be there and shows it by staying late, dedicated to the discussion. It feels more like a group of friends pushing ideas around than a Yale class. It is easily the greatest seminar I have taken at Yale and has truly changed my outlook on the world.",
    "The strengths, I think, are obvious. An incredible professor and an incredible syllabus. These two factors come together and it's impossible not to feel deeply inspired. The only trouble I had was that sometimes the conversations felt stilted, by virtue of the strategy Moira uses (and many other professors, across Yale College) of \"queuing\" people up during discussions, such that everyone who raises their hand at once is given a place in a preset order to voice their comment, which leads to the discussion becoming at times quite disconnected, and less urgent than it otherwise would be if students were allowed to respond to their peers immediately (in a perhaps less clean system, but a livelier one!), so that conversation flowed actively based on content, rather than people's pre-planned little speeches.",
    "Yale needs more courses like this: Its not that it should have them, but that the school as an institution needs them. The films we watched were a jumping-off point for far-ranging and far-reaching discussions: I cannot stress enough how important I find it to be, to have an international scope when talking about politics. One of the many things that I realized over the course of this class, was my own vast ignorance of political idioms that are not centered around the United Statesand how crippling this can be when trying to countenance a world that, well, is situated on a global scale. This class also taught how utterly necessary it is to have courses on Latin America and other places on the (neo\/post)colonial periphery: places that are too often ignored, or at best added at the end of classes, as if there is no philosophy or art or political practice that comes from the Latin American margins but only ever serves as a second-hand example of what happens in Europe and the United States. Students at an institution that sees itself as part of the fabric of the globe, need to engage with that globe; with the underbelly of that globe; with the frayed edges of that globeedges that have been made frayed by the powers at the center. This course gives you a strong sense of the radical histories and imaginaries of decades past, and also imbues students with a radical sense of hope of possibility for the present and future. Coming out of the course, you have learned so much about the connections between filmic aesthetics, radical politics, history, and your own place in this web. I would not change a thing about it.",
    "Strengths: Excellent films - nowhere else would you be able to watch and DISCUSS these films. Brilliant discussion, led by everyone. Everyone participated throughout the semester, either through formal presentations or the following discussion. Moira and Diego facilitated discussion yet always allowed for the development of our arguments, even if they disagreed with them. Relevant workload - nothing was silly or busy work: a study paper in which we engaged with criticism of the films, a final paper in which we proposed our own criticism of a film or a few films, weekly screenings, readings that tested our boundaries of what these films could mean beyond a superficial aesthetic value, forum posts that catalyzed discussion in seminar and got everyone on the same page so that we COULD jump right into discussion, and the incredible seminar meetings that I looked forward to everyone Wednesday evening. Student-led presentations at the beginning of each seminar threw us all deep into the historical, political, and social contexts of the films while bringing in the filmmakers' lives and perspectives and our own criticisms into the foray. The presentations were a delight; I have never enjoyed presenting so much before. A truly fruitful intellectual challenge. Weaknesses: None. Some might say the weekly film screenings, but it was always acceptable to leave the room for a few minutes if you needed to.",
    "I can't say enough about how amazing this class is. Far and away the most stimulating, exciting, and fascinating class I've taken so far at Yale. However, as Moira will make sure to tell you on the first day, it requires a LARGE time commitment (evening sections and screenings, both of which can go on for 4+ hours!)."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Absolutely!",
    "Yes. Gives you a cultural, historical, and artistic perspective that few courses at Yale give.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student because the films are incredible and Moira is a fantastic professor. I think that if you take this course you have to be committed to long hours and doing the readings to get the full effect of the seminar. The screening nights can be LONG so be prepared. If you don't function late at night this may not be the class for you. You do't have to be a film major to enjoy this class. Many people from different majors brought their own interests into it and I think it made our discussions much richer. The workload is manegeable: weekly screenings (usually 3-5 hours), film responses, a few short readings, a midterm paper (unless you take the Spanish section), and a final paper.",
    "I would very much recommend this course to someone, provided they understand the time commitment. Film screenings are weekly and super long (and sometimes kind of dry), and there is a seminar meeting on top of that. There is a presentation and two papers that require a good bit of research and time (though they are definitely doable). But that really shouldn't stop anyone! Because Moira is a phenomenal teacher. There are really not enough nice things to say about her. She cares so incredibly much about her students, and she makes a big effort to get to know everyone. And she knows an incredible amount about the material--enough that she personally knows some of the filmmakers. Speaking of which: the material is super interesting. Contemporary Latin American history is fascinating and rewarding to study. The films (which do definitely and unabashedly come from a certain perspective) raise some really interesting ideas, both in content and in form. And a few are rare enough that this really may be one of your only opportunities to see them. You will learn a ton, and have many of your ideas challenged (by the films and by Moira) in a really interesting way.",
    "Unbelievable class. Take it if you get in.",
    "Yes. Take this class if you are interested in Latin America, film, or radical politics. This class is an incredible, unique opportunity to study fascinating and rare radical Latin American films from the 1960s and 1970s. You will learn to think in new ways about film (what film can be, mean, and accomplish) and about politics more generally. This class is unlike any other I have taken at Yale. Be prepared to be fully invested in the class; screenings and section can go late into the night--and although you don't necessarily have to stay until the end, the best conversations were often the late ones! The large classtime commitment is probably the biggest part of the 'workload' for this class. Otherwise, it's just very brief weekly responses (1-2 sentences), a midterm paper, and a 12-14 page final research paper.",
    "Yes. Take this class, if you can. Your schedule will be different (evening hours, etc), but you will get a sense of an intimate class setting that is like no other course at Yale. The other students who take the class are incredible, and the professor is a hero. You will find a space to discuss through the films other political topics that can be synthesized in new ways.",
    "Absolutely. Probably the most mind-blowing class I've taken at Yalefor Moira's admirable, immensely inspiring passion for teaching, the relevance and importance of the material, and sense of urgency and responsibility for being the agent of change it will instill in you. You shouldn't be allowed to graduate without learning about the material covered in this class, and this is the best setting in which you could do so.",
    "with no hesitation.",
    "Absolutely would recommend. In fact, it is perhaps the only class I have ever taken at Yale that I would unequivocally recommend to every student. The only caveat being that you have to be ready to commit to it, it is a lot of time spent but hugely worth it.",
    "Take this class, please take this class for two reasons: Moira, and the films. The other evaluations probably say it all w\/r\/t how magical and dedicated Moira is to the class. But I want to make sure it's also clear how INCREDIBLE these films are. They will frustrate you, they will enchant you, and they will, without a doubt, change your worldview. I've become so much more politically dedicated because of this class, and I am so grateful for the knowledge that so many of these filmmakers RISKED THEIR LIVES to impart. Be prepared to stay up till midnight many Mondays watching these films. But be prepared also to feel like you're part of a real learning community, and to feel really supported and cared for by your professor and classmates.",
    "Yes, take this class. It changed my life and I really mean it. You learn about the connections between filmic aesthetics, radical politics, history, and your own place in this webbut also how to be a politically engaged, morally courageous person. I also got a real sense of my own ignorance of political formations that arent U.S.-based. All of this wrapped up with a deep education about radical political possibilities from the 60s to the present, anti-colonial philosophy that stretches across oceans, AMAZING films every week, and the most incredible professor you could ask for, who really wants to know you as a person. You get out what you put in, but you will want to put everything in.",
    "I don't think that I will ever recommend a course as strongly as I recommend Radical Cinemas of Latin America. This course was a fruitful intellectual challenge; my mind was blown by how much I did not know about the region but that I purported to know. The workload is all relevant and manageable (a short 5-page study paper, a final 12-14 term paper, weekly forum posts and readings to catalyze discussion, and one presentation per student throughout the semester to formally begin seminar), and you FEEL that you are learning from day 1. You will not get to watch and DISCUSS (not listen to a diatribe about a singular perspective on a film or a filmmaker) any of these films anywhere else at Yale. Moira is an incredible professor who cares about each student individually, in addition to caring about the group as a whole and our consciousness throughout the semester. TF Diego matched Moira's enthusiasm, especially in the Spanish language section. I never looked forward to going to class (on Monday and Wednesday nights, mind you) as much as I looked forward to my weekly radical cinema discussion. Take this course - think globally. You and your peers will become a family over the course of the semester in your study of Latin American film.",
