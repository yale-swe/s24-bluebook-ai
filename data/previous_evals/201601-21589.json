   "comments": [
    "Yes I would absolutely recommend this course. Although it is challenging, it is nevertheless rewarding and interesting. There were interjections at times regarding the history of the time period, which I found to be very thought provoking.",
    "Take this class if either 1) you need to get your language requirement over with or 2) you genuinely enjoy Latin poetry! Either way it will be a fun and not too difficult course.",
    "Latin Poetry is far more rigorous than Latin Prose. There is little grammar review, so you may have to bulk up your grammar skills on your own. Jennifer was a great class leader, and very willing to meet one on one. It was a lot of work preparing each night before class, but rewarding to read from the Latin.",
    "If you like reading Latin, take this course! If you have to take this course... you have to take this course. The workload, while not overwhelming, is very consistent, so you really won't be taking any breaks from the material. The assignments, quizzes, and exams are very straightforward. If you study, you should do well. Overall, the workload is a bit more than Latin 131. Vale.",
    "A very good class for those who wish to strengthen their translating skills. Having 6-7 students in the class is the perfect amount. It is a time commitment but ultimately much progress is made and translation skills are strengthened.",
    "LATN 141 allows one to (1) gain experience translating larger amounts of Latin text; (2) acquire a deeper knowledge of Latin grammar and syntax; (3) gain an avid interest in Latin poetry. I would definitely recommend LATN 141 to another student because it allows its students to significantly improve their Latin translation skills while also enjoying the texts they are reading."
