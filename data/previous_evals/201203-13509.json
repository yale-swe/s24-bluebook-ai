    "A discussion-led class that touches on extremely nuanced and often \"conclusion-less\" topics on China. Extremely relevant, extremely detailed, and very student-driven discussion. Also one of Yale's only China classes that deal with state-society relations, with a week focused on media and civil society.",
    "Take the course if you're interested in China! It's a great topic.",
    "Yes, I would recommend.",
    "Good class if you are interested in China.",
    "I really enjoyed this course. I felt that the readings were very well selected and built on each other well. I think the seminar format was very conducive to learning about this topic. Professor Weiss was a really great discussion leader. I thought the readings were very carefully selected. I appreciate the way she let the discussion flow organically while still providing useful direction at crucial discussion points. I would definitely recommend her to other students."
