    "This is a great opportunity for motivated students to develop their own meaningful experiences in lab. 20 hrs\/wk is a lot for any undergraduate to spend in lab, but if you make efficient use of our time and with guidance from lab members it can be a rewarding experience.",
    "For MCDB 585, the student is expected to take on his\/her independent research project under the guidance of a PI and grad students\/postdocs in his\/her lab. The course is structured to allow 20 hours per week of wet lab research, although students are expected to spend more than 20 hours per week if needed. There is a substantial amount of independent reading and independent lab work, but students can always ask their PIs\/grad students or other mentors for help and advice, as well as recommendations for what readings to do or what primary literature background to catch up on."

    "Working in a lab to gather my own data and prepare for presentations was a valuable experience that is helping to prepare me for a future in biomedical sciences.",
    "This course was very helpful in creating time for me to concentrate on my research and focus on my independent study of my field."
