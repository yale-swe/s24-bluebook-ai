If youre just looking to take this because of the fun field trips, be aware that youre in for a Lot of time in the lab and the trips are way more work than the average vacation. This course required a significant time commitment, but I genuinely enjoyed fighting my way through Floridian underbrush and all the other unique experiences the lab had to offer."
