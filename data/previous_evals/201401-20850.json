    "Amazing. If you love children and want to take a course that you actually feel as if you learned something, take this. You will learn how crucial early childhood is to later success from course readings as well as first hand observations of children.",
    "Take this course if you are interested in early childhood development. I learned a great deal about how to teach children, which, if you look at the title, has a lot to do with play. The trek up to the preschool twice a week is a little time consuming, but if you can fit it into your schedule, might as well jump at the opportunity!",
    "Take it, one of those gem courses at Yale, and skills for the rest of your life.",
    "I would recommend it if you're looking for a class that has observations\/interactions with kids and if you're looking to learn about literacy and literacy curriculum. There is a good amount of writing for the course so prepare for that, but everything is pretty manegae me and I thought it was a rewarding experience",
    "I took this course because I needed an easy SO. This class became so, so much more than that for me, and I'm so glad I took it. I highly, highly recommend you take it regardless of your interests or background. At first, I thought literacy learning is worksheets and Fun with Phonics. I learned that literacy learning actually happens best in play-based curriculums, where kids actually treat writing as this new and fun mode of communication, expression, and art. I learned this because the instructors make you observe at a daycare for two hours a week. Yes, two hours a week--that will feel like a lot, and the daycare is literally so far away, but it's fine since the class only meets once a week. But the things I learned from the kids will stick with me--they made me think about being a college senior in new and emotional ways. What I take away from the course is that play is how kids learn best because that's when they are open to new ideas, when they are able to think about the feelings and their life in creative ways, when they can manifest their creative energies. The joy of seeing kids learn to read makes your remember what you love about learning, and since the instructors only let seniors in the class (mostly), most of us are pretty jaded from the entire Yale experience. But seeing the joy on these kids' faces when they read and write and triumph, and remembering what it was like to be that little--when the world was full of possibility, when there were new and exciting things every day on the playground (bugs, bark, birds), when you could just draw your feelings on a page--those are the reminders I needed to be able to leave college with a better, healthier attitude towards learning and towards life. Like those little kids, we, college seniors, are also so, so young (even if we have forgotten that), and the world is so, so full of possibility for us. Let the world be your play-based curriculum. Refuse to give up the creativity and joy you had in kindergarten. You absolutely must take this class.",
    "Yes I would absolutely recommend the course. It is a great way to learn about children and you really get to form a relationship with your classmates, teachers, and most importantly, the children.",
    "Language Literacy and Play is a good class, but not as great as it might seem. It's basically a lecture series with guest lectures tackling different aspects of early child development and education. I definitely learned a lot about the literacy curriculum at Calvin Hill and the differences between schools and age-groups. But the lectures can be boring sometimes and it's easy not to engage much with the class. The class consists of observations at Calvin Hill, which are obviously awesome if you love hanging out with adorable kids, and then journal entries that integrate the readings\/discussions with the observations (not too bad). You also visit some other schools during classtime which are some of the most interesting parts of the course. Then at the end you write a pretty simple paper describing one of the kids you observed according to a detailed child assessment guide. It's a lot of writing, but doesn't really feel like that much work, and if you like kids, it's pretty enjoyable.",
    "Take it! The best, most rewarding class I have taken at Yale so far! It is a trek to get to, but a very enjoyable class, perfect for if you want to be a teacher later on, or just want to learn how to better educate and help your younger siblings\/cousins\/ children.",
    "Very unique class - you won't find another like it at Yale. It focuses on a play-based language and literacy curriculum, and you learn an incredible amount. Class discussions are pretty conversational, so you actually learn the most from observations at Calvin Hill. You go for 2 hours weekly (in addition to class time) and it's incredible how close you become with the teachers and kids. I didn't realize how important even seemingly insignificant decisions are for helping kids learn and develop. The work consists of 6 5-page journals based on your observations (they are very straight-forward) and a final longer paper that is a write-up of the child you choose to observe for the semester. The work is actually not that difficult because it is mostly a reflection of what you learn at Calvin Hill - in fact, it helps you get a better grasp of what you've learned. Carla and Nancy are also fantastic. Take this if you get in - definitely worth the early morning trek!"
