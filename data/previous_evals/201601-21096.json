    "Another student in CPSC 433 told me one day that she had spent 90 hours on one of our assignments. Don't do that... This is one of those courses that makes everything else feel irrelevant when you're doing it, partly because of the full-time-job-level workload and partly because everything else is actually irrelevant compared to the Internet. Computer Networks goes through the Internet protocol stack from the top down. You cover application, transport, network, and link layers, briefly touching on topics in the physical layer (such as fiber optic technology). The assignments in Networks can be ridiculous, and they include writing six versions of a HTTP get request web server: serial, three multithreaded models, and two asynchronous I\/O models (in one assignment). We also implemented a simplified version of TCP (~2000 lines in Java) and did a warm-up assignment with a HTTP client and server that pinged one another. Yang Yang absolutely owns this class, and he knows his stuff. Do not take Networks if you want an easy course, but it is very rewarding and, next to Vikings, this is likely the most useful elective offered at Yale.",
    "There are 2 kinds of CS majors at Yale: the type that gets by taking gutty CS electives, which I am not going to name, and the type that takes hard ones, like this class. In this class, you will encounter two types of people: the type that already knows networking b\/c of their summer internship, and the type for which this class is way over their heads. If you are the gutty CS elective person, HAHA, real world going to hit you bad. If you are the summer internship person, take something that actually challenges you. I don't really care if you beat Apache once. If you are the \"way over my head\" person, take this class. You'll learn a lot more than if you took a gut.",
    "Solid CS elective with informative lectures by Yang. The assignments were also helpful but the TA's did not offer much clarification and their grading scheme was not according to the rubric.",
    "Hard but worth it. You'll suffer so much but you'll also gain actual useful knowledge and skills which is a nice change for our CS department. The grading was pretty lenient this semester which was really nice because I felt like I was getting grades proportional to the amount of time and effort I sunk into this class even when I had some flaws in my code. You'll shed your blood and tears for it but you'll emerge stronger, or whatever. Take it if you like misery and\/or knowledge.",
    "An extremely rigorous and practical CS elective taught by an expert in the field. More work than 323 mostly due to unclear specs, and it would have tanked my grade if the TFs weren't incredibly incompetent. They really didn't seem to care if the psets were even done, which helped me a lot grade wise but didn't do wonders for my work ethic and probably aggravated people who were actually putting in the required 30 hours into these psets. As it stands I still managed to get a good amount out of the course and put good time into a final project I'm proud of, but in order for this course to reach its full potential you need to build your semester around it as a student (as much as you had to for 323 should do) and the TAs need to be clearer on specs and then follow through on that with grading.",
    "Yang Yang is a great lecturer; all of the material in class is useful to understanding how the internet works and applicable if you ever want to make a networked app. Problem sets are long (seven different HTTP servers and a client is a single assignment) but really interesting and fulfilling to complete. I'd recommend Networks to a CS student (you really need programming background, but picking up Java was easy) who wants to learn more about how the world of computers actually works.",
    "A relatively good CS course; not as fantastic as some of the other reviews make it seem IMO. Yang Yang is fantastic but he has his head in the clouds a lot; get ready for a wild ride not only through networking topics but whatever he feels like talking about. For the assignments, I would definitely recommend at least some java\/OO experience in addition to some experience with concurrent programming models (I took 422: Operating Systems before this class). The assignments are probably around 20-30 hours each if you have this background, though I heard of students spending 80+ hours on each assignment!",
    "Absolutely, take this course. Be warned, the workload is all it's hyped up to be, but the grading is lenient, so your grade will be fine if you put in the work. This is stuff all CS majors should know.",
    "Yes, take this course! It's hard but worth it (actually hard & worth it, unlike 323 & 223 which induce stockholm syndrome in many students). If you ever wondered about how the Internet works \/ the infrastructure that supports it all, take this course. There were two hard assignments in my year (HTTP server, TCP implementation) but the others were definitely more chill (simple server\/client, final project, & written homework).",
    "Great class! I came in knowing absolutely nothing about how the internet works, and came out feeling completely comfortable talking about its ins and outs (and knowing where to look to learn more). This class is a lot of work -- the server assignment and TCP\/IP are crazy long\/difficult psets and you have to use java, ugh -- but you come out on the other side feeling like you really learned something. If he offers the option again, choose final projects, because you will definitely gain a lot from doing a self-directed project! Yang is an engaging lecturer and fun to talk to in office hours. He really knows what he's talking about.",
    "Really good content that is important to know, but you will be really frustrated many times while taking this class. The assignments are long and difficult, and not the kind of long and difficult that teaches you the material well. More like confusing to understand what you're supposed to do, and then having to code random parts that don't have to do with networks. Still, the material of the class made me glad I took it in the end, I think.",
    "Computer Networks is a survey of the modern internet. We began at the application layer discussing HTTP, Web servers, FTP, DNS, etc. We then moved into the transport layer discussing how UDP and TCP were built. Next, we tackled the network layer explaining how packets are routed from one host to another host in the internet. Lastly, we discussed the Link layer and several technologies (ethernet, wireless, etc.) that are responsible for carrying data from one hop to the next. For the assignments, we built several versions of Web servers and built a simplified version of TCP. For the final project, I implemented two routing protocols at the network layer. The assignments take a good amount of time, but the payoff is well worth it. Professor Yang is an excellent teacher and fun to work with.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course. This has been by far my favorite CS elective, and is up there for favorite CS course in total. It's a lecture, but the students have a lot of input in the topics discussed. The problem sets are quite difficult (one or two are definitely around 323 level, or maybe harder, though there are definitely fewer total), but I found them quite fun to work on, and I understood the topic a lot better afterward. Professor Yang is a great teacher--not the best lecturer ever, but he is knowledgable, and incredibly approachable and flexible.",
    "Time-consuming, but good stuff.",
    "A great class, it's very surprising that it's not required for the major honestly. 100% take it. A lot of it will go over your head, but the exams are actually pretty straightforward\/easy. The last two-three programming assignments are *very* hard. On the same level as 323, so beware.",
    "Great introduction to everything networks! Definitely take it (if it's offered) with Yang. You will need to know this stuff if you're going to industry, and it's interesting anyway if you're not going to work after college.",
    "This was a fantastic course! If you're lucky enough to be advanced enough in CS to take this when it's being offered, you really should consider it! I think the depth to which it goes is a real strength of it. The problem sets were very clarifying and made me understand the material thoroughly. There was a lot of emphasis on the top two layers of the internet (which most people usually deal with) and little with the lower layers which could have been interesting, but I'm not sure how much time there would be for more. Professor Yang can sometimes go fast, but he's very responsive to feedback and often realizes when he does and slows down. He was also super friendly and wanted people to be invested in the problem sets (which you REALLY have to be, time-wise and energy-wise, in order to complete them). He cared a lot about the students and talking to him was always helpful, and often made me feel more supported."
