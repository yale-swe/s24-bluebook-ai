    "This course will change your life",
    "This course addresses the philosophies of history formulated in the late 19th and early 20th century (by authors such as Hegel, Marx, Nietzsche, Husserl, Heidegger) and then re-imagined by philosophers under communism in the 60s and 70s (Kolakowski, Patocka, The Pussy Riot\/Zizek, Michalski). The history and the ideas are both fascinating, and get to the depth of what human life and politics can be (or mean) in the modern world. I would absolutely recommend the course to another student, so long as he or she was ready to engage with tough theoretical material, and had some background in this kind of thought. Professor Shore is incredibly invested in the authors and problems we addressed in this course. Although she allows the students to shape the discussion, she also intercedes at important moments to clarify concepts and readings of the texts. She also connects the readings and the history we take up to what is currently going on in the world. As a student of literature, I found this perspective fascinating and refreshing. Prof. Shore really brought the historical and philosophical problems together.",
    "Readings are intense but very good, weekly workload depends on how much you put into them. Discussion in seminar can feel disjointed due to conference-style calling system. Focus generally more philosophy than history.",
    "A horrible introduction to intellectual history; perhaps a reasonably ok introduction to phenomenology, if you're able to teach yourself the material. Really good material, if poorly structured; miserable classes.",
    "Philosophies of History in Central Europe was my favorite class this semester. The readings were fantastic - we read Dostoevsky, Hegel, Lukacs, Heidegger, Husserl, Patocka, Kolakowski, Michalski and Zizek, writers who were honestly and unflinchingly grappling with the most important questions of knowledge and being, of life and death, of time and history. Professor Shore was an excellent teacher and seminar leader, and the other students in the class contributed to making this class what in my opnion the liberal arts education is really all about."
