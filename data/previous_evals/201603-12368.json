We also gained a great deal of exposure to t he varieties of ancient sources available for the period.",

   "comments": [
    "OVerall the course was excellent. Easily my favorite course this term. that said, I would have liked to grapple with more complete secondary texts (e.g. Syme, Gruehn, etc.) rather than only select portions.",
    "Excellent course. No changes necessary.",
    "The course's strengths were a strong reading list, active student engagement, and excellent teaching. It might be worth considering whether spreading out student presentations on paper topics over several classes, so as to allow slightly fuller discussion.",
    "This course was excellent at creating discussion. The idea of submitting questions in advance really helped with this and I think it was a major strength.",
    "The strengths of this course were its demanding list of weekly readings and its ideal size. Everyone had a chance to speak their piece at length every week, and every participant contributed their own unique perspective to the discussion. Discussions in this class could easily have run on into a third hour, if such a thing could be arranged. Three-hour seminars are mentally (and physically!) trying, but I think the extra time would be well-spent."
