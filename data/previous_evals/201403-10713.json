    "yes! a great course for scientists, we should all be made to take a course on ethics like this!",
    "It's a class about possible miss-steps in science and their motivations and consequences. It's a required course, so all research students have to take it, but I found it interesting.",
    "Intro to ethical issues that may arise during scientific training. I would recommend this course to any student who is interested in research.",
    "mandatory. interesting class though, fun to be there",
    "Awesome course in understanding ethical issues in science. I learned a lot and had to grapple with some interesting issues. The choice of material and examples were very interesting. I would highly recommend it (it it wasn't already required by the department).",
    "Although the course is a requirement, I would recommend the course to another student.",
    "It's a relaxing course on research ethics. It is mandatory.",
    "Yeah absolutely, this was a very engaging course",
    "Yes. The course highlights some interesting examples of misconduct and brings to light some of the issues that are more often overlooked or not explained in detail.",
    "Requirements aside, I would recommend CHEM 590 to a student if they were searching for a course on ethical merit. This is because the course does not simply present concepts, but it engages its students and provides them with intriguing real world examples that allow us to better understand the scientific community and the ethical breaches that happen within it.",
    "For those who plan to have government funding of any type, this course is crucial.",
    "You sit in a room for an hour and listen to anecdotes about people royally screwing up there lives and others by faking things and messing with money. You have to take."

   "comments": [
    "For instance, I now know about misappropriation of funding, and that untenured professors might cleave to a research idea because it looks impressive and that success will help them get tenure. So I won't be that professor.",
    "interesting to see examples of scientific misconduct",
    "I learned a lot about approaching ethical issues in science and how to avoid ethical conflicts. I also learned about certain issues and examples that I had not previous been aware of. It was essential for my graduate career and beyond. It will contribute enormously to my research and my dissertation.",
    "Reinforced my understanding of plagiarism in scientific community.",
    "It discusses some relatively complicated scenarios that is very likely to occur in our research career. It helps guide me ethically in my research.",
    "The course highlights the importances of ethical research and will be something that is constantly a part of one's career.",
    "This course did deepen my knowledge regarding the ethical nature of the profession that I am in.",
    "It mostly scared me. It was negative. Nonetheless the class was crucial to remind us how easy to plagiarize without knowing it",
    "The course was a good overview of the ethics required for proper scientific research. Additionally, the course qualified me for government funding."
