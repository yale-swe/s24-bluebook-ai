    "I learned the basic vocabulary of architecture and how the history of the Roman Empire can be told through its architectural remnants.",
    "This class was amazing and I learned so much about Roman Architecture.",
    "I think I learned a great deal about both the history of Rome and architecture in general.",
    "Learned a lot about architecture, Roman history and especially Roman architecture and unique characteristics.",
    "By taking this course I was able to develop further insight into the world of the Romans, and while there was a lot of focus on the emperors, there was also discussion of lower classes which was important. I learned how to better identify Roman influences on modern architecture as well, and now I see it everywhere I go.",
    "absolutely nothing other than never to take a class with James Rodriguez as a TF",
    "I came in with no knowledge of art history or architecture and came out feeling very comfortable with the different movements and periods of Roman architecture. When I went to the Met in NYC toward the end of the semester, I actually could say more about the Pompeiian rooms than just what was written on the placard.",
    "I really learned a lot about how Roman architecture has influenced our own environment around the world and on Yale's campus. I learned a lot about ancient Roman culture and influence, as well as about architecture. I learned how to better prepare for an art history exam as well.",
    "I taking this course I gained valuable knowledge about Roman Architecture. I learned how it was used in antiquity and how it influenced later architecture.",
    "The background and history of Roman architecture.",
    "What an artistry class is like and how to take one.",
    "This course provided an in-depth overview of Roman Architecture. I learned so much about many of the defining characteristics of Roman Architecture, as well as some history of the Roman empire."

   "comments": [
    "This course was very interesting and i enjoyed it. However, there was a lot of material to memorize, so I feel like if it was split into three non-cumulative midterms rather than just two, it would be a lot better. This way you will be able to learn more about each individual monument. Also, you need to beware of your TA. The TA's don't grade the same (one is a lot harder on grading).",
    "Good clear lectures, interesting Roman city option for final project. Online discussion section was convenient but ultimately proved hard to keep up esp in the second half of the semester without weekly reminders to post",
    "The class was really well run and the content was organized really well. The architectural topics fit into a broader cultural narrative. The forum was a great replacement for an in-person discussion section, allowing students to express their viewpoints.",
    "I thought that our professor was amazing, but I really didn't love the role of the TAs.",
    "Great TF's and great Teacher.",
    "As for strengths, I think it covers so much information but in a digestible way. The course is designed so that the information really sticks in your head, rather than just floating out the minute the semester ends. It's absolutely brilliant. As for the weaknesses, I know that we only have a certain amount of time in the semester, but I think there were some monuments that were perhaps left out. Also, the TF led sections should have been mandatory.",
    "class is extremely boring, dry, and unengaging, and while it pretends to be an introductory level class and is marketed as such, it is graded like a very high level class that expects \"mastery of content\"",
    "The course is structured quite nicely though Prof. Kleiner does tend to go on a bit at the end of lecture. You get used to the speed and depth of each class, but it can be hard at first. I actually quite liked the online forum because it took off the extra time commitment of section and allowed me to prove myself participation-wise with a bit more careful thought.",
    "Professor Kleiner is definitely a strength of this class. She would always greet us with a smile and be ready to engage with us rain, shine, or snowstorm. A strength is definitely also how Professor Kleiner utilizes the canvas website. She really uses it to our best advantage, more so than any other class. I wish more classes would do this as it was a rest resource.",
    "The course provided a lot of exposure to Roman architecture through time and different locations. It was also a very engaging class.",
    "This course was for the background and into class",
    "I thought it was a very strong class. The only thing that could be improved is the time it is given.",
    "I enjoyed attending lectures, although because there were so many monuments to learn about, they were at times difficult to follow. There was so much information to learn that the midterms were very difficult, but I enjoyed the class aside from this."

   "comments": [
    "Yes--straightforward course that takes you more or less chronologically through Roman Empire and each period's architectural monuments. Doesn't require much active thinking in lecture and it was kinda nice to start off the morning with a bunch of photos of cool places.",
    "Yes! The class is so interesting and I would recommend it to anyone.",
    "Yes- professor Kleiner is amazing.",
    "yes, very good course and teacher. Really liked the topic and its a nice class that many people would otherwise not take.",
    "Yes! it is very interesting and engaging and Professor is amazing and very knowledgeable.",
    "Absolutely. Professor Kleiner is clearly an expert in the field and her lectures allow you to feel as though you are traveling throughout the Roman Empire. It was an amazing class.",
    "never in a million years.",
    "A great course especially if you are a Classics major looking for an art history class, but don't feel like you have a great background in it. Also a great humanities credit in general. It's a substantial survey and eases you into the complications of architecture and art history quite nicely. Definitely not too bad grade-wise.",
    "I have already recommended this course to other students because I loved Professor Kleiner and her teaching style so much. She was such a joy, and I would love to take more classes with her. You learn a lot in a low stress environment.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to any student interested in architecture or ancient Roman history.",
    "Yes",
    "Definitely would recommend this course to other students; the Professor and the course content are fantastic!",
    "No",
    "I would recommend this class for anyone who likes to travel or is interested in architecture. The exams were difficult, so I would say be prepared to study a lot, and don't take the course if you don't want to do a lot of memorization."
