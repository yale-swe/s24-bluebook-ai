    "1) a better appreciation for nonlinear DE's and the amazing behaviors that can result from them 2) a very clear picture of stochastic processes (diffusion, etc) 3) deepened my appreciation for the ear as a physical device. The ear is totally amazing.",

   "comments": [
    "Strengths - engaging lecture and course material, fun homework assignments, general utility of approaches used",
    "Strengths: biological content is cool \/ interesting Weaknesses: * terribly taught. Nobody is going to pay attention to you writing calculus on the board for one and a half hours. * pronumerals are often used without explanation, such that I spend an entire class wondering what mu is. * equations from the course notes are often referred to in the homework without referencing which set of notes and which page. Homework shouldn't be a treasure hunt. * homework frequently contained errors. Get your act together * homework uploaded to portal far too late. One week is not enough for a final project. One assignment was uploaded less than two days before the due date. Improvements: * think about the concepts that you are trying to teach. Nobody gains anything by watching you work through the calculus for an hour. What is the take home message? We benefit much more from an in depth discussion of what Fokker-Planck implies than from watching you struggle to derive it.",
    "Really fun course, no real improvements I could suggest. Maybe give extra solved example questions to help students build intuition on how to approach different problems.",
    "Strength: very clear presentation of mathematical methods and their application, although could have been more in depth at times. Weakness: lack of cohesive flow to the course. Switching back and forth between Prof. Howard and Prof. Emonet disrupted the flow. Would have been better if each of them had had his own self-contained half.",
    "Weakness: homework was not very friendly for MATLAB beginners"

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Yes, the course presents most students with a new perspective on biological systems, and emphasizes thinking of a physical or mathematical theory to describe phenomena.",
    "Most certainly not. It's a waste of time. I didn't learn anything more than a few biological novelties \/ curiosities that would be better appreciated by spending a single evening browsing wikipedia and watching a couple of review lectures from undergraduate mathematics.",
    "Yes - it balanced a modest workload while still teaching me a lot",
    "Yes! One of the best courses I've taken here.",
    "I would recommend this class to any student who wants to work on cellular biophysics or systems biology. While molecular biophysics people can still benefit from the math methods in the class, the applications would be less relevant.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. It is a good introduction to quantitative biology and equips students with the practical skills (programming, mathematical theories) they need.",
    "Yes. This course is useful especially for students involved with system biology"
