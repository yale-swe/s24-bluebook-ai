   "comments": [
    "\"Gateway to math proofs.\" Prepare for heavy proofs, especially towards the end of the semester. You learn a lot-go for it! It can actually be easier than MATH 120.",
    "Really good class. I think they tend to switch the professor up fairly frequently for 225 and that's what everything really hingeson. Prof. Calinescu was nothing legendary, but she was thorough and that's really all you need for linear algebra. For those deciding between 222 and 225, 225 is really not hard at all while 222, I hear, is almost mind-numbingly easy. Don't waste your time with 222, apparently 225 provides much better preparation for higher level math courses and gives you a better intuitive understanding of the subject.",
    "Very theoretical and often doesn't explain the point of the theory (and we never do application, obviously). Classes are basically the teacher writing the examples from the book onto the board. You should read the chapter before coming into class everyday so you can better grasp the material.",
    "It's not a very interesting class, so unless you need it as a prereq for more advanced classes, I wouldn't recommend it. That said, the workload is light and the exams are very reasonable.",
    "Very good course with Prof Calinescu. Much better than Math 120. The proof aspect makes it much more interesting than Math 222 (or so I've heard). Take it if you wanna see if you like proof -based math.",
    "It is harder, but in the end I feel I have learnt a lot and inderstood most of the material.",
    "Take it if you are extremely interested in proving theorems and if you feel comfortable with math in general. If you don't but need to take linear algebra shop 222 also and decide which professor you like best. If you feel that you prefer 225 commit to it and learn\/understand the concepts before and on the day they are discussed in class. This is something I regret not having done rigorously enough.",
    "1. Proof is not as scary as it sounds. I am not very 'mathy,' and, although the final was not a walk in the park, I didn't have much trouble with the homeworks\/midterm.2. From talking to people in Math222, this class seems almost easier-- less busywork and more theoretical material. It looks like you'll end up learning linear a little better if you take this class.If you're interested in learning linear algebra, take 225. You'll learn the basics and, in my opinion, it's easier than120 was.",
    "I would recommend it for someone who is truly interested in maths and proofs, mind you, the class is not curved.",
    "If this is the next step for you in math, I don't see any reason why you shouldn't take it. It's useful material, and the proofs are interesting. If you don't like proving things or you really just want the practical aspects of math, take 222 instead.",
    "A challenging class, but you definitely learn how to go about proofs. You'll definitely learn and grow by taking this course. This is pure math, no applications or anything like that, so take this class if you want to do proofs and learn theory.Note, you can do very well in 115 \/ 120 and still have some trouble in this class. But you'll get the hang of it. I'm glad I took it.",
    "This is a class that I would only take again if I were forced to. While I learned a decent amount of linear algebra, it was often by reading the book, rather than from the lectures. If Professor Calinescu is teaching this again, chances are you will have a much better experience in Math 222. Professor Calinescu, although obviously very bright and talented, wasn't engaging. At one point, she told a classmate that they didn't need to attend class because all of the material was in the book. However, for me, as well as for most of my classmates, despite attending every class (and reading the book multiple times), the exams were very tough. Professor Calinescu would often include a proof or two that seemed that the only way one could solve them was if they had seen a similar proof previously, which most of us had not. So, take this at your own risk.",
    "Math 225 is very proof-based, and gives a good foundation in matrices. Overall, it was very manageable and I would recommend it.",
    "Good proof-based linear algebra course that is a nice fit for those who have already taken MV Calculus and\/or linear algebra in high school. The problem sets don't take too long and it's a great alternative for those who were overwhelmed with MATH 230 during shopping period.",
    "Math 225 was a goods in depth survey of linear algebra. I would recommend it to anyone with a real interest in math, hoping to have a firm understanding of the underpinnings of many specialized branches of math.",
    "Boring but easy. You'll learn what you need but you'll want to fall asleep every class. However, don't be intimidated by how early the class is, because it's totally OK to cut classes because she teaches everything straight from the book."
