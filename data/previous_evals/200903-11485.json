    "This is the best class I have ever taken at Yale. It is fun, interesting, and a manageable workload. The professor is such a nice person and class is always a pleasure to go to. We did a lot of case studies, watched videos, and had a lot of discussions, all of which were interesting and relevant for anyone who wants to work for a corporation. Absolutely take this class.... it is unbelievable.",
    "It is a good intro to ethics and how we can apply those to everyday situations.",
    "By far, one of the best classes I've ever taken, if not the best class overall. Dr. Carreras was incredibly knowledgeable about the subjects discussed, which spanned a wide range of topics, and she's the nicest teacher I've come across. The reading responses are a little long, but they're only due once a week so it's completely manageable. The midterm and final were open book, open note case studies; three were presented but only two needed to be solved. The case studies we discuss in class are famous, interesting and well-known cases, and the main moral philosophies were also covered. Take this class, you'll absolutely love it!",
    "This class is a definite! If you are looking for an easy social science and are interesting in business and engineering, take this course. Plus the professor is phenomenal!",
    "I highly recommend this class. The work is minimal, but you will learn things. A great fifth class or Credit\/D.",
    "Definitely. This was my favorite class at Yale. Great subject and the best teacher. Everyone should take a class taught by Mercedes Carreras at some point, she is the best.",
    "Good course in thinking about the factors of a situation. It covers a lot more than just \"ethics\". Yes, I would recommend",
    "I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in business or otherwise applied ethics. It's a small class, so you get a lot of attention.",
    "This is the best gut class ever. Very interesting, and extremely easy. I really enjoyed this class.",
    "Yes. Take this class."
