    "In HIST 351 you will survey both the political and religious history of the Middle East, North Africa, and parts of Central Asia from 570 AD to 1500 AD. This course also focuses on the development of Islamic Jurisprudence and Sufism (Islamic Mysticism). I would recommend this class to anybody who is interested in the Middle East, but has never had a chance to learn anything about the area!",
    "It is a really interesting subject matter and there is a good combination of religion and history, which is perfect if that is what you are looking for. The TF and the prof make sure there are other resources for you too, so no worries if this is not something you know about. However, it can be really dry and boring, and a lot of work. I recommend it if this is what you're interested in but otherwise its boring and not really worth it.",
    "Interesting to begin with, but gets a little dull as the course strays from the establishment of overarching themes in Islamic history and refocuses on dates when important battles\/assassinations\/conquests took place. Not too exciting.",
    "I really appreciate having the understanding and knowledge I gained in this course. Western education definitely leaves you with a hole in the history of the Middle East, and I now have a very solid grasp of what happened there from Muhammad to 1500. That said, this was one of the most exasperating courses I've ever taken at Yale. The professor seemed totally disconnected from teaching. He obviously outsourced everything to the TA. He literally asked us whether we had a final paper in the class a week before it was due. No grading breakdown on the syllabus, and he tried to lay out reading that related to lectures but he usually ended up lecturing about whatever he wanted to that day in rough chronological order with the course. Readings sometimes corresponded to the lectures sometimes not. I stopped doing them. And he lectured from memory, which meant it was absurdly disorganized and sometimes he literally ran out of things to talk about and let us out early. The last week he talked and rambled about current events, but it was nice not to have any more content for the final. Also, weekly quizzes, reading responses, way too much reading for a history lecture, and a 12-15 page paper at the end. This lecture for some reason thinks it merits the workload of a seminar without the responsibility of actually being organized and thoughtful about its content. Also, I memorized a list of 20 dates and the names of events that went with them for the final. Didn't I graduate from high school already?! I thought I came here to do higher level thinking or something like that. Seriously, guys.",
    "Do not take the class. The professor is very knowledgable and kind but the course is extremely poorly organized and the lectures are often boring and incoherent.",
    "Easy easy ROW if you're a history major. Very dull class though. Can't really recommend it other than that it's easy, but you could probably find a more interesting class that also wasn't too much work if that's what you're looking for (that's what I wish I had done).",
    "The class has potential to be interesting, but is actually quite dry."
