   "comments": [
    "Unbelievable. If you can get in, you must take it. If you love music, or theater, especially if you love both.",
    "Dan is a great professor, although the class is very fast paced. It might have been nicer if the class were smaller, because it felt at times like some students would dominate the discussions, and in the quasi-lecture format, there's not an opportunity for intimate discussion. Definitely take it if you have the time to commit to it and are interested, but if you're not able to do the reading (of which there is quite a bit), there's no reason to take it.",
    "I had hoped this class would be more geared towards American history and how it shaped musical theater. It mostly focussed on specific shows and analyzing them. It's an ok class.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who has any interest in musical theater and how it has evolved as an art form and a business.",
    "YES YES YES YES A THOUSAND TIMES YES. Dan Egan's passion for Musical Theatre, along with his brilliant musical insight, makes him an unbelievable lecturer. Be prepared to be pushed to refine your thoughts, make meaningful contributions to class and really work to achieve greatness on your papers. My favorite class at Yale.",
    "This is an excellent class. You will know immediately if it is right for you. This is a place where, one a week, Yale's theater nerds sit together and talk about showtunes. If Oklahoma and Ethel Merman and Stephen Sondheim bring a smile to your face, take it. Professor Egan is a really great professor who brings out the best in you as a student and the class as a whole.",
    "Yes, most definitely! Such a fun class, and I feel like I approach shows in a different way now.",
    "American Musical Theatre History is a rigorous, intensive study of all aspects of musical theatre: evolution of storytelling, sociology of musical theatre, connections of music to character, influences of various people on the art form's development, the commercial aspect, politics of musical theatre, how we write about theatre. As such, it's absolutely fascinating and you're guaranteed to encounter shows and ideas you're unfamiliar with. On the flip side, there's not time to cover everything and sometimes important shows get shortchanged for far less important ones: for example, a close study of songs from Bloody, Bloody Andrew Jackson yet no mention of a single Lerner and Loewe musical. Everything's interesting though and the deliberate range of backgrounds of the students in the class makes for some incredible discussions. You'll work really, really hard on the 3 papers and, if you do the readings, which you should, it's a big commitment, but it's definitely worth it. And, let's be real, Dan Egan is the guardian of the Shen Curriculum for Musical Theatre at Yale, a truly great guy, and an absolute must-know for anyone who's interested in theatre, music, or meeting awesome people.",
    "Great class, even for non-theater people. Make sure you love musical theater though, otherwise it could get old quickly. But if you do, it is so fun to sit in a room for 2 hours and listen to soundtracks and learn about a different part of American culture. It's an incredible opportunity to engage with a neat side of Yale as well.",
    "If you have a passion for musical theater, this class is for you. But just because the subject matter is \"fun\" doesn't mean this class isn't hard work - you absolutely need to study the works and be prepared to dissect them thoroughly. Egan pushes you to make insightful and critical comments about the musicals we cover. It gives you a great history of the medium and allowed me to (re)experience some classic shows. Highly recommend it! There are three papers (7-10, 2-3, and 10-15) and weekly assignments of listening\/reading. It's a fantastic seminar and Egan is a brilliant seminar leader. He is such a great person to get to know. If you get in, take this!!",
    "Great class. Take it if you're at all in to AMT.",
    "I have already recommended this class to people. Seriously, take it. I've never seen so many people arrive early to a Friday-afternoon seminar in my life. Fun, gloriously good fun.",
    "Definitely would recommend it.",
    "I'd recommend this class to any student who's interested in taking a serious academic approach to studying musical theatre. There is a lot of class discussion and really interesting readings, and you are introduced to some lesser-known musicals as well as going into more depth with old favorites. You get the chance to follow certain threads through history, and can choose to pursue interests you for paper topics. Professor Egan is really excellent and so helpful with narrowing down paper topics and guiding discussion. He also brings in a few interesting guest lecturers and organizes a trip to a production in New York, which was a lot of fun. It's a very engaging course, and you get out of it what you put into it. Overall, I would wholeheartedly recommend this class if you love musical theatre and want to think critically about everything that it can do.",
    "You'll have fun talking about musicals for two hours every week, but you might not get a lot from the actual course. Dan is great and super nice. You're graded on three papers throughout the semester."
