    "If you want to learn the process of writing a good history paper, take this course. Freeman really walks you through the steps of writing a paper, more so than many other Yale professors who teach junior seminars. She even line-edits full rough drafts! However, it is early in the morning, and sometimes the material can seem a bit dry (unless you're a total early American history buff).",
    "I would take this class if you are interested in the time period, because it is less about individual politicians and more about the time period in general. The class is interesting, but it can be dry at times.The paper is really long, but Freeman actually helps a LOT and improved my writing. So I would recommend it!",
    "Professor Freeman provides rigorous, but insightful\/invaluable, feedback on the papers. Fun course.",
    "I did not enjoy this class, but I think I enjoyed it as much as I could have enjoyed a class about early national politics. Professor Freeman is a dedicated teacher and scholar, and I hoped her enthusiasm for the time period and its characters would win me over during the course, but it did not. I found class discussions to be extremely boring and unproductive. While I did challenge my understanding of early American history, I did not learn anything in doing so. Take this class for a pre-industrial American credit, but beware that discussions and paper-writing can be painful if you are not an early American enthusiast.",
    "This is an interesting and well taught course about a period in history that is not very well understood. There is one 20 page paper to write. A draft of the paper is due at what seems like a very early date. But then it is returned with very helpful feedback for completing the final paper.",
    "Yes. The course is solid and the professor is great. No grades other than the final paper, so who knows how I actually did, but the week-to-week was great. Readings were long but manageable and generally interesting, and discussions were often engaging and the two hours seemed to fly by. Also, Freeman is really lovely and getting to work with her was definitely one of the highpoints of the class.",
    "I would definitely recommend the class. The reading was mostly very interesting, and Professor Freeman is interesting, intelligent, and extremely nice.",
    "Interesting seminar. Great professor."
