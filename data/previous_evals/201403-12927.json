   "comments": [
    "Good course; certainly superior in content to the sections of regular German that I shopped (for people who really want to know the language). The textbook is obviously excellent. Professor Stern is a very good instructor with an excellent sense of how to make German grammar sensible to new speakers and readers of the language (and entertain us from time to time as well!). Problems do arise, however, on those occasions when Professor Stern devotes more time to defending his teaching methods than employing them. All in all, I'm happy I chose to take this course and feel I have learned a great deal.",
    "GMAN 125 is, despite the course title, really not about learning German. Yes, you will gain a very solid grasp of German grammar and syntax--Herr Stern is an excellent language instructor--but the larger project might be described as teaching you how to learn in general--\"mental hygiene.\" The textbook is highly systematic and Herr Stern's main goal in teaching is facilitating your ability to organize and retain all the information needed to read and understand German. Herr Stern supplements this larger project with asides about poetry, linguistics, music, and a smattering of other languages. Really a delightful class. On a more practical note: do not take this class unless you can commit to being on class every day for the entire semester. No lateness, no absence, no \"nonsense.\" Herr Stern does not respond well to careless mistakes, and the first few weeks of class may seem a bit cold--mistakes will warrant some mockery, and the class will not have yet bonded--but as the semester progresses, things warm up as Herr Stern gets to know the class and vice versa. The workload is not terribly severe, especially if you have prior experience with the sort of teaching that Herr Stern promotes, but is certainly not light by any means.",
    "Only take it if you're REALLY serious about German! If so, it will be fabulous, and if not, a nightmare.",
    "I've already recommended it to heaps of people. I'd describe it as an intensive introduction to German grammar, which also happens to be the best class ever, as long as you do your homework.",
    "German 125 is a big commitment for only the most serious students interested in learning German. It is also your best shot at learning German at Yale and I wouldn't trust my language goals with any other Professor. I would highly recommend it for students who have no excuses and who can be punctual."
