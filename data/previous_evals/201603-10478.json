   "comments": [
    "This course has taught me a lot about the theory and experimental methods of physical chemistry. I learned many new skills in the laboratory, such as use of oscilloscopes, NMR spectrometers, operation of gas tanks, and performance of calorimetry experiments, to name a few. I have also reinforced some other skills I already had before this class, like organization and time management, which were integral to success in this course. The lab writeups have helped me become very familiar with Microsoft Office (even more than I was before), OriginLab graphing software, and the BASIC programming language. I have truly learned a lot from this course and believe the knowledge will be very useful in the future.",
    "Lab techniques, how to work with physical chemistry principles, how to do electronics, how to do data analysis. Developed carpal tunnel from lab reports.",
    "Some techniques necessary for chemical work were practiced by the student. Some data analysis techniques were gained.",
    "I learned tons of excel and a bit of chemistry.",
    "Developed high proficiency in Excel, some basic coding skills, and the ability to do error analysis\/propagate error in my sleep. Gained the confidence that any other scientific writing I do from here on out will only be less arduous and time-consuming. Experiments also clarified the details of some topics covered in the first semester physical chemistry course, such as Joule-Thomson coefficient. Greater understanding in the working of NMR spectrometry was gained.",
    "This course teaches you how to perform experimentation in physical chemistry, analyze data, and compose\/organize scientific reports. It also teaches you how to fight sleep deprivation (see: every all-nighter I had to pull to get these reports done), control your slowly declining mental health, and maintain personal friendships and relationships despite your unconditional prioritization of this class over them. You learn about yourself as a person and how you react under pressure that you didn't think a class was capable of imposing on you. It's a class that stems from good intentions. You learn a lot - really, you do. I now know a lot more not only about chemistry, but about the tangentially related subjects that it's important to understand if you're studying chemistry, and I genuinely feel a lot more prepared for a career in the field. The workload made me a lot more resilient, and I now feel I can tackle any project I set my mind to.",
    "I did not develop any skills that I haven't already developed in other courses that are usually taken by students who have to take this course. The material consists of a high school engineering electronics course followed by a slew of unconnected Physical Chemistry\/Thermodynamics experiments. The final experiment on Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy may be the only place where you learn new information, and that is only because you probably haven't taken Physical Chemistry 2 yet. You will relearn the exact same thing in Physical Chemistry 2. So, overall the material in this course is unnecessary for the students who are required to take it. You do learn how to propagate errors, but that is so simple you only need to do it one time to learn it. Despite this, you are forced to propagate errors thousands of times over during the course, resulting in a waste of 20-30 hours per experiment on excel sheet adjustments and meaningless proofreading.",
    "The only skill I developed in this class was how to use excel and how to simultaneously hate excel. The workload for this class is absolutely absurd - such that it's nearly impossible to actually learn and retain any information if you're taking any other classes... which you obviously are. I can honestly say I've wasted a full credit at Yale taking this class and I have taken nothing valuable away from the experience.",
    "A good intro to learning to write (and read!) scientific papers. A lot of practice for data and error analysis and interpretation.",
    "Nominally, this course teaches you three things how to write a comprehensive and properly formatted technical report, how to analyze large sets of quantitative data and handle error propagation, and how\/where energy exists in chemical systems. Through tackling these objectives, you also learn some life lessons. You learn how to say something sensible about NMR inversion recovery pulse sequences when youve gotten a cumulative 7 hours of sleep in a 55 hour period, how to navigate and extract crucial information from an inordinate amount of course packet text, and how to have your personal life and relationships altered due to how much time you dump into this class.",
    "Learned many practical chemistry skills and learned a lot about applying concepts drilled into our head over the course of gen. chem, orgo, and pchem.",
    "I gained practice and confidence writing concisely. Writing such comprehensive reports with well-presented data and thorough analysis was gratifying.",
    "This class took me through some classic physical chemistry experiments and concepts, as well as some of the requisite skills required. The class complemented the lecture course well.",
    "I have expansive understanding of the Joule-Thomson effect; I will lose the ability to count before I will lose the ability to propagate error; a week ago I calculated weighted means and standard deviations in a dream (scratch that, it was a nightmare); I know why electrical heat from the ignition wire can be ignored in a bomb-calorimetry set up; I know the speed of sound in helium (it's 1007 m\/s) and my oscilloscope trial and error skills are so good that they make it seem as if though I actually understand that machine. I still don't know much about T2 relaxation other than its definition, but I can tell you three different ways to measure it.",
    "Knowledge: Basic electronics Thermodynamics in relation to experiments Concepts behind NMR Skills: Microsoft Excel, some Origin Error propagation Writing long and detailed lab reports Word processing Insights: None",
    "This course helped me develop laboratory skills necessary for conducting physical chemistry experiments. It taught me a lot about how certain physical properties of a substance are determined experimentally. I also learned a lot about error analysis and statistically accurate estimates.",
    "The ability to produce a 50 page document multiple times in a semester and an insane amount of time management skills.",
    "This course teaches you had to push yourself to the limits and work HARD.",
    "This course taught me how to propagate error, write professional looking lab reports, propagate error, and propagate error. I also got damn good at Microsoft Excel. The labs do teach fundamental concepts of physical chemistry, but it takes some time to get it if you don't read the course packet thoroughly the first time.",
    "This class did an excellent job at developing my technical writing skills. In addition, the class also did a very good job at developing my ability to propagate error and estimate the uncertainty in experimental measurements. Finally, the class allowed me to develop knowledge on a wide range of topics within physical chemistry, as well as a brief but thorough review of electronics and circuits.",
    "I learned how to design experiments that minimize sources of error, how to propagate error, and how to set writing goals."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I believe this course is very good as is. Professor Vaccaro's organization of the course is impeccable; you can tell that he cares a lot about students' success and learning, which makes the course very rewarding. One area of possible improvement is the reviewing of the NMR experiment manual. There were many things that were omitted in the packet, and many things that were not done in lab that were in the instructions. This made the experiment extremely confusing and frustrating at times.",
    "Too much. Workload needs to be scaled back or questions to be answered in reports need to be outlined more clearly.",
    "The first lab on electronics is almost completely irrelevant to the subject of the course. The last lab on pulsed NMR is not given enough time for students to fully digest the information and theory behind it. The obvious solution to me is to cut the first lab entirely and have the last lab be twice as long, with more experiments. There should not be a serious final in a lab course. The lab reports ask for too much information. We shouldn't have to include every single piece of data collected and every single calculation. See inorganic lab (CHEM 252) for comparison of a reasonable amount of data to collect for the class. The lab packets should be significantly shorter, and should include a section that directly states what should be included in the final write-up. As it stands, they are confusing and difficult to work through, and very easy to miss an additional section of the report.",
    "Strengths: The course is well-organized, some of the topics explored in lab are actually quite interesting Weaknesses: The amount of work you put in for this course is not proportional to what you get out of it; simply way too much work for a laboratory class which is worth just 1 credit.",
    "Strengths: imparted several useful skills like error propagation and familiarity with Excel Weaknesses: extremely time-consuming, to the point that my performance in other classes suffered; lab reports were technically limited to 15 pages of text, but the analyses required for each report were too extensive to fit in such a limit and grading punished those that did not include every possible value\/detail\/analysis; grading rubrics often required analyses not expressly stated and only \"implied\" in the lab manual; did not get the first few graded lab reports back in time to learn from initial mistakes made and correct the next lab reports (although Professor Vaccaro somewhat addressed this and allowed for a second turn-in of the fourth lab report)",
    "The class, overall, it extraordinarily unreasonable, to the point of satire. The concepts that are taught could be conveyed just as easily with at most 50% of the work that was assigned. This class consumed my entire semester, and the majority of my time working on the material for it was spent performing tedious tasks, such as making figures and performing trivial error propagation calculations. I wouldn't have minded if most of the time was spent teaching new chemistry concepts, but that wasn't the case. This class took up a lot of time, to the point that I was sleeping through my other classes because I had stayed up all night to work on CHEM 330L. It also left me a lot less time to study for my other classes. Good class - unimaginable workload.",
    "Let me begin by saying this course has no strengths. This course needs to be taken over by the university and redone. This course is unreasonable to a degree that I have never before imagined possible. I spent 80-100 hours working on each of the 7 lab reports in this class. For each lab, you have to learn incredibly nit-picky material and then write a report that demands the most irrational time commitment I have experienced in my academic life. I gained absolutely nothing from this course. Zero knowledge. Zero skills. Everything in this course could have been taught in a week of lecture to any mildly experienced science student. The idea that I had to devote my entire life to this class for absolutely zero return is absurd. This lab class left me with no time whatsoever for my other three courses. It left me with no time for any extracurriculars. It left me with no time to apply to internships. It left me with no time to myself as a person. Meals were skipped. Showers were skipped. Multiple all-nighters were taken. I did not have a single moment of free time this entire semester. My health suffered as a result of this class. I was as proactive as possible in completing the work for this course, and I performed very well. However, being proactive and performing at a good level in this class cost me my whole semester. I have never seen a course so flawed in my entire life. This course prevents you from studying or doing the psets for the actual Physical Chemistry lecture. Taking this course is like taking three courses at the same time. Even after the 700 hours you put into the lab reports, you are forced to prepare for a ridiculously specific final that prevents you from preparing from your other finals. The final in this class gives you no equation sheet for the hundreds of equations you have seen during the semester, and you have to know any random one from memory for the final. I did well in this course, I love chemistry, I love lab research, and I love being challenged. But this course is the worst part of my Yale experience. It has made me rethink my choice of major.",
    "The weakness to this class is the completely unacceptable workload and frankly unethical grading policies. TA's grade lab reports you spend over thirty hours writing, and 10% will be deducted for a minuscule detail not formatted the way the TA decided -- EVEN THOUGH IT'S NOT IN THE RUBRIC! How can hours upon hours of work be valued in any way if the grading is so arbitrary? Aside from that, the workload of this course in completely horrifying, and ruins your entire semester. This class is horrible and I regret taking it (of course I had to for my major...) and it was one of my worst experiences at Yale. However, Professor Vaccaro is a strong lecturer and truly understands the material and can teach it well. If only I ever had time to pay attention to his lectures - I was trying to finish the reports...",
    "The course is rigorous enough to drill in the theory of the experiments and the handling of data. The grading rubric is a little random and unpredictable. The main reason people lose points (despite working hard on those reports) is that they miss out things they didn't know they should include. A lot of times, one small insignificant sentence costs them 6 points (an they build up). So a more comprehensive list of questions that should be answered compiled in one place would be more fair (and pedagogic).",
    "Theres a certain point where what you get out of a class exceeds what you put into it, and this course seemed to be well beyond that point. If youre in any other remotely difficult classes and are involved in extracurricular activities, it is pretty much impossible to finish these lab reports without some serious sleep deprivation. Taking this course detracts from the other learning that goes on at Yale. You write 7 lab reports counting just the text, I wrote 23274 words, equivalent to 83 double-spaced pages. Adding on appendices and captioning for tables\/figures doubled that word count and took me to 235 pages. My NMR report took roughly 40 hours and my Bomb Calorimetry report took about 60 hours, and both of these are due roughly a month after the data is taken (but you need to work on them simultaneously) so its not like you can get a huge head start. If you do the math, 100 hours of analysis\/writing divided by 4 weeks of school plus 5 hours\/week of class time averages to 30 hours\/week spent on this one class towards the end of the semester. Im not saying that people cant handle it, Im just saying that its unnecessarily demoralizing and the information could be probably taught in a better way. Im also writing this as a non-athlete student on no financial aid a student with a work-study job or an athlete with a practice schedule might have to make some serious sacrifices to find the time to do well in this course. It would be possible but difficult. Ultimately though, I did learn a ton. Im not an educational professional, so I cant determine myself whether this course is being taught remotely efficiently, but I think it requires some input\/insight from other professors or administrators to evaluate whether thats the case. This is a rite of passage for chemistry majors here, so selfishly I dont really want it to change because I want future majors receiving a chemistry diploma from Yale to be held to the same high standard, but it's a bit much.",
    "I thought one of the weaknesses of this class was the heavy focus on electronics. While electronics were helpful to many of the labs they didn't need to receive so much individual focus. Focusing on how electronics was applied to help with finding the speed of sound, or with NMR seems a lot more relevant than the ridiculous amount time spent just on resistors, transistors, op-amps, and other electronics. This is a chemistry class not an electrical engineering class.",
    "In general, the course packets were very clear (both the lab procedure and data analysis components). The written instruction for the NMR lab could have been improved. With the CP and MG pulse sequence and inversion recovery portions written on the board, the TA's were not able to tell the students the data required for data analysis at the original lab time.",
    "The clear strength of the course was that the experiments and lectures were informative and useful, and provided a good insight into some classic physical chemistry experiments. The weakness of this course was the workload. The hours required simply do not match the knowledge gained from this course. The skills obtained when writing the reports for this class were valuable, but the reports themselves were exceedingly long and tedious. Improvement to this class must come in making the workload reasonable, perhaps through abbreviation of the sheer volume of data that must be analyzed and reported upon.",
    "Strengths: it is very rigorous in application of basic principles Weaknesses: it is super high workload. Improvements: Decrease the workload",
    "This course definitely covers a lot of material, to both its benefit and detriment. Topics like the Joule-Thomson experiment were enriching and interesting, but electronics made me (and the vast majority of the class) extremely frustrated and confused. I think Prof. Vaccaro's \"bottom-up approach\" is excessive. I found that we focused too much time on the very foundational things in lecture so that we never even got to learn about what we'd actually be doing in lab. For example, with electronics, we spent the vast majority of 5 lectures learning about RC circuits. But, in lab, we spent the majority of the time (and brainpower) working with transistors, which are more complex and non-intuitive. I still don't know how they work. The lecture often lagged behind the lab such that we would experiment first and then come into lecture, only to learn the reason behind how what we ended up doing was a mistake. I think organizational things like this would go a long way towards making this course less of a struggle. Lectures ideally should precede the experiment, and should be focused on the higher level things that are of concern to us. For me at least, I would rather spend the time speaking practically about the experiments, rather than deriving quantities through Maxwell relations--those are the things I can read about in the packet. And my largest recommendation: Please cut electronics in half, if not more! I did not find my lab experience enriched by electronics beyond basic oscilloscope functions and Lissajous figures. Op-amps, ICs, and digital circuits are simply too advanced for a chemistry lab course, and it turns students against the course before it even begins.",
    "In summary, this class should be renamed word processing and Microsoft Excel. Strengths: Teaches you a painful attention to detail Enables you to master error propagation, detailed writing and linear regression Workload has become much more reasonable recently with the class building up to a lab report rather than 6-7 full lab reports Weaknesses: Mechanical, repetitive and pointless exercise of error propagation, Excel processing, comparison to literature values and organizing information in tables and paragraphs rather than analysis of chemical concepts, the logic of experiments and\/or implications of results. Contrary to the professors belief, this class will not make you anything close to a physical chemist. The class needs to shift the focus on lab reports to understanding the implications of result (and\/or do more meaningful experiments) rather than forcing students to spend weeks of their time on adding\/multiplying value, copying equations from the lab packet and doing error propagation. Honestly, the class was never intellectually challenging it was just a frustrating drain on time. If I was learning something, I could justify the work; Rules for checking lab reports are unclear and arbitrary with some TAs cutting off 8 points for reasons like not easy to follow or could be tidier. No central marking or grading scheme was available for a fair comparison No focus on the concepts behind actual experiments lecture mostly disconnected and\/or much simpler than experiments; Poor lab teaching for all experiments except electronics (where Professor Vaccaro himself taught the procedures); Pre-lab quizzes were supposed to be an easy source of high grades but were not very meaningful since they expected you to have understood the material before it was actually taught in any formal manner. More specifically, with challenging topics like NMR and Electronics, the pre-lab quizzes were too difficult and not educating; Lab experiments (other than electronics) were exceptionally boring and exhausting with students forced to stay for the entire 4 hours even if they had finished the experiment earlier, along with torturous rules like no earphones\/music even when doing an experiment individually; Some of the TAs were quite clumsy and wasted the students time by giving incorrect advice on procedures and tasks;",
    "While this course did a good job of presenting a wide range of laboratory examples and applications of physical chemistry, it demands a very high time commitment that makes it difficult to fully take in the information being presented. I often found myself still unable to take the time to fully understand a particular lab because the laboratory write up and calculations took such a long amount of time. Professor Vaccaro is a very, very good professor, but the demands of this course make it difficult to fully take in all of the insight he has on the subject.",
    "This course does an incredible job of providing students with all the information they need to learn about different experiments in physical chemistry. Professor Vaccaro is an amazing lecturer and is extremely helpful. That being said, I think the biggest weakness of the course is the workload. It is an extremely large amount of work for one course, and consumes a disproportionate amount of time for the one credit it offers. I probably spent more time doing lab reports for this class than I spent doing work for all of my other classes combined this semester. I think there are ways to teach physical chemistry lab without having it be this much work. As of now, though, it really is too much work, especially given the difficulty of the semester that most chemistry and chemical engineering students have at this time.",
    "People say this is the hardest class at Yale and in terms of time commitment this is completely true. I probably put 3 times more time in to this class this semester than any class taken previously. The strength of the class is that it teaches you your limits.",
    "While this course definitely helped me grow as a student and chemist, at times the amount of work and some of the tasks felt unreasonable. For example, we were asked to create a computer program, albeit simple, when half the class had absolutely no exposure to programming.",
    "This course made us do an unhealthy amount of work that was completely unnecessary and damaging to our physical and mental health. This course could be improved by reducing the amount of material covered or by reducing the amount of work needed to do the laboratory reports. There were times that I had to skip meals and extra-curricular commitments just to be able to keep up with the work. I also felt that my lab reports were often incomplete or could be better polished if I had more time to work on them.",
    "It will certainly teach students how to write proper reports, but the labs take an incredibly high amount of time. Hard to put an exact time to it, but some of the reports took over 40 hours to complete. That's over a full work week. Im lucky I didn't have a fully committed job or sports team, or else I don't know how I would have done this. Another issue is that it seemed like students' time was not valued at all. If a lab was fully completed early, instead of being allowed to leave, often time more work was simply made up to he dine and hold students longer. It felt like high school treatment.",
    "The main strength of the class is in surviving the class. The workload and expectations of the class are so intense that simply completing all the assignments to the best of one's ability and putting in the effort to surmount and overcome the seemingly impossible task of the lab reports seriously strengthens a student's ability to write technically and present data in the form of tables and graphs. The biggest weakness of the class is the stress associated with the workload. It can appear to be an overwhelming amount of work, and a student taking the class is certainly bound to worry about completing the lab reports in time while satisfying all requirements and having good data to present. The stress is compounded by the fact that the class is a huge time sink, and can easily start to affect other classes.",
    "Starting with partial lab reports before building up to a complete report was helpful. It would be more helpful to see\/review what a satisfactory lab report for a specific lab contains. While the provided guideline was helpful, it was hard to stay within the page limit while ensuring that major details were included."

    "Although this course is a lot of work, I recommend it if you are a student who is curious and passionate about learning. Many new skills will be developed throughout the semester, and the accomplishment felt after the completion of each report is immense. Professor Vaccaro organizes the course very well and presents the material in a very clear and interesting way. This is extremely important, because the topics covered in this course have the potential to be quite confusing if presented poorly.",
    "Y I K E S if this is not a 5 for workload for you, whatever you rate this class for workload is THE NEW MAXIMUM for your workload scale. But you'll get through it. Vaccaro is very accessible if you need help.",
    "Absolutely not. Only take it if you are certain you want to be a Chemistry major.",
    "Unfortunately, those who take PChem lab have no choice about it. I believe that the instructor means well and indeed many of the topics explored in the course are interesting on their own, but the amount of work needed to complete the lab reports is absurd; moreover, you really don't get much out of them: completing a lab report takes a long time, but usually does not require a profound understanding of the related concepts. It's really all about excel and table formatting. If 2 of the 6 lab reports were to be dropped, I would argue that the course-load would be more manageable and the course more enjoyable. In its current form, it is useless pain and misery...",
    "This course was intellectually challenging and allowed for deeper\/more practical insight into various concepts in physical chemistry. However, the workload was INCREDIBLY high. Cannot over-emphasize how much work this class was.",
    "Don't do it man. If you're a chemistry\/chem engineering major, then you have no choice and I'm sorry. Otherwise, stay away. It's informative, but it's overkill in the name of academic purity and instruction. This class made me sharp much in the way that dropping a glass jar makes sharp shards of glass. The workload is entirely unreasonable - this is coming from someone with minimal commitments outside of classes who consistently devotes a lot of time to learning. It's true that I learned a lot, but most of my time was spent doing tedious things that didn't involve any of the concepts i had learned. This class ruined my sleep schedule and very nearly drove me to my breaking point. It strained my relationships with people, and made me unnecessarily angry at everything. I came into this class very much interested in pursuing a career in academia. Now, I have no desire to go anywhere near an academic institution after it, and I'm honestly unsure if I want to pursue chemistry in general as a career.",
    "Do not take this course. Ever. Do not take this course. If your major requires it, switch majors. This course will consume your entire semester. You will struggle in your other classes. You will not be able to study for your other finals. You will not be able to apply to internships. You will not be able to talk to your friends. You will have no time. You will be sleep deprived. You will be forced to learn arbitrary, unimportant material. You will be forced to write 7 lab reports that each require at least 80 hours of work. This does not include the time that it takes to read the material and prepare for lab, go to lab, and go to lecture for this class. I did well in this course, so my advice does not come from a place of anger. It comes from the fact that any reasonable human being would look at this course and find it disgusting in what it asks of students. You will spend 80 hours on a lab report just to have 10% of your grade docked because you didn't report one of the 1000 values in the experiment in the \"right\" units. Countless hours of data calculation, error propagation, reading, writing, and thoughtful analysis will be thrown aside as the TAs take off points from your lab report for the most arbitrary things. There is no way to even predict what will result in points being deducted; the TAs do not disclose their rubrics for each report. This course is an absolute joke. Do not take this course if you respect yourself as a person. There are an infinite number of more valuable ways to spend a semester at Yale than being consumed by this atrocity of a course. You could learn all of the actual useful material from this course in a week of lecture. This lab teaches you nothing, but it takes everything from you for a full 14 weeks.",
    "I will never ever recommend this class to another student at Yale. Not even someone I strongly dislike. It has ruined a semester at Yale, and has had made me question, multiple times, the value of the STEM education at Yale.",
    "Absolutely recommend it. The workload really is not as bad as the rumors. You have two weeks for every report (sometimes more!). The analysis of data itself takes about half a day to a day. And then another day to realize you've messed up and redo it. (That's really worst case scenario.) The writing might take longer. Most of the time spent is on copy-pasting your data into tables and captioning it. It's tedious but not hard. It would take you about 2 days to do all the writing. You can't exactly work 2 days straight so spread this out over your two weeks. You might have to pull an all-nighter per report. (reports don't have to be longer than 20 pages in total. And 10-15 of those is just tables.) Try to keep your five \"grace days\" for a bad midterm week and the last two experiments near the end of the term. The experiment packets are long. When you read them, mark any questions that should be answered in your report. These are sometimes hiding among the instructions. Make sure you understand the theory. Read the intros in the packets. It will save you for the final. It's a totally doable class (even enjoyable) as long as you don't procrastinate. And you will learn a lot.",
    "You do improve upon physical chemistry and thermodynamic intuition a ton, but in terms of training to be a chemistry researcher, its like learning how to drive by first building a car from scratch. Will that make you feel more confident and knowledgeable while driving? Yes. Will it actually make you a significantly better driver or prevent you from getting into accidents? Probably not. I cant say Id recommend it, but I guess that doesnt matter because you probably dont have a choice. The lab reports are exercises in endurance and consume an excessive amount of your time (mine totaled 235 pages). Not to mention that there are also pre-lab quizzes, a competency score, and a final exam, but the reports take up 99% of your effort and mental energy. The last two reports (bomb calorimetry and NMR) are killer and completely drained me going into finals. While the TAs are usually great, even they dont even know whats going on sometimes. You will make it through though, and I cant even describe how great it feels to turn in that last lab report.",
    "I would not, not unless it's required. While it is a useful class the work load is absurd and while a lot was learned, too much time was spend on busy work and electronics.",
    "I would not recommend this course to anyone simply because of the work involved. This course dominated my semester because of how much time was required to complete the assignments.",
    "If you have to take it you will take it. If you don't have to take it you don't take it (everybody knows that).",
    "This is at least 2 credits, maybe 2.5, worth of work, so plan accordingly, and I mean this sincerely. If you can help it, take 4 credits of the lightest load you can. These labs are no joke, and take literally all the time you have to work on them. It seemed like no matter how early I started, I finished minutes before class. The electronics portion is maddeningly complex in comparison to the level of instruction you are given, so most of that unit was a mystery to me (and others). That being said, don't decide not to be a chem or chemE major because of this class. You'll get through it and learn a lot about chemistry, formatting, and staying up very very late.",
    "*Note: the course is not nearly as time-consuming as it used to be. There is a big fear factor associated with the class which is no longer justified. The workload is still high but reasonably manageable and acceptable given that the tasks are normally very easy\/mechanical\/not intellectually challenging at all. Dont be afraid. In summary, this class should be renamed word processing and Microsoft Excel. Strengths: Teaches you a painful attention to detail Enables you to master error propagation, detailed writing and linear regression Workload has become much more reasonable recently with the class building up to a lab report rather than 6-7 full lab reports The peer tutor was the only reason this class was bearable and doable Weaknesses: Mechanical, repetitive and pointless exercise of error propagation, Excel processing, comparison to literature values and organizing information in tables and paragraphs rather than analysis of chemical concepts, the logic of experiments and\/or implications of results. Contrary to the professors belief, this class will not make you anything close to a physical chemist. The class needs to shift the focus on lab reports to understanding the implications of result (and\/or do more meaningful experiments) rather than forcing students to spend weeks of their time on adding\/multiplying value, copying equations from the lab packet and doing error propagation. Honestly, the class was never intellectually challenging it was just a frustrating drain on time. If I was learning something, I could justify the work; The final exam is a random and unwelcome addition to a course where we have no exams and suddenly a very challenging one at the end, often quite disconnected from our weekly musings in lab and in the lab reports; Rules for checking lab reports are unclear and arbitrary with some TAs cutting off 8 points for reasons like not easy to follow or could be tidier. No central marking or grading scheme was available for a fair comparison No focus on the concepts behind actual experiments lecture mostly disconnected and\/or much simpler than experiments; Poor lab teaching for all experiments except electronics (where Professor Vaccaro himself taught the procedures); Pre-lab quizzes were supposed to be an easy source of high grades but were not very meaningful since they expected you to have understood the material before it was actually taught in any formal manner. More specifically, with challenging topics like NMR and Electronics, the pre-lab quizzes were too difficult and not educating; Lab experiments (other than electronics) were exceptionally boring and exhausting with students forced to stay for the entire 4 hours even if they had finished the experiment earlier, along with torturous rules like no earphones\/music even when doing an experiment individually; Some of the TAs were quite clumsy and wasted the students time by giving incorrect advice on procedures and tasks;",
    "If you're taking this course, it is for the major requirement. That being said, for those who will take it, do not procrastinate. Set aside a lot of time in your schedule for the lab reports, especially making sure to do the calculations as soon as you can after performing the lab in case you have to redo anything in the lab. It is certainly a challenging course, but Professor Vaccaro is very helpful for the many questions that will come up.",
    "If you are considering this class then you likely have to take it. You also probably know that it is an extremely large amount of work. Make sure to get started on your reports early, as it may surprise you how long it takes to complete them. For the first traditional lab report, Experiment 2, I would consider giving yourself at least a week to figure it out; it can be pretty difficult to do everything Professor Vaccaro asks of you at first, so you should take extra time to get it right at the start. I strongly suggest that you finish a lab report over Thanksgiving break too. Finals period is always busy, but with this lab it is a completely different story. If you do not do a report over break, it is entirely possible that you will just not have time to study for other exams. Be kind to yourself and plan ahead. It will definitely be worth it.",
    "This is not a class you take unless you're required to. It's a ridiculous amount of work, but doable. Be aware that your other grades in other classes you take might suffer as a result of takin this class.",
    "Never take this class. Switch your major away from Chemistry so you can avoid this. Don't listen to people who say that this class is manageable. It's a trap!",
    "Believe the hype. You won't realize while working on labs, but they take forever. They will take as long as you give them, and if you give them less then 5 days then you're out of luck. It's hard, don't take it for fun. That's all I can say. There's no greater feeling than being done with it though, so that's a perk?",
    "I would only recommend this class to a student that is required to take it for the major. It is an immense amount of work, and will certainly improve any students technical writing abilities. Additionally, anyone that passes the class is bound to have a confidence boost regarding other classes simply for surmounting the amount of work expected of you in a semester. However, neither of these reasons should be grounds to convince an otherwise uncertain student to take the class because the fact is that the class is one of the largest time commitments I have ever had to make for a class. The benefit of the taking the class is not large enough to justify the amount of time required for the class, and there may be better classes for students who are not required to take the class.",
