   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this seminar, even though it is required. It is a helpful introduction to the discipline and a good primer for non-theorists.",
    "I would summarise it as a lot of really interesting and useful information that can nevertheless be quite the chore to slog through, simply given its basic nature as something usually on the less musical side of what we must do in this modern form of our discipline (though thankfully Pat did help to alleviate that issue often enough, e.g. in the sessions on Schenker and Gjerdingen). I would recommend the course to another student both on the grounds that it contains a great deal of important information and on the grounds that the department requires it, though I would make sure to serve my recommendation with a healthy side of caution and advice about how one must not approach this course with the right amount of detachment: learn what appeals to you most and of course do the assignments as best you can, but don't be too much of a completionist when it comes to the readings--you will gain more from reading two articles really well than from reading four badly.",
    "As a proseminar, the answer to this question is relatively circumscribed. The course provides an overview of music theory as a discipline within the last hundred years or so, with a focus on institutional history and recent developments. A recommendation is mostly irrelevant since it's a required course, but I would definitely recommend it, especially to musicologists, or anyone who is less familiar with what theory is and does.",
    "The music theory proseminar gives a historical survey of music theory since around the turn of the twentieth century. It focuses on how the discipline has formed itself and continues to reform itself. The class focuses more on big-picture concepts than on how to apply theoretical techniques. I would recommend the class, since I think that having an awareness of the history and position of the field is important for anyone in academic music."

   "question_text": "How did this course deepen your knowledge of your discipline\/profession? To what extent did this course contribute to your dissertation\/research?",
   "comments": [
    "This course provided me with useful historical background.",
    "There was a great deal of freedom to select project topics that coincided with individual interests, and this was beneficial for a lot of students.",
    "This class seemed most useful for developing a better understanding of how the discipline developed in its modern institutionalized form, and this was for me the highlight of the seminar.",
    "This course gave me a good idea of the debates that are happening\/have happened in the profession. However, it would have beneficial to include information on what theorists are doing now, and how people use this type of work in recent scholarship. I realize that the presentations at the end of the course served this purpose, but a stronger thread of purpose from September-December would have been incredibly beneficial. I'm not entirely sure how to use the information I learned in this course in my own research, as it wasn't entirely for practical purposes. However, I could see how the content of the course will influence my teaching, and assist in bridging the divides between disciplines in future.",
    "The main virtue of the course was the way it situated current music theory within the modern university system, and taught the history and genesis of that situation--several unpleasant and nonsensical aspects of the discipline as it exists today suddenly made a lot more sense, and thus the road ahead of me became much less threatening. It made me understand that, to fit the modern university model (and gain the precious precious funding that comes therewith), any traditional art must mould itself into sometimes rather unnatural shapes. This creates the strains that I have always been at least somewhat aware of, but with the light of history shined upon them, they do not look quite as overwhelming as they had before. The effect of this upon my future research is mostly on the presentational and methodological side of things, which is as important as anything: I now have a much greater knowledge of the institutional forces that stand between pure, divine Music and callous careerism (the price, of course, of any such careers being available at all), and thus should be better equipped to navigate around them in pursuit of both sides at once.",
    "This course definitely deepened my understanding of the discipline, though I had already taken a related course (more focused on analytical techniques than disciplinary history but dealing with similar issues) in my master's degree coursework. If I had not already been exposed to some of this material, this course would have provided a good introduction to it. As a required overview, it doesn't contribute directly to any research that I am working on, but it exposed me to a lot of readings and methodologies that will be important to know about in general, some of which will almost certainly be valuable for my future research.",
    "The course taught me a lot about the history of the discipline that I hadn't known previously, and the overview of several subfields within music theory was helpful as well. It did not really contribute to my dissertation or research, but the course isn't necessarily supposed to."
