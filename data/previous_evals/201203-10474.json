   "comments": [
    "Yes, i will recommend it.",
    "This is a highly recommended course. While it will require some effort on the student's part, it has a lot to offer both the experimentally and theoretically motivated student.",
    "yes! It is essential for any upcoming scientist who aspires to be successful, as it lays the fundamental groundwork to noise, statistics, probability theory, stochastic process, and delves into the deeper connections between the fields, including a novel look at QM in terms of information theory.",
    "I would recommend this course to other students in physics or many other fields. The provided lecture notes, though not a polished and complete textbook on the material, are also good and the homework problems worthwhile.",
    "Physics 677 is relevant to anyone who works in measuring sensitive signals, which is to say almost all experimentalists and many theorists.",
    "No...Only if they are going to do research in one of the lab's in Becton that is closely related to that field. This was an extremely technical course, one that should not be taken by the cursory student."
