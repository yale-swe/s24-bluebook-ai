    "Only take this class if you want to be an English major, and even then think twice. Such a joke that Yale makes us take this shit as a requirement.",
    "English 125 is a course that covers some major poets from the 1300s to the 1600s. It is a discussion based class that involves a lot of close reading of the text. It has a significant workload with several essays and assignments and blog posts. I would recommend it to someone who enjoys this style of writing and who likes to analyze mostly based on the form of poetry.",
    "1. English 125 isn't as bad as everyone says it is. 2. Glaser is a good professor to take it with. I found his grading to be a little harsh, but class discussion was always good and he definitely made the class a lot more palatable, despite the lack of James Franco in our section.",
    "ENGL 125 seems to act as a filter for the English Department. It certainly did for me. The structure of the course is extremely restrictive and antiquated: you learn the God-given English canon and ignore the poems overt sexism and racism in order to study the poetic devices at play. Theres no room built into the class to take on why the course looks the way it does (and why the English department, by and large, looks the way it does)All that Ive just said is what the course is set up to do: However, you can change it, and, depending on the Prof. you get, actually work around this gross structure. Prof. Glaser is great, and you learn to ask questions beyond the text. I feel like, for many students, this is a continuation of the poetic education they got in high school. But for me, this was all new, and so I did learn the names of formal devices\/types of poems (anaphora, Alexandrine, scansion, etc.). In any case, I guess you need to know a thing in order to critique it. The critique, however, should be part of the learning process. You can make it so, but, you have to actually work to make it so. I wish I had more.",
    "This class is one that you should take really if you have an interest in English as a major and as a subject. You should not choose this as an introductory english course unless you are planning on majoring. As an english Major I loved it. It's complex poetry that is super fun to work out and extremely deep. For me the highlights were Spenser and donne, but I know that most people prefer shakespeare and Chaucer. The papers are extremely reasonable and spread out. A lot of shorter assignments. I wish Professor Glaser did a little bit more \"lecture\" style teaching, I felt like there was too much group work and it could use a little more enlightenment from the professor rather than pulling it out of the students themselves.",
    "tough and engaging. how much you like\/get out of this class depends on the professor."
