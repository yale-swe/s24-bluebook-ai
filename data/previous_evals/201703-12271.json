    "I learned many Spanish basics and feel as though I can have a moderately in depth conversation in Spanish. I came in knowing no Spanish at all, and this course definitely immerses you and forces you to study and become familiar with the vocabulary and grammar.",
    "Professor Alexandrov is great! The course moved really fast, but I felt like we learned a lot of the language in a short period of time.",
    "I learned how to use the language with greater fluency and I learned the importance of speaking each and every day.",
    "I learned the basics of Spanish grammar and a lot of helpful introductory vocabulary. I also learned a lot of interesting information on Spanish, Central American, and Latin American cultures.",
    "I learnt beginners Spanish including how to say things like my name, age, wants etc",
    "This course served as a solid foundation in developing my knowledge and understanding of the Spanish language."

   "comments": [
    "The major weaknesses of the course are the fact most homework just feels like busy work and almost all the students have already taken Spanish before. I was a new Spanish student and felt incredibly intimidated, frustrated, and confused most of the time in class. It is very easy for incoming students to purposely fail the placement exam to get an easy gut class, but that leaves true L1 learners in a terrible place. There must be a better way for prior knowledge to be determined because it just isn't fair to have these advanced speakers in a beginner class. The course does immerse you in Spanish and I do feel like I learned a lot in just a few months.",
    "I felt like more listening and speaking exercises could have been brought into the classroom. Also, the pace of the course made it easy to fall behind. Potentially having more review of past vocabulary and grammar in the midst of new lessons would help reinforce these concepts.",
    "could include more in class practice",
    "I thought the in-class time nd the exposure to spanish was very useful, but occasionally I felt that the homework was more busy work than anything else. The Supersite homework was often unnecessarily difficult.",
    "Professor Alexandrov was very engaging, but I would say that sometimes the amount of busy work assigned was excessive.",
    "I believe this course is engaging because it surrounds you with other Spanish speakers in an environment fostering communication, however I wish the class relied less on textbooks.",
    "I know that based on how the classes are set up in the department, the structure of this class can't change. However, it was too much information, particularly vocabulary, for me to learn all at once. It just felt like it was moving at a faster pace than I could handle, especially coming from Latin where the vocabulary is much less complex or modern and you don't actually speak the language. I think the professors do a lot to try to subsidize the pace of the class with in class activities and Supersite work which I appreciated, but it was still too fast for me.",
    "Best Teacher I had first semester. Course was very well organized, maybe more preparation for the final evaluations throughout the year."

   "comments": [
    "Take this class with professor Alexandrov if she is still teaching. She's the best spanish professor in the department.",
    "For an L1 language class, I guess I would recommend it. It's taught simply, like a middle or high school language class, though the material does move quickly. For a completely new Spanish student, in a room full of students who had taken many years of Spanish before (and bombed the placement for an easy class), it was challenging at best and horribly frustrating at worst.",
    "Yes, take it with Professor Alexandrov. She's incredibly hard working, intelligent, and kind.",
    "If you want to learn spanish well go for it. Just know many people in L1 know Spanish and should not be in it. The class is a shit ton of work, and although spanish is an easier language you still have to put in work for it",
    "absolutely!",
    "Yes. It is a good way to get introduced to Spanish, and I, for one, got really into the language as a result of the course.",
    "Yes. Great intro course and great professor.",
    "Yes, I think this Spanish class is very effective in teaching the basic tenets of the language which are essential in forming the foundations of ones Spanish speaking.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student because I feel like I learned a lot this semester. However, I wouldn't do so without giving them fair warning that the class is fast paced and requires a lot of work.",
    "Absolutely.",
    "Yes I would because you learn a lot of Spanish.",
    "Yes! The fast pace I believe was necessary to cover the amount of info needed for a good foundation in any language."
