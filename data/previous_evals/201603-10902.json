    "This class provided a solid introduction to a whole variety of topics.",
    "Wonderful comprehensive science class at Yale. Definitely gained a much better knowledge of the processes that have led up to the physical world which we now inhabit.",
    "I learned interesting overview information on the origins of things from the big bang to today. Honestly I didn't learn a ton -- the class is set up so that you are never tested\/held accountable for any information except for the one subject you write your paper\/do your presentation on, so I didn't really retain much information beyond the area I became an \"expert\" on. That said, it was interesting to learn a bit about a lot of things (the origins of planets, origins of oceans, origins of life, etc.).",
    "Very good introduction to the scientific history of the world. It's a survey course which touches on quite a few topics related to the universe,planets, climate, humans etc.",
    "I learned more about geology as an academic discipline as well as how to write a scientific paper.",
    "I learned about current theories on how the universe, earth, and animals formed. I learned about the research methods used to formulate these theories and determine facts scientists know about our surroundings. I gained insight into the very small scope humans occupy, both in the universe and in natural history."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The fact that the professor presented and then the student would present a similar, mostly redundant PowerPoint, I found to be quite frustrating. I think there should be more communication about that, and that maybe instead of presenting an overview of the material the student should be assigned a relevant paper to present on. This would decrease redundancy and also allow for a greater level of discussion, as we could also discuss problems we had with the paper's methods or its findings.",
    "Weekly reading and responses definitely pushed me to be engaged in the text and I really liked that each student has a micro-topic on which they must present and write a research paper. However, the twenty page final research paper is very open-ended and for non-science majors can be a bit intimidating- wish there was a bit more direction with it.",
    "This class was a relaxed and pretty wonderful way to do a science credit for non-science people -- its strengths are that the material is really interesting (and even if you aren't interested by something, you only learn about each thing for one class period, so it's not a big deal). You learn about everything from the Big Bang to origins of planets, the oceans, origins of life, and more. It's cool information, and it's a pretty much pressure-free class, because there aren't any tests\/you're never actually held accountable for any information besides for the one origins topic you do your paper\/presentation on. But this is also the weakness -- that it's easy to not actually learn much.",
    "You touch a lot of topics, and each day has a different topic. At times some topics are not that substantial to be covered in one full class slot and presentations can be repetitive.",
    "The format of the class is great, with frequent readings and responses as well as a final paper. The class could be improved by there being more direction regarding the final paper.",
    "This course does a great job of providing a basic overview of pretty much every large scientific event from the Big Bang to the evolution of man. While the multiple write-ups each week can sometimes feel like a lot of work, they also proved essential in making sure that we understood the concepts and could be engaged participants in the subsequent class discussions. The only way I could think to change the course is by considering reversing the order in which the students and Professor Bercovici present each individual topic. Considering that many of the student presentations could be quite basic, they were often just a reiteration of Bercovici's presentation and did not provide much additional information. In those cases, it could have been valuable to have Bercovici follow their presentations, correct any possible errors, and expand upon the basic theories by introducing the more advanced concepts. However, I admit that this is difficult due to the individual nature of the presentations. This would have benefited some of the presentations however there were also presentations that skipped the basic theory and went straight to presenting alternative information.",
    "The course did a good job of covering the material but it did not test us on the material to confirm that we had learned it. There were no quizzes or exams, so there was little pressure to try and understand the material or remember it after the lecture.",
    "This class was very interesting and the readings went in-depth enough to be interesting, but were not too technical that they were boring. The presentations were sometimes a little repetitive, with material being repeated by both the professor and the student, but I think this did make it easier to remember. Most of the discussions consisted of students asking questions and Professor Bercovici answering them, so there wasn't much discussion between students. I'm not sure if this is much of a weakness, after all, Professor Bercovici knows more than the students do, but it might be something to change slightly."

   "comments": [
    "If you are someone who is already knowledgeable about many of these subjects, I would NOT suggest taking this course! I found it to be slightly frustrating how we couldn't delve deep into the nuance of the topics. However, the structure of the course made this necessary; most people were not science majors, and so much of the time was spent explaining basic scientific principles. If you are not a science major, though, this course is perfect for you.",
    "I would recommend the course, especially for non-science\/STEM people. Definitely requires that you put the time in to do the readings and responses and research on your individual topic, but is not daunting in scope or concepts. I feel like I really learned a lot about scientific topics I actually found interesting.",
    "Very solid science credit for non-science people. You learn about a different origins topic every class, from the Big Bang to the origins of humans, write a two-page response paper for every class (sort of time consuming but basically graded for completion), and then do a presentation\/big final paper on one origin topic. Bercovici is a chill guy and class is relaxed and interesting. The downside of the class is that honestly it's easy to not learn much at all\/not get much out of the class -- you're never accountable for any information besides for your assigned topic (there aren't any tests) so I ended up just skimming the reading\/not feeling like I had to be really engaged in class. The other downside is that the structure of the class itself is just not well led\/thought out-- in each 90 min class, Bercovici spent around the first 40 mins lecturing about whatever the origin topic of the day was; then, one student presenter did their presentation for around 30 mins - on the same exact topic that Bercovici just presented, frequently repeating exactly what he said - and then we asked Bercovici questions about the topic for around 20 mins. So you don't really engage much and you get the same info twice, and then never actually have a discussion (just ask questions). That said, Bercovici is cool and the material is interesting -- definitely a painless science credit.",
    "I really enjoyed taking this course and I would highly recommend it to other students. For each class, we would read about 10 pages of the instructor's book, 1-2 short scientific articles, and write a brief 1-2 page response. This usually took about 1-1.5 hours, and the class met twice a week. Class time was split between our professor lecturing, a student presentation, and discussion time. The seminar style of the course was excellent as everyone had the opportunity to talk and ask questions each class. This class is engaging and interesting regardless of how much geology background you have - take it before you graduate.",
    "Stay away if youre looking for a gut. Otherwise you really learn a lot and the workload is manageable. 2 reading responses a week and a 20-30 page final paper.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone with a non-science background who wishes to chronologically learn about the formation of life and the universe.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to any student - science major or not. If you put in the work each week to do the readings and participate in class discussions, you will gain so much knowledge on the history and evolution of the Universe, ultimately narrowing down on how humans came to be here. It is a manageable yet amazing way to learn a substantial amount about the Universe, the Earth, and the leading theories on how everything came to be the way that it is. Not to mention, Professor Bercovici is an incredible professor. He is extremely knowledgeable about all of the topics and conducts the class in a very relaxed and fun manner. The round-table and conversational setup allows for literally any question that you may have to be answered.",
    "This is a good class to take if you are a non-STEM student looking for a SC credit. There are no exams or quizzes. Instead, the work consists of a 1-2 page reading response for each class, a 20 minute presentation, and a 20 page final paper on the same topic as your presentation. It's fairly straightforward and the lectures can be interesting, so I would recommend taking this class if you can get in. Be warned, however, that there is almost no feedback on your grades throughout the semester.",
    "This class is really cool if you are curious about the history of earth and the universe. It is made up of short summaries of each reading, a student presentation, class discussions, and a final paper. Each class begins with Professor Bercovici's presentation, followed by a student presentation, and then a discussion of the topic, which usually consists of students picking Professor Bercovici's brain. The topics are very interesting and Professor Bercovici is very good at answering almost any question thrown at him, everything from the beginning of the universe to the start of mankind, which makes for an engaging class discussion."
