   "comments": [
    "Class was great. The topics are really amazing and the professor gives all the students an opportunity to discuss issues related to the class topics.",
    "Excellent course and the class was tailored around our individual interests which makes it fun, appealing, and applied - No weaknesses",
    "The course was very unique and deviates from a traditional science class. The weekly writing assignment and discussion challenged students to think outside the box and apply physiological principles to real world public health issues and problems. Similarly, the take home assignments encouraged creativity and were actually enjoyable to complete. For weaknesses, I felt there should have been at least one in-class objective evaluation (i.e. exam). While I learned much from this course, I did not learn as much actual physiology because the class frankly did not require one to do so. It is the responsibility of the student to learn all the material presented in a course; however, practically throughout a busy semester there is often only enough time to learn what is actually required from the course. An exam would be helpful in this regard.",
    "Different perspective of the usual physiology class.",
    "Great course. Taught at a high and integrative level, making it very interesting and educational. However, this is, in a way, also the greatest weakness of the course. Most of the students have not taken a basic physiology course, so much of the material went over our heads. A basic text or online reference would be very useful as reading prior to each class. Overall, I highly recommend it. I have never had a 2 hour class go so quickly or hold my attention so well.",
    "Excellent.",
    "A broad physiology course, covering pertinent organs and functions and relating them to current public health issues and debates. It would be useful to walk into lectures with more background knowledge (for those who are biology lacking), but class discussions are easy to keep up with if you've done your background work. Taking Nutrition&Chronic Disease epi is a great complement to this course, as many topics overlap, but are presented in a much different manner.",
    "This was a WONDERFUL course. Dr. Yeckel does a wonderful job of integrating physiology with public health concepts. This class encourages \"out of the box\" thinking and provides a comfortable atmosphere for creative and innovative sharing of ideas.",
    "Honestly, I don't have enough great things to say about this course. Professor Yeckel makes this course. Without her it would just be good. With her it is inspiring, interesting, fun, and VERY useful. I love it!",
    "The course does a good job in presenting physiology within a public health context. I appreciated the freedom to explore topics that interested me in each assignment.",
    "Great class!",
    "My main gripe for this course is that it lacked focus. And while I am in support of independent learning, Professor Yeckel's course takes this to extremes. Students are given weekly written assignments that only tenuously relate to the lectures given the same week. Only half the alotted class time is spent on the lectures (which focus almost purely on the science of physiology) and the rest is spent on mandatory discussions of topics that may or may not relate to the topics of the lectures given on the same day. I say \"mandatory discussions\" because everyone is forced to participate; it does not matter if you are hiding in a corner because you WILL be called upon to share whatever brilliant thoughts you may have. Overall, I feel the course could benefit tremendously through tighter integration of material presented in the lecture and the written assignments. This way, students will be better able to retain the science presented during lectures.",
    "A definitive strength of this course was the fact that physiology was examined under a public health context. We learned how different systems worked and then researched public health issues concerning these various systems. Physiology can be very indepth and this gave a great overview of important aspects of different systems in the body.",
    "Strengths: One assignment per week.Weaknesses: In the beginning, the directions for the assignments could have had better clarification as to what the format and purpose were supposed to be. Also, there was so much physiology given to us during lecture, yet the professor didn't want us to focus on the powerpoint slides. I disliked how we were told not to get too involved in memorizing the slides and to focus more on the broad scope of things - yet when midterms and finals came around, we were given such specific questions to answer - questions that involved having an in-depth knowledge of physiology.",
    "The course material was interesting and relevant to public health. I really enjoyed this class. The structure of the course (half lecture, half discussion) was a great format and made for a great learning experience, and it got everyone involved! I liked the format of the weekly assignments\/quizzes\/tests because they were open-ended and allowed me to research material on my own; this really gave more breadth and depth to my understanding of physiology."

    "Instructor: Catherine Yeckel \u00a0Great! She is very enthusiastic about the course and does and awesome job",
    "Instructor: Catherine Yeckel \u00a0Excellent professor - willing and eager to teach. You can tell the difference between a professor who just lectures from a professor who truly enjoys engaging with the students.",
    "Instructor: Catherine Yeckel \u00a0Very informative during lecture, and gave great feedback on assignments.",
    "Instructor: Catherine Yeckel \u00a0Dr. Yeckel does a great job summarizing basic principles that a public health worker should understand!",
    "Instructor: Catherine Yeckel \u00a0Dr. Yeckel is a wonderful professor. She is extremely engaging and I have never had a professor care so much about making sure that her students succeed. If she thinks you need any extra guidance on an assignment she will go out of her way to meet with you and bring you up to speed. She is also brilliant and very much at the cutting edge of her field. Dr. Yeckel provides a fresh perspective in the EHS department, where many of the other professors work on similar issues.",
    "Instructor: Catherine Yeckel \u00a0Dr. Yeckel is an excellent instructor. She held dynamic classes that pushed students to discuss and apply knowledge. She was also very understanding of students and wonderfully accommodating to any circumstances that arose. One of the better instructors in the department hands down.",
    "Instructor: Catherine Yeckel \u00a0Dr. Yeckel is incredibly passionate and caring instructor. She really cares about the topics and her students and makes the course very reasonable. My only critique is that she wasn't always aware if students were keeping up with the information being presented, but otherwise, I enjoyed listening to her lectures.",
    "Instructor: Catherine Yeckel \u00a0Dr. Yeckel is FANTASTIC!!! She is so enthusiastic about what she's teaching and really cares about her students. I was unable to make it to class one afternoon and she offered to set up a time to give me an entire make-up lecture. Wonderful!",
    "Instructor: Catherine Yeckel \u00a0AMAZING. Catherine Yeckel is the ultimate superstar. She is wonderful, energetic, interesting, fun, and VERY smart. I really enjoyed her class. I was out sick and she was unbelievably accomodating. She asks really interesting questions in class and really prompts student discussion and learning. I am so glad I took this course and had opportunity to study with her. She rocks.",
    "Instructor: Catherine Yeckel \u00a0The instructor is very passionate and enthusiastic, which made lecture both interesting and enjoyable. She truly cares about the students and frequently went the extra mile to support students with assignment feedback and make-up classes.",
    "Instructor: Catherine Yeckel \u00a0She was absolutely wonderful. Always had time for all the students, really pushed us to think for ourselves.",
    "Instructor: Catherine Yeckel \u00a0I pay tens of thousands of dollars a year to be here, and I'm not allowed to view the grades I've worked so hard to earn until I fill out this survey? Is this some sort of joke? Anyway, back on topic. Professor Yeckel seemed very enthusiastic and knowledgeable on the topics presented. She is also quick to reply to email. Every single question I have asked her have been replied to within the same day the questions were asked. That is impressive.",
    "Instructor: Catherine Yeckel \u00a0Professor Yeckel was amazing! She was very knowledgable on many of the public health issues concerning different body systems. She also encouraged us to incoporate our interests into how we evaluated a public health issue.She was very dedicated. I missed one class due to illness and she gave me a personal make-up session to ensure that I didn't miss any vital information. GREAT PROFESSOR!!!",
    "Instructor: Catherine Yeckel \u00a0Strengths: the professor was very enthusiastic about teaching the course.Weaknesses: the weakness was due to the course and the way it was presented. Too much information on the slides was presented to us.",
    "Instructor: Catherine Yeckel \u00a0She is an engaging lecturer and I think she ran the course well. I liked how she structured the classes and assignments so that we (the students) would get more out of the class and were able to explore our personal interests in greater detail. This made the class more interesting and relevant for each student."

    "FUN! It is a really intersting course! Iloved it. The more work you put into it, the more you'll get out of it, but you won't be sorry you took it!!!!",
    "This class is a great way to look at physiology from a public health standpoint. I would highly recommend it.",
    "I would describe this course as a coursethat examines public health issues by dissecting the various physiological issues that are the root of individual health issues and then evolve into public health issues.",
    "No, I would not recommend this course to someone in YSPH, unless they wanted a light-load course for the majority of the semester. Otherwise, I did not learn a lot as expected, and I would have spent my hours in lecture sitting in another class.",
    "It's a great class and you can explore your own interests in physiology in greater depth within the framework of the course. So if you have an interest in physiology, I would highly recommend this course."
