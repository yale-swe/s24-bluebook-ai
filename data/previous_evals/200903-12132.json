    "Yes.",
    "This is an amazing class, but I think everyone knows this about Prof. Freeman's classes. Definitely take a class with her, whether it is a lecture or a seminar. There is a lot of reading, but it is great. There is not a lot of work throughout the semester, but the final 20 page paper sneaks up on you quicker than you might think. Luckily, Prof. Freeman gives you great feedback on the draft, and once the semester is over, you feel like you have really accomplished something great. This class also offers great preparation for the senior essay, which is useful to both juniors and first-semester seniors.",
    "I really enjoyed taking the class with Professor Freeman. The material is really cool and insightful, and not very challenging. The paper is long - 20-25 pages, but it's not bad because you have to hand in a rough draft midway through the semester that she edits and gives really helpful comments on. Makes writing the final A LOT easier. Reading is very doable. Other than that, no additional work.",
    "Take it if you can get in! A great class, especially if you have never written a 25 page paper before. You won't regret that it is due before reading week. Professor Freeman is very helpful and the material is very interesting.",
    "I'd recommend it! Especially if you're into American history, but even if you're not it's a great way to learn about it, and to prepare for your senior thesis. Early due dates for your prospectus and rough draft might seem daunting but they help you out in the long run.",
    "An excellent look at early American politics. If you know you don't like this period of history, obviously the course isn't for you. But if you're not sure, or you think you might be interested, then go for it. Prof. Freeman is an excellent professor, the reading is almost all really interesting, and the class discussions are engaging and well worth your time.",
    "TAKE IT",
    "Excellent history seminar with enthusiastic input from the instructor. As noted by many others, the rough draft of the paper is due early on, which you'll be thankful for come finals week. Interesting and mostly manageable load of reading. Will give you a deeper and more nuanced understanding of the founding period.",
    "I would 100% recommend it if you have any interest in the period, and perhaps would recommend it if you just wanted a great seminar that teaches you how to write a primary source research paper. It's definitely manageable and 90% of the reading was fun and interesting. A great way to see the personal side of the foundations of American politics.",
    "Take this class. Prof. Freeman is awesome and the reading is too. The paper draft is due early so be aware, but it helps in terms of your overall courseload.",
    "Yes - and emphatically so. If you want to learn to write a long research paper, take this class. Prof. Freeman advises you on your sources, evaluates your prospectus, line edits your rough draft, and then returns your final paper with detailed criticisms and comments. You would be hard-pressed to find a seminar leader in any of Yale's departments more committed to helping his or her students perfect the research and writing process. The course reading is interesting and seminar discussion is often lively and fun. I feel that I now have a good grasp of how politics worked in early national America. Also, because this class is so popular, it tends to attract particularly engaged students. But, above all, take this class for Prof. Freeman - it would be nice if all serious History majors had the opportunity to work with her before they graduate.",
    "Eh.",
    "I would definitely recommend it to ANYONE who is interested in American history and learning how to write a good history paper. The course gives you a really good, nuanced look at the foundations of American political culture. Professor Freeman is awesome--passionate, knowledgeable, engaging, and approachable. She is very personally invested and instructive throughout the paper-writing process.",
    "Great books. Great professor. Great subject matter. However, as is the case in every seminar you take, it depends on your fellow students.",
    "Everyone else is going to tell you that this is an amazing course with an awesome professor. I argue that this is a good course with a good professor. It is a good experience to write a 25 page research paper, but Professor Freeman is not that good of a discussion leader and does not provide helpful feedback on your paper. If you are interested in the time period, its worth taking and you will enjoy it, but its definitely not the best class at Yale."
