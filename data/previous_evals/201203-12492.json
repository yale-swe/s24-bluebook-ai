    "I would recommend Kiswahili if you're looking for a language class that is neither particularly difficult or particularly easy. It's also great if you want to meet a diverse group of students since half of the class is composed of graduate students.",
    "To anyone who needs to fulfill three semesters of a language requirement: take this class. I was one semester away from being finished with my requirement, but the dark woes of the German department scared me away. I turned to the glorious light known as Kiswahili. This class is fun (you sing songs), the grammar is super easy (Kiswahili makes a lot of sense, unlike German, English, Russian etc.), and Mwalimu Kiarie is an AMAZING teacher. So yeah, I can't think of a better way to spend three semesters at Yale. Also, the class isn't too difficult which is an added bonus to it being fun and light hearted.",
    "Fun course! If you want to learn Swahili, take it",
    "It's an incredible class. You will not only become close to the professor, but to your classmates. I think that it's important to have one small class among your lecture courses. It really makes the difference.",
    "I LOVE this class. Mwalimu Kiarie has been teaching it for over ten years and loves it. Swahili isn't a very complicated language, and this class is really fun because:a) Mwalimu is hilarious. He pretends not to understand American culture even though he's been here over a decade.b) You get to learn about East African culture as you learn the language.c) It's interactive. Silly songs, presenting dialogues with a classmate, buying and selling meat aka little plastic animals... It's quality.Especially if you get a good group of people, it's a really fun class. We've got five great grad students and ten or so undergrads, including a few pretty goofy ones.As far as assessments go, you have more homeworks at the beginning of the semester, and those are graded. You have a \"quiz\" aka test every week for 4-5 weeks (theoretically the whole semester but that kind of failed), a midterm, and a final. The midterm is cumulative, and, at least for us, the final was only on the material on which we hadn't yet been tested (which was a lot since we went a little too slow throughout the semester.)You'll love Swahili. You'll love Mwalimu. You'll probably love your classmates. Just take it.And use Quizlet with your classmates."
