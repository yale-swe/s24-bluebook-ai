    "I enjoyed this course, though at times the details in the readings seemed overwhelming. As I noted above, I found the course to be most effective once Prof. Adorno implemented the close reading strategy of assigning specific passages to specific students--especially because each passage was tailored to each student's interests."

   "comments": [
    "This was my most demanding course this semester; I dedicated more time to this seminar paper than I did to all of my other assignments from this semester combined. I share that not as a complaint, but simply as a comment, because I do truly believe that this course allowed me to grow in new and exciting ways as a scholar--thanks in large part to Prof. Adorno's detailed critiques of my work. However, I would advise prospective students to take this course only if they have time for it (as I did); this course would not have worked as well for me with a heavier course load. That stated, my seminar paper was not directly related to my dissertation research, though it provided me with a firmer understanding of the \"Age of Revolutions\" which served as the foundation for Latin America's formative nineteenth century. I am sure that I will revisit my seminar paper at some point, whether over the summer or in the near future, as I prepare my Master's thesis for publication. In sum, Prof. Adorno's comments on my \"extracurricular\" work were some of the most detailed which I have received thus far, and for that, I am grateful."
