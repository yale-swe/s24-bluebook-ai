   "comments": [
    "I definitely recommend this course to another student. I was very hesitant to continue with Italian after L4, but I can't express how I happy I am that I did. Anna makes the class so fun, and the atmosphere facilitates conversation and story telling. Great class!",
    "This class is fun and easy. There are no tests and your grade is based on participation and your compositions. However, be wary of which teacher you choose. Some aren't really concerned with teaching or improving your writing. If you're using this class to further your Italian skills make sure the professor doesn't just watch Italian music videos in class.",
    "I almost didn't take this class, because I thought it wouldn't be useful and because I thought I wouldn't have time for it, since I was taking so many other classes. It ended up being the class I was most excited about\u0097it was always fun, and I feel like it really helped my Italian skills.",
    "ITAL 150 was a purely conversational class. Everything we did was spoken, and I loved that. If we wrote an essay, we would discuss about it. If we saw a movie, we would discuss about it. I believe we wrote 10 compositions, but they weren't very long (350 words each I believe). The final consisted of writing a 600 word composition. Overall, it was just a really fun class that I would happily take again.",
    "Yes. If you want to learn Italian, take this class.",
    "Very informal study but a good way to familiarize yourself with some good Italian literature and film. Not as much oral practice as L4, but probably because it only meets three times a week, which was nice.",
    "I would recommend this course if you are looking for an L5 or want to keep your italian alive. Not too much work and discussion everyday in class. Take it with Anna if you can, class work and energy depends a lot on the professor.",
    "Take this class if you want to keep up with Italian and want a bridge between harder L5 classes and L4. But don't expect to learn too much about Italian literature or improve dramatically with your compositions. I definitely know a little more about contemporary Italian culture, though.",
    "This is a good course to take if you want to practice your Italian. It's not too strenuous. The biggest assignments are a composition a week. It's fun and interesting."
