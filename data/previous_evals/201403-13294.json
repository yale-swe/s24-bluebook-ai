    "This was an amazing history course! The topics were all related to mobility in California, but covered varied ground - racial hierarchies, immigration, labor history, and more. Moreover, in this class we learned that the history of Latinos in 20th century California is connected with the histories of various other ethnic groups. Also, the projects for this class were really fun over all! Instead of writing papers, you write a series of blogs. These assignments were challenging in some respects, but it's definitely rewarding to see your work in digital format once it's completed - plus, you get to share your work with other students and scholars all across the internet if you'd like! Discussions are always interesting if you take the time to do the readings! Overall, a great ER&M\/HIST course!!"
