   "comments": [
    "441 is similar to 440, except that you specifically focus on the Hydrogen atom, perturbations to the hydrogen atom (hyperfine splitting, relativistic correction,etc), a hydrogen molecule, helium, two electrons, etc. The format of the course is similar to 440 with weekly psets and one midterm and one final, but instead of those pop quizzes you give a presentation at the end of class on a topic that the professor picks out for you. The homeworks aren't bad; I would say they are a little bit harder than the 440 psets, but most of them are still Griffiths problems. The exams are a lot easier, but that also means that the curve is more difficult. After the midterm he told us that a 93 overall grade would be the minimum for an A-. He's a better teacher than McKinsey, but he also teaches straight out of the textbook so you could read that instead if you would like. Overall, I enjoyed it because quantum is interesting, so take it if you like quantum or if you are doing the intensive major.",
    "This class is interesting, but doesn't actually cover much material. I sometimes object to a professor lecturing about one topic and assigning reading on a completely different topic, but I this case, Prof. Nagai went too far in the opposite direction. Most of the lectures were purely out of Griffiths which is already pretty easy to understand. I wish it covered more, but I'm happy with how rigorously and formally I learned the subjects that were covered.",
    "A good class for physics majors. Im not an intensive major, but I found the course extremely interesting and cool and would recommend it as a good learning experience. Electrons and orbitals are way more complicated than you ever expected. Be warned that it will be a lot of work, especially later in the semester. Thats not a joke. I would NOT recommend taking this at the same time as PHYS 420, since both classes are a lot of work.",
    "This class is a continuation of 440, with emphasis on applications (especially the hydrogen atom). The material is, frankly, a bit dry. A lot of the work in the class focuses on fairly tedious derivations, and there's not much new in the way of elegant theory (except for the variational principle, which is pretty neat). Nagai is a great professor, but he can only do so much to spice up the course. I wouldn't take this course unless you're a physics major or love (love!) hydrogen (and its fine structure).",
    "A fantastic course! Very difficult, very through, gives you a great background in the physics around the hydrogen atom model up to some multi-body models. Especially if it's taught by Dr. Nagai again (one of the best professors at Yale; always willing to answer question and a brilliant guy), I would definitely take it.",
    "Much more interesting that 440 in my opinion. Nagai is also a great professor (especially following McKinsey who is not always the clearest). You'll spend a lot of time perturbing the hydrogen atom, but that's actually pretty interesting and leads to the prediction of some neat phenomena that we observe in astronomy and other areas of physics. Much more than in 440, I felt like I left this class really understanding quantum mechanics at a deep level and having an intuitive sense of it.",
    "Great class, much better than 440 and somewhat easier too",
    "You basically learn quantum mechanics of the hydrogen atom.",
    "This made much more sense that Quantum I. The textbook is helpful, the course very well taught. Up to the first midterm the workload is very manageable, but it then picks up and some p-sets turn out to be very challenging (but also very educating).",
    "I mean, it's a fine course. Nothing too mindblowing. I definitely wouldn't recommend it to someone who isn't an intensive physics major, and if you're an intensive physics major, you have to take it anyways, so it's kind of a moot point.",
    "Quantum 2 is pretty good. You spend a lot of time talking about the hydrogen atom and various techniques used in 3D. Unfortunately, we didn't get to talk too much about some of the cooler topics and applications of quantum mechanics (beyond chapter 4 in Griffiths). Nagai is a good lecturer and explains things clearly, but follows the book very closely. I also found that the problem sets were very heavy on algebra, and often times the problems weren't very interesting.",
    "This class is a great companion to PHYS 440, as it focuses on applications of the foundations built in that class to real-world systems like the Hydrogen atom. It can sometimes feel a little tedious, but at the end of the class you'll be pleased at your readiness to understand real research in physics, physical chemistry, etc. I would say that it's a bit easier than 440, if only because the ideas aren't so radically new. Professor Nagai was a very able lecturer, and managed to strike a good balance between mathematical rigor and conceptual motivation. He was also very organized, and I always felt like the class had a clear narrative. The class culminates with student presentations about more advanced topics, viewed through the lens of everything you've learned. Although I was initially skeptical, they were low-stress and actually a really satisfying way to end the course; you can understand some pretty cool things with the tools this class gives you. Psets aren't terrible, mostly 5-10 hours a week.",
    "I would say the course is not worth taking unless you need to take it. It's not mathematically rigorous enough to allow you to understand the foundations of the subject, and it's also not conceptual enough to allow you to gain a sense of its physical meaning. The homework is mostly tedious algebra and integration."
