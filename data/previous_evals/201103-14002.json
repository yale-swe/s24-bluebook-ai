    "Take it! Don't think twice! If you have some knowledge of Spanish and are deciding between continuing with your Spanish of taking another language, then I highly recommend Portuguese! Trust me, I would know. The classes are fun, the workload is light (yet you still manage to learn a lot in a short period of time), and the exams are stress-free.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to any one interested in learning another language. It is fun and easy, especially for Spanish speakers.",
    "If you speak a Romance language and want to learn Portuguese, definitely take it. The language is beautiful, the class is entertaining, and the teacher is fun. I wouldn't think about taking any other language at Yale.",
    "Definitely!",
    "Light workload with incredible payoffs. Introductory Portuguese and French are undoubtedly two of the best courses taught at Yale.",
    "Wonderful class. Very low stress; come to class ready to participate and you're golden.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to anybody interested in Brazil, an emerging power and a country with an interesting culture and history. You learn a lot about Brazil and its people, its culture, and its traditions. Portuguese is a beautiful language and prior knowledge of a Romance language is very helpful, but not necessary.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. There's not a lot of work and Marta is really good. That said, you get much more out of this class by doing the work. By the end of the class, I guarantee you will be able to speak basic Portuguese.",
    "Portuguese is a very fun language to learn. As a spanish native speaker, I still found the class very interesting and it did not require too much effort. I would definitely recommend this class to anyone looking to fulfill the language requirement. The best things about it is that because it is rather easy to pick up one reaches a relative conversational level quite easily which makes it more fun than frustrating.",
    "Awesome class, 100% recommended. Portuguese is really fun, and the workload is light (although class is every day). There's more of a focus on speaking and interacting in class, rather than on repetitive exercises and homework. If you know Spanish, you'll pick up the language really quickly.",
    "Easy and fun: Marta is adorable and encouraging, lot of interesting people in class, less daily work compared to other language classes like Spanish L1, but decent amount of Portuguese is taught by the end of L1. Also, quite a lot of emphasis on Brazilian culture and history, and I found it very interesting - so thoroughly enjoyed this class!"
