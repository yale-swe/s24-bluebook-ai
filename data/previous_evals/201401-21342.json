   "comments": [
    "If you need an upper level elective, definitely take this. Relaxed, open-book tests, and you learn a lot.",
    "The class offers relevant up to date information from a very well qualified professor. The material encompasses the latest studies from a critical lens that often points out the weaknesses and opportunities for improvement for the research. My only negative for the class was its 9am start time, but I still have no regrets taking the course. The open note format for the exams allow one to spend more time focusing on understanding the material rather than memorizing tedious details.",
    "A perfect course for anyone with an interest in science and research. Super low-stress in terms of workload, as long as you attend lecture. This was one of my favorite courses at Yale. Tests are well-written and an extremely fair assessment of your understanding of the course material.",
    "This class was very chill but also very informative. Professor Kyriakides was engaging and clearly knew his stuff. I would prefer the classes to have more structure but we spent a lot of time doing lit review so it wasn't apparently what the subject of each class was until the end. The tests were very reasonable and people who came to class could generally all do well.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. Light workload, but you learn a lot. I really liked that it didn't focus on memorizing facts. It was more about interpreting journal articles. The midterm and final were very straightforward. Take this class!",
    "Biomaterials is a very interesting class. It is on material that is very new and current in today's research. It is lecture format with three exams that are not cumulative and are open note. I would definitely recommend this class.",
    "It's a course looking at past and recent developments in biological engineering and technology.",
    "Yes, take it. Not much work at all, but one exam slip up will cost you. They are all open-note and from lectures, so be sure to get up and go to lecture at 9am. If you can't do not take the class. Be very organized with your notes for the exam. take time to make sure you know where things are prior to the exam for easy access.",
    "This is definitely a great upper level elective for BME, especially if you are in the molecular engineering track. Professor Kyriakides was the best. Exams were fair but the TAs were a bit harsh on grading. Overall one of the better taught BME classes that I have taken. Be warned that you need to be able to wake up early for a 9AM class and take good notes.",
    "Easy class-3 open note exams. However, realize that it is very bio heavy. If you are looking for a more quant engineering course, this isn't it.",
    "Good class without too much work but getting an A will be difficult unless you already know a lot about the field. Start it credit\/D, and see how you do on tests.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone interested in tissue engineering or implant design. The course discusses in depth the foreign body response and many methods in which researchers have tried to improve biomaterials. I found it really interesting. The Professor's lectures are engaging and both the Teacher and the T.A's are open to questions and very patient.",
    "This class is gives an overview in the field of biomaterials. There is not much work in this class, but do take good notes, because the tests are all open note.",
    "Fantastic course. I'd recommend it easily to anybody--Professor Kyriakides is a top-notch professor, enormously witty, and somebody you can always talk to about the simplest\/most basic questions. Even if it's an early class, it's worth it--the tests are fairly straightforward, and open-notes. However, they do require very good notes from you, which means you have to be paying attention for the entire lecture (something hard to do at 9 AM at times). However, the quality of teaching makes it worth it, and it's one of the best courses I've taken at Yale.",
    "The class was informative, and we covered some interesting papers. Professor Kyriakides isn't exactly friendly and really promotes his own research, which is certainly understandable but can be a bit frustrating and negative. There isn't a ton of outside work, and attending lecture is important. Studying with friends can be helpful for exams to make sure you didn't miss anything in class."
