    "the bulk of this course goes into the projects you do for clients in DC. this is a TON of work, but worth it if you get a project and\/or client you want.",
    "the course is unorganized and the requirements to complete not one but two clinical policy research projects is overly demanding and unnecessary. i would recommend that students only be required to complete one research project, which would result in better quality work and a better experience for students and their clients.",
    "I really enjoyed this course and learned an enormous amount. Jim Lyons is a great guy and has a lot of wonderful stories to tell, and brought in some great guest speakers. However class time is really not the valuable part of the course, it's the two projects that you work on with outside clients and with Jim's guidance. Jim provides clear and sufficient advice on these projects and pushes you to do well, but otherwise you're on your own to research and answer a policy question posed by an outside client. This means that there was almost no work for the class before spring break, as we were choosing projects, making contact with our clients, and dawdling on research. It's hard to stop researching and start writing, and so the workload over the last three weeks of the semester was absolutely unbearably tremendous--allnighter after allnighter to get the work produced. The experience of giving the presentations, however, was great (I rated the field trip organization as low despite terrific effort by Kate because the first trip to DC coincided with Snowmaggedon and everything got canceled and communication was really tough).",
    "Question 1-There could have been better reading materials regarding the discussion subjects for each class. A well structured class could have tremendous benefits on student projects. Readings could have been selected to prepare the students for invited speakers. There is a lot of potential here.",
    "4 - Two projects is overwhelming, particularly when responsibilities are not shared equally due to differences in expertise.",
    "This course was all about the client projects, which were incredibly valuabe. First of all, Jim was able to put together a long list of fascinating projects with various DC-based organizations and agencies -- an impressive task that few other professors would ever be able to do. The two projects I worked on were related to interesting and timely natural resource policy issues. It was a treat to work for a client on a real-world problem when most of my other courses are obscured in academic abstraction. I greatly enjoyed both of my groups and both of my clients. I loved this course and would recommend it to anyone."

    "somehow forcing students to do more of their projects in the first half of the semester so they don't take over our lives at the end",
    "I don't feel that the instructor is entirely invested in the students' having a positive experience. I also think that requiring multiple trips to DC for client meetings is totally unnecessary. One trip at most should be all that is required of the students.",
    "It would be great if it could get moving faster at the beginning of the semester. I did not end up meeting either of my clients in person at the beginning of the work, and ended up feeling that while it would have been great to do so we did findwith connecting by phone. Maybe the semester could be kicked off on the phone so that scheduling is easier and projects can start sooner?",
    "Reading assignments for specific classes, and the structure of class time, can be improved upon.",
    "One project would be better.",
    "It needs to be more than 3 credits...it is a ton of work to do an adequate job on 2 projects",
    "the workload was a lot for this class - it was hard to balance having two projects and do a good job on both."

    "PICK YOUR GROUPS CAREFULLY. they will make or break your semester.",
    "Group work was essential for this class, the workload would be unmanageable withoutit. Working in groups is what you will be doing in a real work env.",
    "The fact that we each had two groups to manage was REALLY frustrating. Students should be required to pass some sort of writing test before taking classes like this. I had one team mate who really couldn't write and couldn't hold up his end of the bargain. This put a lot of pressure on the rest of the team.",
    "Advantages--better quality and more depth to the projects.Disadvantage--group writing and review takes a lot more time than working on your own.",
    "Both of my teams were fantastic. Very diverse backgrounds and interests, but committed, extremely responsive, collaborative rapport from all team members.",
    "Lack of expertise of partners. Took on lots of responsibility vis-a-vis my partners. Again, I could have handled this for one project, but two was overwhelming.",
    "Real life experience working for clients as a team rather than individual. It can be very difficult but also very rewarding",
    "team member evaluations should have been conducted! Some people do more work than others. The prof\/TA\/client do not necessarily know about the internal workings of a group."

    "Start and finish researching early!",
    "Be very careful when choosing your project, and your team members. Although I had a great experience with my teams, I did hear from other class members that not all team members were as responsive and collaborative. Choose an organization that you might see yourself working with. Since there are two projects, it may be helpful to pick a project you are very familiar with, and a project you are not very familiar with, to both further your expertise and try something completely different.",
    "Be prepared to work a lot, and dont just pick projects that look cool, pick TEAM members that you trust have the capacity and will to contribute as much as you.",
    "It is a lot of work so make sure at least one of your other classes has a relatively light load. Pick your teams\/topics carefully as that will make or break the experience. This was a great class.",
    "Choose two projects you are passionate about or really interested in. Don't base the decision solely on where you want to build connections.If you have a choice between different teams - choose people who are reliable and hardworking."
