   "comments": [
    "Take it.",
    "Absolutely take this class, even if you've never done poetry before. Yale doesn't have many opportunities for students to take creative writing courses without an application, and this is a great opportunity to learn about poetry without the stress of being expected to be an expert. Regardless of how much poetry you've studied (or haven't) you'll walk away with a treasure trove of knowledge.",
    "I definitely recommend this class! Be prepared to overhaul how you conceive of yourself as a poet, but you will leave this course much more focused and prepared to write on your own.",
    "This is a really nice introductory course to poetry. As someone who did not have much experience with poetry before, this course felt perfect in terms of level. I would absolutely recommend this class.",
    "I loved this course. Being exposed to so much poetry, and writing it for myself for the first time, brought me profound joy. I mean it when I say it changed my life in many ways. It helped birth a love of poetry and a new form of creative expression that I will treasure and embrace for the rest of my life. I am so glad I took this class with Professor Gorin. It is a course that is good for the soul.",
    "If you are afraid of putting your (possibly terrible) poems on a Google Doc for all of your (13 or so) peers to see, some of whom are possibly already professional poets and are very intimidating but most of whom probably feel the same as you, then you might not take this class. Otherwise, I highly, highly recommend Reading Poetry for Craft.",
    "ENGL 135 was a wonderfully taught class with an expansive reading list (from Shakespeare to contemporary works) and insightful workshops. Professor Gorin made the class really great. He was incredibly helpful in class and in our individual workshops and invested in each and every student. I appreciated his prudent comments and suggestions and know I have become a better reader and maker of poetry from them. I read works that I wouldn't encounter on a usual basis, and I learned more because of this. The workload is not bad a poem every week, revisions along the way, and a 7-9 page final paper. ENGL 135 is a must-take class for anyone with even the slightest interest in writing poetry.",
    "If you want to get into the world of contemporary poetry as a reader and a writer, this is your course. You write a poem a week, which is not too difficult, and you read a ton of really kick-ass poets who are writing now. The course also forces you to start a notebook habit, which has only been a blessing to me. It also makes you attend poetry readings, which seems like a burden at first, but ends up being really interesting- you get to see how artists present their works. If you are new to poetry, don't shy away! This course has a workshop in which you will learn what works about your poetry, and what needs more work. Overall, I really enjoyed it, and would recommend it to anyone curious about or already in love with poetry."
