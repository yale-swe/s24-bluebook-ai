   "comments": [
    "I would recommend French 610 to any student interested in medieval French literature, as it trained us in the skills of paleography, translation, and Old French grammar. As a graduate student outside the French department, I feel that this course also provided a nice complement to my studies of the medieval period beyond France.",
    "This class is a requirement for my program, which makes this a bit of a moot question. I would recommend it to someone with an interest in Medieval Studies, however.",
    "I would recommend the course. If a student is studying French literature, knowledge of Old French is important. In French 610 01, we learned how to translate Old French as it appears in La Mort Artu.",
    "Yes. It is an essential skill for medievalists.",
    "Each class involves translating King Arthur from a Beinecke MS. Interesting reading and a good way to pick up OF quickly, particularly if you've had a lot of experience with modern French already.",
    "French 610 consists in the reading of an Old French manuscript and, as such, in the gradual learning of this particular text's vocabulary and syntax."

   "comments": [
    "I am not a graduate student in the French department, so this course will not factor directly into my own research. However, it did offer me a point of comparison with other medieval literatures and enhanced my own field of study.",
    "It provided useful historical context and helped deepen my understanding of French as a language, as well as French literary history. I am mostly interested in 20th-century French literature, however, so in that respect, its relevance was limited.",
    "I can't say how this course contributed to my dissertation or research, as I will be focusing on the 19th century and have no current plans to focus on the medieval period, but the course was important to my understanding of French literary history. I also noticed that I now understand some words better than I did before, especially in the renaissance poetry I read for one of my other courses.",
    "This is a skill-oriented language course, so the fact that it did exactly what it says in the title is optimal.",
    "Learning a new language has broadened the primary sources I can use in my research. I work mostly in Latin but occasionally findmyself looking at vernacular literature as well, and it will be quite helpful to be able to work with the original language."
