    "This class is exactly what it you would expect. You read anywhere from 600-1000 lines of poetry (20-30 pages of prose) per week, starting with the early stuff and working through the greatest hits of Latin literature in chronological fashion. Assessment consisted of weekly translation quizzes, a midterm, a final exam, and presentation and submission of a paper.If you're a graduate student, then you most likely have to take this class. If you're an undergrad with a good background in Latin (you need to be able to cope with the reading) and you want to expand your classical horizons, then you should definitely consider taking it. As it's currently taught, it's great in every respect; Jay himself is phenomenal."

   "comments": [
    "I took this class as an undergrad and found it very rewarding. It wasn't easy, but I think that struggling a little from time to time has helped me to grow as a classicist. In future, I hope that other undergrads are also encouraged to take it."
