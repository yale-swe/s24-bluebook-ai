    "I really enjoyed the discussion-based nature of the course, but I would have liked some other form of activities",
    "I think the class taught me so much about human rights research and the different mechanics of human right actors, governments, and other international actors. However, I wish we could have zoomed in a few particular human rights cases.",
    "I have a hard time figuring out if I'm doing good or bad in the class, therefore it would be helpful if the assignments were graded or commented, so I would have an idea. Besides, I would have liked if we read a more policy papers, since this was what we should write for the finals.",
    "The type of final paper was a good idea and I liked the small class size. I wish we had more case studies to think about the application of certain tools instead of spending a lot of time in comparing different research methods for human rights in the beginning of class."

    "Yes, I would. I found it very interesting and feel that I learned a lot from it.",
