    "Take it if you like politics!",
    "The same themes from the fall semester are continued in Directed Studies: Historical and Political Thought in the spring. This class was a fast-paced look at political philosophy (but not much actually history) from the Renaissance onwards. Professor Petranovich was not the most exciting professor, but has a very good grasp of the material. Class discussions alternated between stagnating and vocal back-and-forth. There was a great emphasis on one's own opinion on a thinker and on contemporary applications.",
    "If you despaired at H and P in the fall, know that spring H and P is about a hundred times more interesting than first semester. The readings are all excellent, and most of the lectures are very good. Petranovich is a great professor\u00e2\u0080\u0094he runs lively discussions and pushes the conversation in thought-provoking directions. Overall, a really enjoyable, challenging, interesting class that provides an incredible foundation in political thought.",
    "Professor Petranovich is a solid section leader and lecturer. However, his remarks on papers are largely unintelligible, and he's proven somewhat difficult to track down to talk over a paper. Also, discussion occasionally breaks down in his section: it lacks a little bit of momentum. That being said, however, I think he grades papers fairly and offers excellent insight into the texts. He also has a strong interest in discussing and relating current events to the texts, and approaching them this way, something that most other section leaders shy away from: very useful and thought-provoking.",
    "Yes. DS is phenomenal and spring H and P is just as good as the fall, if not better.",
    "Take it if you have any interest in the Western intellectual tradition. Everything covered is crucial to understanding Western society and is fascinating in its own right.",
    "yes"
