   "comments": [
    "Holy moly you learn so much Chinese it's amazing. By the end of this course, I was able to hold conversations with my teacher and other students. I loved going to lunch with Shen Laoshi and being able to talk 90% in Chinese with her about both our lives.",
    "Level one speaking, listening, reading, and writing skills. Learn to write over 300 characters, and recognize more. Lesson topics include greetings, family, date and time, hobbies, making appointments, studying and school life, shopping, and transportation.",
    "I can hold very basic communication in Chinese in many practical contexts, and I also got a greater appreciation for Chinese cultre",
    "How to speak Chinese, Chinese culture, Intricacies of everyday conversation in Chinese culture",
    "By the end of L1 Chinese, you can introduce myself and follow a basic conversation, and you will have learned a lot of useful characters.",
    "I learned how to speak Chinese and communicate with classmates in speaking exercises. I also learned how to write Chinese characters.",
    "I learned a really surprising amount of the Chinese Language for just one semester. I am not very good at learning languages, but the course is so well structured that almost anybody could learn Chinese if they applied themselves. They are strict with everything, so I feel we are learning to speak very properly. Also, completely unrelated to Chinese, but I really like how the course forces students to speak Chinese to the whole class, every day. This had the side effect that I am more comfortable public speaking in English now. I didn't take the course to improve at public speaking, but its certainly a nice benefit!",
    "I learned so much. I started the semester knowing absolutely nothing, and I am amazed with how much I know now. The class covered an entire textbook (Integrated Chinese 1), and I feel confident about all the material it contains.",
    "An introduction to the Chinese language including learning basic grammar structures, pinyin, and basic characters.",
    "We learned so much Chinese in one short semester! I liked the fact that we had a lot of little homeworks\/quizzes\/presentations\/etc. so that we got constant feedback. Overall, the L1 program is super well-organized. I can't believe how many characters I knew by the end of the term."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: The Chinese dept is awesome (especially Shen Laoshi), small intimate class fostered a warm learning environment, daily HW and quizzes make sure you're keeping on top of your Chinese, very manageable work load, you learn so much Chinese in 1 semester Weakness: none",
    "Strengths: You will learn so much Chinese! This class is perfectly designed to teach you introductory Chinese. Grading is extremely reasonable, and the professors are great. Weaknesses: This class is a huge time commitment. You will have substantial homework every night, and will have to be constantly practicing on your own time in addition to class every day.",
    "The teachers are extremely attentive to each students individual needs and act accordingly to ensure everyone can reach the same level of learning. The only weakness of the course is the lack of emphasis in writing - which can be excused because of our fast development of speaking skills.",
    "I think this course was fantastically taught but sometimes all the grammar rules confusing so it might be even nicer if we had like a textbook outlining the grammar rules more clearly?",
    "Strengths are in the oral practice (we practice simple and improvised dialogues every day in class) and reading comprehension ( a lot of focus is put on being able to recognize characters even if you can't always write them.)",
    "I really enjoyed the pace of the class.",
    "I really think this course is great just the way it is. The structure is phenomenal, and really lets a student learn to read, write, and speak Chinese very quickly. The professors are friendly and interject Chinese cultural knowledge into every class. I have no improvement.",
    "The class is incredibly organized and well thought out. The course website contains all the powerpoints, every week's homework, and tutorial worksheets. The class covers speaking, reading, writing, and listening. The one drawback is that the tutorials were not as helpful as they could have been. They became out of sync with the material covered in class. I found myself unable to do the reading exercises because they included characters we hadn't covered yet and unable to have the conversation at the end because it was on topics we hadn't studied yet. All in all though, it was an amazing class.",
    "All of the professors for this course are very passionate about teaching the language and it shows. I would say the only weakness of this course is that there wasn't as much speaking practice, which is understandable since it is just an L1 course.",
    "Having now taken other language courses here, including Spanish (L1-L4), I can really justify why I've always been told the Chinese program here is so strong (and perhaps the strongest language program Yale has to offer). For starters, the way the class is organized is incredible at both pushing us but also making it so structured that we never feel too overwhelmed. The daily quizzes start off feeling nerve-wracking, but after the first few, it truly becomes easy to consistently churn out 10\/10 points on them, and you can skip three and still get a perfect score on the in-class quiz portion of the class. Having weekly schedules with all the homework assignments makes it easy to front load homework on weeks where you have midterms in other classes or are just busy. Having powerpoint slides to structure the class everyday was also a key difference between this class and other language classes I've taken where often, it's just professors rewriting the new grammar structures onto the chalkboard and talking about them. These powerpoint slides in Chinese were consistent and thorough and made it easy to keep up and ask specific questions. Above and beyond everything great about the course mentioned so far are the instructors. All of the instructors know how to make Chinese accessible and are incredibly patient.",
    "I really liked how well-organized the class was -- I could plan weeks ahead if I needed to, which is super helpful since Chinese met every day. My teacher was really accommodating when I needed extensions or extra help. I loved hearing Chinese songs and about traditions like Chinese New Year. I'd love if there were a supplementary Chinese info doc posted on the site with links to songs, podcasts, or movies so students could listen just for fun."

   "comments": [
    "Yes yes yes. Chinese is probably the strongest language department at Yale. The professors are all so caring and funny. I don't have a strong passion in learning Chinese or Chinese culture, but the class was still incredibly engaging and I got super close with all my classmates since there's no more than about 12 in each class and you see them every day.",
    "Yes, if you are genuinely interested in learning Chinese. It is not an easy language to pick up, but if you are willing to engage with the class and have fun with it, you will learn so much.",
    "If you are willing to put in the work yes",
    "Yes definitely. It requires a lot of work but I definitely feel that it has been paying off.",
    "The introductory Chinese program at Yale is super strong and I would highly recommend, if you want to learn Mandarin for a particular reason or just if you want an intro language sequence that will also be fun and engaging.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student because I think it's important to learn new languages.",
    "Absolutely. I am not good at learning languages, and I think it would probably be impossible for me to learn Chinese outside of such an effective course. If I can learn the challenging but valuable language, somebody else could too.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. It was absolutely my favorite this semester. However, I would only recommend it for someone who actively wants to learn a new language. The rate of learning is incredible, but the workload is comparably high.",
    "I would recommend this course if the student is genuinely interested in learning the Chinese language. It is a lot of work and getting through the daily homework can be very difficult if you are not enjoying it.",
    "Yes, 100%! You will learn so much Chinese and it's totally awesome."
