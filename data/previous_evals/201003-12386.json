   "comments": [
    "Do not take this course if you have no music experience. Even if you play and instrument, be prepared to realize that conducting involves much more than waving your arms in the air. You will learn a lot of techniques that may seem trivial, but will go a long way to improving. The final exam conducting piece was really hard, although it is really short.",
    "If you want a very relaxed intro conducting class where you get to practice conducting some fun orchestral pieces, take this.",
    "Yes. Take advantage of when Toshi offers help, and learn your music beforehand. Know that you have to do a good deal of work yourself if you want to get better, because you will have limited time in front of an orchestra. You should only take this course if you can read music fluently.",
    "Teaches basic conducting technique via trial-and-error experience conducting an ensemble of your peers. Toshi asks the class to bring in whatever instruments they play, and then they form a mini-orchestra which performs the same pieces over and over again as students take turns. It is a nice way to get started conducting, though probably a more valuable experience could be gleaned from just taking a leadership role in whatever musical ensemble you happen to be a part of.",
    "Yes I would it's a class that id different from any other, a previous evaluation said it was Harry Potter-like because of the conducting batons, and it's TRUE!",
    "I would recommnend Music 323 very enthusiastically as all music students should take conducting, and here is an opportunity to study with one of the best.",
    "Intro Conducting is an excellent course. Students conducted two movements in Beethoven's Fifth, the second movement from Brahms's Second, and the Royal March by Stravinsky (which was the final exam). Grading consisted of conducting, writing critiques of your conducting, and class participation\/attendance. Each student conducts an in-class ensemble, although not all students play in it if there are enough musicians \/ someone can't play an instrument. I learned a lot in a relatively low pressure environment. Toshi has a great sense of humor and is always willing to help if you're having problems conducting. I highly suggest that people interested in music take this course."
