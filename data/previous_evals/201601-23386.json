I think I would've preferred having two midterms was smaller amounts of info in the same time period. There really weren't a lot of examples to reinforce learning in the first half of the semester's material. It was just the problem sets which I thought was sort of a limited selection of objectives."

Or involve the TAs in making sure that we understand the concepts presented in the first half of the course. If we have so many TAs in the course it seems a waste not have them available for things like problem sets or midterm review. I also think it might be wise to make this course 4 credits simply because of the time required for the course on a weekly basis.",

Seemed like the assumption was that we were all just required to be there at the same time, in which case I would have rather just come in on my own time. It would have been more valuable in the labs were set up in a way to foster teamwork."

Following the midterm, the course isn't that difficult but just be prepared to spend a lot of time working on the labs in the project in the end. Also, if you struggle with some quantitative components be prepared to have your skills tested in the beginning of the semester with the problem sets and midterm. Make sure you stay on top of the problems that's in the midterm assignments and ask questions! The TA's are not very helpful in the beginning course material but can be very helpful with the lab exercises.",
    "I would recommend this course for students that want to learn about remote sensing in its application for science (atmosphere, oceans, land, urban, forest). The course does not cover drones in an advanced level, rather there is only one introductory session.",
