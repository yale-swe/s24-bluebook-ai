   "comments": [
    "L1 Russian is a really fun and engaging course with great instructors. The course expects fairly consistent studying and work on the part of the student, but it is not excessive. The language is somewhat challenging (less so if you're familiar with the grammatical concept of declensions because of experience with Latin, etc.) but very rewarding.",
    "Yes. I would recommend Russian for another student because it is an interesting language and the faculty are very good at making sure each student knows the material.",
    "Russian 110 is a very solidly taught course. I would definitely recommend it if you are interested in learning Russian-- the textbook is good, there's not too much work, it's not too too hard if you stay on top of things. The other students in the class will be smarter than those in most other introductory language courses (maybe not Chinese or Japonese). Professor Titus is excellent.",
    "If you want to learn a cool language take Russian.",
    "I highly recommend taking Russian. It's challenging (the syntactical structure is on par with Latin) but truly rewarding. Now that I've learned the cyrillic alphabet, it has become so automatic that I often accidentally sign my checks, documents, and receipts in Cyrillic (oops). In addition, it's an important literary, policy, and business language. Just go to the Academic Fair to check it out--I promise you won't regret it. You might even leave with a yummy Russian pastry.",
    "Russian is a great language and also a very interesting culture. It is always great to learn a new language and if you are wondering which one you should learn, choose Russian!",
    "I decided to take Russian because it is not like any Romance language and another language I have taken before. You learn a lot about Russian culture and the Russian way of thinking about various topics. I would recommend this course if you are interested in learning about any of the above!",
    "I would definitely recommend Russian L1 to anotherstudent. Russian is a very difficult language, but the professors understand this and are eager to help you every step of the way. Just make sure you ask questions, email the professor, and go to office hours. It's going to require extra work outside of the regular homework, but it will pay off in the long run. Make sure you continue to work on vocabulary throughout the units.Julia Titus is also a wonderful professor. She approaches topics from different angles to make sure you understand them and she also frequently adds facts about Russian culture\/major historical figures so you are able to fully understand Russia as a whole."
