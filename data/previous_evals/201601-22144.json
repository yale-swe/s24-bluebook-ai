   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this class to anyone with an interest in children or even play!",
    "Absolutely take this class if you can! You get to observe once a week for 2 hours at Calvin Hill daycare--an amazing example of how things go smoothly when people are just SO GOOD at teaching. The two hour meeting is sometimes a guest lecture, sometimes a discussion of what we see in our observations. Homework was 6 journals connecting readings with observation and a final paper, very doable.",
    "This class is a really really cool experience, and will change the way you think about childcare, parenting, and children in general. Take it!",
    "Yes, if they like children\/are interested in this subject.",
    "Definitely take this course. A great way to get a writing credit and the material will be useful not only if you want to go into teaching but if you just want to become a good parent. Very useful!",
    "This course is excellent! Everyone should take a class at Calvin Hill sometime before they graduate. The amazing slate of guest lecturers that you learn from are brilliant, Carla and Nancy are warm, approachable, and deeply knowledgable instructors, and, best of all, you get to spend some time hanging out with amazing kids. The workload is reasonable but not light: a little weekly reading, weekly observations in classrooms, six observation papers (where you're required to fuse your classroom observations with insights from the books, so you have to do the reading!), and a final paper. But the experience of learning from these incredible instructors, and spending time with these wonderful children, makes it all worth the work!",
    "This is a great class because you get to learn in the classroom and learn with the kids. I loved seeing what I learned in class play out when I observed the children. Take this class! It is fun and not too hard and you learn a lot about yourself and kids.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student with an interest in early childhood education. The class is founded on participation and willingness to grow, so the student taking the course should be very dedicated to the course and all it has to offer."
