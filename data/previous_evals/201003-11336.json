    "It would be a difficult class if you don't already have a background in computer science, math or philosophical logic. Can be a very enjoyable course, but it is necessary to spend a lot of time on the homework and to start working diligently from the very beginning of the semester.",
    "This is a great class. It starts simple, but gets quite complicated around two-thirds of the way through. The professor is funny and fun to listen to. Overall, I'd recommend it for anyone who likes to think deeply and mathematically."
