   "comments": [
    "This course would be appropriate for trainee social workers at the local community college. Given that this is Yale (and that students pay thousands of dollars to be there), this course is well below average and needs to be significantly improved.First of all, the level of the material presented is lower than I would have liked. I understand that there are students of different backgrounds in the course, but, as I mentioned above, this is Yale, a world leading university, so the level has to be higher. The students who don't understand something can ask the instructor, the TA or can look up the basics on Wikipedia. Parts of this course were Wikipedia-level...Secondly, the course is called \"Global HIV\/AIDS\". There was nothing global about it. No mention of why the epidemic is so high in Africa vs. the rest of the developing world, no mention of the different epidemics in Asia, Russia, S America, etc. I understand Dr Khoshnood's experience is in drug use in New Haven, but in the global context of the epidemic, drug use in the US is a drop in the ocean compared to what is going on in Africa. Having a drug user visit the course was informative, but again, not so relevant to what the course should be aiming to teach. Handing over an entire lecture to AIDS activists and giving them a platform that they used to ask students to protest against another Yale course was rather inappropriate.I think that by devoting much more of the course on global issues, particularly Africa and by removing the social worker elements (e.g. partner notification, etc), the course can greatly improve and reach the level that a Yale course should have.",
    "Difficult to organize multiple group work assignements, presentations and papers.",
    "This was an interesting course, filled with information. I really enjoyed the HIV positive man who came in to speak. Fascinating class day that put the information into perspective. Too much busy work thought- we are in grad school and shouldn't have to submit annotated bibliographies. The assignments were slightly restrictive and therefore limited creative thought. I felt that the grading rubrics for the 3 papers were also too cookie cutter. We are in grad school and I think most students appreciate being treated as such.",
    "It gave me a big picture of fundamental topics of global HIV\/AIDS. Immunology, virology, ethics, human rights, transmission routes.",
    "Overall I think there is lots of room for improvement. The course content feels tired - not to say that it isn't relevant or timely, just that it isn't presented with much impact. I would recommend that a future student take this class only if they have an especially low general knowledge about HIV\/AIDS. Like so many courses taught at YSPH, it did not deliver many concrete skills and is representative of a general lack of such content throughout the MPH degree at this school.For the 1000th time, we don't want overview courses, no matter how tempting it is, especially for a course like this that attracts lots of students form outside of YSPH. Don't worry about them, they go to Yale and they're smart enough to get caught up. We're the ones paying or are required to take this class, so make it practical. Suggested topics include:- How to formulate and negotiate ARV tenders for national governments- How to construct an advocacy campaign (not just a 1 lecture explanation)- HIV\/AIDS economics and the impact the epidemic has had on national economies- How to improve vaccine research",
    "Strengths:Plenty informationWeaknesses:The content of the course is too general.",
    "Strengths: Dr. Kaveh Khoshnood; guest speakersWeaknesses: lack of global focus",
    "The course was fantastic, except the final assignment seemed to be too arduous to have any educational productivity. Specifically the annotated bibliography, which to me indicates that we are not capable of selecting proper sources and had to spend about 2000 words explaining why we were using certain sources.",
    "There was way too much work during the last three weeks of the class. It seemed as though all of the work for the class happened during this time period. The reflection paper was a waste of time. I also think that maybe posting 3 articles and comments would be better than 5. The lectures were enjoyable and I especially enjoyed when Mike came and met with us. I did not like the lecture on activism. It made me angry. I did not mind the three assignments however I thought the grading was way to specific. The amount of work was not bad, I just think it would be nice to have it sprinkled out throughout the course.",
    "I really enjoyed this course! This was the first Public Health course I had taken and it was a great overview of public health issues relating to HIV\/AIDS. The papers were spread out well and it was nice having a 3-4 page limit so you couldn't go too overboard. I also enjoyed the special lectures, when Mike came in to talk, and also the activists came in for discussion.My only complaint is about the group project-I think group projects are nice in theory, but they usually go really well or really bad, and a lot of times one person ends up doing the brunt of the work. I didn't think it was that unreasonable for me to try to arrange meetings before the night that assignments were due, but my 2 partners were never available to meet up until the last minute. Even then, one of my partners didn't respond to my calls, texts, or emails to work on the group project report (I guess he assumed I would handle it) so I ended up writing the whole project report by myself because I didn't think 4.5 hours was enough to write the 10-15 page report (my other partner wasn't available to meet until 7:30 the night it wasdue and made a few edits). I wasn't sure about whether or not this was something to bring up to Kaveh or Jennifer, but otherwise, the course is structured well.",
    "This course required a lot of writing and preparation, but I'm not sure how much new material I actually learned in the process. I wish class were more discussion-driven.",
    "Overall, the course was great- it exposed me to various facets of HIV on the global stage. The strengths were the papers that gave student experience in how to address real HIV problems. The final group project was also a great way to work with others and gain understanding about an HIV topic in depth.",
    "I liked this class and feel like I learned a lot during the semester. It seems like this class might be listed incorrectly as an EMD course. Generally, we talked a lot more about behavior, interventions, and policy than we did about the disease itself. It could almost be listed as SBS or HPA. My only real complaint would be about the final. It felt like the final was an endless assortment of assignments all due somewhat at the same time. We had to (1) make a poster (2) present the poster to others for several hours (3) write about and evaluate other posters (4) write a 10-15 page group paper (5) annotate sources and (6) write *another* 3-4 page paper about a different, but related topic. It seems like this could be streamlined somewhat, as it is kind of excessive for a time of year when every other class also has large finals.Also, the lecture of advocacy felt kind of like a missed opportunity. Why focus on a few students protesting Obama when there was actual\/real advocacy in the US and abroad that made a meaningful difference on HIV\/AIDS policy?",
    "This is one of the best classes I've taken at YSPH. (That doesn't say much, though, because I feel that the quality of the education at YSPH is unacceptably low.) That said, this was definitely more engaging, interesting, and relevant than any other class I've taken. The papers were manageable and interesting, the lecture was engaging, and the final project was fantastic.",
    "This was the best course I have ever had the privilege of taking. The course was well-planned and efficient. Students were able to gain comprehensive knowledge on HIV\/AIDS via interesting and diverse classes, brief papers, and a group project\/presentation.",
    "Great course",
    "Strengths: Good topics for discussion, readings are great and pertinent and not too heavy.Weaknesses: Too big - smaller class size necessary to facilitate discussion. Assignments aren't great teaching tools - the paper topics aren't things that helped me learn anything new about the topics. I would recommend fewer smaller papers and something more substantial that can be used as a teaching tool. The group project was fairly unorganized in terms of expectations. All expectations and requirements for the write up should be given at the beginning of the class so when students pick topics they are informed about what they will be required to write about and present on. Ensure that all requirements for the course are listed plainly in the syllabus.",
    "This was an excellent course. The most memorable class was the class when Dr. Bruce brought a patient of his in to talk to us. The course started off really great, but I thought that it was way too heavy on the work load by the end of the semester. We had an individual paper due the same day as our final group project paper, and it seemed like it could have been organized such that this fourth paper would have been due before finals started. Otherwise an excellent, thought-provoking course.",
    "Overall it was a very interesting course. I really enjoyed how the course was mostly discussion based.",
    "Strengths: guest lectures, array of topics covered, final projectWeaknesses: It would have been nice to get more feedback on the small papers we submitted throughout the course.",
    "I was disappointed in this class. I felt that all the papers, posting, and final project were overkill and a bit patronizing. I took this class only because Kaveh is a good instructor and I thought it would be interesting, but by the end I found myself frustrated and wishing it were over. I felt like the class was intended to encourage critical thinking and discussion but instead, because of the volume of assignments, made everyone frustrated and working just to turn stuff in rather than to really learn.",
    "While the lectures were interesting, this class had far too much busywork. The reflection papers (which were actually mini literature reviews) really didn't add to my understanding of the issues at hand but required a lot of time. Perhaps worse, the papers did not get much feedback, and it seemed that as long as they were thesis-driven and included a ton of citations, you were fine. There was no nuanced critique of ideas. The forum was also a little silly. Had some of the discussions that were being put up on the forum because we had to post entered the classroom, that would have been very cool, but the way it was set up, I think most of us just did a google news search now and again to make sure we had articles and then read and responded to a post every so often. I don't think it could be seen as a substitute for class discussionI think it would have been FAR FAR better to require reading responses as I know very few people did the reading (myself included). However, I also think this needs to be complemented by more in-class discussion \u0097 the issues talked about are really contentious but only in the final paper or, on occasion in the lit reviews was there really a chance to hash them out.",
    "Strengths: Presents many different facets and viewpoints of the disease.Cons: MLA format is for humanity papers, not for public health. That's why there are no dates for the in text citations. In PH, dates matter, making it an irrelevant citation style to be familiar with.-Where is the global? It seemed primarily domestic based.-Disliked the activist lecture. Too one-sided and extreme. It would have been better to have a debate between those who understand the concept of scare resources (let's call them the Emmanuel Camp) and those who pretend money is not a scarce resource (let's call them the Activist Camp). We would have gotten a lot out of a structured debate between the two camps. Also, trying to recruit students during a class to protest against a guest lecturer who is obviously doing someone a favor just because he holds another viewpoint is really tacky and on the verge of despotic.- Way too much work. Get rid of the reflection paper. It is nonsense. Have 2 papers and a group project or 3 papers, but not all of it. Also, the directions were misleading... these are full-fledged, journal heavy papers.",
    "I think it was a little more busy than it ought to be--particularly with the group projects. Although I still think the group project are a necessary part.It could also be broadened to focus on the epidemic globally rather than the US. The history of HIV for example was just to limited to the United States and did not touch on Sub Saharan Africa or else where.",
    "The course is a good overview, but I think that Dr. Khoshnood tends to teach to the lowest common denominator, and this ended up feeling more like an undergrad class. Could benefit from more depth.",
    "Strengths: Kaveh was wonderful, very helpful and encouraging. He wanted us to do really good work and helped with that. Also providing 2 paper topics to choose from was a great way to let people write about\/research what they were really interested in.Weaknesses: Inconsistency in work load: so much of it was done at the end of the semester. Also, the details of the final project assignment were given very late.",
    "The course was really interesting and the workload was reasonable for most of the semester, but the end of the semester was frustrating. The group project was too complicated--we had various parts of it due every few days over the course of reading week and finals week, which was cumbersome when we had papers and exams for other classes. A final project or final paper would have been fine, but having to compile draft slides and put together a presentation and critique others' presentations and write a group paper was onerous. The individual reflection paper on top of everything else was the most onerous part. It didn't really seem to have much of a purpose; instead, it seemed like just another short research paper like the ones we wrote earlier in the course (but a particularly inconveniently timed one).",
    "Insufficient discussion of GLOBAL aspects of HIV.",
    "This is an amazing class. It is interesting, engaging and well taught.",
    "Course gave a good overview of global HIV\/AIDS, but I feel that there was too much focus on HIV\/AIDS related to drug injection, and much more time could have been spent on challenges in low-income settings."

    "Very basic overview for someone who wants a shallow taste of a variety of HIV\/AIDS issues.",
    "I would say that it's a broad overview of Global HIV\/AIDS and that you can kind of make it what you want to be or what you're interested in, through paper choices and the final paper. Yes, I would recommend it.",
    "The course is interesting and the workload is fine for most of the semester, but be prepared for a lot of assignments to be crammed into the end of the semester. Also be warned that some of the topics (like injection drug use) can drag on just a little too long.",
    "Good overview of HIV\/AIDS, which could have had more focus on global aspects of HIV\/AIDS."
