   "comments": [
    "My eyes were opened by the wonderful words from the brilliant Professor Michael Veal who taught from the heart about cosmological and sonic surfacing of music in the aspects of jazz and rock through John Coltrane and Jimi Hendrix. The TAs were also amazing and the entire class made me think more about music and culture than anything I have taken at Yale.",
    "In this course I learned how to bridge musicology with history and sociology, which was unexpected and incredibly cool. The depths to which this survey course reaches in its teaching of the fundamentality of African American art and history at the root of nearly all popular culture is astonishing and was well worth the experience.",
    "I learned to connect historical and cultural contexts and influences convincingly to formal sonic aspects of music. I learned a lot about music and cultural history.",
    "As someone who barely can play an instrument and has never studied music seriously (at least not at Yale), I learned A LOT about musical theory and ethnomusicology. This course helped me develop analytical skills and a better ear for jazz, R&B, blues, and rock!",
    "I learned so much from this class - the social and cultural origins of rock and jazz, the development of Coltrane and Hendrix's expression, the advancement of musical genres and technologies, the history of the Cold War era.",
    "Deep understanding of the musical and cultural forces that governed the careers and musical institutions of Coltrane and Hendrix.",
    "I learned not only a great deal about the lives of John Coltrane and Jimi Hendrix, but also basically the whole backstory of Jazz, Rhythm & Blues, Rock & Roll, and Psychedelic Rock, and how the social, political, and economic issues and conditions of the times tied in. Furthermore, this course really pushed my conceptions about music and greatly improved my writing.",
    "This course greatly improved my writing about music, politics, and popular culture.",
    "I developed critical thinking skills in the context of music history and sociology, as well a wealth of knowledge about American cultural history."

   "comments": [
    "This is the most poorly organized course I have ever taken at Yale. The material is fascinating, but the paper topics are never posted early enough for you to write a good paper under minimal stress, the final paper meetings were not scheduled in a way that made it easy for everyone to go, and section felt practically useless. The course could be improved with clearer communication of dates, assignments, and meetings, and section needs to be changed so that it does not become a diatribe about 20th century classical music (I say this as someone who loves contemporary classical music) because quite frankly those ideas seem irrelevant to the narratives of Coltrane and Hendrix. Also, the course feels like it is struggling to find a balance between being a music course in which musical technique\/theory is discussed and a cultural\/sociological study type course. It must be worked out if students should know music theory or what have you, because there were many generalizations that were musically confusing for musicians (or section just became about music and you lost half the class) and much of the class is taking this course to learn about these musicians' place in American musical culture\/political culture (not serialism). I really enjoyed the course but believe that these issues must be worked out!",
    "The professor and the TA Krists were both the best part about this class because they genuinely showed that they cared about what they were teaching, and came with a passion and enthusiasm unmatched by any other person I have taken a class under.",
    "The lectures provide very little information not readily available in the readings and listenings, unless the student has virtually no experience in any of the relevant fields. The two halves of the course were also quite disparate, and remained unconnected.",
    "The course's structure was excellent; I learned so much about jazz and rock in both units and they related very well to one another. I think two papers per unit felt a bit redundant; I would have rather written one six page paper for each unit rather than two four-pagers.",
    "I think this was a great course!",
    "This class wonderfully analyzes the histories of Coltrane and Hendrix. There is a fair amount of work but the readings are very interesting and the listenings are great! There is a lot of writing for a non-WR.",
    "Strengths: Great teaching team (Professor Veal is intense about the subject and the course, and the TFs were fantastic). The syllabus was very well structured. Weaknesses: At times, because I do not have any jazz background, I felt lost in the Coltrane unit. This was made worse when certain lectures would get sidetracked and go off on a tangent. It would be helpful to do a proper primer on musical concepts before each unit!",
    "Professor Veal is a brilliant and engaging teacher. I looked forward to coming to class every day. He incorporates multimedia sources and lots of listening which always keeps class fresh. His knowledge of the subject is deep and he makes connections between disparate musical traditions and ideas.",
    "The course was a little paper heavy, especially at the end when we had a short paper and the final paper due on the same day at the end of reading period. It was a little tough to focus on the final when we also had the short paper to complete.",
    "Wonderful wonderful class. My only complaint is that the two essays due the last day coupled with the fact the prompts were often only posted a week before made the workload at the end unnecessarily tough.",
    "The strengths lie in Prof. Veal's and the TFs's teaching, as well as the very-well-chosen readings to accompany the lectures. However, it is a lot of material to digest and interpret, and sometimes it felt as though I was missing something even though I had done all the reading.",
    "The course's greatest strength is the amount of information that we learned throughout the semester. Every lecture was consistently engaging and full. I thought some of the essay prompts could have been more specific, as sometimes I was not quite sure what questions I should be answering. I really enjoyed the variety of topics my section discussed but I also thought the section discussions could have been more closely tied to the material covered in lecture."

   "comments": [
    "The material covered in this course is fascinating, but it has yet to find a balance between detailed musical analysis and cultural ideas. Section is basically useless and it's very disorganized, but Veal is an incredible lecturer and the listening is wonderful.",
    "This class is amazing and engaging and fun. I missed only one lecture because of a health reason, and I was willing to pull myself out of bed just to hear it because I didn't want to miss a single word from Professor Veal's mouth. It was a class full of enthusiastic students. The cold calls kept us on our toes, and the essays expanded our minds. The reading was hefty, but I highly recommend doing it all if you're interested in the class because it genuinely is enjoyable. 10\/10",
    "I would not recommend this course to music students. If you're looking for two half semester classes about two influential 20th century cultural figures with virtually no mention of women and with lectures that summarize the readings, this is the course for you.",
    "Yes. Absolutely take this course to learn about culture you will not find in any other Yale course.",
    "This is a great class if you are interested in music and especially the relation of arts to society. It gives both rigorous musical listening and analysis and historical depth to the subject matter of 20thC America. It is fun and contemporary as well as very broadly relevant to issues of race, sexuality, politics, and art's place in a changing world.",
    "Definitely. This class provides its students with invaluable knowledge that is difficult to come by.",
    "A wonderful course if you are interested in the history of these musicians!",
    "I rarely write course reviews, but I have to for this one. This class is incredible, whether you're a jazz\/music prodigy or a complete musical dunce like me. I learned so much about these two men and the musical worlds they lived in and created. This course also makes me appreciate music SO much more. I haven't stopped listening to Hendrix for months now. Professor Veal is great- just make sure you come to class (decently) prepared and don't be afraid to participate!",
    "This was the best class I took freshman year. If you like music at all this class will make you a more informed listener and bring a new level of appreciation for the music, culture, and history of the 1960s. The readings are engaging and the essays are fun to work on. Professor Veal is demanding and outstanding.",
    "Take it, it's amazing. The 5 papers are hard, and demand close engagement with the readings and themes from class. But overall, the class was not burdensome and the lectures and topics covered were so rewarding.",
    "If you're interested in these musicians and the musics they were involved in, this is a course to consider. However, be forewarned: there is a ton of work involved so don't take it lightly.",
    "YES!",
    "I would recommend this course to any student interested in music history and American history, but especially one interested in both."
