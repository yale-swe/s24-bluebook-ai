    "I would recommend taking it.",
    "DS Literature Fall Semester is a good overview of some of the most famous texts from the early Western canon. Although it's not comprehensive, it is a good overview and will definitely pique your interest in at least some, if not all, of the reading. The seminars are a great opportunity to get close contact with esteemed professors, and the lectures are often insightful.",
    "This was an excellent course and I highly recommend DS Literature and specifically Professor Hawkins' section. The syllabus is well selected and draws on the greatest works of the Western tradition. Professor Hawkins is passionate and extremely dedicated to the teaching of literature, especially Dante. His in-class close readings were especially helpful to understand the works we studied in much greater detail. Conversations are open and engaging. I would often leave class with a profoundly deeper understanding of the text we discussed. My only regret is that DS is so rushed, meaning we could not linger and discuss works for more than a section or two. Two weeks on Dante? It is barely time to scratch the surface. Professor Hawkins definitely understood this challenge and did an excellent job to try to give us breadth and depth. Overall, an excellent course that was by far the best section I had in DS.",
    "DS Literature is the most eye-opening course; the insights of your fellow students and of Professor Hawkins will provide a multitude of readings for just one passage. Professor Hawkins' emphasis on close and outloud reading reveals the structure and beauty of a passage, even in translation. It is a wonderful course, one I would highly recommend. Professor Hawkins will give very comprehensive comments and can make you a better writer.",
    "I would recommend this course because it is intellectually interesting and a lot of fun.",
    "This course is an introduction to early Western literature which moves quickly through many works and requires a significant amount of reading, but which also provides ample opportunity for in depth discussion and examination of the texts. This course was my favorite that I took this semester. I would recommend it to students interested in literature who want to explore how themes and motifs which continue to influence literature today began and were developed in early literature. I would not recommend it to someone wanting to spend a large amount of time on any one work.",
    "I would recommend doing DS in general to a fellow Yalie.",
    "If you have even the most middling interest in studying literature, TAKE THIS CLASS. Professor Hawkins doesn't normally teach undergraduates, let alone freshmen--but in the rare years he does teach DS, you will be in for a wonderful intellectual experience if you get him as your professor. Above all, do the reading--and then be prepared to have your interpretations expanded beyond all measure. The workload is tough (and Professor Hawkins is an even tougher grader), but the rewards make it all worth it.",
    "It was a really good course that involved an accelerated study of the first half of important texts in the Western canon. I would recommend it if they liked reading."
