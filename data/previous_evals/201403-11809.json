   "comments": [
    "Meh. The material seems so interesting and disability studies is a great field to be talking about right now, and yet the class never seemed to reach that place. More work and stress than it ended up being worth.",
    "A reading seminar in which you discuss random things and get nowhere. I would not recommend it to a peer. I would recommend for them not to take it.",
    "This class brings up some really difficult questions. You read wonderful literature that is largely off the beaten track, and you talk about identity, voice, care, language, advocacy, science and medicine, and fiction's approach to ability\/disability across a large time period. The class is very unstructured, leaves a lot of loose ends, a result of its subject matter. I wish everyone would elect to become educated on the subject matter, but I didn't enjoy the course much myself. All the components of an awesome seminar were there, and things just didn't click together.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student! It is a great experience for students who have never really thought about disability issues as well as students who already have some background. Discussions were eye-opening and the course covered a wide variety of interesting material. Of course, it is really only worth taking if you commit to doing the reading (which is perfectly manageable). Most students who I heard complain that the course was uninteresting had obviously not done the reading. In any case, check out the syllabus before you make a decision.",
    "This was a very average seminar. The readings are decent and not too burdensome. Professor Berger often struggles to lead a meaningful discussion in class, and class time is often filled with awkward silence or the professor posing numerous rhetorical questions about the material. The biggest fault of the class is that by week 7 or 8, it becomes very repetitive. Grading is also a bit hit or miss. However, if you are someone who is very interested in disability studies, then this may be the class for you.",
    "While the syllabus sounded promising during shopping period, the class proved incredibly underwhelming. We never got past the fundamental question or problem of \"how do you speak for those who cannot speak for themselves,\" and all discussions hovered in some indeterminate area between superficial literary and cultural analysis. If you're interested in disability studies re: literature, read Professor Berger's book, which is fascinating and far more substantial than the class itself."
