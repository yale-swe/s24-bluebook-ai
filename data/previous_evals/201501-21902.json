    "Challenging class but very fulfilling.",
    "Kowalski is a rising star in the healthcare economics field and a good lecturer. Great survey of recent research on healthcare economics, particularly as regards the ACA and healthcare reform more broadly. Two psets, two short papers, midterm and final. There was mandatory discussion section, which was useless and felt like a chore, but hopefully Professor Kowalski will do away with that.",
    "Take a class with less work. You don't wanna deal with this class your senior year, and the professor and TA are the most nitpicky graders you will have.",
    "Econ 405 is a pretty solid class that has taught me quite a bit about the healthcare system. You learn a lot of stylized facts in class but the tests are more about your analytical and critical thinking abilities which I think is how classes and tests should actually be. Take it if you're interested in the intersection of healthcare and economics!",
    "This was a great course for students who are want to discuss theories and economic papers published about the American healthcare system. It is different from Forman's ECON 180 class in that the institutional details about the Medicaid\/Medicare systems etc. aren't super important; rather the economic theory behind how people value health, health care, and insurance. Both classes cover the ACA in depth but, once again, Forman focused on the institutional detail whereas Kowalski focused on the economic implications of the policy. Bottom line is don't be afraid to take ECON 405 even if you've taken ECON 180! The courses give you insight into different aspects of the healthcare system. Intermediate micro and econometrics\/stats are needed for the course. The workload wasn't bad: 2 problem sets, 2 papers (best one counts), 1 midterm, 1 final. The best part of class was definitely when we deviated from the powerpoint slides and discussed implications of policy or empirical approaches to research. (Be ready to read a lot of papers!) I would definitely recommend this to anyone who wants to know how to function in a post-ACA world.",
    "Yes absolutely, everyone should have at least a basic understanding of the US healthcare system. I took Professor Forman's class before and would recommend taking this one as well. It puts more of the healthcare ideas into economic models.",
    "Take it! The material is super relevant to life and it is extremely well taught."
