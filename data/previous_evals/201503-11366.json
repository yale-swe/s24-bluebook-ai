    "DS History & Politics Fall Semester is a good overview of some of the most famous historical texts from the early Western canon. Although it's not comprehensive, it is a good overview and will definitely pique your interest in at least some, if not all, of the reading. The seminars are a great opportunity to get close contact with esteemed professors, and the lectures are often insightful.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to other students. It's a lot of reading, but it is worth it for sure. The focus of the class is on discussion, and that led to a great environment.",
    "If you hope to familiarize yourself with some of the most prolific pre-Renaissance historians and work with the greatest political theorists on campus, take this course! The lectures often precede some of the week's reading assignments, but since they are mostly context-based and holistic, this is not a problem at all!",
    "Good intro to politics",
    "If you are down to do all of the reading, definitely take H&P with Smith.",
    "DS HP is a course on the underpinning of modern historical and political thought. If you are looking for a class which incorporates the Eastern tradition then do not take this class. However if you are looking to begin to truly understand both the modern political systems and the variety of approaches we can take towards challenges today, then truly invest in this course.",
    "Yes.",
    "Yes, it works well with the other DS courses. I wish that in the beginning of the class, there was more introduction to how this might fit with other classes. Also, I appreciated the linkage between H and P and the current American society, so I wish there were more of that in the beginning of the course and perhaps some supplemental written material to read if curious.",
    "Would recommend; stimulating material and professor",
    "Yes, this class was awesome. You will read very cool authors, and learn a lot about the classical world and the heritage of political thought that still influences and confronts us today."
