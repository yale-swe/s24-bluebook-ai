   "comments": [
    "This course is fascinating and contains important subject matter. My best advice would be to keep up with the reading, since that helps explain some of the concepts better than the explanations provided in lecture.",
    "I would summarizethis class as an introduction into everything having to do with primates, with an emphasis on humans and hominids, that is biology related with supplementary sociocultural explanations. I would not hesitate to recommend this to everyone and already have recommended it to quite a few.",
    "I will recommend it to students who are interested in humanities major, because this class taught me a lot about the biological aspect of anthropology, which is not too hard but really helpful to everyone",
    "During the first half of the semester, we learned about the various primate species and how they differed (anatomically, socially, biologically) and how they were connected by things like similar social behaviors. We studied both modern and prehistoric species, which allowed us to transition into ancient primate species and possible ancestors of mankind. The second half of the semester focused on our own species: our evolution, behavior, unique adaptations, DNA, and how those compared to other modern primates.",
    "Bio Anthro is a really interesting class if you haven't learned anything about human evolution and hominins before. I needed a science credit and I thought that checking the anthro department out would be cool. I'm glad I did cause I have learned a lot of interesting stuff about why we are the way we are today and what the deal was with Neanderthals and that kind of stuff. I would definitely recommend this class!",
    "Ugh if you have to get a science credit and science is not your thing there really aren't a whole lot of options\u00e2\u0080\u00a6.this class was a struggle though. The lectures were outrageously boring (and I would know since I inexplicably went to all of them) and Watts was incapable of presenting the material in an articulate way. It was never clear what was going to be on the exams, which were really hard. Lab was okay since I had a great TF but even that was a hike up Science Hill. You gotta do what you gotta do but if you do in fact take this class, brace yourself because you are in for a rough and uninteresting trip down \"let's just watch weird videos of monkeys that don't even have anything to do with today's topic\" lane.",
    "I would recommend Anthropology to another student who is interested in fulfilling the sociology med-school requirement. ANTH 116 is an exciting course because new findings are constantly re-writing what we are learning in the class room.",
    "Anthropology 116 is a great introduction to the discipline, especially for someone without a great deal of science background. It covers a variety of topics, so if one aspect of anthropology doesn't particularly interest you, the odds are good that the next one will. The labs allow you to touch and work with the bones of the primates and early hominids you just learned about in class and really drive home the information. They are also very low stress and even fun. I would recommend this class for anyone interested in knowing a bit more about how humans came to be or in getting a science credit that will give them knowledge that is relevant to their lives and will actually stick with them.",
    "If you are interested in Anthropology, this course is a great choice. The work is pretty straightforward.",
    "I think ANTH116 is a solid introductory course into Biological Anthropology, especially for a non-science major who still wants to take a science course. I would recommend ANTH116 to anyone who is interested in human origins, specifically from an evolutionary standpoint.",
    "Anth 116 is a good class to take if you're interested in evolution or want to take a science credit that requires very little work. The material can be interesting, but the lectures tend to get boring so be prepared. It's easy to put in little work and be prepared for tests, but sometimes Professor Watts gets bogged downin the minute differences between primate species and it can be a little frustrating. Overall, if you like evolution, take the class.",
    "Good for a SC credit. Not intimidating material so humanities students can tackle this course. The first midterm was very hard for me so I'd advise people to make sure they are really confident on the material for the tricky multiple choice.",
    "I would recommend it for a decently easy science credit and for those interested in human evolution",
    "If you need a rather easy going science credit, this class can be good, but beware that lecture is extremely dry.",
    "-only if interested in the field",
    "This class provided a baseline understanding of physical anthropology, but the class' few interesting moments were somewhat lost amidst the otherwise boring atmosphere. A lot of people in the class are there for the science credit, but it's not quite a gut, though not overly difficult either. Professor Watts is a nice guy who can be helpful if you ask, but he can also be very confusing and dull. Overall, a passable to somewhat mediocre class.",
    "I took this because I had to. It's a good course overall and you will learn a lot, but if you're looking for a bio anthro elective there are more engaging choices elsewhere in the department. Still, this is a great introduction, and it covers a lot of interesting material.",
    "If you need a social science credit and you are a science credit I would recommend this course. There is a bit of biology (hence the name), but there is also a fair amount of new and interesting material. The book is a nonessential because Watts is pretty thorough with his powerpoints and lectures.",
    "Anthropology 116 is a really interesting class that does a great job of applying the concept of evolution to human beings, as well as the human race. That is to say, it integrates science with culture to give students a broader view of why we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re here today and why we do what we do. It covers everything from a survey of early hominids and their evolution to primate behavior to human life-histories. I would definitely recommend this class to anyone who is interested in the scientific or cultural aspect of human evolution. The lectures can be a bit dry, especially toward the end of the year, but the material is interesting and the section is wonderful! It really applies the concepts learned in class.",
    "It was an interesting subject, with a professor who loves the topic. However, he doesn't do a good job of getting that love across in a large lecture setting. It ended up being the most boring class I've ever taken. I would fall asleep after nights of a full 8 hours of sleep. It's a science credit, but there are better and more interesting science credits to take. Dwatts seems like a good professor to take small seminars with, the review sessions were actually interesting because he's more personable one on one.",
    "An interesting class to take just because it is a kind of unique field. Lectures are pretty boring but the class isn't too hard. If you study you'll do well.",
    "I would not really recommend this class unless you are solely interested in learning about the evolution from monkey to man. You don't get into human behavioral patterns until literally the last two lectures. Everything else is learning about the names of different monkeys. Also, lectures are so boring and our \"labs\" are just measuring the size of bones. Also, the midterm and final definitely required substantial studying although study guides were definitely helpful. I honestly did not get that much out of this class.",
    "Boring. Take it iff you want to memorize the bones in monkeys' skulls.",
    "There are easier science classes in terms of the material; it sways back and forth between elementary social science and hardcore genetics\/physiology\/epidemiology (beware non-science majors...). Since it is both a science AND social science credit, there are a lot of science majors taking the class who definitely have an upper hand. That being said, I learned a lot about pure biology, paleoanthropology, what really makes us human and a lot of other interesting topics that I would never have touched otherwise. I highly recommend this class. Final note: Prof. Watts tests the DETAILS; don't just skim the powerpoints, make sure you review the psets, labs, textbook, etc.",
    "This class was a great intro course that taught me a lot painlessly with fair tests, clear slides from lecture, relevant problem sets, important sections, and accessible instructors. Take this class for a good grounding in human evolution, for an easy science credit, or for the opportunity to explore our history as a species and its current impact on our lives (think nutrition and the consequences of anatomy and physiology).",
    "Take the class. It is more interesting than you might think.",
    "A great course. The lecture is slow, but the material is fascinating. Definitely take it if you're interested in human evolution. And go to lecture! The exams are entirely based on lecture.",
    "Lecture is underwhelming but material\/section are a lot of fun.",
    "THere might be better SC classes out there, but this class wasn't bad. I enjoyed parts of it, coming from a psych background a lot of this was helpful to my major.",
    "A solid introduction to the field of anthropology with an emphasis on human evolution. A fair amount of the material is less than exhilarating, though some units are particularly interesting (Blombos cave and early hominin culture, for example). That said, I felt like the material that was exciting did the work of being exciting on its own; i.e. Professor Watts did not do a great job of making the material exciting for us students. In fact, I rarely felt an overwhelming need to go to class. The lecture powerpoints were so concise and informative that I often felt like I could skip lecture altogether and go over the lectures on my own time, teaching myself the material\u00e2\u0080\u0094not a particularly good sign.Structurally, the class was perfect. I thought the two midterms and the light final exam (which was really just a third midterm) minimized stress while maximizing my ability to retain all the information.Overall, it's a great class for non-science majors looking to fulfill their distributional requirements.",
    "Tests are harder than expected",
    "Take it for the science credit, but be prepared for long lectures and some dry material.",
    "It's a class about going from the earliest primates to modern humans. In the first part, you learn a lot about monkeys and early primates. In the later part, it's more human stuff. Don't take if you don't want to learn about lots of different primate stuff--may sound obvious, but perhaps not to everyone. I took this class not for the science credit (as many do) but because I really wanted to learn about human evolution. I was not disappointed. I know a lot more about our ancestors and the the selective pressures they faced. There's some cool psychology and health stuff at the end of the class. Prof. Watts may be a dry lecturer, but he's very kind and very intelligent. I would definitely recommend this class if you want to know about human evolution.",
    "Biological Anthropology was a great way to get a science credit. As a senior humanities major who unfortunately lacks any interest or skill in science, I was thrilled with this class. The material on the whole is interesting and anthropologically, rather than biologically, oriented. Although I cannot say that I particularly enjoyed memorizing the distinctions between different extinct primate species, with a little effort the exams are a breeze. This is a good one. And Professor Watts is a really nice guy.",
    "If you're looking into Introduction to Biological Anthropology, you're probably a humanities or social-sciences person looking for a science credit. OH MY GOD TAKE THIS COURSE. I walked out of lecture and section with the same sense of wonder science classes gave me when I was younger- \"so this is how the world works! wow!\" Section usually involves examining fossils, particularly skulls, and the worksheets we do in section are great preparation for the three exams. The two mid terms aren'tcumulative, and the final is cumulative in terms of big ideas (evolution by natural selection) but not in terms of facts, so you don't have to panic about remembering terms from the second week of class. The ideas really stick with you, though- this is all about how we became human, and the answers to that question are fascinating.",
    "Good and interesting SC crEdit.",
    "I took this class (probably like you) because science is really scary and SC credits exist. I thought that this class was great - the information is useful, and the powerpoints are all online. You do need to go to section, but it's really great - you get to work hands-on with fossils, which was fun and made it much easier to understand the information in the lectures. There are a lot of (very short) problem sets and some pretty hard tests, but overall this is a great class. I really enjoyed it!",
    "If you're looking for a science credit, but you're not great at science, I don't recommend this class. The multiple choice questions are tricky: Is it... (a) ___, (b) ___, (c) ____ (d) a& c, (e) all of the above. When they're asking you about long primate or neanderthal names, it's easy to get tripped up and miss a lot of points because you marked it was \"all of the above\" instead of \"a& c.\" If you're good at memorizing, you can do well in the class (lots of people got As on tests), but it was a real struggle for me to do well. If you take it, definitely use the online textbook resources for studying.",
    "I would summarize the course as a great entry point into the field of biological anthropology and would definitely recommend it, because I think it offers a great deal of insight into the human condition--which is, after all, useful for quite a few things more than just biological anthropology.",
    "If you're interested in Bio Anthro go for it...if not, then don't take it.",
    "Take the course! It's a great introduction to anthropology if you want to see what the field is like.",
    "I would recommend it",
    "I would recommend this course to students who are not the most science inclined, it is pretty interesting and not the hardest science credit.",
    "The lectures can be a bit dull if you aren't interested in the subject. Overall an interesting subject to learn about."
