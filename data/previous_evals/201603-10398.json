   "comments": [
    "While the individual techniques learned were fascinating, I found this to be one of the weaker courses I have taken here. There was very little structure and I felt that the directions our professor gave was very vague. I was often frustrated with the class because we were constantly running out of supplies that were essential for completing the assignments. Even very basic things like paper towels, scissors, xacto knives, and simple clay sculpting tools were hard to come by and were often broken and useless. I expected much higher quality and better organization from a Yale course.",
    "Not enough conceptual rigor. We were given a few technical skills and then left to ourselves. For a more experienced group this might have been appropriate, but for the level of our class it resulted in a lot of uninteresting work."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this to somebody who is very eager to learn the basics of mold-making, but is ready to put in a lot of time and trial and error to accomplish the assignments\/projects. Also be aware that sometimes you might have to buy your own supplies and tools because the classroom was very poorly stocked.",
    "If you already have an established sculptural practice and a conceptual grounding, and wish to force yourself to learn moldmaking techniques, go for it. If not, it's not worth your while. Carolyn is uninvested in her students, provides little feedback, and gives no conceptual, theoretical, or historical grounding or background to the technical lessons. Even the techniques could be learned for much less cost from the book that she left in the classroom for us to reference when she was gone - it went over basic plaster and silicone molds. If you're looking for rigor, this isn't the class for you. If you're looking for fun, consider this: I put in at least ten hours of work just to try to get a decent casting of a banana."
