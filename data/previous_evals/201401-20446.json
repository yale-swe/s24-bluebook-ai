   "comments": [
    "Very heavy in philosophy, but necessary for any archaeological studies major! Lots of readings, and weekly book presentations (5 min long) but only one big presentation. Prof. McIntosh is very, very good!",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone who is interested in archaeology. Though there is a lot of reading, it broadens your prospective on the different theories in archaeology that have influenced the archaeological thoughts of today.",
    "I'd recommend the course to anyone interested in archaeology or material culture studies with a philosophical inclination; it's a lot of fun!",
    "ANTH 482 is a thought provoking seminar that challenges your perceptions of the meaning of archaeology. Part of the course involves following the change of your personal beliefs at the beginning and end of the semester. Prpf McIntosh is a fantastically at-ease professor. The weekly workload is rather heavy, but there was no paper or final in the class. The major assignment was one presentation during the semester. Very manageable and very enlightening."
