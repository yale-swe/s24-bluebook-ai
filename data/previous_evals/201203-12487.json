    "I would definitely recommend this class. Persian is a very beautiful language to start learning and the class is well taught. That being said, make sure you are willing to put in the time to do the work and practice the language, because if you aren't the class could be frustrating.",
    "I wouldn't take this course. As much as the language itself is beautiful, in the course you barely end up using it. Classes felt mostly disorganized, we hardly spoke Persian,and I ended up just feeling frustrated with my progress (the early start time and every day thing didn't help either, I really felt that we could have done the same class MWF with little variation in the content covered).",
    "If you are really serious about learning Persian, take it. If you're not, it's going to be a long year.",
    "Persian is a beautiful and easy language. If you're interested in Iran, this isn't a bad way to learn the language!",
    "I would highly recommend this class for any student interested in studying Persian as a language.",
    "If you want to learn Persian, definitely take this class. The professor is great, although definitely demanding. The class is very enjoyable, and one really learns a large amount in very little time.",
    "I would recommend it, its a great language to learn.",
    "Never take it, worst professor EVER."
