    "I learned a lot grammar and it was a great review of a lot of things I had forgotten from high school.",
    "My Spanish didn't improve that much, but I did learn some things and got to practice.",
    "My Spanish speaking abilities were greatly improved and I was challenged everyday to better my speaking, writing and reading skills. Class was also very engaging and I enjoyed attending everyday as I felt like it was a very productive use of my time, and I'm so glad I was in the class that I was. The teaching was great and I learned a good deal about hispanic culture as well.",
    "I definitely improved my Spanish speaking skills. I learned a descent amount about Spanish culture as well.",
    "This class allowed me to become more comfortable speaking Spanish. I developed vocabulary, grammar, and speaking, reading, and writing, skills.",
    "My Spanish definitely improved after this course",
    "I learned how to better and more quickly conjugate verbs and I expanded my Spanish vocabulary."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "A strength is that the class is very well organized. Something that could be improved is less repetitive busy work.",
    "I wish that there weren't so many repetitive, mind-numbing assignments, and that we spent more time speaking with the professor rather than with each other, since we can not correct one another as well.",
    "Strengths - It was easy to get feedback on how you were doing in the class, and it was also easy to discuss problems and goals with the instructor. Class was always engaging and very fun, while it was also very informative. I always felt like I left class having learned a great deal more. I also enjoyed the structure of the class and felt as though the material was all very interesting and useful to understand. the way we were taught in class was also very effective. Weaknesses - Some of the explanations in the textbook were not that great for many of the topics covered in class and made it difficult to understand some topics. The information in the book could have been presented in a better way at times.",
    "It felt like we had a lot of busy work for homework, and it seemed like we wasted a lot of time going over to answers to homework everyday in class that could have been better spent elsewhere. I think it would have been better for us to have solutions posted online that we could review and come in with questions everyday to class instead of spending 2\/5th of each period reviewing HW.",
    "This class was great for improving my speaking, reading, and writing skills. The textbook was also great. I thought the essays that we read were a bit above our reading comprehension, however.",
    "This course was amazing because of the instructor.",
    "This course could be improved by lightening the busy work activities from the textbook and focusing much more on conversation and writing."

   "comments": [
    "This course was well organized and designed to help students learn. If you took Spanish in high school then a lot of this will seem like review. Meeting every day helps improve fluency and speaking a lot. You will also improve your writing skills.",
    "If you're taking this, you have to. It's not too bad, just a pain that it's every day.",
    "Yes, I would. This course was engaging and helpful to improving proficiency in the spanish language. Profe was especially very fun and helpful.",
    "Yeah if you need a language requirement.",
    "I would recommend this course to someone who wishes to improve their Spanish language skills.",
    "For someone interested in really becoming comfortable with Spanish, this course is amazing. I enjoyed it a lot overall.",
    "If you're interested in learning Spanish, this is a course that you need to take to help you advance your language and writing to a higher level."
