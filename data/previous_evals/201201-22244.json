    "TAKE THIS CLASS.Analysis course teaches you the logics\/proofs behind all the theorems you learned in calculus classes for granted. It is very thought provoking, and a lot of fun. I would say the problem sets took me about 5 to 10 hours every week. This class reaffirmed me to continue taking higher level math classes in future years at Yale.Professor Datta is incredibly friendly, accessible, talented and awesome. He dedicated a great portion of his time for his students. His lectures were always clear and were great complement to reading lecture notes (which are really well organized). Students loved him and I had a blast learning from him this semester.",
    "If you are thinking of taking analysis, it probably is required for the major. The class was very well structured and the notes prepared by Professor Datta were really useful (better than the book). The problem sets were definitely challenging as you would expect. Overall, I feel like I learned a lot and am more comfortable with mathematical thinking and writing.",
    "HARD. So hard. This class will crush you and make you not want to be a math major. I put more effort into this class than my other four classes combined, and I'm still going to receive a B- at best. This class sucks.",
    "If you're a math or math\/econ major, then yes. If not, then no.",
    "Rigorous, proof-based calculus course, dealing with sequences, series, sequences of functions, convergence, continuity, integration, differentiation, open and closed sets, compact spaces, metric spaces, etc.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course, with the cautionary note that it entails an immense amount of work and patience--more so than any other course I've taken in my academic career. But it's worth the effort!",
    "Yes, excellent course on real analysis (not like I have any to compare it to, but still). Super proofy course, but at the end the material is surprisingly interesting. 250 was helpful as a prereq, but multivariable is not really necessary. Swarnendu Datta is an excellent professor who has super informative notes which summarize all of the material and make the course enjoyable to take. After taking this course, you will know a ton about sequences and series and will understand how they form the foundation for basically all other math classes that you can take.",
    "Although slated to be an introductory course in real analysis, there is nothing introductory about Math 300. This course is extremely difficult, and when compared to friends in 301 (the higher level intro analysis course), 300 was equally difficult this year. Professor Datta does things right. He gives excellent lectures and uploads detailed class notes online for students. The workload is extensive--problem sets take around 10-15 hours a week, but they are quite enjoyable and well-made. Professor Datta's exams were interesting: the first was very easy, with an extremely tricky last question; the second was excruciatingly difficult (series, of course); and the final was an extremely fair take-home, written at an appropriate level for the course. In summary, Datta is a boss and you should take this course! Well, that is if he's teaching it. If not, take whatever he's teaching.",
    "Uyyyyy. Only take it if you have to, or if you REALLY want to challenge yourself. The material is by nature extremely difficult. I think Professor Datta did the best that he could at trying to make it accessible to us (his notes are super useful), but he's not good at gauging the class's understanding of the material, so we were usually completely lost. The problem sets are painfully long, and the second midterm was brutal.With that said, though, you definitely come away knowing some analysis. And some of it is kind of cool. I just don't know that the class was worth the agony.",
    "Would definitely recommend this class if it is taught by Datta. He's not gonna blow you away right away, but he's a very clear lecturer, prepares great notes, and is generally the man. Definitely is manageable workwise - although the weekly problem sets can be a real time suck. I took it after 230 because 301 never fit into my schedule and I think it was a significant step down in difficulty (although my 230 class was taught very poorly). But its nice because you just go through the material at a really reasonable pace, learn it, and can focus more effort on more difficult classes.",
    "You should know this.",
    "No, I would not recommend this course to my friends, unless he\/she is smart and is okay with fluctuating class speed in the middle of semester.",
    "Only take it if you have to. It's a ton of work and none of the material is particularly beautiful or enlightening. Absolutely miserable. Lectures were not fun and made me not want to major in anything close to math.",
    "I thought this class was very well taught. Professor Datta is a good lecturer - he moves at a reasonable pace and distributes very good notes. I did think the problem sets could get long and tedious, especially towards to end of the semester. They also tended to be fairly algebra heavy. I think shorter, more straightforward problems would have been as effective at teaching the course material. It also seems like the curve for the class is going to be tough. Overall however, I would definitely recommend this course.",
    "Don't do it unless you took a relatively rigorous proof based class before (e.g. MATH 250) and you enjoyed it. This class is no joke, you'll spend most of your time during the week on the psets (10-20 hours.)",
    "I would not recommend this class 1) because it is hard and 2) because of its arbitrary grading standard. The professor changed the final grading scheme after the second mid-term exam from the scheme 30-40-15-15 to the better of the two scheme 30-30-20-20 and 30-40-15-15 for HW-FINAL-MD1-MD2; he also made the final a take-home final. This is the first time Prof. Datta is teaching this class, so he might have more experience next year.",
    "It's an interesting course. Far better than Math 250 if Datta is teaching it.",
    "Take it with Datta. Great class.",
    "This subject is difficult but essential for those hoping to pursue higher level mathematics or similar subject matters, and the Professor does as much as possible to make a difficult course easier to comprehend. I would recommend it to those who are serious about math and willing to give a large amount of time and effort.",
    "I would highly recommend this class to another student who would be interested in learning math proofs. This is a great gateway to the beauty of math kingdom."
