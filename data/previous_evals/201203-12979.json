    "I really liked this class. Elizondo was kind of a hard grader but always ready to answer questions about the papers (or the class in general). I would recommend this class to another student interested in a survey on the ethical thought, from Plato to modern times",
    "Take it if you are interested in moral philosophy, or philosophy in general. Awesome lectures. Seriously. Shop at least three or four classes.",
    "Okay class, good texts. Three papers: each one was a five-page to the last one (e.g. 5, 10, 15 pages, the 10-page one being a 5-page addition to a revised version of the 5-page paper you did earlier), which was helpful but also stressful. Lectures were boring because Sonny read straight from his notes, and he always let us out 15 minutes late, which was annoying. Papers were the most frustrating, because it seemed as if all he wanted was a direct regurgitation of what he said in class. The most common criticisms were about details in your paper about the authors that did not properly align with what he had said. And he grades harshly. I couldn't tell if it was just to make a point.",
    "This course is a lecture course specifically about Professor Elizondo's views on what these philosophers think about morality. The reading list is great, and Professor Elizondo is an engaging lecturer. Be prepared for reasonably hard grading and no opportunities for individual expression on the essays. I thoroughly enjoyed the class, and thought it was good for a Yale philosophy course.",
    "Phil 331 is a good survey to the different types of critics to morality there are out there. We first cover Plato and Aristotle (not critics bus defenders) then Nietzsche and Freud and then Bernard Williams. Professor Elizondo explains things clearly, although it takes him a very long time to do it. The class was already an hour fifteen lecture and he usually ran 10-15 minutes over time. So be prepared to sit through very long and sometimes a bit boring lecture. But otherwise the class was good if you want to learn about these particular works. The format is simple: you just read the work and the write an essay about it. No tests or anything."
