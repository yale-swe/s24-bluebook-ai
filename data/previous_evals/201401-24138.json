    "Lectures could be better organized, but the trip was so amazing that nothing else compares! Extremely well planned itinerary by the TA. Class after the trip was a bit of a drag, but I'm sure that's natural. Did not like the whole fundraiser situation and how it was thrown on the class at the last minute though.",
    "Fantastic exposure to students and professors outside of your discipline, with a great mix of guest speakers. The trip was fantastic. Sometimes the course content could have been better organized, but the overall experience was amazing.",
    "Strength - content, students selection, the tripWeakness - shaky leadership, class disorganization",
    "Phenomenal course, my favorite during my time at Yale.",
    "Strengths are learning about Haiti and traveling there to see first hand what is happening.Weakness is that the class often felt disjointed when we were stateside. Too much lecturing and discussing readings. Would have been better to have us interact more to create an interdisciplinary understanding. Maybe do some case studies and mix up teams, or find ways to make the three hours more interactive.Also, the fundraiser got thrown on us out of nowhere. It was supposed to be one student's project for the entire semester, and instead in the midst of us doing our work for the class and thesis\/finals\/etc, we also had to get thrown into projects that we weren't prepared for. If the fundraiser is something to be done again in the future, this should definitely be ironed out early on so that students can prepare if they are supposed to work on it.",
    "Strengths: unique opportunity to work with interdisciplinary students and faculty to explore particular issues in a specific context, and work with international partners.Weaknesses: course seemed unorganized post-Haiti. Considering the amount of work to do during the last couple weeks, perhaps cutting class time down the last couple weeks would have been better than unproductive class time."

    "Instructor: Gordon Geballe \u00a0I think Gordon is a great and humorous teacher. He did a good job with selecting the students, with great global experiences.Weakness - I think the class lacked organization from day to day. Although the trip was organized, the Yale classes were not structured. This made it seem like the class was worth only the trip.",

    "This is a one of a kind course that will leave an impression on you forever. You will connect with amazing people both in Haiti and in the class, and come out thinking of global aid with a whole new light.",
    "Take it!! I took it as an extra, fun class and it was amazing. I especially recommend it if you have prior international health or development experience, as it will help you digest what you've done and think critically about how you will approach such work in thefuture.",
    "I learned a lot in this class and more in Haiti.I would recommend it to another student looking to explore development in a low-income and healthcare-stricken country.",
    "Phenomenal course, once in a lifetime opportunity.",
    "I would recommend this course mainly for the experience in Haiti. A lot of the class time was not as meaningful as I had hoped, but overall a great experience.",
    "Excellent. One of the best experiences at Yale."
