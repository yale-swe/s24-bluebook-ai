    "A good summary of occupational and environmental medicine.",
    "I thought this was a great introductory course with amazing guest lectures. It was a great combination of guest lectures and lectures with the primary instructors. The information was very interesting and the papers were good to finish the class with by discussing them. I think the strengths include the classes in which we did exclusively case-studies and discussed them. I think the only weakness would be that the organization was not well-laid out; I wish there was more structure in terms of weekly expectations\/quizzes and the midterm.",
    "boring lectures, but somewhat valuable material. would have taken another course if wasnt required",
    "This is a easy class, good chance to learn something new and get \"H\"",
    "omnibus lectures by different instructors",
    "The material was relevant and fun to learn. All of the resources were accessible and helpful.",
    "Terrific class. Good guest speakers.Need a classroom. Library was too small for number of students taking the course.",
    "Excellent course, very relevant to clinical medicine.",
    "Interesting course that covered broad topics in occupational medicine. I appreciated the overview of the breadth of the field, and understanding the role that occupational physicians and industrial hygienists play in the workplace. I felt that the articles chosen to read were all quite good, but the textbook reading was sometimes quite long and I didn't get a lot out of it.",
    "The course was initially difficult to follow because the basics of the course were somewhat dry. The course improved after including many different speakers, each with different teaching styles which made the class more enjoyable. The flexibility of grading regarding the pop quiz was appreciated. The only thing that I would change is that the popquiz is only given in the first few minutes of the class except to those who come late. Since some classmates come far away places, or have to find places to park or other deterrents to going to class on time, there should be some exceptions made. The course work was very manageable. The only other thing that I would change is making sure that the lectures have less acronyms and have more easily defined occupational and medical terms for those with limited backgrounds in each.",
    "A great course. There are many guest speakers whose lectures are replete with many real-life examples.",
    "Great lecturers.",
    "Very Good",
    "The amount of reading seemed excessive, but it was a great foundation for the environmental health sciences",
    "Nice introductory course. The textbook was an easy read and provided a good framework. I liked having various instructors throughout the semester."

   "comments": [
    "For me it was one choice in a group of required courses, none of which were directly relevant to my areas of interest. It was therefore likely the best alternative because there were some interesting facts learned with at most a moderate workload.",
    "This course is a great introduction to the field of occupational and environmental medicine. It ties in many aspects of medicine already learned, but from a new perspective. The guest lectures are great and you learn a lot.",
    "too early in the morning, very stuffy room. take it for an easy class, not much to learn",
    "This is a interesting and relaxed course. The only thing you have to do is attend the lectues and spend some time to do the reading when you are tired of other classed and need a break. The exam is quite reasonable, you can even answer it just with your intuition.",
    "Recommend this class to colleagues",
    "I loved this course and I believe it is relevant to anyone wishing to work in the public health field.",
    "Great course taught in a relaxed environment.",
    "Yes. Great course and lots to learn.",
    "Overview of issues in occupational medicine. Gave a good sense of how the field functions and the role that these professionals play in protecting health in the workplace. I would recommend it to other students.",
    "This course is a great taste of the world of occupational medicine and is like a great intro course for those interested in medical school. I would definitely recommend this course to other students, especially since the material is taught at the beginners level. The instructors are very knowledgeable and approachable and willing to help.",
    "If you want a sneak-peak into the world of occupational medicine and train yourself to view real-life situations with an occupational perspective, I would highly recommend this course.",
    "Great class.",
    "I would highly recommend this course. It was interesting and really incorporated concepts from all of our environmental classes.",
    "Nice introductory course. Easy to read textbook. Reasonable midterm and final exam expectations."
