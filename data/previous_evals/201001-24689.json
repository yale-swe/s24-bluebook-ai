    "I would recommend the class.",
    "Excellent class. Shame the professor is leaving. Discussions were really fun, and the readings were great.",
    "Sure, if Professor McMeekin is around. I really enjoyed this class. The reading is fun and Professor McMeekin is great.",
    "It was a great class, with an awesome professor and an extremely engaging syllabus. Also it was a low-stress learning environment, which was much appreciated. If something changes and McMeekin re-emerges at Yale to teach this class once more, you should take it. This university needs a real, exciting Soviet historian like McMeekin. A pity he's leaving. In the meantime, look up the syllabus for this course and read some of it. It was exceptionally well constructed.",
    "This class is very fun, totally interesting, and supported by a great reading list especially for those with an interest in Russia and its history. It is not very much work. I wish that the study of history had been more rigorous than it was and that we had been encouraged to go in more depth in our thinking and writing, but I am still glad I took this course as an introduction to the fascinating history of the Soviet Union.",
    "If you want basic Soviet history with a seminar format and not crazy amounts of work, definitely.",
    "Great class, take it."
