   "comments": [
    "I would recommend it as an easy and interesting political science class",
    "Definitely a gutty class. Know the basics of the readings and you should get an easy A.",
    "A class you shouldn't take unless you are dedicated to hours of reading on topics that potentially bore you",
    "I would recommend PLSC 116 to another student depending on their learning style. I would not recommend it to a friend who had concerns about large lecture style classes with relatively limited personal interaction to the professor. However I would easily recommend it to another who enjoyed the subject matter or who was looking for an introductions to political science. That being said, I would describe it in this way: \"Comparative politics is a good class if you're looking for an intro to the subject. It's a little more theoretical than I like, because I like concepts connected more concretely to history, but I like it overall. The workload is reasonable and the professor is good.\" I have recommended the class to many peers and several of my suitemates, I have no regrets in taking it.",
    "PLSC 116 is a good intro into the world of comparative politics and political science more generally. The workload is very manageable and the tests are fairly simple. The material is an approachable yet interesting look into important issues in the field, such as the causes of revolution, ethnic conflict, and state building. A good 5th class or easy So credit if you need one.",
    "3 short papers(2 pages) 10% each graded them pretty easily, midterm 20%, section participation and final",
    "Comparative Politics is a course in which you can learn a ton about how states are formed and how they function. I would recommend it because the readings and lectures were very interesting.",
    "Comparative Politics has a lot of readings and information to be learned, but the breadth of the subjects covered made it a great class as a whole. It's definitely necessary to stay on top of the readings, because you can very easily fall behind (each class has new readings, so they'll pile up very quickly if you neglect a day or two). Professor Lawrence is an effective, friendly lecturer who really makes the class worthwhile.",
    "I would recommend this class to someone who is not looking for a tough class.",
    "PLSC 116 is a broad overview into the field of comparative politics, but also an in depth introduction into many subtopics in the field. You find yourself learning a lot more about democracies, authoritarian regimes, regime sustainability and breakdown, civil wars, and relationships between subpopulations and between governments and their people. I would definitely recommend this course to anyone especially if you plan to major in political science.",
    "Yes, take this class. Easy but you learn a lot, the professor and TAs are great, the material is interesting. Written responses are fun.",
    "Take this class! Interesting material and engaging lectures.",
    "I would say it's a good class to take if you think you may be interested in politics or global affairs, or even if you're just looking for a class to present you with some interesting topics and literature to consider. It's probably on the easier side as far as classes go, so you can take it with more difficult courses and not worry about having an outstanding amount of work to do.",
    "PLS 116 is as much work as you make it to be. That also means that what you get out of this class, which is possibly something substantial, all depends on the individual. This class can be an informative insight to what is happening politically around the world and in the past by understanding theories that affect democracy and authoritarianism, but it can also be a \"boring\" lecture. Overall, I enjoyed the course and found taking it to be very rewarding, but I can also see how if someone were to not put in effort to do the readings or learn about the concepts, it really is just sitting in a room twice a week, doing nothing.",
    "Comparative Politics is a great survey course for anyone thinking of pursuing political science. Many arguments fundamental to the current field of political science are introduced, giving students a look into the theoretical aspects of political science.",
    "I would say the course is a survey of comparative politics, an overview of some major political scientists' theories. Although the course was a little general, I would recommend it to another student because it pushed me to think about new theoretical questions and to apply course content to the real world and to my other courses. This class is really what students make it to be.",
    "Get ready for tons of theories and no exact answers. Welcome to political science, where most things are arbitrary! Good course of you don't want to do homework and can manage to stay awake in class.",
    "Yeah, take it. It has a midterm, a final, section, and 3 short responses. I needed it for my major. It was fine.",
    "Good class to take if you are just getting into the PLSC field",
    "Yes, the course is a fine introduction. It isn't, however, particularly interesting.",
    "This class is fine, I would only suggest it if you are interested in generally comparing politics, otherwise it's pretty dry.",
    "Lecture can sometimes be boring. Topics are interesting but explored at a more superficial level than I had hoped. But good class with low workload and easy. Introduces you to important concepts.",
    "Good intro class. Take if you want to know more about int'l stuff. I'm a senior in poli sci, and I'm glad I did this to open up another area in the field before I graduated. 3 reading responses, fair midterm\/final, section. Good stuff, interesting material. Lawrence is great! She'll even start posting her slides for future semesters, I heard.",
    "A course with a lot of reading but if you didn't have time, you could get away with the summary of notes in class. The actual readings did help sometimes though",
    "This is a course offering a wide range of knowledge in politics. I already have recommended it to multiple people.",
    "This class is great if you know very little about political science and want to gain a broad knowledge of the field and of how states and governments across the world function.",
    "I enjoyed the class and found that it was challenging without it being too hard to succeed. The essays really taught me how to deconstruct an argument and make critiques, which is a really important skill to have. Overall I enjoyed the class and I didn't feel it was too difficult and stressful.",
    "Take this if you are interested in poli sci and\/or if you need credits for the major.",
    "A good intro course. The material is sometimes really interesting and Prof. Lawrence is a great lecturer. She is clear, concise, and knows what she's talking about. However, it can get a little dull at times and you don't really have to do all the reading. There are only 3 reading response papers and those are pretty easy. Overall, it was a good class, especially if you're looking to dip your toes into Political Science.",
    "PLSC 116 is a good intro to Political Science. Be aware that this is Political Science and not Politics. Know that this course discusses possible causes for why things happen in nations and how they may be applied to other nations.",
    "A pretty easy, boring class, from which you can nonetheless learn quite a bit if you manage to pay attention rather than going on Facebook or falling asleep.",
    "I would recommend this class to any Yale student, even one not necessarily interested in political science. It was incredibly interesting and covered a wide range of information making the class very interesting and enjoyable. Professor Lawrence was an amazing professor and lecturer, adding even more to the class. I highly recommend it!",
    "How much you learn is dependent on how much you put into the course. It has a light workload but is a very good general overview of comparative politics.",
    "Interesting, easy intro polisci course. Take if you are considering majoring in Polisci; it should give you a good feel for the discipline.",
    "It's a good overview to the comparative politics \/ polisci domain, take it if you're looking to learn the general basics about the topic, and then see where you'd like to branch off from there, or just take it to gain an understanding of basic functioning of the comparative politics subjects.",
    "I would recommend it to anyone interested in the content and not only to prospective PLSC majors. The workload is doable and the material is interesting.",
    "It's a good course. It feels good to learn the vocabulary and terminology necessary to have intellectual conversations about current events. This course doesn't focus on current events at all, but it's a really nice introduction to political science. Not too difficult."
