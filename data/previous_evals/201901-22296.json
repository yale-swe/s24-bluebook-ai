    "This class taught me some tools to import, handle, and analyze spatial data. Additionally, we reviewed a host of methods -- some unique to spatial data, and some extensions of other forms of data analysis that incorporate features to analyze spatial data. It was incredibly helpful to learn in the context of R language.",

   "comments": [
    "Strengths - cover lots of different methods, final project gives space to deeply engage with spatial data and various techniques to analyze; Henry, the TA, is one of the greatest strengths of this class -- his dedication, lectures on the practical applications and tools to analyze spatial data were invaluable. He also made time to discuss outside the class, which is key when encountering problems when handling spatial data. Weakness - lots of different techniques to interpret and digest by the end of the semester",
    "The material is too much to apprehend in a semester",
    "The course is a bit disorganized there isnt a lot of definitive work in spatial statistics because it is a more recent field. The information is valuable if you have spatial data to work with and complements the understanding of stats developed in most other courses."

    "Yup!",
    "yes!!!!!!",
    "If you have a dataset youre interested in or want to do public health or environmental work, then this course would be very useful."
