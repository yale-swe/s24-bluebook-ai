    "Thorough introduction to the subfield of semantics.",
    "I better understand the structure of sentences and how we interpret language",
    "In Semantics I, I learned the basics of predicate logic, tree-drawing, and improved my understanding of fundamental aspects of natural language.",
    "Understanding of the semantics branch of linguistics and how to do things like syntax trees and lambda calculus",
    "Semantics I was a highly engaging class. Prof. Barros taught the material with humor, interest, and a keen sense of how students learn and behave. He was extraordinarily flexible with his time, always willing to look back over concepts the class was struggling with. Despite this, it never felt like the pace of the class lagged. On the contrary, we moved at a very fair clip, and it was fascinating to see how people use language in a more mathematical, formulaic way. I definitely feel I have a better understanding of the underlying reasons of how humans use language, and I entirely plan to take the next term when it happens!",
    "I'm honestly not sure.",
    "I learned the basics of formal semantics, from Predicate Logic to Lamdba Calculus. I learned to think about language in a quantitative way, applying the concept of arguments and functions to natural language.",
    "Learned what semantics was, how to determine linguistic meaning, lamdba calculus, how to construct syntax trees.",
    "You develop the ability to deconstruct sentences into semantic trees and understand how each word in the sentence functions to contribute to the overall meaning of the sentence.",
    "pretty good intro to logic and semantic representations of natural language! matt does a pretty good job of introducing concepts and answering questions.",
    "I learned to think more critically about everyday language quirks that I probably otherwise wouldn't question.",
    "I developed a detailed understanding of how meaning is derived from language.",
    "Much knowledge of basic syntax trees, lambda calculus, and predicate logic, and an idea of what the study of our unconscious language knowledge entails."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The weekly quiz\/homework structure worked really well to facilitate learning. Class was on Mon & Wed, section was on Fri, and Monday was when we had quizzzes and when homework was due, so we had from Wednesday to Monday to complete the homework and prepare for the quizzes, which meant that if you were committed to learning the material really well, then the course was structured to allow you to do that. A weakness of the class would be that sometimes the load of material was unevenly distributed. There were weeks when we moved 2-3 times faster than what should be reasonably expected, perhaps to make up for some weeks when we covered much less material.",
    "The course was remarkably well tailored to students' interests and ability levels. A minor weakness would be the pacing; the first three-quarters of the course were straightforward and eminently possible to follow, while the assignments for the last quarter were much more difficult and did not have as much time spent on background review.",
    "Strength was the structure - weekly quizzes and assignments with no midterm or final, although I think having the quiz and the assignment due on the same day most weeks was pointless. Probably more productive to have the quiz Monday and assignment Wednesday or vice versa Also started very easy and then escalated quickly to being very difficult so maybe that could be improved as well",
    "This course is not a very difficult course, per se, but it is intellectually stimulating and fascinating to be present in. The no-test syllabus was very helpful for me in terms of balancing my time (there are weekly quizzes, a weekly homework assignment, and sometimes some reading, but that's it). This course could be made better potentially by moving faster -- we only got through some of the material we originally planned to by the end of the term. That being said, however, some students had difficulty with the material we were learning, so going faster might have made it harder for some of the class to keep up.",
    "The class was a mixture of seminar and lecture-style learning. The group work that we did was helpful and aided our learning. The class discussions, however, would often slow down the pace of the class and bring us off topic. If there were more delineation between lecture and seminar, I believe the course would have moved more smoothly.",
    "I think that the level of difficulty changed drastically from the first month to the last months of the course.",
    "The course was pretty relaxed and moved at the pace the students were learning. This was a bit of a problem as sometimes the course felt sluggish and stayed on a topic for too long. The course could have moved faster. Otherwise, it was well taught and the textbook was a good introduction so overall a good course.",
    "Matt was really good at doing things at the right pace, answering student questions, making sure we actually understood what we were learning. Overall, I gained a really good basic understanding of semantics, lambda calculus, etc. The workload is very manageable. While the material got much more difficult by the end of the course, what we did on psets was always directly related to what we learned in class\/in the textbook.",
    "I liked the classes themselves and thought they were a nice mix of class participation and lecturing. I wasn't a big fan of the fact that the same few students contributed more than others, since I felt it created a weird dynamic. I thought the problem sets and quizzes were mostly fair, but some were considerably longer than others and not worth much more, which was kind of frustrating. Sometimes it also felt like we were having quizzes just to have them and not because we had actually learned very much that week, which could be improved. Also, I felt like the problem sets were designed to help us learn new information on our own, but at times I think it would have been more valuable to learn this information in class and then put it in practice by doing the homework.",
    "This class should not count as a QR credit. I have no idea why it counts as a QR credit. We play with lambda \"functions\" and truth tables, but that's about as QR-y as it gets. The only thing that flagging it as a QR credit does is draw a bunch of humanities (& related) majors to the class looking to fulfill their distributional requirements, and as a result we moved SO SO slowly the entire semester. The greatest weakness was definitely the pace. We spent a ridiculous amount of time covering extremely straightforward concepts like truth tables and words as functions, to the point where I literally never had to study outside of class because we covered so little material.",
    "The strengths of this course were Professor Barros's lectures, which were well-organized and interactive, and I always felt I could ask questions. I liked how we got a chance to practice new things we learned in class, and I found section very helpful. A weakness is that the homeworks were sometimes sporadic in terms of length and difficulty, so it was hard to predict how long they would take. Also I found the textbook very dense and kind of hard to understand, and I wish the feedback on the homework was more detailedI often wasn't sure what my mistakes were.",
    "The structure of the course was greatI much preferred regular homework assignments and quizzes to midterms and finals. Had I had to cram twice a semester for a large exam, I would not have learned nearly as much. Courses structured like this are a rarity at Yale and I was very glad to take one. I learned the material much more solidly with the gradual approach, and it did not stress me out along with all of my other classes at the regular times of year.",
    "It could cover a lot more material and faster."

   "comments": [
    "This is an interesting class and a great QR for anyone interested in language and who doesn't have strong algebra or calculus skills, because we didn't use any mathematics. It was all formulas based on language structures.",
    "I would; it is interesting and not very challenging. A good class if you are interested in the material.",
    "Yes! Semantics is a somewhat idiosyncratic item of study, but is definitely worth your time, especially if you are a humanities or foreign languages student interested in better understanding meaning in natural language.",
    "Yes! If you're not a math person and you want a QR, this is a great one. Also great for potential Ling majors or language-oriented people. Intro Ling course not necessary",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to any student who is interested in learning a more mathematical way to approach language formation. It's also a QR class, but has no prerequisites and isn't really too mathy, so don't worry about it if you don't feel like you're very good at math. There's no calculus (the lambda-calculus is a very different thing, you'll find out), and most of the \"QR-y\" parts of the course are really just about thinking mathematically and being able to apply basic logic rules. Additionally, given the relatively light workload and forgiving syllabus, I would definitely recommend this as a fifth class. While not just a gut, you really don't have to study too much as long as you feel you understood the concepts in class. Finally, don't be worried by the cross-listing under the graduate program -- despite the potentially intimidating aspects of having grad students in the course, it's really very manageable even if you don't have a background in linguistics (I didn't, and I did well without really any stress).",
    "Probably not. I don't really feel like I learned anything in this class, certainly not anything I really understand or could make use of in the future.",
    "Yes, I would recommend Semantics I. It is intriguing, although I suspect that the most interesting concepts of semantics are found at higher levels. Semantics I made me think about language in a novel way and I got to exercise my quantitative reasoning skills.",
    "I had always wanted to take a linguistics class, but I didn't really know what linguistics was. After this course I do not plan to pursue this discipline further. That being said, this class challenges me to think in a different way than my other classes. I learned new skills that, while probably won't be very useful in my life\/future studies, were interesting. I think this course started off a bit boring to me personally, but then suddenly got really hard. However, the professor and TA provide lots of support including am optional section and office hours. The textbook is online, so you could probably ask for the link to see if this material interests you. I don't regret taking this course, but it's definitely not for everyone.",
    "I'd recommend it if you are interested in getting an introduction to semantics and want a pretty easy QR. This was especially helpful coming from a literature background so understanding the under working mechanisms that create semantic meaning was useful.",
    "i needed it for my major - but honestly, it's a pretty great QR to take if you're just not a numbers person. that being said, to call it an easy QR or a gut would, in my opinion, be an insult to matt - take the course because you find the subject matter interesting, and you'll have a great time! because of that, i'd definitely recommend it to everyone.",
    "Definitely would recommend as a class; workload was manageable, subject matter was interesting (especially as a humanities personwhat we learned felt applicable to humanities courses I was in).",
    "I would recommend this course to a student interested in linguistics (although I think there are other intro linguistics course that cover a broader range of topics) and is curious about the language we employ every day, although I would caution that no final\/midterms and weekly quizzes\/p-sets requires more week-to-week engagement and endurance rather than a couple big pushes each semester (which may work better depending on peoples' learning habits).",
    "This class is a HUGE gut. Do not take it if you want to learn a lot of cool linguistics. Do take it if you want to cover 4 short chapters of a tiny textbook over the course of 14 weeks. For some reason completely unbeknownst to me, Semantics counts as a QR credit, which means the class is filled with a bunch of humanities (& related) majors looking to fulfill their distributional requirements with a fun n interesting linguistics class. As a result, we moved extremely slowly through the course material, and probably covered half of what the prof originally intended. Super gutty in terms of workload--you cover minimal content in class, have weekly homework assignments on the content, and a weekly 10 min quiz that's just a shorter, easier version of the homework. No midterm, no papers, no effort, not much learning.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to someone looking for an interesting, not too work-heavy QR. While the material was often challenging, the workload was very little (no midterm or final, only weekly quizzes and homework). The material is probably not something you will use if you aren't a linguistics major, but it is interesting to get a closer look at the inner workings of language.",
    "Absolutelya great QR credit. The material is engaging but not impossible, and taught at a pace that is never overwhelming. It is also so exciting to research our unconscious language knowledge; I delighted in being aware that everyone in the room is an expert in spoken English, and our task was to understand how and why we are. In other QRs, especially ones non-STEM students take for a QR credit, people are relatively shy about asking questions and coming up with counter examples, because they do not feel comfortable with the material. In semantics everyone has a very high base knowledge of the material, and working backwards from it encouraged participation."
