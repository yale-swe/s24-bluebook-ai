   "comments": [
    "Instructor: James Edward Nati \u00a0James was a great TA. He availed himself to answer questions via email at any time during the semester and encouraged us to contact him if we ever find ourselves confused with the material. He was a great discussion facilitator and allowed for students' voices to be heard. He graded the exegesis papers extremely quickly, which I am grateful for and gave good feedback. Very happy with him overall!",
    "Instructor: James Edward Nati \u00a0Best teaching fellow I have had at YDS. James was organized, well informed, and his first-day guidelines were fantastic. Encouraging students to talk to each other and not only to him was positive. I think James managed well with students' hope that in section we might digest the lecture, when in fact we had separate material to cover. The time went quickly, but since James had outlined our objectives, we almost always either got through them, or had an awareness of how far we had gotten. Sending out reminder emails before each section was such a great addition, especially for first-year students. The exam prep in section was so helpful. James did a great job.",
    "Instructor: James Edward Nati \u00a0James was very professional and thorough. He was very responsive to my concerns and adjustment to the class. He managed the section dynamics well.",
    "Instructor: James Edward Nati \u00a0The strengths of James as a teaching fellow were primarily in the way he organized section and the feedback he offered on papers and to questions. I valued the objectives and target questions given at the beginning of section; they helped guide and keep section on track, allowing us to move quickly and thoroughly through the material. His comments on my exegesis paper were insightful and helpful in helping me to understood my grade, and his comments helping me formulate my paper topic helped me develop a strong paper.",
    "Instructor: James Edward Nati \u00a0James was an exceptional teaching fellow. He demanded respect and engagement, but was kind and understanding in a way that invited discussion. He has a natural ability to lead discussions and seminars in a way that bodes well for a teaching career.",
    "Instructor: James Edward Nati \u00a0James ia a superb, simply superb teaching fellow. He was consistently prepared, highly sensitive to diversity questions and commitments, and responded to my emails outside of class. At times I was worried my emails would be pestering; to the contrary, James seemed to relish the opportunity to educate a dedicated student at every opportunity. His temperament is perfectly suited to educating divinity students, and he was a pleasure to learn from. Thank you James.",
    "Instructor: James Edward Nati \u00a0James was very organized pedagogically; we always had clear learning objectives in sections.",
    "Instructor: James Edward Nati \u00a0Did a fantastic job.",
    "Instructor: James Edward Nati \u00a0James was excellent. Sections were well-organized. Discussion was always on topic and the environment was one that welcomed participation by all. James was very responsive to emails, and he was very willing to offer help with the essay and exams.",
    "Instructor: James Edward Nati \u00a0Well organized, 'made time for each student, very knowledgeable.",
    "Instructor: James Edward Nati \u00a0Well-prepared and organized, with a strong grasp of the biblical material as well as the academic approaches covered. His teaching could be improved by continuing to get in front of different classes of students.",
    "Instructor: James Edward Nati \u00a0James was an engaging, knowledgable, and approachable TA. If given the opportunity, I would certainly take a section under his tutelage again.",
    "Instructor: James Edward Nati \u00a0James was a great teaching fellow. Sections were well-organized and very helpful for the class overall.",
    "Instructor: James Edward Nati \u00a0James was very approachable and helpful as a TF this semester. He was willing to engage with multiple opinions in section meetings. He was also easy to understand when taking more of a \"lecturing\" role in order that course content be clarified. I have no suggestions for improvement.",
    "Instructor: James Edward Nati \u00a0James is an excellent teaching fellow. He always came to section prepared and interested in how we could contribute to the overall lesson. He took adequate time to meet with me outside of class and provide mentorship on possible doctoral work in the future. I appreciate his teaching style. His teaching can be improved with better time management during sections But he was always timely with responses to questions, and feedback on assignments.",
    "Instructor: Justin Joel White \u00a0Justin made our section interesting and challenging and interactive. I think everyone in the section was glad we had him as our TA. One disappointment is I felt some guidance he gave me in our one-on-one meeting about the exegesis led me to write the paper in a way that was later dinged in the grading. But overall it was a great experience.",
    "Instructor: Justin Joel White \u00a0Justin was an exceptional Teaching Fellow. He clearly put in extra time to ensure that we, his students, would benefit from the aid he could provide so all students could perform well. On tests and papers, he provided quality commentary and feedback. He is also a talented lecturer; speaking comes natural to him. The only thing that could be worked on is his tendency to go off on an anecdotal aside--that were generally related to topics being discussed, but were not always fully relevant and time could have been better spent on the proper topic material. That said, Justin was a wonderful Teaching Fellow who was clearly interested in making sure all of his students could perform admirably in class and section. He was open to all perspectives, and seemed to care if students were \"on the same page\" so to speak. Any class would be lucky to have him as a T.F.",
    "Instructor: Justin Joel White \u00a0Good TF. Kept discussion on track and respected diverse points of view, perhaps to a fault. :) Pleasant in personal and electronic interaction.",
    "Instructor: Justin Joel White \u00a0Great TF. Knowledgable in the course material and does a good job provoking and facilitating discussion.",
    "Instructor: Justin Joel White \u00a0Great TF!",
    "Instructor: Justin Joel White \u00a0STRENGTHS: - Well-prepared - Engaged students in conversations and asked challenging questions - Made the time to meet outside of class (more than once) to discuss exegesis paper WEAKNESSES: - Needs to start and end on time. I was consistently running late for a section that met directly after this one.",
    "Instructor: Justin Joel White \u00a0Justin was a great TF. He did a good job leading section and facilitating discussion. He also helped me finally figure out how to write an exegesis paper.",
    "Instructor: Justin Joel White \u00a0Justin was amamzing! Could not have asked for a better TF!!",
    "Instructor: Justin Joel White \u00a0Justin was a very good TF. He made sure that everyone had an opportunity to speak, and in the few sections that included lecture materials, he was very clear.",
    "Instructor: Justin Joel White \u00a0Justin led great section discussions w\/what I thought was a good combination of guidance\/structure and freedom\/letting us work ideas out among ourselves. Appreciated his directness and willingness to take questions\/make time for them. Strengths incl. ability to recognize issues at play in a student's question & how to connect that to the bigger picture; also broad knowledge base & ability to correct and clarify subtle\/structural components of the material when they got murky. Seemed like he actually cared whether we understood things, & was willing to meet students' level of engagement\/effort towards that end.",
    "Instructor: Justin Joel White \u00a0Justin also has evident command of the subject matter. He was available and extremely helpful to assist me and the other students.",
    "Instructor: Justin Joel White \u00a0Weakness: Wish we knew about the class objectives earlier in the course. Some of the concepts were a bit confusing and they weren't clarified until later in the course. Strengths: Facilitated conversations.",
    "Instructor: Justin Joel White \u00a0Mr. White was encouraging and supportive toward students. He seemed to have a desire for them to succeed. I preferred the discussion sessions where he lectured rather than the ones where he just let other people discuss the material. He is good at presenting information in a clear and concise way. He was always responsive to questions. The only downside was that the discussion was dominated by a few people while others had to struggle to get a word in. This is a common problem in discussion groups. I hope the Teaching Fellows will find a way to make sure that everyone has a chance to participate. I think that Mr. White will make an excellent professor.",
    "Instructor: Justin Joel White \u00a0I thought Justin was committed to helping us understand all the concepts necessary to excel in the class. I was concerned about the exegesis paper and the final, but having the opportunity to speak with him allowed me to voice my concerns. It also allowed Justin to share his. Justin embraced his teaching with a seriousness of purpose and a preparedness that did not go unnoticed and was much appreciated.",
    "Instructor: Justin Joel White \u00a0Great written feedback on paper, open to meet with students and answer any questions, really engaged with material, sincere interest in the success of students in the section. Not TF specific, but the role of the discussion section was not always clear in its relation to the course's aims overall. Rather than act as a supplement to the lectures or a place within which to sort out the questions arising out of course material, section often felt like a parallel but somewhat independent track to engage with the class material.",
    "Instructor: Justin Joel White \u00a0Justin was fair, helpful, kind, relevant, and did a great job of moderating discussion.",
    "Instructor: Justin Joel White \u00a0Justin taught constructively. However, his grading did not reflect the guidance he offered when setting expectations. He also lacked equity in grading, admitting that exams that were graded earlier in his grading process always were assessed more strictly than those graded later.",
    "Instructor: Justin Joel White \u00a0Justin was a terrific instructor. He always came to class well prepared, even given his extenuating life circumstances. Justin thoughtfully encouraged students to contact him outside of class time regarding concerns or questions, and overall was an inviting, enthusiastic instructor. I found no particular fault with his teaching style in section. One broader suggestion that I have for sections, outside of Justin's, I is encouraging the implementation of alternative forms of interaction and participation during section, as some students may well have benefitted from other forms of participation rather than simply raising their hand and speaking in class on their own motivation.",
    "Instructor: Justin Joel White \u00a0Justin was highly knowledgeable and conveyed course material with clarity and concern for the students comprehension. He created an atmosphere for engagement, answered questions proficiently, and was very helpful with exam preparation.",
    "Instructor: Justin Joel White \u00a0Justin was always willing to go past what was in the texts and supplemental readings to apply theological frameworks to real life scenarios. He was also helpful in helping to develop a strong sense of what exegesis was for me. I would only like to see the sections stay more on topic (which is in large part due to students asking unrelated questions).",
    "Instructor: Mark Andrew Lester \u00a0Strengths - Mark was a terrific teaching fellow. He was extremely knowledgeable about the material and well prepared for every section meeting, he encouraged discussion, he kept a disciplined focus on what we needed to cover, and he did a nice job with exam prep. I also want to mention Mark's earnestness and kindness. He was simply lovely, and our class responded accordingly. He would ol be a great teacher. Weaknesses - I honestly can't think of anything I would change.",
    "Instructor: Mark Andrew Lester \u00a0Mark is kind, patient, and receptive to feedback. He is available outside of class and is always in a cheerful and friendly mood. I greatly appreciated Mark's ability to connect with his students. I felt cared for and also intentionally lead through the readings and reviews for the course.",
    "Instructor: Mark Andrew Lester \u00a0Mark's sections were very helpful. The quality of discussion improved over the semester, in part because his skills in leading discussion improved. Gave helpful comments on my paper. Excellent TF!",
    "Instructor: Mark Andrew Lester \u00a0Mark was great. Always prepared and accomodating when it was needed and reasonable. He was always well-prepared for section and worked hard to keep it interesting and relevant to what we needed to know.",
    "Instructor: Mark Andrew Lester \u00a0Mark was a great TF and I'm so glad I got to be in his section. He encouraged really great discussions and always made sure everyone had an opportunity to be heard and ask questions. I found out halfway through the semester that this was his first time teaching - he did such a great job, I never would have known this was his first time teaching!",
    "Instructor: Mark Andrew Lester \u00a0Mark is very good a facilitating discussion and including all students in the discussion, be it in section itself or outside of class. He is thoughtful and helpful with assignments and with preparing for exams. He clearly cares about doing his job well, which sets him apart from many other TFs.",
    "Instructor: Mark Andrew Lester \u00a0Mark is one of the best TFs I have had at YDS. He does a great job at facilitating discussion; he knows when to go more in depth on certain points for a more fruitful discussion. He is also very adaptable, he doesn't seem tied down to managing section exactly as he may have planned to. However, he still addresses the relevant issues. On a related note, on request he started giving a brief synopsis of the week's class sessions about halfway through the semester. This covered the relevant information, while not taking too long. He was also very accessible outside of class; he met with me regarding my paper and gave me helpful advice. In general he was very personable, and seemed to really care about both the people in his section and doing a good job with teaching. No complaints.",
    "Instructor: Mark Andrew Lester \u00a0Mark was a fantastic TF. He was consistently well-prepared for section and had a good grasp of the material. When he was unsure about a topic he was honest about it. He worked hard to ensure that everyone was encouraged to participate and to draw students into the conversation.",
    "Instructor: Mark Andrew Lester \u00a0Strengths: knowledgeable, respectful Weaknesses: presented material not in the most organized way",
    "Instructor: Mark Andrew Lester \u00a0Mark was a kind and thoughtful section leader who clearly cared about including all students in the discussion and listened as well as instructed. The outside reading material was covered well and new ideas were introduced in an accessible and respectful manner.",
    "Instructor: Mark Andrew Lester \u00a0Strength: well-organized section with informative agendas sent by email beforehand. Weakness: can't think of any!",
    "Instructor: Mark Andrew Lester \u00a0Amazing leadership in section! Kind and careful attention given to students thoughts and questions. Excellent feedback on papers. Much appreciated!",
    "Instructor: Mark Andrew Lester \u00a0STRENGTHS: - very conscientious about tying class material into sections - demonstrated clear understanding of material - always was able to provide answers to questions and provide clarification of class and non-class material WEAKNESSES: none that I can think of",
    "Instructor: Mark Andrew Lester \u00a0Mr. Lester shows a clear desire to be helpful, and was effective when he answered questions and aided us in understanding. He was also very open to feedback, and was responsive to the needs of the group. I met with him once outside of class and really appreciated his feedback, which was clear and very helpful.",
    "Instructor: Mark Andrew Lester \u00a0I truly appreciated my experience with Mark over the course of this semester. I found Mark to be incredibly knowledgable about the field with a penchant for communicating weighty topics in a digestible way. Mark also worked proactively to ensure that learning accommodations were made in concert with the Resource Office on Disabilities. These accommodations freed me to fully engage with the material, rather than feeling paralyzed by anxiety. For example, my exegesis \"paper\" turned into a half hour lecture that I delivered to Mark also had a knack for responding the interests of our small group during out weekly section meetings. There was one meeting in particular when we were delving into the issue of race I also found Mark to be incredibly thoughtful. I did horribly on the midterm exam... like just performed really poorly. That really shook my confidence in my ability to be successful at YDS. Mark helped me put a plan into place & empowered me with words of affirmation. After one particular section meeting, he sent me a personal note praising the contribution I had been making in helping to drive our discussions forward. I will remember that note forever because unbeknownst to him, I was really reconsidering whether I really had much to offer YDS academically. He reminded me, in clear terms, that indeed I do.",
    "Instructor: Mark Andrew Lester \u00a0I really appreciated how Mark always came to section thoroughly prepared: every time we sat down together, it was clear that he had a structured lesson ready and had come up with meaningful ways to help us interact with the readings and concepts for that week. He was also very good at emailing us before section to recommend things for us to focus on in our readings and ways to prepare for section. He also gave ample opportunities for us to ask questions in section and get help outside of section as needed."
