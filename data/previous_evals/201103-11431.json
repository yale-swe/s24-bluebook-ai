   "comments": [
    "Awesome! Great readings and interesting discussions.",
    "I really enjoyed the course. If you're a WGSS junior, you get to discuss some pretty interesting pieces of theory with the people in your major. The readings are really dense, and most of us never really grasped them in their entirety. That's pretty unavoidable, though, when dealing with this kind of material. The workload's pretty manageable and Inderpal was awesome. It'll probably be taught with a different professor and a different syllabus in the future, but it's a pretty interesting course.",
    "You should only take this class if you have to, which means you should only take it if you're a WGSS major. If you are a major, try to keep an open mind, and find something at least marginally interesting about it, or else you'll be at a loss for what to write the final paper about. Otherwise, non-WGSS majors: don't bother.",
    "Great readings, great professor, important topic. Most of the students are junior WGSS majors, which means that everyone's really passionate and knows how to discuss the material intelligently, but others shouldn't be deterred from taking the class, as there were a few non-majors who all kept up fine and weren't at all disadvantaged or excluded. Take it!",
    "It's a great class. Exposes you to many different ways of thinking - not only about gender and sexuality either.",
    "Whether or not you are a WGSS major, if you want to read major important texts\/learn about theory then this class will do that for you. However, the individual presentations on the readings were very unhelpful and pretty boring, so see if there is a better way of using class time. Inderpal is an absolute pleasure. Assignments were very fair.",
    "The content of the course is exactly what the title promises. Some readings are brilliant and some are entirely incomprehensible. Class discussion doesn't always elucidate what the latter set intend to articulate. I liked having our whole cohort of junior majors together (great for building community and learning what everyone is interested in studying), but contributions from non-majors in the class were perhaps even better. If you're a WGSS major, this course is a requirement. If you're not a major but have a background in philosophy or any other highly theoretical discipline, this course is an important counterpoint to more mainstream Western intellectual history.",
    "If you're considering this class, you probably have to take it. So remember that WGSS majors are extremely frustrating in seminar, there's nothing to be done about that. Do as much of the reading as you want, but I know that the days I got the most out of the class were the ones I did all of the reading and brought a notebook instead of a computer. You'll get a nice introduction to everything you \"need\" to know to be educated in the field of gender studies and really interrogate a lot of your own assumptions about history\/colonialism\/etc.",
    "very interesting reads and discussions",
    "Inderpal is the best. You should definitely take a class with her, even if it isn't this one. It was really helpful to have this background in theory--even if I don't always enjoy theory--and the class isn't too much work.",
    "Excellent, excellent course! The readings are manageable, the discussion was in my term exceedingly good (and I have no doubts for the future), Prof. Grewal did an outstanding job, and the subject matter is both important and captivating."
