   "comments": [
    "Strengths is that we cover a lot of important material in depth.",
    "I really enjoyed this course. All of the material presented was interesting and relevant. I would have liked to learn a little more about the biology of nutrition; however, given the structure of the course, I'm not sure there would have been time. The handouts provided were extremely helpful, but I would have liked more structure to the course in terms of presentation of the material. The case-studies were interesting and helped tie together social, cultural and political challenges to nutrition. There was a lot more work than I had anticipated, but I leave the course with a much greater understanding of global nutrition and its challenging factors.I also really liked that Dr. Humphries invited us all to her house for dinner. It was fun getting to know her and my classmates better.",
    "The work would all happen at once and the classroom discussions were too basic. The professor was very kind and the material was great.",
    "I liked the topics that were covered, and some of the assignments were helpful. I particularly enjoyed module 2 and the structure of this part of the course. The textbook was challenging and frustrating at times. This made the quizzes frustrating as well. I really liked the book review. I liked the final project, though the instructions were a bit unclear. I also wish the paper could have been an individual paper, as it was difficult to coordinate writing a group paper.",
    "-liked the three modules--good way to break up course and look at issues from different angles-felt as if there were one too many assignments--would take out the food security analysis-really really enjoyed the book review books\/discussion-found the textbook helpful-didn't feel My Ishmael was necessary, or maybe not enough time was given to its discussion-case studies were my favorite part--great way to apply the material learned-final project could have used more guidance-found the sheets in class more helpful and interactive than a powerpoint would have been-Debbie and Isabel were fantastic and clearly very knowledgeable",
    "Strengths: in dept observation of the relationships between nutrition and chronic\/infectious disease. Assignments were diverse and interesting and promoted group discussions.Weaknesses: some of the discussions would have benefited in the use of additional case studies or activities to maintain the conversation and promote open discussion.",
    "Great course! Strengths - great professor and TA, good readings, goes over a wide variety of material, fun projects. Weaknesses - poor discussion in class, quizzes were sometimes based on memorizing little facts in readings rather than major take aways.Improvements - better leading of discussions. This is not only on the professor, but the students!",
    "really enjoyed learning the material for this class, and a lot of the discussions and readings were thought-provoking, but the workload was a bit too much at times; liked how we were able to brainstorm interventions for SNEHA, but the group final paper was hard to coordinate in our group.. I would prefer an individual paper if possible",
    "Strengths: case studiesWeakness: inadequate instructions for assignments",
    "I really liked the evidence-based nature of the course but what the evidence comes down to is that nutrition is really hard to evaluate and no one knows concretely what any nutrient does. I liked case studies best and think there should be more throughout the course to break up the dense material and put it into a practical context.",
    "I learned a lot in this course, and I thought it did a great job of typing nutrition into the subjects of policy and infectious disease. It was a lot of work, the readings are required, there are daily quizzes. But I felt this forced you to come prepared to discuss the material in class. However, discussion sometimes felt forced and there was sometimes general confusion about what was being discussed. I think breaking out into groups to discuss questions or the handouts helped with this. However, I think class discussions could be improved by having smaller sub-questions to progress toward the larger topic at hand to keep the flow of discussion going, instead of just having one big overwhelming question to discuss.",
    "The course was great at teaching skills pertinent to public health practice, specifically in nutrition. I also learned a lot about nutritional interventions and ideas. The course, however, was incredibly work-intensive and could use a little cleaning in the amount of work that is involved.",
    "It was my first discussion oriented course at YSPH. I enjoyed how the professor expected the class to contribute. At times the discussion section was a little too vague and general. I would expect something more engaging and specific.",
    "Excellent course in the field of global nutrition, particularly in developing countries. Several diverse projects that increased exposure to different aspects of global food and nutrition. Depth of material is appropriate to the subject in this setting."

   "comments": [
    "Instructor: Debbie Lee Humphries \u00a0Debbie is very knowledgable on the subject matter.The workload was a lot to manage and sometimes felt unnecessary.",
    "Instructor: Debbie Lee Humphries \u00a0Very approachable and passionate about this work.",
    "Instructor: Debbie Lee Humphries \u00a0Debbie was amazing and inspirational. Clearly passionate. It shows that she cares about the topic and took her time to give us the best handouts.",
    "Instructor: Debbie Lee Humphries \u00a0She is very knowledgeable, and her questions and comments are always thoughtful. However, she can be a bit intimidating in her presentation style, which makes it difficult for some to speak out and answer her discussion questions. I also feel that some assignments were not graded fairly. It may have helped if rubrics had been available for every assignment.",
    "Instructor: Debbie Lee Humphries \u00a0Dr. Humphries has developed a course within the EMD department that allows for both EMD and non-EMD students who wish to have a nutrition focus to understand its impact in disease. She provided us with early one on one interviews to assess our interests and allow them to be incorporated into the lessons. She also developed assignments that were diverse and creative approaches to evaluate knowledge of the subject matter.",
    "Instructor: Debbie Lee Humphries \u00a0Awesome person, all around! Very knowledgeable, very nice, intelligent, good teacher. In order to make discussions better, maybe warm people up by talking more in small groups and then getting into talking with the whole class.",
    "Instructor: Debbie Lee Humphries \u00a0led very thought-provoking discussions and was always willing to answer our questions; i appreciated the fact that she had one-on-one meetings with us in the beginning of class to get to know us better and to cater the class more towards our personal interests in food and nutrition",
    "Instructor: Debbie Lee Humphries \u00a0It was boring hearing about statistics every class. This class had a lot of potential to be greater than what it actually is? This class is entitled global aspects not just strictly global statistics of malnutrition. There was no humanity aspect of this course. As someone in the Global Health Concentration I am no more equipped to travel abroad next summer than I was before I began taking the coarse.",
    "Instructor: Debbie Lee Humphries \u00a0Debbie is incredibly knowledgeable and I appreciate her love for discussion. We had great discussions at the beginning then it waned. Then it picked up again in the second module. Then is waned in the third module. If there is any way to keep the enthusiasm up that would be best.",
    "Instructor: Debbie Lee Humphries \u00a0Always amazed at her knowledge on the subject. I enjoyed the format of the class, and I liked her handouts and most assignments. I felt there was sometimes a gap between what she was asking us to do, and what the students understood--these small communication problems couldbe frustrating. But overall, I learned a lot in this class and I felt Dr. Humphries worked hard to really get individual feedback and to speak with all of us about our interests and concerns, which I really appreciated.",
    "Instructor: Debbie Lee Humphries \u00a0Debbie Humphries is a decent instructor. She gives multiple perspectives, invokes creative thinking, and takes into account student feedback. She may need to think about making rubrics so that assignments are more straight-forward, but overall, she was good.",
    "Instructor: Debbie Lee Humphries \u00a0Excellent instructor with solid and practical knowledge base. Led discussions on specific topics which were illuminative. Reinforced readings. Able to emphasize consistent themes through the specific examples."

    "Instructor: Isabel Martinez \u00a0Isabel is awesome!! So approachable and really nice. She was really flexible about taking a quiz outside of class or whatever you wanted to talk about. I really liked her case studies, but maybe they could have been shorter so we could have spent more time onthe questions.",

    "-would definitely recommend, but would tell another student about the work load (number of assignments, daily quizzes for 2 modules, final project, etc)-thoroughly enjoyed the class and learned a great deal",
    "Good course, would definitely recommend it. Definitely a big time commitment to study for quizzes everyday, and the projects are time consuming but really enjoyable. Really good professor, just be ready to participate in discussions.",
    "I was surprised to find out that I found the agriculture and food production topics more interesting than I had anticipated; learned a lot about interventions and where our food comes from",
    "Less quizzes.More discussion where students can give personal input.More cultural aspect can be incorporated into the course",
    "I would recommend this course to those interested in nutrition and possible interventions so you understand how complex the whole thing is.",
    "If you want a overview on how nutrition issues in developing countries, this is for you. I recommend this course.",
    "Excellent introduction to global aspects of food and nutrition. Reading material relevant. Multiple projects help highlight different aspects of the challenges in developing countries. Frequent quizzes on reading material, but no in-class tests. Major group project at end of term was instructive."
