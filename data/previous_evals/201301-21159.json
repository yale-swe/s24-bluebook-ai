   "comments": [
    "Problems in the History of Science is an amazing way to get immersed in the field's historiography. Rankin is an exceptional professor. In the beginning of the semester, he told us that we would learn how to read, write and speak. I am pleased to report that I developed in all of these most fundamental of areas. I am walking away from the course with a much better understanding of how to position my work in the context of larger debates. I highly highly highly recommend this course.",
    "Yes, I would absolutely recommend this class to another student. Even coming from outside of HSHM, I found this a veryhelpful course. I came away with a good sense of HSHM as a field, improved academic skills, and a much better understanding of the sociology of academic knowledge production. This isn't a \"great books in the history of science class,\" nor really a methods class in the traditional sense -- but nonetheless (or, perhaps, because of this) deeply helpful and a lot of fun.",
    "I would highly recommend this class to other students. It trains students to learn the skills necessary to succeed in graduate school. It prepares students' to read and organize the reading materials in a way that prepares them for heavier reading burdens in the future. Furthermore, it provides a general overview of the state of the field which allows students to engage with current authors and researchers and ask novel questions that derives from those readings.",
    "HSHM is an introduction to major contemporary issues\/conversations in the history of science. Would recommend because it offers a great deal of content within a framework that really allows the student to become comfortable with the material.",
    "This was a great class. The workload was daunting, not so much in number of pages but in the specific information you're expected to extractfrom them. The weekly reading notes were a very helpful exercise, however, and I feel like I am truly a better reader than I was four months ago. This is also thanks to fantastic class discussion, itself the result of both engaged classmates and a fantastic professor. If you ever have a chance to study with Bill--in this class or another--do it! Few are so thorough and precise in their advice.",
    "Yes. Learned great grad student skills, including how to read efficiently and engage across disciplines.",
    "The course is, as it's described, an overview of current and recent work in history of science, oriented towards thinking about where the field is going and what \"problems\" it needs to address in moving forward. I definitely recommend it to history of science students but also to students who are interested in science studies-type work more generally\u00e2\u0080\u0094while you don't read the \"classics,\" you discuss core concepts in a way that I thought was both informative and challenging for newcomers and old hands alike. Bill runs a great seminar and at least when I took it, the class had a really interesting mix of folks."

   "comments": [
    "The course taught me to ask questions that are of interest to historians of science. It teaches what kinds of work are being done, who is working with which questions, as well as the texts that I should reference. The course is structured to give each week a theme in the history of science and the types of works that are being in that theme. This helped me narrow down the type of research I am interested in and the types ofquestions I want to ask in my future work.",
    "Very helpful with regard to my research. The course wasincredibly helpful for thinking about and preparing for a professional career in acadamia, and more personal conversations really helped to gain perspective on more big picture issues.",
    "This course was outside my department\/field, but it definitely deepened my knowledge of the field of history of science, and was also helpful for me in thinking about how to integrate my interests in history, and history\/philosophy of science more specifically, into my work in my own discipline. It didn't directly contribute to my research but in a more general sense it definitely helped me think about the scope for my own research and where\/how it might fit into existing work."
