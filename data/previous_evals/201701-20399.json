   "comments": [
    "251L furthered my experience with basic and advanced laboratory procedure in the field of chemistry. Especially new to me were the practices of nitrogen purging, rotary evaporation, and some others. The real value in this class, in my opinion, came from writing and thinking about the lab reports, which required a higher degree of scientific language and formatting than I had ever previously experienced. It was valuable to transition from the style of lab report written in 222-223L (question-and-answer format) to this new style, a closer approximation of a true journal article. It was certainly challenging, but I am glad Professor Parr pushed us to be as scientifically thoughtful as possible.",
    "Writing clearly. Life skills (e.g. how to pour water from a larger container into a smaller container). Inorganic chemistry.",
    "I definitely learned a lot about writing a scientific paper, as well as important topics covered both in the introductory inorganic lecture and other advanced inorganic classes.",
    "I learned how to write a formal chemistry research paper. I also learned various laboratory techniques and about various topics in inorganic chemistry.",
    "Knowledge: Synthesis of magnesium oxide and X-ray crystallography analysis for structural investigation Acetylation of ferrocene and reaction mechanism analysis for the acetylation Coordination chemistry of cobalt and UV\/IR analysis of structure, reactivity etc. Homogeneous catalysis and Ring Opening Metathesis Polymerization (ROMP) Skills: Writing real detailed scientific research papers for publishing Excel analysis of UV, IR, X-ray data NMR data analysis using MestReNova More uses of ChemDraw Structured and clear scientific writing Lab procedures and more experimental techniques: rotary evaporation, giant oven heating, UV spectroscopy, Insights: Science as a subject of debate and philosophy beyond just mechanical work Process of deconstructing and thinking through science writing",
    "I learned how to write scientific papers.",
    "I learned about how to improve scientific writing and create lab reports in the style of formal publications, which is a very useful skill.",
    "I learned how to think critically in a lab environment, as well as write a scientific paper.",
    "Writing ACS-style papers, critical thinking, data interpretation",
    "This course taught me a lot about the scientific process. It gave me practice interpreting data and then using that data to tell a story. This was hard at first, but it became more comfortable with practice. Also, I learned how to structure, write, and format a scientific report, which was very satisfying.",
    "Learned how to write a report in ACS format, which was helpful. Also learned about how to actually write a report using spectroscopic data and got better with Chemdraw. Learning endnote was also extremely useful. Also learned about Tanabe-Sugamo diagrams and powder diffraction, which were new and useful."

   "comments": [
    "This is generally a good course, and it has several strengths. The lab sessions were instructive (though they sometimes ran later than expected). The lab lectures were generally helpful as well. I do think that there was a certain disparity between the amount taught by Professor Parr to each student. Those who asked questions had them answered thoughtfully, while those who remained quiet often missed out on these informal teaching moments (which were always very valuable when I shared in them). I worry that this leaves the quiet types at a particular disadvantage. Often the necessary lab materials were not ready by 1pm on a given lab day, and this was a tiny bit frustrating. (Perhaps this minor snag only afflicted the Monday section.)",
    "Very well planned, especially to foster a greater understanding of inorganic chemistry\/science writing, and very reasonable workload. Dr. Parr was an excellent and accessible instructor. My only suggestion is that I would have preferred for the lectures to start\/finish on time, given that I had a class right after.",
    "The labs were very interesting and the section was definitely helpful and much needed (despite being on Friday!).",
    "I thought that this was an overall good course.",
    "The course was a decently interesting, low-workload chemistry elective. Instructor: Professor Parr is a polarizing figure. At least in the beginning, he was too sarcastic and often hostile. He sent us a very angry email about a clumsy error someone had done in lab (please bring your intelligence\/brains to the lab!). He has this British air but it can feel very unsettling when you are a student and he is the professor. During class, faced with his harsh critique, I sometimes felt very demotivated, stressed and unwilling to return to lab the next week. It got better over the semester and by the end, he was much nicer. In general, for a professor, I would recommend being less sarcastic. I will not take a class with him again. He is willing to meet in person and is a clear teacher one-on-one. He is very open to questions and answers them very well. He is quite knowledgeable and is open to debate\/discussion regarding science. Class content (lab): The pre-lab packets were a bit short and not always clear. Sometimes, Professor Parrs instructions contradicted the packet. Moreover, the packet was just a list of instructions and had very little explanatory context. Often, the instructions for the lab report were incorrect and the you would get penalized for doing it according to the packet because that wasnt the exactly right way (mentioned somewhere else in the syllabus) The experiments were a good and diverse range but some days were much more work than others. This imbalance was quite annoying because you couldnt predict how much each day would take. A more even distribution of tasks would be more prudent Class content (lectures): Friday lectures were quite rushed and very difficult content such as TS diagrams, UV diagrams, NMR mechanistic analysis, acetylation mechanisms were messily and poorly taught but expectations with reports were high. There was often expectation of knowledge from coordination chemistry and\/or physical chemistry even though Inorgo lab is an introductory elective The report writing and structuring sessions were very helpful and should be continued Course assignments: A very reasonable workload regarding lab reports. The focus was on depth and brevity, not length. The pre-lab assignments werent checked so the expectations werent too clear. Hopefully, those were graded just for completion.",
    "I think this was a really great class. I learned a lot about inorganic chemistry that I had not learned in the inorganic class. Also I learned about scientific writing.",
    "The class is not too stressful and there are four lab reports. Expectations are generally clear but sometimes it can be difficult to know how to construct lab reports until after receiving grades.",
    "Strengths: Writing in the format of a real paper is very helpful for research and future chemistry endeavors. Prof. Parr is great at answering questions and truly shows passion for the course. Weaknesses: Absolutely disorganized at times. Due dates for WR credit don't exist. Lab reports take forever to be graded. Hard to find help for problems on paper on canvas",
    "The experiments and write-ups are very well thought out",
    "This course did an excellent job teaching about how to undergo an experiment and then to write an interesting yet representative report about the data collected. I don't have any large complaints.",
    "I think the strength of this course is that it teaches you how to actually write a report, not those ugly word documents you turn in in Orgo lab or, dare I say, Pchem lab. Learning how to report spectroscopic data, use endnote, and write in ACS format are extremely helpful. Weakness: A lot of what is expected of the reports is unclear, with the instructions in the lab packet often including expectations that you later find were totally unnecessary."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this class to any prospective chemistry major or pure scienceinterested individual. The small class size is refreshing, and Professor Parr gives helpful personal attention and is generally very available and responsive.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this lab. It was incredibly well-run, and Dr. Parr was excellent and very accessible. As a non chemistry major (and someone who didn't enjoy labs very much at Yale), I found this one reasonable. The aim is to improve students' writing, which is important for future scientists.",
    "Definitely recommend for chemistry majors! Even if you are not a huge fan of inorganic chemistry as I was, you will learn a lot of interesting things that will be useful in your future\/concurrent chemistry classes. Professor Parr is also very helpful and truly cares about your learning.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student. Dr. Parr is a very fair grader, but don't be fooled, the lab reports will definitely take you a long time and require a solid understanding of inorganic topics.",
    "The course was a decently interesting, low-workload chemistry elective. The material can be very interesting if you have a good background in Inorganic Chem. And teaches you useful new lab skills if you are into that. Instructor: Professor Parr is great at heart but somewhat a polarizing figure.

    "A great class to take.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student, because you are able to apply your lecture knowledge to some interesting labs and learn a lot about how to improve scientific writing.",
    "Take this course as your lab requirement for being a chem major! Prof. Parr is great at answering questions and I now know a lot more about inorganic chemistry and writing lab reports in general. A bit disorganized at times, especially if you do it for the WR credit. You don't have to do much more for the writing credit... just a couple miscellaneous assignments and a final lab report.",
    "Yes",
    "This course is great. I recommend it to all chemistry majors. The labs are fun and informative, and they provide a good compliment to the Inorganic lecture. Professor Parr really does a good job. He is great at teaching concepts clearly. He teaches that basic principles for each lab, and then he leaves it up to you to determine what you will want to write about in your report and how you will want to do it. This factor allowed for creativity and personalized learning. Also, it felt so satisfying to turn in full, polished labs using the ACS template. These reports required lots of time and thought, but were very fair.",
    "Let me preface this by saying I hate lab classes. Like other lab courses, you will probably hate writing these reports; however, this class is actually sort of useful. The reports you turn in are truly lab reports unlike the ugly word documents you turn in for orgo lab (or, dare I say, Pchem lab). In this class, you will learn how to properly report spectroscopic data, write in ACS format, and use endnote, which is useful. The experiments are often long and tedious, but that is chemistry I guess. Dr. Parr is good at giving you feedback and can be really nice most times but can get quite angry in lab if you do something wrong. That being said, he is always willing to meet with you and help. He is also really smart and knowledgable of inorganic chemistry. Meeting on Friday at 2:30 is awful, but welcome to being a Chem major."
