    "Chances are if you're reading this you have to take it anyway, so my response is largely irrelevant. Nevertheless, definitely recommended as a good introduction to probability and statistics. Rigorous but not overly so. DA is a pretty nitpicky grader, but it's good in terms of eliminating BS.",
    "Yeah, teaches you the material",
    "I will recommend it to others.",
    "I would recommend it, but only for students who are completely comfortable with the required prerequisite courses, as these skills are drawn upon often.",
    "Take it with the expectation that you are literally required to know everything in the lecture notes. Don't make the mistake I made of assuming that knowing how to do all of the homeworks and practice exam\/midterm is enough!",
    "Yes",
    "Yes definitely, is a great introduction to the statistical knowledge that one should know to do exhaustive research in statistics or econometrics.",
    "It is a very important and useful course for people interested in graduate economics or other quantitative social science methods, as well as a good course for those considering graduate study in economics.Given the above inclinations, I would definitely recommend Economics 550 01 to another student for the reasons mentioned in question 2.",
    "Yes. I learned a lot.",
    "This class provided exposure to a lot of different topics, so I would recommend it to fellow students, with the caveat that it can be a little confusing and move a little too quickly.",
    "The course is a course about probability and statistics that concentrates heavily on theory. I would definitely recommend the course to another student.",
    "absolutely recommendable"

    "N\/A",
    "Very helpful",
    "Yes, I learned a lot from this course. It is an important foundation for future econometric studies.",
    "It has definitely clarified my understanding of very basic statistical techniques that I had previously taken for granted.",
    "The material covered in the first half was useful to my understanding of research papers, though again, more practical application of the later material would have been useful.",
    "I\u0092m planning to do applied econometrics, so definitely this course has thought me all the details that sometimes other courses skip, and just take it as given. Now I will make sure that each time I learn something, I have a perfect knowledge of every step that I made.",
    "I took this course because I wanted more advanced statistical training than was available in my own department. I will be able to directly apply this course to my own research.",
    "It has given me an indepth knowledge of certain topics in econometrics I think will be important to my research, as well as an awareness of some topics I would like to know more about, and so will study further, possibly in econometrics II.It also helps to develop further a quantitative bent of mind which is helpful in economics research in general.",
    "It's the bread and butter.",
    "This course greatly deepened my understanding of probability and statistics. I am not sure what role it will play in my research at this point in time.",
    "constructed basic knowledge of econometric models"
