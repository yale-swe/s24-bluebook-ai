   "comments": [
    "I would. Have a background in math though, calculus probably. I feel like I have come away with a lot of useful information and I understand what is going on politically better.",
    "Study of basic applications of statistics, goes up to multiple regression.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class - Professor Reuning-Scherer is hilarious and keeps everyone's attention very easily. Nothing not to like about it unless you actually hate the subject of statistics itself.",
    "Yes. It's an easy way to get both a QR credit and a credit towards the major. Not too difficult either.",
    "Most of the lectures are boring, but the information is useful and it's a good QR credit. Definitely not a gut, but manageable if you do the work.",
    "Harder than you think.",
    "There are plenty of people who will be commenting on the first part of the class with Professor Reuning-Scherer, but I want to talk about the Political Science section of the class specifically. The switch in professors is a bit weird, just because the teaching styles of the two professors are so different: Reuning-Scherer is much more lively and makes statistics more interesting and entertaining (which is tough to do with statistics!), and he gives you copies of the lecture slides, which is very helpful, but he goes pretty fast. Professor Gerber's style is more boring (think what you normally think statistics class would be like), but he's more laid-back and goes slower than Professor Reuning-Scherer; also, his problem sets are easier and more straightforward, and the final for the Poli Sci section was easier than the midterms and non-cumulative. Because of this, I was actually glad that I took the Poli Sci section over Reuning-Scherer's Social Sciences section. The one most annoying thing was that we had to buy a new $175 textbook for the Poli Sci section when we were only in that section for 5 weeks.",
    "Do not take this class for an easy QR or if you really want to learn useful statistics. The first half of the class covers virtually an entire year of AP statistics extremely rapidly. The pace is daunting and the lectures can be very confusing and dry. The political science section covered pretty much only multivariate regression, but it was more useful than the rest of the material. Professor Reuning-Scherer's lectures often overcomplicated the material. Even material that I had previous knowledge of became incomprehensible. Much lecture time is spent on funny examples and humor which tend to detract from learning. He is, however, a very approachable and understanding professor. Professor Gerber is a brilliant professor who seems to truly enjoying teaching the material. He is a fairly clear lecturer, and the homework assigned was relevant and key to understanding the concepts.",
    "Great class if you're interested in statistics. The political science section is from an intro econometrics textbook. The first half is basic statistics, like AP stat. The second half is a study of (seemingly) every element of a regression and every way that a regression can give less than desirable results (or desirable results). I found the class very interesting.",
    "Introduction to statistics focusing in the second half mostly on multivariate regression. I would recommend this course to another student if they had to take a qr course or if they wanted to learn something about all the tables and statistics in political science literature.",
    "It's a decent QR, but it's not a gut. It's a lot harder than high school statistic, even if you took the AP.",
    "Don't take this class! If you can fulfill this requirement another way do that!",
    "PoliSci students should take this class - I took it along with another PoliSco class this semester, and taking it allowed me to understand the studies I was reading in the other class. The beginning w\/ JRS is fun, and don't be fooled by the fact that Alan Gerber is boring - he's a really nice guy, and if you can stay awake you'll learn a lot.",
    "if you don't like math, this is a good course for you. it's mostly just basic reasoning and you get the formulas on the exams. For the final, you get to have a page of notes, which is very helpful. It wasn't the most riveting class, but it was interesting at times to see how politicians make decisions based on information.",
    "Stats is a great course to have under your belt. Even though it does move at fast pace, the midterms, homework, and finals are all manageable. If you are worried about grades, Stats 102 will not kill your GPA if you stay up with the material. You will definitely feel comfortable with basic statistics when you finish the course.",
    "A solid statistics course necessary for many fields of inquiry.",
    "Nice introductory course. Not exceedingly difficult. Do not do the problem sets alone, though.",
    "A good introductory course to statistics.",
    "DON'T TAKE POLISCI STATS NO MATTER WHAT YOU DO! If you are a PS major, take Social Science states with JRS.",
    "Alan Gerber and Jonathan have incredibly different teaching styles... Gerber is a dryer and a less enthusiastic but almost more clear. I felt like I learned more in the second part of the class...The workload is incredibly manageable and the TA's are very helpful. The final wasn't too difficult",
    "Definitely take it with Alan Gerber. You'll learn a ton of stuff a poli sci major should know, and Gerber will not tank your grade. This class demands work if you want to do really well, but it's a QR that's accessible to everybody.",
    "Take this if you have any interest in statistics, economics, or political science. It will not be your most interesting class, but you will learn something and it will be useful knowledge.",
    "The material in the first 2\/3s of the course was straight-forward and easy to follow. Unfortunately things got very muddled once Gerber began teaching. This is not to fault Gerber too much--he's certainly a competent professor--but the assigned reading was impossible dense and largely useless. Additionally, lectures often times got into the weeds with complicated proofs that were needlessly confusing and detracted from the core concepts that I think the course was supposed to be aiming for. This course is good for a QR credit but don't expect to take away a tremendous amount of knowledge (with the exception of discontinuity analysis which, admittedly, is very cool).",
    "I know from personal experience that statistics can scare a lot of people. I didn't have an amazing track record for it in high school either, however these introductory courses were not that bad at all. They teach you the important basics of statistics. At times it can be difficult, but your TAs and professors will guide you along the way. It is also very informative and rewarding especially since statistics is very useful no matter what profession you are in.",
    "I fully recommend Statistics 102. In my opinion, statistics is not the most fascinating discipline, but I think that this class makes it as interesting as it can be, and it also effectively explains the useful applications that statistics can have to other subjects. I came away from the course with a solid understanding of the foundations of statistics, and it will certainly give you a thorough enough introduction for you to know whether or not you want to continue pursuing the subject.",
    "This was a good class to take to get distributional math credit. It's not easy, but the nice thing is that the professors don't assume a ton of prior knowledge in statistics."
