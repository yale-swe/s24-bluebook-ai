    "In this course, I discovered the importance of following the patterns of the western tradition through our readings. I also gained key insight into my own writing.",
    "I learned about the Western tradition of literature and also the impact it has had on the society we live in today. I also learned valuable tools to utilize in the writing process and how to become a better reader.",
    "i learned what to look for in a great, intimidating work of literature. professor slanski made me a better reader and thinker and gave SUCH helpful feedback on essays",
    "DS guides you through a large body of important texts with an organized structure. In the course, you learn a large amount in a remarkable period of time and gives you a great foundation for in-depth study in the humanities later in your college career. A fantastic overview of the major highlights of western thought.",
    "I learned so much about the literature of the Western canon. I really cant underscore how much knowledge I gained on that front and how much my writing improved.",
    "A thorough knowledge of the second half of the western canon in literature, major themes, ect.",
    "This course was fantastic and broadened my ability to write about literature and do so with a keen eye towards the text."

   "comments": [
    "I just wish my professor was better. She was always late, not prepared, and biased, and I never really learned much from our seminar discussions.",
    "The strengths of the course in the balance of poetic and prose styles, but I think the course really needs to cut Proust or Madame Bovary, or else space them out a little more. There came a time in the year where I was getting so bored with the literature reading, and with a reading list as fascinating as this, that should not happen.",
    "I thought it was a really great course!",
    "nothing!",
    "The class is great as a \"crash course\" of the western canon. However, due to the huge range of material covered, there isn't enough time to go into the works in depth. It's great for exposing you to different ideas; if there's an author you find very interesting, then you should look into their work in more depth afterwards. Also, the three tracks of DS don't intertwine as much as it may sound (or at least as I expected). They are essentially three separate courses. While they may reference each other occasionally, and sometimes an author that overlaps, there isn't too much interdisciplinary analysis (i.e. , looking into the historical context of a philosophical or literary movement). Sometimes, the timeframes of the works across the tracks fall out of sync. However, this would probably a lot more work, and the tracks will likely give you enough to make these kinds of analysis on your own if you choose.",
    "I think the course can lighten he syllabus to give more time to really important works.",
    "An excellent instructor and subject material; would recommend having class somewhere other than the bass basement because it seemed to keep the energy low.",
    "This course gave excellent writing feedback which really helped me grow as a student. Class discussions tended to focus on narrow passages and I would have enjoyed more discussion on the works as a whole."

    "Not with Slanski. Sure, she is the director of DS so you might think that she leads good seminars. Maybe it's because I had such a good professor in the fall and had high expectations, but seminars this semester was not enriching at all. We talked about the first few pages of a 100+ reading for all of the seminar and never got to discuss the rest of the readings. Slanski returned papers really late, too. We hadn't received feedback for our previous papers when we had begun to write the next paper for the class. Moreover, the professor was extremely biased and emotional in class. She would shut down students when they began to share comments and tell them they are wrong. I'm sure DS Lit can be good, but if you want a good experience, find a different professor. (The only good part was that she brought us snacks, occasionally.)",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another Yale student because of how important all of these texts were to my own understanding and look into literature.",
    "I would recommend to some, but definitely not all. Directed Studies is a rigorous program, and it definitely is not the best fit for all first-year students. However, for students really wishing to engage with the Western canon, I would definitely recommend it.",
    "absolutely. DS is a phenomenal program and learning from professor slanski was such a treat.",
    "I would recommend this course. It does an incredible job teaching you a lot over a short period of time. It gives you a huge library of knowledge for analyzing present day works, and enables you to recognize allusions, traditions, and references you could only know by reading and connecting all the texts that are conveniently and cleanly presented to you on the syllabus. Just be prepared to devote a lot of time and energy to the course: it is a lot of reading and writing compared to other Yale courses.",
    "I would because the improvement in writing skill and overall knowledge from reading the books is so great that it outweighs any aspects of the heavy workload.",
    "Yes. Amazing professor and engaging material.",
    "I would strongly reccomend this course if taken with Prof. Slanski. She is an excellent instructor."
