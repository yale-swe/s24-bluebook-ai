    "This course was very informative. There were some role-play activities that were not very instructive but it was an informative course overall.",
    "The course was interesting, but the format of the discussions could be improved. The size of the class seemed too large.",
    "I think this class was a great blend between health policy and economics. Sometimes it was interesting having a class that was half MPH and half senior econ majors, but most times it provided for good discussions. I liked the set-up of the course in terms of covering a new addiction\/theme in each class.",
    "The material taught in this course is really interesting and that's the highlight of the course.",
    "Extremely interesting and engaging topic, with lots of material from the instructor and lots of opportunities to read, think, write and get feedback. The class was pretty large and so it took time for the group to gel, and the discussion sessions weren't always as lively as they might have been. Bringing together MPH policy people with undergraduate econ students wasn't that great a success but wasn't a complete failure either.The assignments had about the right level of informality and formality of approach.",
    "This class had the potential to be so much more than it was. Too much time was spent on understanding the problem, rather than discussing the current and emerging solutions that have been tried to combat these issues of addiction, etc.",
    "The dynamic between the undergrads and graduate students was challenging and I think the discussion might have benefited from greater involvement from the professor to bridge that gap.I would argue the material on behavioral economics was the most valuable piece of the course and would have liked to have seen more emphasis put on this and other economic frameworks. While structuring around the specific issues is logical, I think a little less of the specifics of the addictions and a little more on the economics and policies surrounding them would have been valuable.",
    "Strength: Weekly assignments.Weakness: Lots of info on power points.",
    "I liked it although I thought the forced participation was too much."

    "Instructor: Jody Sindelar \u00a0Dr. Sindelar is a nice woman but she had some difficulty explaining concepts or responding to student questions.",
    "Instructor: Jody Sindelar \u00a0Prof. Sindelar was incredibly accommodating in making sure that everyone in the class was keeping up with the course material. She was very friendly and made a great effort to try and get to know everyone in the class.",
    "Instructor: Jody Sindelar \u00a0Dr. Sindelar is a great professor. I think learning more specifics about what work she does\/has been involved with in the past for a class would be very interesting, just to get an idea of real-world applications of the topics covered in class. Also, stressing the importance of class participation in this type of seminar class is fine at the beginning of the semester, but I think too much effort was put on trying to get everyone to constantly participate or implement a system of incentives, etc. I think students would have just participated naturally, knowing that it was an important part of the class. Getting her feedback on our final paper topic ideas was extremely helpful, as were post-presentation comments.",
    "Instructor: Jody Sindelar \u00a0Jody is an interesting professor. She brings forth the concept of behavioral economics into public health, which is really intriguing.",
    "Instructor: Jody Sindelar \u00a0I particularly liked the enthusiasm of the instructor for the course topic and material, and her focus on the economic principles underlying the course. She and the TA gave good feedback on assignments.",
    "Instructor: Jody Sindelar \u00a0While the instructor was extremely supportive and accessible, I think it would have been beneficial to receive a little more specific feedback, especially on the final presentations.",
    "Instructor: Jody Sindelar \u00a0Great. Very supportive.",
    "Instructor: Jody Sindelar \u00a0sometimes frazzled, but overall, good teacher. knowledgeable."

    "If you want to learn about addiction and economics, this is a fascinating course.",
    "This course was a nice balance to my other courses. It was interesting to learn about how to integrate an economics perspective into health policy in the context of addiction.",
    "I probably would recommend this course to another student because it is an interesting niche of health policy\/economics that has a lot of need, but that you don't necessarily hear too much about (except maybe the addiction of obesity). Although several of the graded homeworks seemed a bit repetitive and on the tedious side, the readings for the most part were very applicable and the final project served as a cumulative way to apply themes from the course to a specific addiction.",
    "It's a good class to take if you're interested in behavioral aspects of policy. (which if you want to be a good policy maker you have to be)",
    "Really interesting combination of economics, addiction and health policy which will have you thinking outside of the box.",
    "This course was a seminar structured as an overview of different common addictions (i.e. tobacco, alcohol, illicit drugs) and the role economics can play in policies to address the usages.",
    "Yes. Very interesting content.",
    "course content is interesting. liked the readings. sometimes discussion was too pedestrian. would have liked more economic discussion."
