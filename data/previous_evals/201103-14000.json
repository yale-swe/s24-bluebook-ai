   "comments": [
    "The course is very good. It provides us opportunity to work on some real-world data.",
    "Strengths:1. Ability to use material from previous coursework to a real case.2. Opportunity to work closely with researchers at different schools.3. Chance to interact with Professor and Researchers on an equal level, rather than just lectures.4. Opportunity to build interpersonal skills and presentation skillsWeakness:None.",
    "Though it was an experimental course, designed to help students work in tandem with real researchers by utilizing and maximizing their knowledge in stat, I was very satisfied with the course. I attribute this to meeting my great partner, good, interesting project, and excellent lecturer. Throughout the whole semester, my partner and I met every sunday, and I could learn a lot from my partner with regard to using SPSS. The project was based on a couple of published, similar kind of research projects, which means that our primary investigator and her advisor were already well aware of the work and the data set was already complete. More important, I could learn how we can develop our statistical analysis from examining data distribution to applied regression analysis, thanks to Michael's great guide. I consider myself very fortunate as everything important in this project (parter, lecturer, and the project data) was \"perfect.\" However, I think it will be further addressed that students still can be unsatisfied due to the incomplete data set, for instance. Also, I wish I could learn more about the statistical data analysis process, for example, since after only several lectures on sample size calculation and so on, I was still at a loss what to begin with. Thus, hope the lecture contents would be changed.",
    "There really wasn't much structure to the course and I would have preferred to have some guidance or workshops so that we as students gain skills. Perhaps case studies each week showing us how consulting is handled would be helpful. I did not gain as much from this course as I would have hoped in an entire semester's worth of time. It took ages just to get data to play with and I was not sure of what was expected from us in the course. The quality of experience from this course depends very heavily on the project you pick. The course itself does not really offer too much content to teach us."

   "comments": [
    "Instructor: Michael John Kane \u00a0Dr. Kane is quite good at teaching.",
    "Instructor: Michael John Kane \u00a0Dr. Kane did a great job as the instructor for statistical consulting. He provided constructive feedback with a very optomistic outlook. As a student, I found his participation during our sessions with researchers to be particulary useful, there was a lot to be picked up in terms of how he analyzed research questions, looked at graphs and charts and interacted with researchers. In general there was a lot to appreciate and gain from the way he structured the class and I thought his course complimented the rest of my biostatistics courses (current and previous) very well.",
    "Instructor: Michael John Kane \u00a0Overall, he was able to provide appropriate advise always what we should do based upon our previous work, like a good captain of a ship. I also personally appreciate that he even helped me when I asked him for advise regarding my MPH thesis project, which was unrelated to the course at all.",
    "Instructor: Michael John Kane \u00a0The instructor was great at dealing with any problems the students had. He was easy to understand and very approachable. He was also very knowledgeable in the material.",
    "Instructor: Michael John Kane \u00a0He's very approachable and has a lot of experience with statistical consulting. He facilitates meetings between students and clients well."

   "comments": [
    "I recommend this course to fellow student.",
    "This is a great course to build upon previous and current statistics coursework and build some great interpersonal skills. Importantly, this course provides a unique learning and professional opportunity to consult on a project with researcher who has 'real' data, while also receiving constructive feedback from a professor. I would strongly recommend this course to other biostatistics students.",
    "I strongly recommend this course for those who are lack of work experience but eager to experience the real-world statistical analysis project relevant to writing a (public health) paper.",
    "This course is an opportunity to play with different types of data depending on the projects that are presented. It is interesting meeting with the researchers but I did not like how unprepared many of them were (did not have data) and how there were no clear expectations of each project or concrete skills we could take away."
