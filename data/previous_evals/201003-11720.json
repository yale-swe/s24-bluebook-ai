    "Lectures were pretty boring on average. Presenters mostly just read data from power points. It would have been nice to get presenters who talked more about Envorinmental health as opposed to just read data.",
    "Please have a wider array of subjects represented. Every speaker was from NCI. Not all of us are interested in environmental cancer epi. in fact most of us are interested in other things.",
    "I hope we could invite more excellent researchers and speakers rather than PhD students whose work is not quite convincible.",
    "It was interesting to learn about some contemporary issues and research in environmental health -- both within Yale and also from outside organizations. I now have a larger grasp of the field as a whole and a renewed interest in pursuing research of my own.Having some food there would be nice, especially since seminars in other divisions always provide food for attendees.",
    "it's very informational and fun to learn about different topics~",
    "It's a great seminar, some of the subjects were way over my head, and I wish that more EHS and forestry and Yale faculty came to present instead of people from other organizations. I appreciate some stuff from people from other organizations, but I would love to get to know the faculty here more and what they are doing and interested in! Requests for Michelle Bell and John Wargo for next fall!",
    "Interesting class. I really enjoy listening to what people are doing in the field."

Approachable and knowledgeable and seems to know everything about the presentations and lectures before they are presented, as well as explaining some of the things that are above us at the time they are introduced. She is also approachable and is willing to talk to us after class (unfortunately that's not as common as you would hope).",

    "It's required for all EHS students, but it's usually fine if you miss a few. Being able to eat your lunch there is a plus.",
    "fun class to take \/ to socialize with EHS students~",
    "Just show up, eat lunch, observe, and suck in information. It's great for deciding what you want to do after YSPH and determining what sort of research project you want to do for the summer. It's also a great way to get to know the faculty and staff in your department.",
    "It's required, but I really like the lectures.",
    "This class is good in that it allows the students to see what types of research are being done in other areas of academia."
