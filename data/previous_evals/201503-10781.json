   "comments": [
    "I would very rarely suggest this class to a fellow student. The workload is overwhelming, and for very little gain. There are far better ways to learn about this discipline.",
    "I thought this was a valuable course because it refreshed me on some topics I'd seen before, and I also learned about some things I'd never seen before. I also felt like I learned a lot by solving problems on the exercises and assignments. This course was a lot more work than I expected, though.",
    "This class was not a good time investment for me, but that is largely because the topics were not directly applicable to my research. It is interesting material.",
    "Very cool material taught pretty well.",
    "I would recommend this course because it covers material that is up and coming in research, and isn't just taught from a textbook. Overall the course was challenging but the material and skills learned are invaluable",
    "I would say the course is a look at different biological processes with a more mathematical lens. Specifically focusing on systems that can be modeled with differential equations. I would definitely recommend the course because it is interesting as well as beneficial.",
    "highly recommended",
    "Yes"

   "comments": [
    "This course has very few applications in my field of study, and has probably turned me off from anything related to biological systems for a long time, if not permanently.",
    "This does not contribute to my research.",
    "It established my knowledge in the role of dynamical systems in biology.",
    "Learning Matlab was very useful for other aspects of my own research. This course taught me more about mathematical approaches to biological problems, something I didn't get in my undergrad courses.",
    "This course was my first introduction to dynamical systems in biology, and was a great introduction to the power of modeling biological processes.",
    "Unfamiliar topic, but it was good to look at the field from a different angle."
