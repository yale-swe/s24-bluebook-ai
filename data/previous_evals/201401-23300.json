   "comments": [
    "ENGL 115 is a wonderful course. I loved the small, seminar style discussions. The workload was relatively light (four papers, two books, a couple of poems and short stories, movie-viewings). This is a great class to take if you want some support in transitioning to college writing, although ENGL 114 might be more useful for STEM majors.",
    "The heavy workload comes in short bursts, though the rest of the semester is pretty constant and definitely feasible. I would certainly recommend Engl 115 as a course: it\u2019s just a step above Engl 114 with more reading and requires more analysis in the reading rather than simply articulating an argument. Prof. Weiskott was good, sometimes harsh on grading, though generally very fair. Since he won\u2019t be here next year, it\u2019s rather inconsequential though. If another professor chooses to pick up the doppelganger theme that Prof. Weiskott chose, then take it! Doppelgangers was a very interesting topic.",
    "English 115 is not too much work, but you won't get very much out of the course if the topic is not something you enjoy. If you are interested in the readings it's a great way to read some good books\/short stories without being crushed by papers, and I would recommend it."
