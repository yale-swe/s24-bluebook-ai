    "Great class on the Mediterranean. Sometimes, some people in class can make comments that are bit harsh towards other students, especially the older\/more mature students. Fine line between rigorous debate and just crude scoring points in front of professors. But this is a subjective opinion, just got to toughen up!",
    "The class offers something of a comparative perspective to European and Ottoman history. I would definitely recommend this class to fellow students, mainly due the excellence of the professors. It was also very helpful to consider some of these early modern historical developments from multiple perspectives.",
    "Yes, I would certainly recommend this class to other students but if they are not history students I would advise them to take not take the course while also taking other courses on themes and methods that are incommensurable with the themes and methods of this course.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course!"
