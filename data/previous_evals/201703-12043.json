   "comments": [
    "Great overview of the foundations of the field. As my first PE class, it helped me understand what the field is, how debates and ideas are structured, and what the main issues are.",
    "Knowledge of CPE in general and how different approaches of looking at a problem (materialism vs. institutionalism etc.) produce predictably different answers. Skill-wise, I liked the emphasis on boiling down a paper to its central idea\/contribution.",
    "This was a great introduction to the large debates in political economy, and it brought together a wonderful mix of people from various backgrounds. I learned how to think of problems through PE lenses, and also to synthesize readings concisely through the short responses.",
    "Knowledge: A broad range of things related to political economy (mostly in the comparative\/political sense, I suppose). Skills: Analyzing and summarizing what could be very dense writings on political economy. Writing succinct analytical papers (still struggle with this). Insights: A more \"intuitive\" sense of political economy.",
    "Quite broad knowledge of political economy. It was one of those courses that are less skills oriented.",
    "This course provided an excellent overview of the classical debates and current theories within comparative political economy. As such, it expanded my understanding of the direction in which the field is headed, as well as the various methodological approaches to empirical questions within CPE. The course also provided a wealth of literature that has proven to be an extremely useful background in my own personal research.",
    "I gained a lot of knowledge about the contemporary canon in CPE as well as the \"big questions\" being asked in the discipline and the different approaches to and theories of answering those questions.",
    "This was an excellent introduction to comparative political economy taught by a wonderful and extremely knowledgable professor. As someone who has minimal to no background in the subject, I appreciated the range of topics that were covered and the thoughtful discussions that Professor Rosenbluth facilitated."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Reading 4-6 papers a week, writing a short reading response and discussing them in class was a great way to get into the issues and debates. The in-class discussions were always interesting and insightful. On some topics that I was less familiar with, I might have benefited from a more systematic presentation of the topic and the articulation between the different ideas before digging into the different readings.",
    "I liked the emphasis on reading some of the older papers in the literature, but sometimes the reading list felt a little bit outdated and would benefit from inclusion of some more recent work (even if only as an \"extra reading\" resource for students who want to delve deeper into a particular topic). The reading responses were an effective way of forcing me to engage with the readings every week, even if I was initially uninterested in the topic. I like the flexibility of the final assignment. Overall, very well-designed to meet the needs of a pretty diverse group of students.",
    "Super engaging class discussions led by Prof Rosenbluth who made everything from formal models to present-day problems sound interesting. I wish we were given an opportunity to engage more seriously with the final paper, either through mandated follow up meetings with the prof or through class discussions.",
    "Strengths: Covers a broad swath of political economy. Lots of good substantive material. \"Something for everybody\" in a sense. Weakness: Not many. Perhaps a bit more focus on the methodological issues in each paper would be beneficial but I don't think that is the main focus of the class.",
    "The strength of the course was its extensive reading list that ensured students would leave the course with a superior knowledge of the literature. A weakness was the lack of sections. Students of this course would benefit from discussion sections with TFs.",
    "The assignments forced students to engage critically with the readings and to digest them beyond a superficial level. Lectures also provided an excellent overview of the tensions within the field, as well as explained concisely how the various readings either agreed or disagreed with one another. The structure of the final assignment was also appreciated, as it provided students with a project that could be used as a foundation for either a future publication or dissertation.",
    "I loved that we had to write responses because I think that it really encouraged class engagement and facilitated my own critical evaluation of the readings. I didn't see any weaknesses, because this was my favorite course of the semester and I really thought it was excellent.",
    "Though the course covered a broad selection of themes, I think it would have been great to have even more issue areas related to CPE included. More readings from recent\/contemporary authors would also have been interesting. Finally, making students reflect on 5 readings per week in a very short response paper seemed both tedious and a superficial exercise. I would have preferred if we could have chosen a couple and been allowed to discuss in more detail, even in the 1-page format."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, I think it's very useful in organizing your thoughts about many topics in political science, so I would recommend it to students even (or especially) if they are not necessarily interested in straightforward PE questions\/topics\/approaches.",
    "Yes - it is the most apt introduction to the debates of the field.",
    "Yes, for anyone interested in political economy this class is a \"must take.\"",
    "Yes, it gives a very good insight into how the political and economic spheres interact.",
    "That depends on their future objectives. It certainly benefits the right student.",
    "Yes, I would absolutely recommend this course to another student for the reasons outlined above.",
    "100% yes! I would recommend this course even to students not concentrating in political economy, because the applications of the material are so widespread, and Professor Rosenbluth is an excellent instructor.",
    "Yes, both those who would like to specialize in CPE as well those interested in an overview of the sub-discipline.",
    "100% yes to those even remotely interested in the subject matter. You emerge with a clearer understanding of political economy, and how to apply the dominant frameworks to a subject that you care about, even if it is yet to be fully considered by the discipline."
