   "comments": [
    "I think the course had a clear trajectory and I came away with an understanding of the development of the field. I would recommend the course to other students not only because it is a degree requirement in our department but because the course helped me to gain a better understanding of the larger shape of the study of music in the academy, and because it gave insight into the particular situation of the Yale department. Also, it touched on theoretical materials that have been important across the humanities and I was particularly glad to have exposure to thought that bridges a number of areas in the humanities.",
    "Music 697 is, as the course description, an introduction to the history and major issues of the field of ethnomusicology. It teaches a broad range of concepts and approaches that both important to ethnomusicologists and have much application in the fields of Eurocentric theory and musicology as well. Three transcription assignments are included for some hands-on work with music, keeping a bit of variety and music in a naturally reading-centered course. Definitely recommended, even on the off-chance that it stops being required.",
    "This course provides an introduction to the disciplinary history and intellectual currents of the field of ethnomusicology.",
    "A history of the field of ethnomusicology. Transcriptions from particular regions, which give some background about the general musical environments of each culture. Through discussing the history of the discipline, we branched out into more general trends in the humanities and the impact they had on music studies at large. I would recommend it, yes, even though it is required."

   "question_text": "How did this course deepen your knowledge of your discipline\/profession? To what extent did this course contribute to your dissertation\/research?",
   "comments": [
    "This course has helped me to achieve a better understanding of the scholarly study of music since I previously had little insight into how ethnomusicology fit into the broader disciplinary picture. It has certainly helped me to think further about how cultural studies, literary scholarship and anthropology have informed the study of music and I expect to draw on such fields in my future research.",
    "As an introduction to the least widely-known of the three subfields of academic music, it naturally deepened my knowledge of it quite a bit. The course's attention to areas like cultural studies and post-colonial studies were especially helpful because they are popular in more or less every humanistic discipline, and music has been no exception, although I can't help but to feel as if music scholars (and I include myself in this) tend to be less familiar with these ideas than are scholars of other disciplines. These and other approaches (including the transcriptions!) will surely factor into my own work in a variety of ways.",
    "This course opened doors. As a non-ethnomusicologist, this course introduced methodologies and areas of inquiry beyond the typical theory\/history divide, which was not only refreshing, but practical from a disciplinary standpoint."
