    "I would recommend the course to anyone needing to fulfill the requirement because it is a good introduction to something most of us have not learned much about before. It did not go very deeply into the theory behind the modes of assessment, which might have been interesting, but it allowed time for us to learn the nitty gritty of the instruments so we might be better prepared to use them in the future."
