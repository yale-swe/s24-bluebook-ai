    "YESSSSSS! TAKE IT! You will not regret it!",
    "I highly recommend this course to students looking for a comfortable and encouraging environment to better their Spanish fluency. The professor is wonderful and the workload is manageable, especially since the majority is submitted through classesv2.",
    "Taking this course and SPAN 132 in the fall was the best decision I made my entire freshmen year. I was challenged but I also very comfortable amongst my classmates and with Professor Alexandrov. By the end of the year, we had a little family. This class was one of the spaces where I felt I could be my complete self.",
    "Spanish 142 really meets the needs of heritage speakers through insightful movies and readings as well as presentations on the culture of Latin America. Students receive a strong grasp of the language and of their identity.",
    "Spanish for Heritage Speakers gives native speakers the resources to develop their mastery of the language in a more formal way. You learn exactly what you need to learn and nothing redundant if you grew up in a Spanish speaking home.",
    "I would recommend this class to any Spanish heritage speaker or anyone who grew up hearing Spanish but never properly learned the grammar. This is a fun and worthwhile class to take!",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to a fellow student who is a heritage Spanish speaker because the instructor was so good and the class was interesting and informative.",
    "Spanish 142 focuses on learning grammar. The course is aimed at heritage speakers who are familiar with the language but perhaps can only speak it informally, as one would normally speak with friends or family.",
    "SPAN 142 01 is a great course! The curriculum is engaging and entertaining. You not only learn grammar, but you use your knowledge in Spanish to watch films, read poetry and prose and conduct research. It is a comprehensive course I would definitely recommend. Professor Alexandrov is extremely supportive and a sweetheart. She will give you constructive criticism to help you improve your Spanish.",
    "This is the best language class you will take in your Yale career! Prof. Alexandrov is amazing, always willing to help and keeping the class interesting and engaging. Not only will you improve your Spanish (conversational and grammatical); the small class size allows you to learn more about different Latin American cultures and variations in Spanish.",
    "TAKE IT! If you grew up speaking Spanish but don't really have the grammar and vocab down, then this class is great for that. You will also love Prof. Alexandrov",
    "Professor Alexandrov is a gem. She does a magnificent job of keeping the material interesting and explaining everything thoroughly. You will definitely get your effort's worth of Spanish in her class. I recommend this course for all heritage speakers because it allows you to converse with peers with the same knowledge of Spanish while everyone works to expand upon their vocabulary.",
    "If you're a heritage student, TAKE THIS COURSE. It helps you build your language skills and teaches you about the cultures of different Spanish-speaking countries. Coursework is highly manageable and interesting. The professor is AMAZING."
