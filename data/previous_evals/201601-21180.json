    "This is a great class to take as a science credit if you are willing to put in a little extra work. While I learned so much during this course, most of the knowledge I gained was through close examination of the readings and self-directed research online. The lectures were very jumbled and many times I left more confused than before. Professor Harris is a brilliant guy, but was not able to explain or answer many of our questions to an extent that was satisfactory. He often times got off topic and would rush through parts of the lecture that I thought were most confusing or important. This class is NOT structured like a seminar - there is no \"discussion\" - it is a lecture class where students can ask questions.",
    "Great course, and relatively easy.",
    "I would not recommend this class to anyone unless it undergoes a major revamp. The material is fascinating, but there was simply too much of it for us to cover any of it in any depth. Assessments were just easy enough to be mind-numbing, which of course just made them a pain to complete (especially since they mostly consisted of regurgitation of the readings), so this class does not even fall into the 'easy and fun' SC credit category. As for Professor Harris: kind and committed to his students as he is, I have never seen a professor make so little of so much time. He began each class with a lengthy preamble about what we were going to cover, only for us not to end up covering much of what he said we were covering in the first place. His presentation of the material was meandering and unclear, which led to many of us having questions: that would be fine in itself (we are dealing with quantum mechanics, after all) if it were not the case that Professor Harris' answers to questions were even more meandering and less clear than the original presentation of the material. In short: go to class the first day and see whether it has been revamped (it is a testament to Professor Harris' commitment to his students that he would be upfront about this). If it has not been revamped, and if the presentation of the material seems circuitous or full of tangents, do not think it will get better: it won't.",
    "More work than you might expect but definitely one of the best science credits. And you'll learn something! Even if you learn that we know nothing.",
    "PHYS 120 is the study of theoretical physics. I definitely recommend it. I wrote my final paper on time travel!",
    "Great class! You learn how to think about concepts in quantum physics but not in such depth that it's intimidating. \"Cocktail party physics.\"",
    "Not a seminar--glrified lecture; easy workload, you'll learn a lot, quiz\/test\/hw questions can be very vaguely worded sometimes; grading is fair",
    "Amazing class! If you have the opportunity to take, do it! The class will expand your understanding of our universe and you will find all the information you learn extremely interesting. The concepts that you learn are challenging, but the class itself is doable. The professor is also great!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to fellow students: it is not quite a gut class, because it expects a lot from you conceptually, but the homeworks are pretty straight-forward (making sure you're keeping up with the material) and the tests are not too hard. Most importantly, it's really fun: it allows you to explore the more philosophical aspects of science with a legitimate science background in some of the controversial modern physics.",
    "This is an introductory physics seminar that tries to expose students to the basics of a wide variety of topics in modern physics today. It is incredibly accessible to students with a background in high school physics and math, and covers a lot of exciting topics that otherwise are not taught until much higher level physics classes. There are some disadvantages to trying to teach these topics without math. However, for students who are just interested in being exposed to new ideas and current events in physics, this class was a really great experience. I would recommend this class to any student that enjoyed physics in high school, needs a science credit, and is not able to take higher level physics classes in college. The seminar format also created a really great classroom atmosphere where you're able to ask whatever questions you need to process and understand the material.",
    "This is a good science credit for those who don't have much experience with math--the material can get a little complicated, but if you do the reading & study the quizzes\/etc. are manageable. The topics covered were interesting."
