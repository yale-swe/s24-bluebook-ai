    "Course has weekly readings under 100-110 pages, though a lot of it is technical, so the workload is pretty similar to other seminars. 3 three-page RR papers and a final essay that you can shape yourself, which is nice. Huber is great at leading discussion and explaining research methods and econometrics for the novices in the group (aka all the undergrads). The mix is pretty even between grad students and undergrads, and the discussion is cooperative. BEWARE: this class is not debate-team-turned-seminar. The focus is on research papers, and the discussion style is overwhelmingly academic. There will be no abortion or death penalty debates... take that information as you will.",
    "A wonderful class, but likely not for you if you're looking for a basic polysci seminar. It's very much a graduate class in the way it focuses on political questions. By the end of the course, I realized I was not interested in quantiative analysis of political behavior or in academia in general. A lot of grad students also take this course because it's required (I think?) so it's fun to meet them! The final paper isn't bad, also, and there aren't that many assignments overall.",
    "Take it!",
    "American Political Behavior was a phenomenal class that deals with the decision making of people in a political science context. A definite must take for anyone interested in social psychology\/cognitive science or for those interested in political science. Both perspectives bring up interesting points for discussion which make class interesting and always engaging. There is quite a bit of reading (3 tense articles per class) but they are always interesting and unique. These articles include a lot of statistics so a background or previous knowledge would be helpful but is not necessary.",
    "Great seminar. Recommended for hard core poli sci people. heavily focused on analyzing methods."
