   "comments": [
    "Less of a focus on theory. Perhaps listening to more oral histories in class? we read a lot more oral histories than we listened to. Perhaps having more recording excercizes early on? The readings became quite repetitive as narrative theory became a bit boring after a while. It might be cool to have the whole class engaged in one oral history project that everyone is gathering pieces of, or to have small groups that do that. There could be more engagement that way.",
    "This was really a fantastic course. I thought the structure of the syllabus and course overall was well-suited for the material and our objectives. The fact that we were to start our final projects so early in the semester was essential, as it allowed our ideas to gestate."

   "comments": [
    "If you want to do interviews and make an oral history for credit, this course allows you to do that. Beware, there is quite a bit of theory reading that can be a bit repetitive and stale, but if your self guided oral history is interesting to you, then the course can be engaging.",
    "YES! Absolutely take this course. It's a fantastic dive into oral history, which is a really fascinating discipline with tones of sociopolitical potential. Really a fascinating, engaging course--and Joey is a delight to work with.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to another student, if she has any interest in the subject matter. One consideration is that the course was highly theoretical and methodological, so you're not going to learn anything about History per se. The course instead teaches you how to use oral history and how to interpret the narratives that that methodology produces."
