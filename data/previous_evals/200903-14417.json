    "I would definitely recommend it. It is a lot of work, but is incredibly rewarding!",
    "This class will teach you to view history and the Revolution in a totally new light. Take it!!!",
    "A solid class. It's probably a little easier than your average history seminar, but it's not a breeze either. It's generally interesting, and if you are interested in cultural history and American history (even if the Revolutionary Era isn't your thing), you'll probably like it. Professor Yokota is engaging and smart. Unfortunately, she doesn't always make her expectations entirely clear (be sure to very clearly ask what she's looking for when grading your paper), but it was not a huge problem.",
    "A GREAT course that every history major should take. Professor Yokota provides a very different perspective in studying history, showing how studying different aspects of the revolutionary era reveals many different and conflicting narratives about this time period. Professor Yokota likes to show how you can study the same events from different perspectives, whether it be from the point of view of women, slaves, or others who experienced the same revolution that we've studied so often, or how studying material objects, clothing, or architecture debunks many of the popular narratives of the revolutionary era. Professor Yokota not only aims to teach the history of this time period, but also HOW to study history.",
    "Overall a good class",
    "I would recommend this class \/ material culture studies with Prof. Yokota in general for history students who want to study the nitty-gritty, everyday realities of the Am. Rev. era \u0096 the world of meaning contained in a tea set, the economic\/political\/social implications of daily decision making of men, both famous and not-so-famous, of the day. I don\u0092t want to say this is a must-take class, because you have to be interested in studying from objects and images. A mix of history\/art history\/material studies. Although this class suffered a little because of misunderstanding about the extent of the exhibition, and discussions dragged a little, students walked away with very clear ideas about material culture studies. I think history as a discipline is curving toward this type of study \u0096 hurtling us to remote times by studying the very material that constituted the worlds of the past."
