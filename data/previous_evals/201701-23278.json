    "This really is a crash course in the mechanics of screenwriting. You will come out of it much more confident and knowledgeable than you went in, whatever experience you might have. Outside of the writing of a script itself, this is a course that teaches storytelling techniques, as well as important corollary skills like coverage writing.",
    "I learned the fundamentals of screenwriting I learned that the only way to learn screenwriting is to read scripts and write scripts",
    "I learned how to really and truly tell a story.",
    "A good hands-on intro to the process and form of screenwriting!",
    "I learned the basics of screenwriting, a script's format, and elements of interesting plot points and character development",
    "The fundamentals of screenwriting - formatting, development, and technique for writing for the screen as well as preforming coverages and analysis of other works.",
    "Learned conventions of professional screenwriting. Helpful formatting tips and more general things about storytelling.",
    "I developed an understanding on screenplay format and the aspects of character and story creation that goes on behind the screen."

   "comments": [
    "the workload could be distributed more evenly instead of one midterm folder",
    "Marc is absolutely awesome.",
    "I really liked the workshop format of the second half of the class. I thought that was very useful for thinking about how to make scripts better in general and also for getting feedback on my writing. Would have been nice to have more writing exercises in-class to help start the process in the first half of the semester.",
    "This course covers so much and Marc teaches expertly. The workload is handled like, presumably, one is in a gradschool class -the students being able to pace on their own. I actually think the course would be improved, however, if there were more deadlines. I understand wanting to treat undergrades like grad students, but there is a reason they arent.",
    "I loved the subgroup layout and the collaborative nature. It was very much a workshop class build around teamwork, helpful to have work seen by multiple eyes semi-frequently.",
    "The assignments for this course never felt unnecessary, which was good. However, the problem is assigning the work as a midterm packet instead of weekly or biweekly assignments. I think having deadlines for each part of the packet will get students to produce better work rather than trying to finishing the entire packet the week or so before its due."

    "Everyone talks about the midterm packet for this course. It's not the odious monster you think. Yes, it's a lot of work, but a) it's fun work and b) you have a lot of time to do it. Beyond that, this is just a plain fun course that's also very informative and will improve\/kick off your screenwriting very effectively. If you have the slightest interest in film, I would definitely take it.",
    "I think anyone can write scripts if they read them, we grow up watching movies and a student who wants to write can probably intuit many things",
    "Absolutely. Marc is the coolest person\/best teacher.",
    "I thought this class was quite fun. If you're at all interested in learning the basics of screenwriting, i would recommend it. The workload really isn't bad at all except for the midterm packet which takes forever (I think it took me 15-16 hours to finish), but he does assign at the very beginning of the semester, so spaced out properly it wouldn't be too bad (of course we all left it till the week before and didn't sleep that week, but life doesn't have to be like that). The final project is a revised version of your 8-12 page screenplay, which you have already written a first draft of by that point. Lapadula is a character, though, so definitely shop the first class and see if you vibe with him because if not, it will be a long semester for you.",
    "Definitely, if the student is inclined to becoming a screenwriter",
    "yes",
    "Definitely. This course is a great intro to the world of film, especially for those who might be interested in script-writing in the future. Marc is a joy to work with and the coursework really immerses you in the world of film development.",
    "I recommend this for anyone who has an interest in screenwriting and has an idea they want to write. I wish this met more than once a week (not counting subgroup meetings, which were a great addition to this class). I wish more classes followed the subgroup format.",
    "I would recommend this course if you are at all interested in films. Reading film scripts and writing a screenplay is very different that most things you will probably do in your Yale career and it is very enjoyable."
