   "comments": [
    "I think this is a fantastic course that everyone should take. Asian American history is something that is not really considered when viewing American history at large, and that's really unfortunate. There are a lot of readings, but this can be manageable. The readings are super interesting. Professor Lui is a great historian, and lectures are super interesting. TAKE IT!!!!!!!!!",
    "A great class to learn about Asian American History. Not anything you would cover in any other class in college or high school. It was different from all the other history courses I have taken. The workload is extremely high (see other comments for why) and the readings can get dull sometimes.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class. It's a great mix of social, economic, and political history and provides a much better picture of American history than most students get. The reading is solid, the work is manageable, and the lectures are well-done and engaging.",
    "This is the hardest class I have ever taken at Yale. The readings will take a full Saturday. 2 essays and 2 tests--basically, concurrently at midterms and finals. Plan accordingly!",
    "I fully recommend this course to another student. Professor Lui was fantastic throughout the semester; her lectures were the highlights of my classes of this semester. The workload may be a bit tough: there's a bit of reading, and there's a midterm paper, midterm, final research paper, and final take-home exam, along with mandatory section participation.However, if you're even remotely interested, Professor Lui paints a haunting, profound narrative of the Asian American experience in the United States. The course is not impossible--in fact, it is very accessible to anyone who is interested. I didn't have the time to read through *all* of the assigned readings; furthermore, I had only taken one history course before this (and I'm a STEM double major). However, even without the \"proper background,\" I still did very well in the class, thanks to Professor Lui's incredible teaching and Devin's (the TF assigned to the course) wonderful help throughout the semester. Tip: respect the primary sources (I might've stuck too close to them at times, but doing so really helped), that's how I did well in the course.Take this course. Absolutely. I needed it for a distributional requirement, but taking this course made me consider taking many more History\/American Studies courses in my Yale career. The course asks the hard questions on race formation, political resistance, migration, gender roles, and will make you think about not only the Asian American experience in the United States, but also the experience of minorities at large in the United States.",
    "This was definitely a rewarding experience. Previously to this class I only took one class on philosophy and had not taken any history class in college. There was a lot of reading and I wished I had stayed on top of it better. I learned a lot from this class. For the amount of writing this class did I would have hoped that it was a writing credit.Definitely take this class whether you are a humanities, science or whatever major. I absolutely loved this and it was by far one of the better classes I took at Yale: professor was great, TA was knowledgeable, and material was interesting.",
    "It is an absolutely wonderful class and a must take. People hardly know anything about Asian American history (I definitely did not before this class), yet it is so important in order to understand the history of our country. When people think Asian American history, they usually think Chinese exclusion and Japanese internment and that's it, but there is SO much more. This class not only teaches Asian American history but at least for me, it really made me think about much larger themes like citizenship, race, and community formation. Professor Lui is amazing and her lectures are the best. Yes, there is a lot of work, but it is TOTALLY worth it.",
    "This is a comprehensive introduction to the history of Asians in America. Every and any student should take this class, provided they like to read; the workload is non-negotiable if you want to get the benefits and knowledge of this class.",
    "Yes. Asian American History is a great course and should be a core course for the AMST major."
