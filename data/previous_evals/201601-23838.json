   "comments": [
    "This is very rewarding to learn all the anthro theories in a systematic way!",
    "ANTH 311 is not your typical anthropological theory course. It is a creative and sophisticated introduction to questions of voice, representation, and knowledge production. The assignments were very out of the box and enjoyable. The only frustrating thing was that our class size was pretty big so there wasn't much time for discussion each week.",
    "Take this class if you like philosophy\/critical theory\/have questions about anthropology and colonialism. The readings are amazing and varied. The assignments are stimulating and creative. Professor Erami knows so much and makes these ideas digestible while at the same time showing their complexity.",
    "If the course is larger than 20 people I would recommend staying away from this course. The engagement with the text is fairly low and I don't feel like I learned a huge amount, nor was I able to discuss ideas creatively and productively.",
    "I wish everyone had to take this class, because the syllabus is a necessary, in-depth exploration of post-colonial thought. I feel better able to talk about issues on and off campus now that I have this theoretical background.",
    "Yes would definitely recommend",
    "Not every class at Yale truly allows students to learn. But this class allows students to learn at their own pace, to their own extent, which is a unique and wonderful experience to have at Yale. The readings are pretty great, and I enjoyed the class overall.",
    "Good class that is pretty much what you would expect from the title. A good overview of anthropological theory. Two presentation, three short papers. Professor Erami really cares that her students understand the material and do well in the class.",
    "Take the class if you want to get a better grasp of Anthropology theory. However, that does not mean that you'll fully understand by the end of the course. It will definitely give you a better foundation, upon which you can continue to work on your understanding of the discipline. You can get away by not doing the readings, but that also means you'll miss the essence of the course. If you dedicate yourself to understanding and grappling with the material, then you can get a lot out of the course. As for assignments, you write three 1000 word papers (which are NOT easy; they are challenging but very fun to write) and give two presentations throughout the course on readings of your choice.",
    "Since there were many more students this year than last year's class, I feel I wasn't primarily taking away clear, specific ideas definitely associated with certain thinkers on anthropological theory, but I was more so taking away from every class a sense of having engaged with a kind of atmosphere that encouraged my own train of thought during the class in an anthropological grammar (re-thinking how I represent others in my thoughts, how I represent myself to others on varying planes of interaction, etc.). However, I felt this was much more helpful in the long-run having to apply that way of thinking to writing the papers, doing the readings on my own, and coming away from the semester towards future experiences.",
    "This is a great, great class. You read things normally pushed to the fringe by the crusty white men who have dominated anthro and theory for too long. Prof. Erami is so incredible and brings her expertise and field work to bear on class discussion, which also can be extremely student-led. I do think, however, from talking to people who took the class previously, that it was better in former years when there were less students: my year, a good portion of each class was dominated by student presentations, which can sometimes not be that helpful. Also, be prepared for a lot of senior anthro majors who bring outside info to the class and proceed as if everyone's read everything they have. Overall, though, absolutely wonderful. Prof. Erami makes this a fantastic course, as do the readings. (there's a LOT of reading)"
