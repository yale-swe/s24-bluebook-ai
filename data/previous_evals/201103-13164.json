   "comments": [
    "Non-CS majors: This class starts with what a database is, then covers PostgreSQL (which is an open source database), and SQL (which is a language used to work with databases), and the first couple chapters are all about how you can use SQL to utilize a database. Then the course goes into SQL at a theoretical level i.e. relational algebra expressions, and from there we talk about relational databases and the ER model. The latter half of the course discusses different types of storage (cache, memory, disk, etc), record organization (B+ trees, indices, extendable hashing), normalization, transactions, concurrency, and durability in databases.If all that sounds foreign to you, no worries. It's a bit tricky at first, especially if you've never programmed, but you'll learn a ton about the concepts behind databases, and nothing is really hard. In addition, after the first half of the course, you'll be able to create and work with a database for whatever you want. I'd definitely recommend this as one of the more practical courses at Yale, even though the 2nd half is mostly theory.CS majors: If you've finished 223, this class will be really easy. If you've worked with SQL before, the first half of this course will be review for you. Some stuff can get a bit tricky, but it's mostly just learning the new stuff and practicing for a bit. Lectures are basically unnecessary because his slides are terrific. Just study the slides for definitions and limitations on things, and you'll ace this class.",
    "Presents basics of database theory. Teaches you SQL. If you need that stuff and don't want to learn it yourself, or if you want an easy but not terribly interesting elective, take it. Else no.",
    "I would not recommend this to non-computer science Yalies. As a computer science Yalie, I found this class a bit unengaging.",
    "This is a fairly straightforward and easy elective if you either go to class or read the lectures\/textbook. The workload is relatively light and overall the course is enjoyable. You learn some practical tools (SQL) and some database design insight. A good elective in the CS major that requires little to no coding at all."
