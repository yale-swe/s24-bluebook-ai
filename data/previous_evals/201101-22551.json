    "to take a course named after a book that the teacher co-wrote or edited was so cool. it's almost like a once-in-a-lifetime shot. who would know the material better?we all did presentations. some of us did one and a half, to two. those were so cool, and then we wrote a final paper.here are my recommendations before taking the course: 1) get the exact prerequisites (i do have these, but i want more history of metaphysics now); 2) read quality and concept; and 3) read some of george's work on modal epistemology. these are a way to have a better picture of some of the arguments.i have to strongly recommendto the mature philosophy student. to the student who just believes that he or she can come to lecture, and b.s. a paper, i suggest you stick to another course (for the sake of the other students in the class); we had no students that were just trying to get by, everyone was a great participant (even graduate auditors).take it if you are serious about philosophy and want to learn, but if you are taking the course because it fits your schedule or something, please do not waste your time for the sake of the other students that care about learning the material.this class is the best i have taken in yale's philosophy department, and george is without question the best teacher (in terms of actual understanding and work) that i have had here.",
    "I would recommend this class to someone with an extensive background in philosophy and a great interest in metaphysics.",
    "It's a class taught by George Bealer; 'nuff said."
