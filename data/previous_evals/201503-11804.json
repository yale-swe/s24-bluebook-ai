    "Fascinating material. If you really want to understand the physics of modern electronics, computing, etc. you have to take this class. You learn how we go from semiconductor materials to logic gates, and tons of other things as well- Mark's last four lectures were on optoelectronics (solar cells, LEDs, lasers and the like), heterojunction devices, and the peculiar history of the invention of the transistor. Mark is a strong lecturer- make sure you ask questions when you have them- the class is small and he will get to you. You will understand modern technology so much better after this course. Worth it if you're a curious non-EE major.",
    "It's a necessary class for the EENG major. If it wasn't I probably wouldn't have taken it but I'm not really interested in going that far into detail about semiconductors. However, if you're interested in learning how semiconductors work and how they're manufactured, then this would be a good class to take.",
    "EENG 320 is a true introduction to semiconductors: diodes, BJT's, MOSFETs. By the end of this course you will understand, at least qualitatively, how transistors work. You will understand a lot quantitatively as well. Professor Reed explains the concepts in class very clearly and the TF's are extremely helpful with labs and homework. Because there is so much information, however, this course requires a lot of time, especially when writing labs.",
    "Most difficult and perhaps the most rewarding class in the EE undergraduate curriculum. Labs are tough but a great experience. HWs are reasonable and the tests are not built to punish you.",
    "EENG 320 is a fast-paced introduction to the wonderful world of solid-state physics. If you've ever wanted to know exactly why a transistor does what it does, this class is for you. If you want to know how to fabricate these devices and the world of variance you can have, this class is for you. Prof. Reed is a great lecturer; incredibly knowledgeable, approachable, and really interesting. By throwing in the occasional lecture on industry applications or history of transistors, you won't get swamped by just physics. highly recommended though you do have to put in a lot of your own time to fully grasp the concepts. They do come quite fast.",
    "EENG 320 provides you with a solid foundation for the physics of semiconductor devices. You'll develop a physical understanding of diodes, BJTs, FETs, and get comfortable deploying mathematical models for each. Lectures are fascinating!!"
