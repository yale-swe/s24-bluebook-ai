   "comments": [
    "The beginning material is really easy for anyone who is taking this class. But the information starts moving very quickly as you near the end of the term, making it hard to catch up. So be on your toes. The curve is better in this class and Smooke is a great guy to take it with because he understands what's fair for students.",
    "ENAS 151 is a good course for someone who needs to take multivariable calculus and is interested in the physical sciences. If you plan on any sort of engineering major, take this class instead. Prof. Smooke is a great guy and you'll likely run into him again in ENAS 194 and definitely in upper-level MechE courses. The problem sets aren't too bad and are due weekly. The exams are pretty fair too, and he gives you all the formulas you could need. He tries to do as many real-life applications and demonstrations as he can, and they were usually pretty cool. He's a very patient and approachable guy who genuinely loves to teach this course.",
    "Multivar is multivar; definitely take this class though if having concrete contexts for your equations and theorems is helpful for you. Smooke is great.",
    "Eh. Not too hard but I lack conceptual understanding of the topics. Definitely helped out with my physics and engineeringn classes though. Overall, take if you are doing engineering and don't really care about deeply understanding the math behind it.",
    "Great course, DEFINETLY TAKE INSTEAD OF MATH 120. Unless you're some sort of math genius. Which I am not, and I felt challenged by this class but not overwhelmed. Smooke is a great teacher and very fair. That said, I think there could have been a bit more communication via email about times and places of review sessions, etc. But really, a good class. I'm glad I took it.",
    "It is Multivariable calculus for people who are not majoring in math. I would recommend doing it instead of Math 120 if they were looking for a prerequisite class to their major.",
    "If you are thinking about pursuing for engineering, you should consider taking this course instead of 120 if it fits better into your schedule. Shop both and see which one you like better! I think it's a good alternative that teaches you more about real world applications.",
    "Great class I love it. Had no struggles and the test where very similar to the p-sets great alternative to Math 120.",
    "A much better alternative to Math 120. Definitely take this over 120! Professor Smooke is awesome and the workload is reasonable. The TA's were also helpful but everything could be learned out of the book with time.",
    "A challenging course that I would only take if you are required to. Not a very enjoyable course at all.",
    "yes",
    "Interesting math course. Take only if you want to continue with math. Not for those who are unsure about their major.",
    "I would recommend this over Math 120",
    "This is probably a more straight-to-the-theorems option than math 120, but still be prepared to put in a lot of work. Mitchell Smooke is friendly and available, but he lectures directly from his notes at warp speed, and if you miss a step while you were frantically writing down the last one, you can be jettisoned into the lost zone for the rest of the class. The book will save you. The problem sets take many hours, and you have to start them early in the week. If you're thinking of engineering, this is a staple course.",
    "Definitely take it over Math 120. The applications and real life relevance makes this course much more comprehensible. Profrssor Smooke is very competent and his explanations are very clear. The presentation made the difficult material exciting and fun to learn. I feel like I've really grown.",
    "ENAS 151 is likely the best math class I've ever taken. It's focus on real world application makes it exciting and the material easy to engage. The workload is totally appropriate for this kind of class. Professor Smooke is an excellent teacher who cares both about the material and his students. He makes the math come alive while keeping the room active and engaged. He is invested in the students and makes sure that they all understand and feel comfortable in his class, and often learns everyone's name. Would highly recommend.",
    "This is a great alternative to Math 120. It is a bit more example focused, but covers almost the exact same material and more effectively. The work is not too bad, but can be annoying at times. Still, it teaches you what you need, and is a good course overall.",
    "Do not take this if you need to know multi for a class later on. You will learn very little.",
    "This class will either affirm that you should become an engineer (or any career requiring math) or force you out of anything math related at Yale.",
    "ENAS 151 is for those who prefer application to theory. Would recommend for engineers or physicists.",
    "Yes; applied, easy to grasp, and great professor.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to a fellow student. If you at all enjoy math, you'll like the material. But two things to consider: 1) this is an \"applied\" math class, and so that translates to computational (not proof-based) PSETS. These can be tedious and unchallenging and it can feel like plug-and-chug if you don't have the motivation to dig into the theory on your own. 2) Prof. Smooke's teaching style is particular. He largely rewrite the textbook on the board -- if that doesn't bother you, then you're fine. If it does, either don't come to class (not the best option, because why waste a credit on a class you won't attend? Especially when you can always figure out a way to get around having to take this course) or take a different course (a much better option). Teaching style aside, Prof. Smooke seems to genuinely care about students, which is pretty great. The workload is totally manageable; what gets covered is not at all a big conceptual lift (at least not until the very end of the semester, and even then it's a moderate lift). Assuming you took the initiative to read the book\/payed attention in class\/thought some about the material on your own, you'll walk away with a new understanding of a bunch of different types of equations, which is both useful and satisfying.",
    "ENAS 151 is a multivariable calculus course designed with a real life application focus for engineers. However, I would recommend this course for anyone who wants a solid foundation in multivariable calculus, and unless someone is deeply interested in the solely theoretical aspect of multivariable, I would recommend ENAS 151 over MATH 120. Having said that, my positive experience with the class had a lot to do with the excellent professor.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class over Math 120 to anyone who will be using applied multivariable calculus. I really enjoyed the more straightforward, application-based material, and professor Smooke was also a great teacher. I still learned a ton of material, but in a much easier and more understandable way.",
    "I definitely recommend it to any students that learn by application. The questions on the homework and on the tests were always doable using the skills we got in problem sets and the class. Very fair, and a great math class.",
    "ENAS 151 is a more applied version of Math 120. If you are like me and learn better when things are applied, not just in theory, then I highly recommend ENAS 151."
