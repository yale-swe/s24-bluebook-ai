    "A great class different from other psych courses, since it is largely application based. We discuss how to formulate psychological cases for patients with a variety of health concerns, and how to best approach behavior change. The class was a mix of lecture, discussion, and therapist\/patient role plays, making it a great median between the lecture and seminar.",
    "Don't take the class if you're not super into psych. There's a lot of reading (though you don't really have to do it), two exams, one mini paper, and a health change project throughout the semester culminating in an 8-10 page paper. The workload, then, overall isn't bad at all and it's pretty cool to work on yourself as an assignment, but I don't think it's worth taking the course because while it's very interesting for the first two weeks, thereafter, it's remarkably repetitive. The exams are very picky and Professor Toll wants you to remember exact phrases rather than the same idea in different terminology. I had a lot of hope for this class that I would learnvery interesting material and take away a lot for my future clinical practice. Unfortunately, all my growth was contained in the first two weeks of the class. If you're a psych major, this might be more up your alley. Otherwise, I find it repetitive and kind of light.",
    "A fantastic course in which you learn the methods of health psychology.",
    "Great class for students interested in being health psychologists. Very interactive. It got a bit redundant in the middle, but picked up toward the end. Very applicable. I was glad that I took it because of its small interactive size. The health change project is also what you put in. I enjoyed writing that.",
    "Health psychology is an intersting class that gives a unique perspective on the psychology of behavior change. While the topic is fairly interesting and can be useful overall, it did get a bit repetitive at times. The test - while manageable - can be frustrating to study for, as the material can be a bit amorphous at times. Grades overall are not too bad, as 40% of your grade is a final paper (which is easy if you've been paying attention, and you can get lots of feedback from the TF), and 10% is based on participation and a one page debate statement, essentially free points. It is a seminar, so it can be a bit hard to get into. I would shop it, because the format may not be interesting to everyone. Overall, I would recommend the course to people regardless of if they are a psych major or not (most of the class was not majoring in psych).",
    "If you are at all interested in going into any sort of psychology or health-related field, TAKE THIS CLASS! It is one of the only classes I've taken where I really feel like I learned something practical and applicable for my future career. Its main strength is how applied it is vs. just theoretical. Also, the self-change project is a really really awesome experience - it definitely helps you understand just how hard it is to change a behavior. There's not too much work outside of the self-change project and paper. Dr. Toll is wonderful: he's very accessible and extremely knowledgeable, passionate, and experienced in the field of clinical psychology. The lectures are a little repetitive, but he makes it very clear what you need to know for the tests. If you want some practical advice for being a doctor or a psychologist, then this is the class for you.",
    "This class has a lot of real strengths. The material is very engaging, especially if you're at all interested in health or psychology. Professor Toll is a really nice guy, and he cares about his students a LOT. I hadn't taken any psych classes ever before (including intro psych), and I still felt like I could understand the material and was constantly learning. We had a couple of really fantastic guest speakers, which really added meat to the course.The overall weakness of the course is that after the first two months, all the material feels like it's being repeated over and over. I wouldn't let that stop you from taking the course -- but I do hope that Dr. Toll adds more new material.The readings are interesting but there are too many of them and no one really does that reading.I think the exams were pretty easy, and parts of them (namely the case studies) were really cool. But Dr. Toll also made you memorize a bunch of pointless studies If I were to give him feedback directly, I'd tell him to do away with all the memorization for the exam and make part of the exam grade a sample interview, where you get tested on your ability to act as the clinician with the patient.Overall, I'd say a FANTASTIC class but be aware that it's more work then you may think.ALSO find out about the individual project ahead of time. If you don't like it (as I didn't), it will just be annoying but the rest of the material is worth it.",
    "Health Psychology is a very interesting and well-taught course. I would highly recommend it to any student interested in pursuing a career in medicine, clinical psychology, or a related field. The course involves a mix of lectures and role plays during which you have a chance to apply the skills you learn in the class. The workload is very manageable, and the exams are very fair. Professor Toll is a wonderful instructor, and he brings in a variety of guest speakers who compliment the course well. The self-change project, which involves modification of any health behavior of your choosing, is really fun, challenging, and insightful.",
    "It's going to be a different type of psychology class. Most classes here are highly theoretical, while this was incredibly practical. We barely learned any theory of why we were doing these techniques, but we did spend a lot of time practicing our techniques. Don't waste your time reading the papers, but keeping up with both textbooks will help you get the most out of the class. Very little reading is actually necessary to do well, but the more you read the more you'll enjoy yourself. There is also a semester-long self-change project that can be incredibly rewarding.",
    "This is a great class. Really relaxed with a great professor. The self change project is also a great opportunityto actually do something healthy during the semester. You really get as much as you put into it, but some people are able to do some amazing things like run marathons.",
    "Take it. If you can get in, it will be the best class you have during the semester, the self-change project makes you evaluate your life. Changes you as a person more than it teaches you. But of course, you learn everything you want to know about health psychology. And practical classes, with clinical role-play.",
    "Good unique course"
