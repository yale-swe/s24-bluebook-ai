    "For someone with very little prior experience in global affairs or political science, certainly a class in which you will learn a lot. For more experienced students, lectures are not helpful. The readings, however, are quite interesting if you have time to do them all, which not very many students did this semester. As with most humanities courses, the material covered in the lectures and readings were disconnected from the assignments, so there was not too much incentive to do them, though they were certainly good readings!",
    "As of now, GLBL 275 is still an experiment. The structure of the course is not set; the teaching style is not set. Really, everything's still somewhat up in the air. But as you probably know if you're looking at this course, it is a mandatory class for the major so just keep your hopes high if you're a new Global Affairs majorbecause things will improve. We were only the second generation, so I'm assuming that by the third, they will be much better.",
    "This class is a theoretical study of the largest topics in international security (ranging from terrorism, intervention, nuclear weapons, international institutions, etc.) that has you apply your own analysis to the preexisting literature in those fields and write comparisons, analyses, and your own proposed research design.",
    "You either have to take this course or are not allowed to take this course based on whether or not you are a Global Affairs major. So, those of you who are GA majors and will be taking this course: I'm sorry. Hopefully they figure out a way to make it better, and they did make changes for our year, so hopefully they will make more changes before you have to suffer through it. But here's what I have to say about my experience:This course is the worst course I have ever taken at Yale. Professor Sanchez is horrible and essentially gave up part-way through the course. She stopped lecturing at all and just divided up the students into small groups for \"discussion\" each class period. Students quickly stopped coming to class because it was clear that it would be pointless, and though I came to basically every course, there wasn't a single class period (EXCEPT the two sessions led by the TAs when Thania wasn't there!) that I felt was worth my time. I almost regret being a Global Affairs major because of this class. Though the writing exercises were useful, they could have been laid out more clearly. Since the course was a writing credit, section only focused on writing, and though I loved my TA and my section, it would have been nice to actually talk about the material (since we weren't doing that in class!).The advice I have: make use of your TA and your section as the best part of the course and choose the topics you write about carefully, as they will be the only things you really get out of the course and you may as well make that as interesting and useful for yourself aspossible!",
    "The only reason you will take this course is because you are required to. I love this major but I kinda wanted to drop out because this class was so bad.Professor Sanchez seems smart, but she was a terrible professor. Her lectures were just bad. She didn't seem seriously interested in the subject matter and her lecture technique often consisted of excitedly caricaturing the authors' theses and pointing out that they were in conflict. As a result, there were days when only fifteen students (out of fifty enrolled) came to the lecture. The professor was also not a skilled communicator on a personal level.Workload-wise, it doesn't matter if you do the readings (I still did them) except for the two weeks during which you have to respond to a few of them. Other than that, you are never assessed, at least with my TA.",
    "You have to take. I'm so sorry. I would not recommend it if I could.",
    "This class is an extreme waste of everyone's time. The materials chosen represent the extreme flaws in the field of international security and Professor Sanchez does nothing to explain how the field is moving forward. Her teaching style involves zero commitment to inspiring students to think critically and a total lack of preparation for lectures. Professor Sanchez argues at thebeginning of the class that the academic security specialists have no connection to the reality of actual security practice. This class mirrors that divide as well as the professor's separation from the needs and academic background of her students. This class has the opportunity to excite students to pursue useful research in security studies; instead, it introduces students to the worst research techniques I have ever seen, and actually dubs some of them valid.This is the worst class I have ever taken at Yale. While I would not avoid the Global Affairs Major solely based on the class, just know that you will not get anything out of it.",
    "This class is closely tied with intermediate microeconomics as the worst class I've had to take as a Global Affairs major. Lectures were very boring and were not helpful at all in better understanding the material. The class was painful, poorly organized. Professor Sanchez is wonderful in person, but she wasn't able to effectively run a lecture. I'm hoping they completely change this class. As it stands now, I've been having trouble recommending the major.",
    "To be honest, I have been looking forward to writing this for about 2 months as some sort of vindication of how much I have hated this class. Let me break it down:The class itself was taught as if it was section, meaning that Professor Sanchez took apart bits of the reading but never brought any new information. She expected frequent audience participation\u00e2\u0080\u0094remember this is taught in a large lecture hall, though by the end of the semester only 20 people showed up\u00e2\u0080\u0094and was not dismayed by long, awkward silences when no one had anything to contribute. In the beginning of the year, she used least helpful powerpoints I have ever witnessed. These involved black screens with single words or phrases in white, like \"International Institutions\" or \"Realism.\" Later, even more insultingly, class was broken up into thirds. In the first, Professor Sanchez commented on the readings and asked for our thoughts, though no one read it. In the second, we were broken up into four groups (often with 4 students, as no one went to class) and asked to solve problems that baffled the week's authors. For example, one week, we were told to solve African poverty. Unsurprisingly, we were not able to accomplish that feat. In the last, Professor Sanchez criticized our suggestions. While she may have derived some sort of feeling of superiority out of it, I'm not sure how this helped me.I am not sure who the audience was for the class. Security students already studied this and have likely read 1\/4 or more of the readings. Development students aren't interested in it in the first place. I think Professor Sanchez may have found a way to turn both of them off. Her treatment of the material was mind-numbingly boring, surface-level and not engaging. On the other hand, she used no innovative approaches to draw in development students. The class focused on theory, not case studies or examples, so I felt thoroughly disconnected from anything real to take away.Call me shallow, but I can deal with a horrible required class if I can do well in it. But the most frustrating part about the class was that in addition to not learning anything, I was also not likely getting an A. We have two papers, a midterm and a final, that are nothing like papers that I have ever written or I ever plan on writing again.The midterm was a literature review. In an ideal world, you read and critique all studies, articles and books relating to a topic. First of all, the scope was impractical. Rather than narrow topics that are more easily perusable, we were supposed to read all literature about \"war\" or \"nuclear weapons.\" This turned into reading a few sentences in a lot of reports and getting good at citing sources. The instructions\u00e2\u0080\u0094and takeaway\u00e2\u0080\u0094were beyond unclear. We did have two \"rough drafts\" throughout the year...but those were for the simple reading responses rather than the midterm or final.The final was a research design, which combined the 2 things I was least interested in: theory and statistics. We were required to come up with our own, unique theory in international relations and back it up with an imaginary testing mechanism. Just look at every other class offered in the major. Do they have anything to do with this at all? I don't even understand who was supposed to benefit from this.I am sorry I am so bitter. There were good parts. The readings were sometimes interesting and my TA was helpful when not MIA. But never before have I taken a class this bad. It is astounding to me that Professor Sanchez is a professor here, that this curriculum was thought to have any merit and that a required class for a major I love can be this frustrating, boring and terrible. A common joke in the class was that people were rethinking their decision to be a Global Affairs major thanks to this. This is not something to joke about. Serious actions need to be taken to fix this class, and until that happens, I would not recommend this to anyone who is not forced to take it.",
    "Many people did not show up to lecture and probably did fine. Readings are interesting but unnecessary to do well.",
    "You aren't taking this class because of choice, but because it is required for the Global Affairs major. There is still a long way to go before this course becomes very engaging, but until then just take this course with a realistic mindset: the material is not the freshest, but it is core IR theory material. I recommend taking this class with the expectations to improve your social science writing, if you choose to use all the tools available. It is more about the way of thinking through social science literature than it is about the substantive IR material.",
    "Terrible. Almost a reason not be a Global Affairs major (fortunately some outstanding seminars make up for it.)",
    "It sucks for you that you have to take this. Literally so awful. Hopefully it sees some majorimprovements next year.",
    "Chances are, if you're reading this review, you're a Global Affairs major, so you don't really have a choice as to whether or not you'll take this. The way the class is structured right now; however, I would be really hesitant to recommend it to another student. Nevertheless, I know the professor and Jackson are working really hard to make the class better, so I'm sure it'll only improve from here.",
    "Required class for the global affairs major so this might be practically meaningless, but overall I'd say yes.",
    "If you are a global affairs major, you have to take this class. Just be aware ahead of time that this is a very theory-based class, and the written assignments are mostly literature reviews.",
    "As one of the intro courses to the global affairs major, I would have expected this course to be better taught, especially after the poor reviews it received last year. It is truly very sad that such a poor class is one of the requirements of the global affairs major. The department needs to seriously consider hiring a new professor for this course and changing the assignments.",
    "Terrible. A reason to think twice about the major. The readings are great, but the teaching and assignments are not.",
    "This class is an absolute embarrassment to the Global Affairs major and to Yale. The department has been trying to improve this course for years, but they have yet to take the essential step of choosing another professor. If Professor Sanchez still teaches this, take it only if you're really committed to the Global Affairs major. Professor Sanchez is condescending and offensive not only to the class but also to the authors of the readings, which you wouldn't think possible when they're Clausewitz and Schelling. For some reason, somebody also thought it would be a good idea to make us do class debates and activities in our 9am lecture. This got increasingly awkward as attendance dropped to around 6 people on a good day. I actually felt as if this class killed my spirit a little bit. This was further exacerbated by an incredibly annoying section with an overly serious and yet completely disorganized TA.Assignments include 2 reading responses that you bizarrely have to submit a draft of and rewrite. This is in contrast to the midterm and final paper for which it is impossible to get tangible feedback because your TA has the attention span of a bedbug.If you're a Global Affairs major and have to take this class, all I can say is that it's not really that hard and we all definitely bonded over our misery. The only explanation for the continued shittiness of this class is that Levinsohn sees this as a valuable extended fraternity hell week. I want to compare sitting through lecture to group water-boarding but that might be a tiny bit dramatic.",
    "Ugh. So much to say about this course. As it currently exists, it sucks, but it won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t exist like this anymore so take these reviews with a grain of salt.This year, they made it a writing course (in the attempts to make our time spent in the classroom valuable) which is nice, but it had some unfortunate side effects: a) the writing was structured poorly- we had 5 weeks to write 3 page response papers, but a week or two to write each of our larger papers, the midterm and the final. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just dumb and b) there was even LESS of an incentive to do the readings, because in section we only talked about writing and not about the readings, and in lecture we talked about very little at all.Then there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the fact that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a humanities lecture at 9 am, and a professor (who is, to her credit probably a brilliant researcher) that is just an awful public speaker. Add all that up and it makes for a pretty poor class experience, which is embarrassing for the major, unfortunately.They are working to revise this course- to take advantage of knowledge that we already have, to make the readings more relevant to the course, and to try and take advantage of some of the course\u00e2\u0080\u0099s unique characteristics (only 50 people, all who have been selected, eseentially, to take the class based on their demonstrated interest in the topic).It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not good, but you have to take it and so I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d just recommend that you do as many of the readings as possible, so that you at least leave the class with some exposure to the important works in IR. Looking forward to seeing how they make it better.",
    "I had trouble encouraging those in 2015 to apply to global affairs, knowing they would have to slog through this course. Please revamp. The reviews from last fall were equally poor and the course was still insufferable. There's nothing like inviting people into a so-called exclusive major with a course that makes them feel stupid.",
    "This is a horrible class worth avoiding at all costs, even if it means switching majors. You learn next to nothing about the important historical or current issues in international security - for example, how the UN or the ICC works ro why the US has an adversarial relationship with China - but get overloaded with an absurd amount of very fluffy theory discussions. The assignments, which were excessive, had nothing to do with the material. Our final paper was a 15 page research design that none of us knew how to set up. Even if you attended every class and did all the readings, it's almost impossible to gain anything from GLBL 275. This class is a wreck, the professor is a mess, and you could learn more about international security from one copy of the Economist over a semester in this course.",
    "Absolutely not. Not even for freshmen with no knowledge of international affairs. The evaluations for this class last year were predominantly 'below average' and 'poor,' and I have to say that I would agree. At this point, this class makes Global Affairs significantly less appealing, and I have told many sophomores that as they apply for their majors.This class is an absolute waste of time, and I don't think I learned anything.",
    "Not as bad as people made it sound because they didn't attend the lectures at all. I missed some lectures too, but that wouldn't make the class terrible. They could do better in terms of syllabus and give more time forthe final and midterm papers.. Oh and ALS, the TAs' grading was not really fair.. Some were way more strict whereas other way more chill..",
    "The lectures for this class were pretty bad this past semester. We barely learned anything new in lecture that was not already in the readings. Nevertheless the readings are interesting and sections were really helpful in helping you write the papers and reading responses for the class. Workload is pretty low, except during the weeks of the midterm and final papers.",
    "This is by far the worst class I've taken at Yale. Thania is a horrible professor, with poor presentation skills and useless slides. Section was a waste of time as we talked about how to write papers rather than discussing concepts covered in lecture. There was no incentive to attend lecture as the professor merely summarized readings. The midterm literature review was a painful waste of time...Unfortunately for Global Affairs majors, this is a required course.",
    "You will take because you have to take it so...",
    "Don't take it unless you are a global affairs major and don't have a say. If you're looking for a writing credit, there are better, more interesting class out there.",
    "you have to take it. sucks..",
    "I would not recommend the class but GA students do not have a choice in the matter. I would recommend allowing students to take this earlier on.",
    "If you're a Global Affairs major, you haveto take this, so just bite the bullet and try not to scream, cry, or curse.",
    "One of the most aggravating and unfulfilling experiences of my Yale career.",
    "This class makes me regret being a Global Affairs major. Poorly organized, mind-numbingly boring, and totally irrelevant to most of our interests (and I say this as someone on the security track!)",
    "Overall this course melds together the key sub fields of international security. Good readings we should all be familiar with as Global Affairs majors and globally minded individuals. Pedagogy needs work. Try to engage with the prof one on one to gain more from the course.",
    "The bad news: this is the worst class I have ever taken at Yale. The good news: the Jackson Institute is working on improving it so hopefully it will be better for you. This class is required for all GA majors and in theory, this should have been an interesting class. However, while the professor has good intentions, lectures are boring, poorly structured, and lack direction. The class as a whole seems poorly organized with too much time for easy assignments and not enough time to do the hardest ones (the midterm and the final) because due dates for the easy assignemnts are dragged out and placed too close to the midterm\/final. Readings are often interesting, but while lectures are boring, the TF's chosen to lead sections often seem to have unrealistic expectations and the midterm\/final assignments are not easy. That said, everyone else is in the same boat and in approximatly the same place so if you do the work your grade should be decent. So far, GLBL 275 has been one of the required classes that you know is bad but you just suck it up. However, this class will hopefully be significantly improved next year."
