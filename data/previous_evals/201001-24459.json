   "comments": [
    "The specific scope of this course makes it appeal to a specific demographic of students, I think, but for anyone who is interested in allusion, modernism, post-modernism, contemporary literature, or queer lit at all, I would highly recommend the class. It's a lot more work than is usual for an English seminar, both in terms of the reading load and the writing assignments, and its standards are more rigorous, but these challenges enhance the experience. Only take it if you are prepared to devote a lot of energy, but if you're able to do so it will be immensely rewarding for you!",
    "Take this class. Best and most challenging learning environment during my time at Yale",
    "I would recommend the course for a student who is excited about WGSS studies or wants a very thorough and invigorating introduction. The class is definitely not for the faint of heart.",
    "if you have a lot of time to devote to it, definitely take it.",
    "Sam See is a demanding but fantastic professor. This has been one of the most rigorous English courses I took at Yale (I am a senior English major), but it was also one of the few that challenged me in the way I expected to be challenged as a Yale student. Prof See puts in as much time and effort as he expects his students to, and it's high on both counts--but that is exactly as it should be for a Yale course. If you are ready to do the work and want an environment where the professor will be extremely personally attentive and committed to your growth and success, then absolutely take this class. If you love the first few discussions, then really consider taking it if you are prepared for the reading and the workload--these discussions were some of my favorites I've had at Yale.",
    "This class is about learning how to look at literature in a specific and interesting way - while specific, however, its implications are many and this class is totally relevant and important for all kinds of literary criticism.",
    "This class is hard, but sooo good. You'll do a ton of reading, and a bunch of writing, and maybe it will be painful along the way, but at the end I actually learned an important lesson about the (significant) cultural valence of mythology.I took this class bc I needed the writing credit and thought the topic was interesting. I got what I expected... a hard and good ride. Sam See is fantastic. You won't get a more caring or engaged professor.",
    "You read a variety of 20th century novels, poetry, and plays, along with a lot of articles and theory to supplement. The focus is on queer communities.",
    "Yes take it with Prof. See!"
