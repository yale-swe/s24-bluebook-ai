   "comments": [
    "ABSOLUTELY! This is quite possibly the most fun class I've taken at Yale. Most weeks were basically \"show-and-tell at the Beinecke.\" We spent several weeks looking at old documents at the Beinecke, several more with materials from Manuscripts and Archives, and even one week looking at Samurai swords at the Peabody. Professor Botsman is a very laid-back, fun discussion leader. We didn't always discuss the reading (which was frustrating if you actually did them), but I learned an immense amount about Japan, Yale's history, and the ridiculously immense archival and museum resources Yale has. If I had taken this class earlier in my time at Yale, it would have completely changed my outlook on the History major.",
    "I would absolutely recommend taking the course!",
    "This was a great intro class to using many of the archival resources Yale has to offer, as well as an interesting look at the connections between Yale and Japan.",
    "If you're interested about learning more about Yale and Japan.",
    "I would say if you need a seminar this is a great one to take. Learn a lot about a subject that many people don't know much about and go in depth about the relationship between Japan and Yale that is so important to the university. Also a fair amount of work that prepares you well for the final paper.",
    "Professor Botsman's junior seminar successfully integrated both the histories of Yale and of Japan to provide an insightful connection and exchanges between the two institutions. The course's strength lied in the two main areas: the primary sources that we were given to investigate and analyze independently, and the primary sources that we observed from Beinecke Rare Books and Manuscripts Library, Manuscripts and Archives, and Peabody Museum. While I wish we could have discussed more in depth about our readings, the readings were enjoyable in itself, and I believe that most, if not all, of the students did their assigned readings. In all, Yale and Japan was my most favorite class of the semester, and I hope that Professor Botsman will be teaching this course next year.",
    "Take it.",
    "Always take classes about Yale if you can! This was a really great class. Perhaps it could be a good freshman seminar as well. You have no idea how closely Japan and Yale are connected! In this class you examine that incredibly rich connection using some truly AMAZING primary sources. Primary sources so amazing, a film crew came from NHK and they may or may not have wanted to take some of them back to Japan with them... Take this class if you like Japan, history, great professors, the Beinecke, old documents, or you are a Yale student."
