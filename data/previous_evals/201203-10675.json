   "comments": [
    "Yes, I would recommend it.",
    "A review of basic consumer and producer theory that may be useful if you have never had micro theory before, or if it has been a while since you learned it. However, the material can be very dry and mathematical.",
    "It is a class that makes Economics practical and intuitive!",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend. You learn a lot from this course.",
    "A introductory but must have class if you want to study advanced level of economics",
    "It provides a good summary of basic economic concepts to a fairly good depth. Useful as an introduction to microeconomics.",
    "Definitely would recommend it. Interesting topics and engaging lectures, despite the few points critiqued earlier.",
    "I will recommend this course because this course was not so difficult as that of Ph.D course but this course bridges the material covered in undergrad and Ph.D.",
    "required course for IDE students, so there's no choice",
    "i would definitely recommend the course. It was a unique experience for me to learn microeconomics in such an applied manner.",
    "I would recommend taking this course. The application aspect of the course makes it extremely interesting. The course is not taught in a standard text book fashion which is why it is great.",
    "I would say this is a more theoretical approach to microeconomics and that some prior knowledge, especially in the realm of calculus, will be extremely helpful. Students well versed in mathematics with familiarity in economics seemed to do best in the course. However, I would also say that it's a great class to take if one's research is in any way related to consumer preferences, microeconomics, etc., as it really offers a could perspective on these topics.",
    "The class is a good introduction to graduate level microeconomics, but isn't as mathematically rigorous as a Phd level micro course. It is also a very applied course, which makes it very useful.",
    "Yes, absolutely.",
    "I recommend to take this class for student who have undergraduate micro economics background but do not have any advanced microeconomics background.",
    "It is a very good course for gaining a broad overview of Microeconomics, especially if one has not taken such a course before.",
    "It's a good class if their focus is microeconomics and they intend to do a Ph.D.",
    "I would recommend this class to someone who had taken economics as an undergraduate but not as their major as I think that the coverage and pace would be most suited to this level.",
    "Econ 545 gives a useful overview of microeconomic theory and applications mainly related to theory of the consumer and theory of the firm. It is not very math-heavy or technical, but does help you to think more carefully about microeconomic concepts. I think it is a useful course.",
    "A fairly tough intermediate microeconomics course. It gives you enough to be conversant in the language, and builds enough skill for you to learn more of what you need."

   "comments": [
    "I did not gain much out of the course particularly because it was very similar to my undergraduate classes.",
    "For me, it was a \"new\" way of learning micro. I used to have more graphical analyzes and in Econ545, it was more intuitive.",
    "I learned a lot of this in undergrad, so the class was not particularly useful for me. Only the stuff on rural labor markets was new, but we were not tested on this.",
    "Yes definitely. It's a different level or style of studying.",
    "Not sure yet. We'll see after the development class in Spring.",
    "Definitely a great introduction to microeconomics on a more advanced level.",
    "I would expect this course to contribute well to my future work\/studies, however at this point I cannot answer that question.",
    "This course made me remember what I learned in my undergrad long time ago and understood clearer.",
    "I had never heard the terms \"Hicksian\" or \"compensated demand\" before taking this course. Now, as I am conducting a literature review of environmental economic valuation methods, everything I learned about consumer theory in this course is coming to light and making much more sense. The models my research is based on are, in turn, based on all the models and theories discussed in this course. It has been incredibly helpful.",
    "Because of this class, I could deepen my knowledge. Now, I am ready to take development economics class.",
    "The more applied components of this class were helpful as they were more focussed on development econ."
