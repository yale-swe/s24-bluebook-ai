   "comments": [
    "I would but ONLY if you are really interested in East Asia. The \"Empires\" in the title makes the course seem way cooler than it really is (at least for people like me, who are only mildly interested in China, Korea, and Japan and their histories). I made the mistake of taking it only because I thought I would learn a lot of valuable History skills, but I never had time to go to the optional sections and thus couldn't make the most of the class in that regard. Beyond that it lost its value for me because I wasn't super interested in the material.",
    "Unique way of approaching East Asia. You cover quite a bit of history, but instead of simply memorizing facts, the class emphasizes the dynamic between China,Korea, and Japan in an interesting manner. Take it if you want to know how the history behind the dynamic between these countries.",
    "A sometimes confusing and unorganized class about pretty interesting material.",
    "This class is great for both beginners and people who already know something about the histories of any one of the empires. That three empires are taught makes this class worthwhile. There are also some very interesting video clips shown in class.",
    "This is a solid introduction to East Asian history. It is somewhat disorganized at points, but you will learn a lot and the workload is not too bad (two short papers, a midterm and final).",
    "No, I would not recommend this class. Professor Drixler is great, but the class itself is completely disorganized and disjointed. Some of the lectures were interesting on their own, but it was nearly impossible to follow any sort of coherent train of thought from lectureto another. It felt like there was information we were supposed to know, but never taught, despite the fact that the class was marketed as a basic survey course in East Asian history. Also, the instructions for the exam were so vague that studying for it was a bit of a nightmare. I have honestly never taken an exam that was so very stressful to study for. And in the end, I frankly don't think I learned much of anything at all, because the class was so very unfocused. I would strongly recommend not taking this class.",
    "I would recommend this course. The material is really helpful and relevant. At times I thought it could be approached better, but to be honest, it achieved what I wanted it to in allowing me to see thebroader trends in East Asian history.",
    "Definitely take it. It's a lot of reading, but Hansen and Drixler are good lecturers. This course will completely change your perspective of East Asia and recent developments there.",
    "This class is a good survey of East Asian history from forever ago until the modern day. I would recommend it if you know very little about Asian history. But be warned the teaching staff could be much improved. Day to day it was not very interesting at all, but overall I am glad about what I learned in the course. The essays are graded very harshly, which can be a good or bad thing."
