    "French 160 is a course that explores many facets of French culture. I would recommend the course if you are planning on taking a level 5 course but do not want to take French literature. However, the course is a lot of work, and vocab quizzes were exceedingly difficult. The oral exams were not terribly hard to prepare for although they were nerve-wracking. There were also a large number of reading and writing assignments. Class discussions were always interesting and engaging (though occasionally boring and drawn-out). If you choose take the course, take it with Madame Pinzka! Her enthusiasm is infectious, and she makes even the more boring topics seem interesting.",
    "Really engaging, but definitely quite a bit of work!",
    "If you think this class will have no writing, you're wrong, but, while frequent, the little essays are super-manageable and really help nail down the vocabulary that you need in order to speak better in class. If you can get a section of under 10, I think that for this particular class that works the best, since it's all about discussion. If you really want a good chance to work on your spoken French at a high level while learning about some of the most current issues in French society, definitely shop this class."
