    "good introduction to IR basics.",
    "As mentioned in Question 1 and 2, the course would be helpful for someone who wants to deepen and strenghten his\/her understanding about what is going on in international relations. The emphasis of the course on cotemporary challenges of the international system and its historical development would also be very useful.",
    "It's required, so yea. Especially good for those new to IR or who have training in a distinct academic discipline. Provides an overview of the key debates you should be familiar with. For those wishing to make a career out of IR, however, it falls short of placing these debates within the context of their broader historic origins.",
    "A superficial overview of twelve topics in IR that the instructor finds interesting\/pertinent. All incoming IR students must take this course, but I think it is the worst course I've ever taken and would not recommend it to a fly.While the class may be useful to those without any IR\/PoliSci background, I was bored to tears at the pointless banalities that were constantly thrown about during class discussions. I learned nothing that I hadn't known before and wish that I could have taken another course in its stead.",
    "You are required to take the couse, so you have no choice in the matter."

    "Somewhat. I appreciated the unique insight into contemporary issues in international affairs offered by the guest speakers. Beyond that, the issues and debates were largely ones that I was familiar with, or could fairly easily have educated myself about.",
