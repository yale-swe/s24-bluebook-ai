    "This course was very compelling because it combined art and mythology in Greek antiquity. I learned about the classic myths in antiquity and how they were represented visually. It was fascinating to see the connection between the myth and its representation in the visual arts.",
    "I learned how to identify and critically analyze Greek art, often in comparison to non-ancient-Greek era artifacts.",
    "Interesting course that helped my writing skills, TA's were great",
    "I'd never really done visual analysis of art before, or tied it into literature through essays. I also learned a lot about Greek culture in general.",
    "How to analyse ancient greek art and apply the myths and legends to the work",
    "I entered the class not knowing anything about art or humanities. I left the class being able to analyze art from any period, not just ancient Greek art. This class allowed me to use my writing and literature skills and to apply them to visual art and to see how the two are inherently interconnected.",
    "I learned how to talk about Ancient Greek art and myths. I learned what to look for, and how all of the stories play together.",
    "This class helps to develop analytic skills in regard to the relationship between textual and visual narrative.",
    "In this course I learned a lot about Greek Antiquity and how the myths of the ancient Greeks shaped art throughout time. I was also able to greatly improve my writing with this course.",
    "Through this course I developed a much better understanding and appreciation of art as well as ancient Greek texts.",
    "I learned all the stories of Greek mythology and improved my writing skills.",
    "I gained a through knowledge of the survey of Greek myths and the art related to them.",
    "I learned a lot about Greek art and mythology and got better at writing\/researching.",
    "in this course I learned a lot about ancient Greek mythology and how the culture of this society was depicted in art and texts",
    "I learned a lot about Greek mythology and how it permeated into Greek art and modern culture.",
    "I learned how to think critically about ancient art through both form and the context it was made.",
    "How to analyze art, how Greek art from antiquity connected to Greek myth",
    "I gained a deeper understanding of the Greek gods and the mythology surrounding ancient Greek culture through observing and studying the art of the time. My analysis of art increased and developed as well as my writing skills in describing such works of art.",
    "This class gives you a great overview of the language of iconography used in the ancient world and connects the ancient world to later periods of art.",
    "Basic skills of visual analysis were emphasized in this course, as well as skills in comparing works of literature and visual pieces. Insights into the world of ancient Greek myth as it has influenced society were also developed.",
    "Learned a decent amount about myths and Greek history\/geography but primarily learned about art, visual analysis, how to examine it and view it, etc.",
    "I learned a lot about the context of Greek myths. Even when I was familiar with the story, I didn't know a lot about how the Greeks would have interacted with myths. It was a really interesting class.",
    "The main things I gained from this course were a general understanding of some of the most important figures and stories in Greek mythology and the ability to critically view and write about visual art.",
    "I received a basic understanding of Ancient Greek art grounded in myth, texts, and images. As an art history major, I find that having such an understanding of Antiquity will serve as a helpful basis for my studies of later art."

   "comments": [
    "This course was very engaging. The lectures were interesting and Professor Gaifman's enthusiasm for the material made it fun to come to class. The readings were also enjoyable because they are classics and there are so many allusions to these stories that it is nice to know the myth on its own. It was also enjoyable to compare and contrast the text to the visual representations.",
    "The course is extremely interesting, and works well to supplement weaknesses of specific students by offering a variety of assessment types: midterm vs papers, and extra credit potentials.",
    "Cover a lot of mythology and texts but could have covered more actual art.",
    "The course was very interesting and informative and the professor is a great lecturer. The organizational structure could use some serious improvements though - some of the assignments were unclear, and the lecture slides didn't really contain any helpful information.",
    "I liked the subject and professor Gaifman was fun to listen to and loved her class. I enjoyed taking this class, though I wish we'd gotten more feedback on the essays since they were such a large part of the grade.",
    "This course is absolutely fabulous! As a young kid, I was interested in Greek mythology, and this class allowed me to take a more mature and intellectual approach to the ancient stories. This lecture course felt like a small seminar. The TFs are very talented and friendly, and Professor Gaifman connects to students personally to ensure that they are feeling good about the class. She even learned our names! Professor Gaifman is an amazing professor, a wonderful lecturer, and just a great person. I always looked forward to lecture, and that is not an easy task. The material was fascinating, and the professor made sure to convey her passion for Greek art to the class.",
    "By writing essays focused on analyzing art and literature peices, I was able to gain a deeper understanding of the significance of these works of art. This exercise also helped me gain a greater appreciation for art in general.",
    "I thought the course was structured very well and incorporated a fantastic range of texts, images, and trips to the Art Gallery to analyze works that I might not have taken the time to explore further otherwise.",
    "Great Overview. Could move faster.",
    "The readings for this course were at times dry, but for the most part, the material and readings were very interesting and engaging. Compared to the readings assigned for the other weeks, assigning the readings for the Odyssey and Iliad in a week was a bit of a stretch, but otherwise, the pacing was good. The lectures were always interesting and offered insight into the greater context of the myths, but discussion sections seemed to be lacking direction and meaning in comparison.",
    "The strength of this course is the interesting material, and the way that the professor does a good job tying the relevant readings (which are enough that they supplement the class lectures but do not overwhelm them) and the art and myths covered in class. I also enjoyed going to the art gallery for sections - that was a departure from typical humanities courses that I had taken. In terms of weaknesses, I thought that this course, for a WR, suffered a bit on a lack of focus on writing. The sections where we did cover writing were supremely helpful, but I found they seemed sometimes like afterthoughts - they came after assignments were do, or were sporadically spaced out. I think that if there were a couple more writing exercises (not for a grade, perhaps just for completion) that may be helpful to future students of the course. Additionally, there NEEDS to be more time for the final paper. Two weeks is not enough time for an original paper with very little structure. The prior two papers had significantly more time given to them, even though they were shorter and had more structure given. Even my TF seemed surprised at how little time we had for the final paper. Even a week or two would have been significantly helpful in reducing stress and helping students produce a better final product.",
    "I think it's set up rather well. If you do what is required of you, there is no reason you shouldn't do well in the course.",
    "This is quite possibly one of the most interesting class I've taken at Yale.",
    "Was pretty good! Loved going to the gallery, definitely a strength. Could have gotten feedback a bit more quickly, would appreciate the slides ahead of time to annotate as the lecture goes on.",
    "This course does a great job in demonstrating how art plays a huge role in the depiction and understanding of stories, myths, and \"urban legends.\" The course provided vivid depictions and did an excellent job of using the wonderful facilities and artifacts on display at the Yale University Art Gallery to help fashion a more concrete idea for the techniques and material presented in the class.",
    "The readings and the lectures of this course are engaging and interesting and tie together nicely. I think, if anything, more could be done in section or in the lectures themselves to formally introduce visual analysis and the writing skills associated with that.",
    "Lectures were good, sections in the art gallery were awesome, sections in the classroom were alright. Readings were helpful but occasionally too long",
    "I think the amount of writing was really good, but maybe having drafts due and time for feedback before the final copy would have been helpful. We could have done that on our own, but forcing us to do it as part of our grade might have been good.",
    "I thought a strength was that the lectures were pretty engaging and the reading was relevant to them and not excessive in length. I think we could have gotten into more depth in sections than we did, but the overall rigor of the course made sense."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course to another student. The material is engaging, as well as the Professor. The class is about learning the ancient myths and seeing them translated into a visual representation. Everything is straightforward and it is just really interesting material to learn about.",
    "3 papers, they tell you what's on the exam and you get what you want out of this course. Easy writing credit, take it if you want. Not particularly great, but not bad. Borderline gut.",
    "I'd definitely recommend this for anyone interested in Greek myth. It's a really painless way to get a writing credit, because they don't necessarily assume a background in the subject or experience writing art analyses. Professor Gaifman is hilariously energetic and sweet too--she makes the class entertaining.",
    "Yes.",
    "Yes, absolutely great class with an awesome professor. If you are mildly interested in Greek mythology, take this class.",
    "Take this course, a basic understanding of Greek society and the myth surrounding it is fundamental to ones perspective of contemporary culture. It has fun readings and lectures. I was surprised how easy it was to study for because lecture made everything memorable.",
    "Definitely a good, manageable WR credit if that's what you're looking for. would recommend.",
    "Really fun and interesting!",
    "Yeah! It's pretty fun and a nice class to take even if you aren't an art or history major.",
    "Absolutely! Everyone and anyone should take this course. I am not majoring in the humanities, and I am often a tad intimidated by artistic courses and visual analysis. This class challenged me to learn how to conduct strong visual analysis but allowed for many opportunities to ask questions and seek support. You do not have to be a humanities major to take this. Please take this course if you have any interest in art or mythology.",
    "This is a wonderful class with a wonderful professor. The lectures were always interesting and the creative freedom with the final paper was a lot of fun.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student with interest in art or Greek Mythology.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in Greek mythology as well as Art History. It covers both topics well and provides an in depth exploration of many interesting Greek works of art as well as how they tied into past and present culture.",
    "Everyone should learn the Greek myths!",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in Greek myth, especially if they didn't have much background experience in the subject. I found the course to be extremely accessible, and it kept my attention easily.",
    "If you're looking for an interesting WR course, this is a good one. The material is interesting, and Professor Gaifman's lectures are engaging, if not a little bit repetitive. There are very few readings, and you can probably get away with not doing all of them (though doing them is helpful for the midterms and final). There are three papers of increasing length, but I actually found them quite enjoyable, as far as papers go. Get started on them early, because they often involve going to the YUAG, which isn't open certain days or at night.",
    "I would recommend it to anyone interested in Greek mythology or looking for a writing credit.",
    "this is a pretty chill writing course and the material is interesting",
    "Take this class!",
    "Pretty chill, material was interesting. Felt like the concepts were finally connected for the midterm\/final. Papers increase in length as the semester goes on so be prepared. Shop around for your TA. Do the extra credit as it was pretty chill. Gaifman is so enthusiastic!",
    "I would always recommend this course to another student. The Professor is extremely passionate and conveys this in her lectures. Writing skills are also drastically improved and a greater appreciation for how to study the art is developed.",
    "This is a great class to take for a writing credit. Professor Gaifman is a phenomenal lecturer and the papers and tests are both interesting and not very hard.",
    "This was a great writing credit as well as a great introduction to art history classes at Yale. The lectures are very engaging and are particularly well crafted into a narrative. The course as a whole also offers a broad range of topics from Greek myth as a nice survey course.",
    "Professor Gaifman made this class really fun and engaging, I would definitely recommend taking it with her. The section meetings in the art gallery made us actually visit the art pieces we were discussing, which I think was a good thing. The workload isn't heavy, 3 essays and two tests. The professor really wants you to succeed so you'll get plenty of opportunities for feedback on your writing and what's on the test ahead of time.",
    "This is an interesting class if you're into greek myth and art - there is more of a focus on art than expected. I would recommend, it's a solid writing credit and the essays are pretty fun to write.",
    "Yes! It was a fantastic writing credit that I thoroughly enjoyed.",
    "Yes! It's a writing credit but there is also a midterm and a final, so if you are a STEM this is a great way to get a WR credit."
