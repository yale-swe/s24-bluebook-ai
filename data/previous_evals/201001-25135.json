   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course, if you can stand unreasonable demands on your time and an expectation that you should be near your computer at all hours of the day. It might just be worth it because the material is amazing and the students in your course will probably be incredibly thoughtful people.",
    "Yes! If you're at all interested in democracy, journalism, the public sphere, new media, etc., take this course. Easily one of the most best classes I've taken at Yale.Prof. Sleeper is amazing- he puts his heart into the class and truly interacts with each member of the seminar (i.e. he actually cares about what you write or say on a conceptual level, not just to grade it).There's a fair bit of reading, but you'll benefit from it. No matter whether you have a solid background in Poli Sci theory or know nothing more about Aristotle than his name, you'll learn from this class.We had productive, thought-provoking discussions every week. Wish there were more classes like this here.",
    "The class attempts to use classic political theory and philosophy to build a case for why journalism is necessary for a functional democracy. Classic texts are paired with more modern-day articles on the current crisis in journalism's business model. Discussion is conducted at a high level -- the class is it's own microcosm of a public sphere.I would recommend to any student if for no other reason than to meet and learn from Prof. Sleeper.",
    "If you are interested in politics as well as media this class is a must. It's not a class on journalism only. It's a class about the lacking public sphere, the public, the discourse and deliberation.",
    "This class might be the most intense I've had at Yale. With Professor Sleeper's one-on-one interactions with each student in the class and semi-required posts in the forum on classesv2, there's a lot to do and this class will keep you busy. If you have the time to take it and commit to it, however, Professor Sleeper can teach you a whole lot.",
    "This is a fantastic course, Professor Sleeper cares very deeply about his course material and his students. It was a very interesting spread of topics that revolve around the themes of journalism and democracy. One of the best courses I've taken at Yale.",
    "I would take this course if you are interested in the American area of political science. Even if you are not interested in journalism in the future, it's worthwhile to take the seminar to understand its role in politics The first half of the course gives you a crucial overview of the republican government that we have, and the second delves into how to apply those principles to real-world journalism issues. The workload is not overly demanding, and you will get a lot out of it."
