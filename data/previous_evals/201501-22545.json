   "comments": [
    "It is a pretty hard course. Topics are really interesting, but reading assignments are often very hard.",
    "A good class that offers a solid peek into the seldom-known world of philosophy of language. Be prepared for some overly technical and dense readings though! But Prof Whittle's handouts make up for that. Take it if analytic philosophy is your thing.",
    "Great class, and not too difficult if you catch up on the readings and show up to lecture. Bruno especially does a great job making the class interesting.",
    "It is pretty dense and abstract. It is a lot if it's your first philosophy course, like it was for me. It is not too difficult though.",
    "An (analytic) philosophy of language course that seeks to present a survey of (recently proposed) answers to such questions as: what is a name? what does a person know when a person knows a language? what is the difference between what people say (the things that they utter) and what people, overall, communicate - and what is the role of language in this communication. Yes, I would recommend it to fans of analytic philosophy, the congitive sciences, mathematics, and computer science or related fields.",
    "Bruno Whittle has a great accent to match his incredibly eloquent lecturing style. The notes\/outlines he provides are the best I have ever seen; they're direct and very easy to understand. The subject matter of this class is super interesting. If it's what you're into, I'd take this class.",
    "I think this is a wonderful class! It takes a little while to work out what the point of it is, but imo once you do figure it out, you actually realise that the entire class fits together perfectly into a semester-long project that has enormous philosophical stakes. The basic idea is to work out how words have meanings, and what exactly makes meaning possible\/what determines what those meanings are. Sometimes it felt like this was just a technical linguistic exercise (and there isn't an enormous amount of traditional philosophy in the sense of reconstructing arguments), but if you take a step back, you realise that the implications of what you're doing are enormous. It would have been nice to talk a little more about these broader philosophical project in class though - I only really understood this stuff by taking other classes at the same time\/doing extra work, and I would have liked some more information in class about what the purpose of\/motivation for 'philosophy of language' actually is. The workload is very light, and the use of exams is actually kind of nice, in a weird way; it forces you to think about the readings holistically, and the questions Prof. Whittle asks on the exam are all interesting. Also the questions are provided beforehand :) Despite being really interesting, I also found this class very easy. Kind of a nice combination. Don't take it as a first philosophy class. It won't give you any idea what normal philosophy classes are like, and you don't get any help at all with the methodology of doing philosophy.",
    "If you were looking for deep insights into the nature of language based on the assumption that philosophers have already figured it all out, think again, because they haven't. In some ways, I was disappointed by this course because I was hoping it would take a more computational or generative approach towards understanding language (and consequently more engagement with the ideas of AI and formal systems), but I also learnt a lot that I didn't expect to learn through the readings - about how language must be in some sense thought-independent, about how words like \"I\" work very differently from most other words, and how a lot of time is wasted on resolving logical puzzles in language by failing to consider how people use language to communicate pragmatically. If you don't like doing readings, you'll still be able to follow well - the lectures and notes and very clear, and at the very least you'll come out of the class with some understanding of how analytical philosophy is like.",
    "Philosophy of Language provides you with a strong basis and fluency in philosophy of language. Go figure. You read pretty canonical thinkers and start to see what sorts of questions they're asking and think what they're thinking. It takes a while to step into those shoes, but it's fun to walk around in them a bit. Plus you can have fun with words like that and get away with it...because it's philosophy. I'm a Cog Sci major and took this for my philosophy breadth requirement, and I'm very happy with my decision. It wasn't so much work; you get the exam questions ahead of time so you can adequately prepare; lectures are solid and though sometimes boring, generally entertaining; and you learn a lot about an interesting area (although it's not one I would want to spend my life studying...but that's what university classes are for). This was also my first philosophy class, and I didn't have any trouble following it at any point (except for certain rare and negligible exceptions). If this sounds interesting, take the class! You won't regret it!",
    "not what I thought it would be.....so boring (just analyzing semantics to no use)"
