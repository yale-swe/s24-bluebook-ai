    "An exploration of how goods and ideas are circulated between (but not limited to) Asian countries through illuminating essays on the mechanisms of cultures and markets, from the 14th century (Middle Ages travelogue) to present (China-Africa investment). Highly recommended for those who have background in anthropology and\/or global economic history.",
    "I would highly recommend this course for people interested in the historical inter connections of Asian nations. I would not recommend this course for people who have not got a background in anthropology.",
    "ANTH 542 will strengthen and challenge your ways of understanding area studies paradigms, which are so prevalent in academia. I really appreciated this new perspective and would definitely recommend this course to another student.",
    "great class to know about the interconnections between various Asian countries, past, present and future, and unhinge Eurocentrism."

    "This course helped me to think about Asia in an inter-Asian context and to consider Asia as a process as much as a geographic location. This new way of thinking is very valuable to my research.",
    "Will help me immensely in thinking about the wider and longer context of urbanization, planning, and international trade, useful to understand how current transformations may be conceptualized"
