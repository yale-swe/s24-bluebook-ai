    "This class provides an overview of music theory. You learn everything about triads, seventh chords, scales, harmony etc.",
    "I got better at reading music + the bass clef and learned figured bass notation",
    "This course teaches the basics of music theory including reading and writing music, scales, chords, and harmony. While the class is pretty easy for anyone with any kind of music background, I think the pace and the workload are extremely accommodating for people who are new to music as there is nothing too difficult covered in the course.",
    "Beyond reviewing basic concepts like rhythm and scales that I was already a little familiar with, I learned a lot about triads and chords progressions and harmony that I did not expect to learn. I feel like I have a much better understanding of music and feel comfortable and excited to make my own compositions.",
    "I learned a ton in this class, more than I even realized in the moment I understand the mechanics of not just music theory, but basic music composition and analysis so much more now.",
    "We learned the basics of Music Theory, practiced some piano-playing, singing, dictations, analysis and composing."

    "This class was fantastic. Within the introduction to music theory classes, this section was the one for advanced students, those with some music background but are still not able to take 210. Liliya was an incredibly effective and engaging teacher, who made sure to walk us all through the material.",
    "There should be some sort of intro-level course for people who already know how to read music\/are musicians. I also felt the course was too heavy on learning piano skills rather than theory.",
    "The course, as my TF Liliya taught it, was really well organized and each lesson clearly built upon the last. The pace was quick in the beginning and slowed down a little as the semester went on (which fit the material).",
    "The assignments twice per week kept us engaged but the book was quite expensive."

   "comments": [
    "Absolutely! Please take it with Liliya. She is so engaging and an incredible section leader. We were a fairly small group, and so we all had a chance to learn and actively engage with one another. Would definitely recommend.",
    "Although this class doesn't offer distributional credit, I think this class is essential for anyone who loves music. I never saw it as a class so much as an extracurricular, and its the ideal class to take credit\/d\/fail. Classes are small and engaging, and compositions are extremely rewarding.",
    "This was a good class, with a relatively low work load. The only downside was, if you are not a music major it does not fulfill any requirements",
    "Yes! If you're at all interested in music, this course will be well worth your time (if you do not place into 210 or want to build a stronger foundation).",
    "I'd definitely recommend this course! I learned tremendously, more than I even realized in the moment it was really satisfying at the end to look back on things that I had seen but never understood before taking the class. Especially if you're in a singing group at Yale and have little theory experience, this class is perfect and gives you a foundation in understanding the music you interact with constantly.",
    "The class had homeworks every lecture, but they didn't take too much time. The compositions were really fun to do, and we got to listen to everyone's music. It's a really great class if you're interested in music and want to understand more of the theory. You can start knowing absolutely nothing, but it does go pretty fast."
