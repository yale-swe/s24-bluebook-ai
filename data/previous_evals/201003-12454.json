   "comments": [
    "I would say it is a great course. Especially to engineering students who want to know more about moving bodies- going beyond simple statics. I would definitely recommend this course- its like a clearer form of physics for engineers.",
    "This class is basically high school Physics (Mechanics, no E&M) with Multivariable Calculus. O'Hern was pretty nice to us this past year - the problem sets were pretty manageable. You're unlikely to take this class if you're not required to for MechE, but it's not a bad one.",
    "The material by nature is a bit tedius with lots of algebra, but is a very useful course even for non Mech E's because it teaches how to solve complex problems by writing and solving governing equations.",
    "Required if you're ABET. If you're not, it's definitely worth checking out. Although the subject is kind of dry (similar to Strength&Def), O'Hern does a good job keeping the class entertaining."
