    "Maybe...if you want to continue chinese, just take it since it's not too different from the fall semester class. The material gets harder though.",
    "Yes",
    "I would definitely recommend this class.",
    "A Yes, take this class if you have taken Chinese 154 and have enjoyed it. Chinese 155 is a great continuation to Chinese 154 (it's based on the second part of the book), and Zhou Laoshi is fantastic, as always. If you took Chinese 154 but did not enjoy it or didn't find it useful, this might not be the best class for you - you might prefer to try another class on Chinese cinema, etc. CHNS 154 still has a lot of grammar to it, which is great to build a strong foundation in Chinese, but it might get boring sometimes and you might not talk as much as in other Chinese classes. The level is of students in fourth-year Chinese, but it is still much based on grammar and reading\/writing, and a bit less on speaking.",
    "It's a good course. Definitely more work than 1st semester, but worth it. Plus, you get another semester with Zhou laoshi, who is a great teacher.",
    "Take it if you want to learn more about aspects of Chinese society that are not talked about elsewhere. We talked about the Cultural Revolution, China's relationship with Taiwan, the impact of the Olympics on Beijing and much more. This was the first Chinese class I've ever taken where the teacher was not only frank with us, but open to questions and comments. Take it!"
