    "Systematizes basic and intermediate jazz techniques and gives you a toolbox for analyzing jazz standards. As Brian says the first day of class, this is NOT a course for people who want to learn to play jazz. The daily homework helps you refresh concepts constantly, but make sure not to fall behind. Transcription in the middle of the semester will take a long time unless you have a crazy good ear.",
    "The course began with more basic, and arguably useful harmonic information about jazz and then proceeded into more in-depth reharmonization and analysis. The course emphasizes assignments completed before each class, with a take-home midterm and final (and final project.) In brief, there is a considerable amount of work to keep you on your toes, but it will help to solidify most of the information learned in class. Brian Kane is great and really enthusiastic about what he teaches, so it was a pleasure to be in the class, even if it was a bit rough with a 9AM start.",
    "Take this course! Why not? If you have a solid theory background, it will not be difficult. If you enjoy jazz and are interested in learning more about how it works, this is a great course to take. You'll learn basic harmonization techniques (though again, this is by no means a performance class), and you'll also listen to a lot of repertoire in the process.The only thing I would say is accomplished jazz musicians may not want to take this course because you will likely be familiar with the techniques used (though it may help you have real understanding of how they function).",
    "Yes. Yes yes yes.",
    "An interesting introduction to jazz harmony. By the end of the semester, we seem to have developed almost all of the fundamentals necessary to understand the structure of jazz music in the period from the 1920s to around the 1970s (if not later). There are assignments due almost every class, but they are not overwhelming and really do help you remember the theories and ideas discussed. I would definitely take this course if you are interested in jazz but don't have any sort of theoretic backgroundin it (though if you haven't done ANY theory at all, you might want to start in the Classical realm).",
    "YES TAKE THIS CLASS. It's wonderful and fulfilling, through-and-through.",
    "This class is great! The class is super chill, and there is homework every day but it's not too bad. The class consists mostly of doing harmonic analysis of jazz standards and then reharmonizing using different techniques. Brian Kane is just really entertaining to watch, and what could be better than listening to jazz for an hour at 9am?",
    "Great course! I wish there were more Jazz Harmony courses at Yale.",
    "It's basically a theory course (in which you learn different techniques and chords and apply them in daily assignments), so it's a bit dry, but I enjoyed it. No experience with performance required, just a good grasp of theory. I felt like I learned a lot about jazz, and Brian Kane is a cool guy. Some downsides: the every-class assignments can wear you down a bit, and 9am.",
    "Jazz Harmony is an excellent introduction to the language of Jazz Music. Professor Kane's approach is definitely idiosyncratic, but the way he borrows from concert music analysis is truly illuminating, and reveals much about how this music is constructed. It won't help you solo or otherwise improvise, but if you're hoping to learn how to arrange or compose in the idiom, this is a super-helpful class. The transcription assignment is hard, but the workload is very light for the rest of term: Lots of little things instead of a few giant ones.",
    "It is a thorough look at jazz harmony.",
    "It is a class about the harmony of jazz and how chord progressions function in jazz repertoire.",
    "it is an interesting introduction to idiomatic jazz harmony, good for musicians interested in the harmony, not for musicians seeking a class in improvisation",
    "Focused on harmonic theory. Very interesting. Prof Kane is an excellent teacher. Make sure you do your homework -- it counts for a lot of the grade!"
