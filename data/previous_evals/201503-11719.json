    "154 is the least stressful Chinese class I have taken at Yale. That's not to say it's easy, but if you stay on top of the text for every class, the rest of the course is extremely manageable. Textbook is good, not great. Many of the essays are actually quite interesting. Zhou Laoshi and Peng Laoshi are incredibly nice and helpful.",
    "This course is necessary to move onto higher level Chinese classes so I would recommend it.",
    "I thought that Zhou Laoshi and Penf Laoshi were both great teachers: they were patient, helpful and informative. They also both brought great energy to the clad which made the class even better. Zhou Laoshi was always quick to reply if you had any questions and he was very understanding of his students other academic rigors and internship pursuits. He was willing to help you make up material. The course was more challenging and work than I imagined but I really should have expected that since the only way to learn a language is to push yourself and study hard.",
    "I would definitely recommend CHNS 154 to another student. I think it's a great class that continues to build upon one's previous Chinese knowledge and is not a crazy amount of work.",
    "This class was very rigorous and excellent in expanding one's knowledge of the Chinese language. The class book is based off the Routledge Duke series. For Yale College students, taking this class is a no brainer as it is the last sequence before all remaining advanced courses are made available for study. For those who are transferring in or who are graduate\/professional students, this class will be a bit of a challenge."
