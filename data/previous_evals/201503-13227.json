    "Loved this class! Mike is a genuinely kind and great guy and is always willing to email, meet with us in person, and go over work even a thousand times over until we understand. I really appreciated his collegiality and helpfulness. I am very grateful I was able to take this course and can't wait to use this information practically in my life. This was so awesome!! Mike is awesome! One of the best and most practical classes I've taken at Yale hands down."
