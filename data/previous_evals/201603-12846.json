    "The class was very useful in teaching the fundamentals of classical Arabic grammar, and I very much enjoyed analyzing texts spanning poetry, hadith narrations, and Qur'anic verses.",
    "Beginning understanding of reading the Quran, deeper knowledge of how Arabic functions as a morphological language.",
    "I honed in on foundational grammar and morphology prerequisite for translation of classical texts.",
    "We were introduced to the major concepts in Classical Arabic grammar, such as different verb forms, moods, case endings, pluralization, etc. The breadth of the grammar topics covered was wide. Also learned about the usual challenges in translating\/understanding Classical Arabic text and ways to approach it. We were introduced to the different types of text often encountered in Classical Arabic, including poetry, hadith, and Quran."

   "comments": [
    "Strengths of the course are the professor, who is a world-class Arabist and a really helpful teacher as well. A weakness is that the students who participated came in at very different levels, with some grad students having had several years of Arabic education while other students only took two semesters of Modern Standard Arabic previously. It might be improved by making this a Level 1 course for complete beginners to Arabic, and then having successive levels of Classical Arabic separate from the Modern Standard track.",
    "This course could be improved with a stricter syllabus. The professor is very kind, engaging, and knowledgeable = a huge strength.",
    "The course ran through a lot of material related to Arabic grammar, so was good in the sense of establishing a broad foundation. Professor Toorawa was enthusiastic, knowledgeable, and highly approachable. The class could afford to be more organized, but this was the professor's first time teaching this specific course at Yale and I am sure it will be better structured in the future."

   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone trying to understand and engage with Classical Arabic texts. The readings were very rich and interesting, and they really make apparent the beauty of the Arabic language.",
    "This is a great course where the professor is knowledgeable and you can make it as hard or easy as you wish. But if you push your limits the professor will always meet the challenge!!",
    "I would highly recommend this class to anyone who has some exposure to Arabic and would really want to develop their grammar and morphology. It's a great class that balances learning fundamental concepts and applying those concepts in translating actual texts, which reinforces what one has learned.",
    "Yes, to get a good grasp on Arabic grammar in general and an introduction in how to approach texts in Classical Arabic. The amount of work you put into the class will determine how much you learn. Prospective students should know the course is geared towards learning to translate or developing reading comprehension of Classical Arabic texts, so oral or writing skills are not involved."
