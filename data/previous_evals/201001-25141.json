   "comments": [
    "Yes. Interesting class, just make sure no one from DS is in it with you, or conversation get...erudite.",
    "Yes!! Excellent course with really interesting material and a great professor who is fun and really knowledgeable.",
    "Yes, yes! It is a wonderful seminar and I'm so happy I took it.",
    "Take this class, and any class taught by Bilakovics. You won't regret it.",
    "I took this course mainly because I wanted to go through Tocuqeville in an academic setting, and was very much satisfied in that dimension. We also went through a lot of other interesting material, and I feel like my understanding of a lot of thought about American uniqueness \/ as it pertains to the American Dream has been much improved. It was a fun and interesting course in that respect.Take this class if you are interested in what 'the american dream' means and want to study that in class quite at length, over different epochs!",
    "It's a great course in which to study Tocqueville and evolving ideas of what it means to be American. It's accessible to those not well versed in philosophy but still engaging for DS alums.",
    "If you are interested in political theory then sure this course. If you are like me and hate political theory and philosophy than DO NOT take this course. I did not like it at all. I thought the class was going to be a lot different than it turned out to be. I thought we were going to look at case studies and concrete examples of inequality in America to analyze the American Dream. But that was not what the class was about. What we ended up doing was debating the meanings of equality, freedom, individuality, materialism, etc. So if that's what you like to study in class, than take it. Professor Bilakovics is great. There is a lot of work though- a fair amount of reading, reading responses, a midterm paper, and a final paper. He is also a tough grader.",
    "If you're interested in America and you like talking about political theory and history then it's a must take. Great class.",
    "If you're fine with a lot of political theory, then go for it. Getting to read and really understand Tocqueville was a treat, and it will change the way you think about American politics.History majors like myself may be a bit disappointed that almost none of what we talked about was grounded in historical fact. Things Manifest Destiny, the rise of the welfare state, or modern conservatism had absolutely no historical context attached, which I think detracted from understanding them.But this is still a great class with truly interesting readings and a very engaged professor.",
    "An overview of the American Dream from the inception of the American colonies to the present day, including analysis of its various formulations and the tensions and contradictions within and between those conceptions.I absolutely loved this class. It helped me understand modern American society in a historical context and provided me tools with which to evaluate it. The readings were fascinating, classes were marvelous, the work was not overbearing. The most personally rewarding class I've taken at Yale!Take! This! Class!"
