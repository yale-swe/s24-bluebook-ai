    "I would never recommend it.",
    "The course was not as well organized as it could have been this semester, and there seemed to be an overwhelming amount of information that we were expected to know, but in the end it was manageable. I think the first semester of this course was definitely more structured than this semester. I would recommend this class because you definitely still learn a lot and the class is pretty relaxed, and if you put a lot of effort into it then you'll have no problem.",
    "You have to take it if you want to learn Arabic, but it's not always the most enjoyable class, and it often left me feeling unsatisfied with the amount of Arabic I had learned.",
    "I\u0092m concerned about the lack of speaking practice\/listening practice that we do in the classroom. First semester when we were sticking more closely with the book we did more drills in class speaking to one another, but since we\u0092ve been doing stories this semester we haven\u0092t had the opportunity to practice speaking. Although we\u0092ve been learning valuable vocabulary in the stories (and I do appreciate having reading material in addition to the textbook), I would appreciate going slower through them and having a focus on learning the words in context both spoken and written. Currently I can recognize all of the vocabulary from the stories when written, but because I haven\u0092t heard them spoken or practiced saying them myself, I find that I can\u0092t use or understand them.I do like the increased amount of grammar that we learn in the program though, and I would like to see that remain part of the Arabic curriculum.",
    "ARBC 120 was very much a course in transition this semester. There were four different syllabi over the course of the semester which made it very difficult to keep up with what was being learned. You were given a new teacher every week, almost at random, which broke up the learning process dramatically. The primary tools for acquiring vocabulary were bizarre Arabic cartoons and short stories, neither of which contained words essential for everyday, common place conversations. The work load was a *lot* more than advertised, upwards of 2.5 hours every night minimum. Add that to the hour of class everyday and an hour section which met once a week, and you're easily looking at an average of 3.5 - 4 hours of time commitment per day. If you're entirely invested in taking Arabic, go ahead; otherwise I highly advise waiting a year or two for this program to reorganize itself to become better at teaching a very difficult language.",
    "Not much different from first semester, except you'll learn a lot more vocab. If you liked 110, you pretty much have to take it.",
    "A decent intro to MSA. Note: MSA, not spoken Arabic. There's WAY too much emphasis on grammar and not enough on speaking\/writing skills, but if you want to learn Arabic at Yale, you don't have a choice.",
    "If you are dedicated to learning the language, then yes, I suggest that you take it. The course is extremely demanding and even more so the second semester.",
    "Yes definitely.",
    "Arabic 120 is a difficult class, but worthwhile if you like the language. Arabic in and of itself is a complex language. Even though the program needs improvement, the professors always have the good intentions and they mean well. Be prepared to work for this class, but also be prepared to emerge having a little more than basic understanding of this beautiful language.",
    "Absolutely. I would say that the program is still developing, so there are some frustrating things like the teacher rotation, but mostly you're going to learn Arabic really quickly and that's very exciting.",
    "It's a difficult process to become fluent in any language, but Arabic feels particularly frustrating becuase the language you learn formally at Yale is not the language anyone speaks in any country. That being said if you are passionate about Arabic and want to learn it for real, then take itIf you just are trying to do a language requirement and want to take 3 semesters of something- don't do arabic just because its trendy these days. You won't really learn anything super-useful in 3 semesters. Other languages the little things you learn in the beginning are at least immediately applicable to conversation with native speakers",
    "intense language course but nice class",
    "Take it! Challenging, but then again its Arabic and its a language class so you do expect to spend one to two hours on it every day.It is quite fulfilling to see the progress you make. Class is fun!",
    "No, I will be dropping the language. Too disorganized, too difficult, too impractical.",
    "Arabic 120 continues to teach you modern standard arabic from 110. You learn a lot of grammar and do a lot of work each night but you do end up learning a lot. It can be frustrating if you want there to be emphasis on speech rather than formal writing but this will ultimately help you in trying to learn the arabic you want to. The biggest issue with the class is that it teaches very formal arabic that not many people actually speak, but the colloquial is so different in different regions that unless they offer a class on each region this is the best alternative.",
    "Take Arabic if you're interested in learning the language and want to read and write scholarly Arabic. Don't take it if you want to go speak Arabic in hopes of converting people.",
    "Arabic 120 has driven me to applying for Directed Independent Language Study. The department is completely and utterly unorganized. This semester, students were taught more words relevant to fairy tales (nymphs, fairies, castles, and magic are just the highlights) than words useful for traveling or studying abroad. Assignments are given hours before they are due because the department director thinks it is acceptable to send emails in the middle of the night. It is difficult to get straight, honest answers to your questions from any one of the professors, who vary in their effectiveness as instructors. The new system of switching teachers every week is unequal and unorganized. I met with one professor for two weeks in the entire semester, while I met with a different professor eight times. When professors switch around, they assume other students have learned the things they have taught different classes, soa lot of information simply gets left by the wayside. Listening examinations are absurd, always requiring students to fill in words they were never taught after listening to cartoons babble in Arabic. Native Arabic speakers and higher level students also complain about the listening tests because it is difficult to understand the voices of cartoon and puppet characters in any language. Quizzes are conducted every single week, but each quiz counts for less than one percent of your total grade, while a final project that is explained in class for a maximum of five minutes before being assigned is twenty percent of your total grade. This final project is conducted in a group that is not chosen, but assigned by the director. The grade distribution was re-worked the night before the final, meaning that students were under false pretenses about how they would be evaluated ALL semester and then blindsided at the end of the semester. Really and truly, if you don't need Arabic for your major, as long as the department director remains the same, don't take this class. You'll save yourself hours of undue stress.",
    "If you're interested in learning Arabic, then Level 2 is a must. It's much more challenging than L1 however, and I'd keep that in mind.",
    "I enjoyed Arabic 120. Although some students complained about how scattered the course was, I think that was more a result of the reorganization of the Arabic program than any weakness. While the vocab can be overwhelming at times, with diligent work anyone can do well in Arabic 120. The rotating teacher system worked fairly well except the rotation was uneven with some sections getting some teachers much more often. I would say three out of the four teachers were extremely capability and worked well in the rotating system. Arabic is a growing language program at Yale and if someone wants to make serious progress in their first year, this is the place to be. I also think a lot of the hiccups that people experienced this semester will be worked out by next year.",
    "The Arabic program at Yale is becoming more effective and impressive, but also more difficult. I would only recommend it to serious students .",
    "Do yourself a favor and take Spanish.",
    "This course was a bit of a train wreck. While the intentions were good and the instructors were very nice, it was executed very poorly with a totally unmanageable workload. However, improvements are being made and hopefully it will be a lot better next year.",
    "This course was just a lot of memorizing vocab. ARBC110 was great, before they started rotating. But you can't get credit for 110 without 120. tough call",
    "I was very frustrated with Arabic this semester, but it seems like the department was ready to be receptive to student concerns, and I hope things will get better.If you already took 110, it's probably worth it to take 120 as well. But maybe consider credit\/d\/fail?",
    "Think about why you're taking Arabic. If you have a good reason, then it's worth debating the pros\/cons of the class, and there are many of both. If you don't have a good reason for taking Arabic, don't take it.",
    "Don't take it unless you want to spend 4 hours every day, still do poorly, and not learn Arabic. The program needs to figure itself out.",
    "Not in its current form, see above for reasons why.",
    "I would recommend arab 120 to another student, i thought it really reinforced arab 110 and continued to teach the language very well.",
    "Take it. It's a lot of work, and sometimes the syllabus is disorganized enough to drive you crazy (hopefully they'll improve that?), but it was so worth it.",
    "I have mixed feelings recommending this class to other students. If learning Arabic is your goal for part of your course of study, it is an important step towards learning it. The vocab in 120 is pretty useless, but you do learn most of the grammar, and you can go into a colloquial dialect or a formal class afterwards. 120, however, is still under structural development, and that made the class very unenjoyable at times. If Arabic is not your course of study, do consider how much time you will have to devote to this class--it will be substantial.",
    "I really hope they stop the stupid rotating-teachers thing, because that sucks, particularly if you get stuck with Aziz (by far the worst) a lot. The stupid book is really annoying. It was enjoyable at times, but often just stupid and silly.",
    "Required if you look L1, and quite a bit more work than L1. Not recommended to take with 5 classes or more, but possible, if you do nothing else all semester. I actually liked it a lot, but be prepared.",
    "I would not recommend this course because of the structural problems and the inconsistent expectations.",
    "It is the continuation of Arabic 110. You work up to chapter 18 of Al-Kitaab, but the grammar you learn far surpasses that book.",
    "I came into Arabic because I want to learn classical Arabic and read the philosophers, hadiths, Quran, etc. If we could have started at classical I would have. I did not have a problem learning Modern Standard. What bothered me was that it was not really what I wanted to take. Although it is important to know practical words if you are going to live in the Middle East, my intention was to learn to read texts. Therefore, it was frustrating for me to be learning words like \"apartment,\" \"car,\" street,\" etc, when it was not really the subject matter I was looking for. However, I do think that Arabic120 was a good base for my future studies, and I think it was good for whoever is looking to take Modern Standard.",
    "No. Unless this is the only course you are taking this semester.",
    "This class is brutally difficult, especially if the same arrangement is kept. You have to really be ready to devote yourself to it. Luckily, the grading isn't quite as difficult as in some other classes. It's hard to say which teacher you should get, since they are doing the rotation system. I think I liked Shady and Ghassan the best, but the others are also good. It's pretty much the same level of work as L1. Maybe a bit more intense, but I also developed better skills.",
    "I don't even really know how to summarize Arabic 120 because supposedly the course program is changing. According to an article in the Yale Daily News, apparently this semester we learned 80% of the grammar we are going to learn in our time in Arabic at Yale. We also read several children's stories and memorized the vocabulary from those stories along with vocabulary from our text book.",
    "A terrific class with a very good overview of written formal Arabic. It does not focus on speaking as much, and, like any course in Modern Standard Arabic, does not teach any of the colloquial dialects that are spoken on the ground. However, it is a great class - if very rigorous (plan on two hours of homework a night) - and I highly recommend it."
