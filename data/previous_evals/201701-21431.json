    "I honed skills in crafting short stories, and also learned how to help other people improve their stories. This helped me learn what a better-crafted story looks like.",
    "I have learned to think more critically about my own writing and consider seriously what makes literature and writing great. I am now more adept at editing and revising my own work, and placing works of contemporary writers in a literary and historical context.",
    "Learned certain skills for fiction writing, but more importantly developed an understanding of the context in which I am writing, what my concerns and interests are, and how I can continue to grow.",
    "I hold my writing to a higher standard than I did before this course.",
    "I got better at building characters and keeping my prose style sparse and effective.",
    "How to write a short story... but also how to read one. I learned a lot this semester about register and tone, and how to balance aesthetic concerns with the story I wanted to tell."

   "comments": [
    "I don't really have any suggestions for how this could be improved. I thought its strengths were its excellent teacher (who always had incisive comments) and the overall setup of the class, which helped us help each other.",
    "The class might be improved by having weekly readings that center the course around different themes. I would have appreciated Professor Baker giving more general lessons about how to WRITE better in particular.",
    "The strengths are the time and space to work on your writing, the guidance of a skilled professor, and the feedback of your classmates. The weaknesses are that class discussion occasionally stalled, but Professor Baker did a solid job of guiding discussion. As a professor, he was extremely accessible, respectful of our work, and genuinely invested in our progress. I enjoyed hearing his thoughts on the writing life.",
    "This is a great writing workshop. Basically, very straightforward--you write, you read, occasionally you discuss craft\/literary theory more abstractly, and Professor Baker at least gave us practical tips about entering the literary market, etc. He also pushed people to make sure their comments were helpful, and they were. We had really engaged discussions, and I felt like I learned a lot and saw my writing improve. Occasionally some of the discussions about craft or theory went on tangents that didn't feel helpful, but most of them were good. A really great course.",
    "Amazing, amazing class. I've taken 465 before, and the feel definitely depends on the other members of your workshop, but both times I've taken this class I've learned so much. Calvin was so, so willing to help-- he gives great advice."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "I would certainly recommend this course to another student who is interesting in improving their writing, because this course will help with that goal.",
    "It's difficult for me to characterize my feelings about this class. I would definitely recommend taking ENGL 465, especially if you are committed about fiction writing. The fellow writers are very strong, and their feedback was generally helpful. It's the professor that makes or breaks the course. Professor Baker challenged me in my writing more than any other professor had, to the point where my self-confidence suffered a massive blow during the middle of the course. I improved markedly, but his feedback was often quite vague (although he got better over the course of the semester). Overall I would recommend, but this class was definitely a struggle at times as I tried desperately to figure out how to radically improve my stories despite vague feedback. You need to be committed (unless you are somehow such an amazing writer that the professor will love your writing from the start, and if so, why bother taking the class?).",
    "Yes, I'd recommend this course. Professor Baker did a good job guiding discussion, and he was accessible and always thoughtful. Besides a couple of short exercises, the only assignments are two stories, revisions of each, and written feedback on your peers' writing. Take it if you feel motivated to grow as a writer, and make sure you have the time to put into it.",
    "I would recommend this course. I definitely grew as a writer. I would say that, if you're at all insecure about your writing, you might want to make sure you have people outside the class who are more on the feel good compliment side of things.",
    "Yes! Definitely take it if you want to improve your writing. You will write, and you will learn how to do it better.",
    "Yes",
    "Absolutely. If you can get in, take this class! You'll learn so much-- about how to write, about how to read others' work, and about how to read your own-- which I think might be the toughest and most important lesson to learn."
