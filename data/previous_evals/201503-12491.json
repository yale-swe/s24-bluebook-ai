    "The course is fast-paced. One needs to stay on top of each lesson and be able to learn cumulatively. Within a week or two, the class will be conducted entirely in Spanish and all questions to the professor must be posed in Spanish. However, the textbook and online tutorials are in English, which can clear up some questions.",
    "YES! Spanish is a beautiful language.",
    "I'd definitely recommend it.",
    "Yes, I think it is a good intro to Spanish.",
    "If you need to fulfill your language credit and want to learn a language you can use, then take Spanish 110. It will be hard but when you get through it you will have your credit.",
    "Spanish 110 11 is an excellent, albeit somewhat difficult, course for learning the Spanish language. I would recommend this course because it has vastly improved my abilities.",
    "The class was a rapid introduction to Spanish with online assessments that kept up with assignments. Overall the setup was good and I felt comfortable in the class. I would recommend it to a friend for this reason.",
    "I would recommend SPAN 110 11 to another student because the class was great for learning the basics of Spanish and staying enthusiastic about it the whole time."
