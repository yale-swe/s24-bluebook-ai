    "A budget would have been useful in this class. The books created were not cheap.",
    "For this class, I had to make many scans of images. It would be helpful to have big scanners on every floor like last semester.",
    "Yes, fine.",
    "I wish we had access to the graphic design building for the production of our books. It would have been really helpful to have a trimmer for our binding process.",
    "these were all adequately supplied, though i must suggest a budget for each student for the production of the books, which were not cheap to obtain materials for. the printing of pages and content were also expensive, even if they were done on school printers. i would say that money was the big issue here, though no one had a problem with spending it since the class was altogether passionate about making thei projects, this of course fuelled by luke's enthusiasm toward teaching the class and the subject matter.",
    "More information on the history of the written word\/image (parchment, scroll, codex, etc.?) would have been helpful. Also, as we discussed in the final class, maybe the order of projects could be shuffled around.",
    "yes, although a quality color pigment inkjet printer of 8.5x11 or 13x19in somewhere in the school would be extremely helpful. the current (non-plotter) inkjet machines are horrendous.",
    "yes."
