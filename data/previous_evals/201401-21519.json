    "Do it! Great opportunity to get research experience. And you don't have to do pure bench science- you can do any kind of research you like.",
    "My research experience this past year was great! I really enjoyed getting to know the other people in my lab and gaining valuable research skills. It can be frustrating and a lot of work. You should definitely try and pick a lab with a PI who is attentive and a project you are genuinely interested in.",
    "Take it if you want to figure out what research is about. Consider getting familiarized with the lab for a semester before beginning research for credit.",
    "This is an important course to take if you are at all interested in research. Find an advisor who you're interested in working with and who cares about your experience and it will be fabulous. A research course allows you to develop the skills needed to apply the knowledge you've memorized in all the other courses here at Yale, and there should be more opportunities to do real work like this. It is the best way to learn.",
    "good",
    "Research for credit is a requirement for a BS in the E&EB major. Best advice is to find a lab that is doing work that really interests you. Also, start working on your paper throughout the semester; it is much more enjoyable this way.",
    "Required for BS. Be sure to outline the expectations of your PI.",
    "Definitely take this course if you want to get credit for your research. The only assessment is a research paper at the end about your semester's work, and it's actually really satisfying to compile all your data and put assess your overall results.",
    "Everyone should do research for credit. It is important to be exposed to the actual process of science.",
    "DEFINITELY. I already knew that I was into research and more so than \"course credit research\" because you get to have your own project that you work on for an entire year in my case. Your experience is heavily dependent on your lab. I'm a senior and had begun working in my lab during the spring semester of my junior year, continued throughout the summer, and then did my entire senior year. I had a post doc providing constant feedback of drafts of me thesis as well as presentation practice feedback. Was an amazing mentorship experience.",
    "It's a great way to get practical experience in any type of research that you're interested in! I found it to be a very valuable experience. And 10 hours a week is very doable and shouldn't put you off.",
    "There is a paper at the end."
