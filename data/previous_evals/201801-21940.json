   "comments": [
    "Analytical thinking about modern day issues and the ability to read and analyze complex texts",
    "We read sociology texts by key figures in sociology (e.g. Marx, Weber, Elias), and discussed at length the meanings and implications of, as well as connections between, concepts in sociology. Also, I learned how to participate meaningfully in academic discussions.",
    "I learned so much about how to evaluate trends in the world, both in the long-term and short-term, through the lens of a sociologist. I understand the economy, history, and human behavior in a new way because of sociological theories I now understand.",
    "I learned how to analyze history, esp. certain periods, through the lens of some sociological theory. I think this class gave me some ideas that I now apply to other classes and my life in general, which is pretty cool, because at the end of the day a lot of the class teaches you about how we develop and exist within society.",
    "Kind of like a global sociology course. A small research element, a lot of reading, intro to sociology-esque",
    "I gained a really great understanding of what sociology is as a field and developed my abilities to analyze the world from a sociological perspective. I also gained an understanding of the theories of major figures in sociology and how that relates to modernity and its problems.",
    "I learned a wide array of information, ranging from historical accounts all across the globe, and I also learned how to synthesize information from a lot of different texts into class discussion. I got a good introduction into the field of sociology, and was exposed to the four classic authors. I also learned about how sociologists approach the analysis of great problems such as civilizational development.",
    "I learned how to make a sociological argument. I see how forces such as culture of our society that are often neglected due to their invisibility and fluidity to interpretation can create concrete changes.",
    "I discovered my passion for sociology. After this course I was able to critically analyze and understand situations from across the world."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Read a lot of diverse and interesting texts that covered many complex issues that are relevant to modern day. I found myself to be a little lost in some discussions though, and wished that it was less theoretical and based in history sometimes. Would love to talk about more personal and real-world applications of the topics.",
    "This course was a very good first year seminar in that it exposed us to a wide range of works in sociology - I think it was a very effective survey. The structure of the course (one lead blog post every week and responses to it) was conducive for discussion in class, not least because everyone had already thought deeply about the readings of the week. The course provided us with a lot of freedom to explore and engage with topics in our own ways. This was of course very useful; at the same time, our discussions were never really characterized by a structure of direction, since everyone became extremely passionate advocates for their ideas - many important ideas were floating around at any point in time, so every session was more often than not a wide-ranging discussion. I found this enjoyable, though some might have appreciated more focus on a few key topics.",
    "Strengths are the course blog structure and the benefits every seminar brings. I think the readings were a little bit long and dry. The course would be improved if those readings were slimmed down ever week.",
    "The course could not be improved in any way. The professor is incredible, kind, and cares about her students. She has been my favorite professor at Yale so far. The class is comfortable and discussion based. The classroom feels like a small intellectual community.",
    "Every Monday we posted a blog post about the upcoming week's readings, which I think was awesome because we would all bounce off of each others' ideas and basically have a conversation on the blog before we even got to class. The readings were wide-ranging and covered a lot of interesting material. I think the class also subtly built on itself, like by the second half of the semester we were applying ideas that we'd learned in the first half to our new readings and also expanding on what we had already learned. I maybe would have appreciated some explicit tying together of the weeks though.",
    "A lot of independent work; you are expected to do A LOT of reading (sometimes an entire book) per week. You can get away without doing the readings, but I always did all the readings, and I felt like it really added to the experience. There's not much of a point in taking this class if you aren't willing to put in the time to do the readings and spend time thinking about them. Also, there is a big emphasis on taking the initiative to participate in class. You will learn A LOT when you actively engage in class conversations.",
    "This course's strengths lie in its reliance on student engagement. Every student's analysis and perspective is important in this class, and it provides a good overview of a range of topics and theories in sociology. It could be improved by allowing more opportunity for instructor feedback on student work.",
    "I thought the workload was very reasonable, and I appreciated that we only had to turn something in persay, once a week. I thought the readings were all very engaging and I really loved all the class discussions (I looked forward to them every week). Although the class aims to tackle a huge topic of modernity, the course is organized to focus on many interesting and a wide array of pieces of modernity that give us a good sense of the fuller picture. I wish that there was more interaction between students during weekly blog posts, because it still felt a little like a completion assignment, and less like we had full-on conversations throughout the blog (with exception of course). Otherwise, a fantastic class.",
    "There was a lot of reading for this course, and I believe it would be more effective to reduce the quantity of the reading so we could get more in depth with some of the texts; we were constantly running out of time.",
    "I really enjoyed this course",
    "The course is great in getting students to discuss their ideas and harbor new thoughts. A weakness would be that the 1 hour 15 minutes of pure discussion amongst students could be dragged out. Perhaps a more thorough analysis of the texts, guided by the professor, could be useful.",
    "This course encouraged student participation and the learning from other students. My learning experience was enhanced by learning from other students and listening to how they formed arguments."

   "comments": [
    "Yes! A lot of difficult reading, but it was interesting!",
    "This being my first seminar, I was struck by how effective the seminar format was to facilitate understanding of the content. This is a great seminar, and I would definitely recommend it to anyone remotely interested in sociology.",
    "I think the course brought up interesting questions and exposed us to interesting readings. However, those readings are extensive and difficult to get through. The class is worthwhile though if the student is willing to give a base level of effort I think.",
    "I would certainly recommend this course to another student. The professor is incredible, and I took a lot out of the class. Students routinely engage with each other's work.",
    "Yes but it's not for everyone. Some weeks are not terribly interesting, though most are. At the end of the day I learned a lot from the weeks that I liked - about race, colonization, social presentation, capitalism - and from Professor Adams herself, who is incredibly smart and kind.",
    "YES! I know sociology can kind of seem nebulous (it is a broad field!), but Prof. Adams is one of the most wonderful professors that I have ever had. She is very sweet, intelligent, thoughtful, and kind. When she recognizes that you are interested and want to participate, she will dedicate the time needed for you to succeed. YOU WILL NEED TO SPEND TIME FOR THIS CLASS! THIS IS NOT A GUT CLASS! I say this because you will have a lot of reading and it behooves you to actually do all the reading. It can sometimes be a few hundred pages a week (usually you will end up pushing it off to the weekend). A lot of the work is heavyloaded over the weekend. Once you finish your weekly reading response (due Mondays), your workload for the rest of the week is fairly light. It is a great Sociology class though. Makes you think about what it means to be \"civilized,\" \"modern,\" etc. as well as gender, race, sexuality, etc. on a GLOBAL scale. You will get insight into the roots of capitalism, colonialism, the Algerian War, race in Brazil, the discovery of America, Japanese seppuku, and so much more. This course covers so many things that you would not experience in many other classes. Final project is really flexible too.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It provides a great introduction to sociology in an intimate, seminar setting. I appreciated having class-time being completely discussion based, and I think the fact that discussions were always interesting and lively despite the 9AM class time speaks volumes about the merit of the class. Additionally, the weekly blog posts are interesting to write and read rather than being as daunting as a weekly essay might be.",
    "Yes, I really loved this class. I also enjoyed being able to take a class with only other freshmen. The work never felt too stressful, and we had a lot of guidance from Professor Adams the whole time through discussion and personal 1-on-1 meetings to make sure we were on track.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student because Professor Adams is so kind and the discussions we have are very interesting because we don't just discuss the readings, we also bring in personal experience.",
    "Yes",
    "This course is great for exploration into sociology and similar strands of thinking. If you are interested, this course provides an excellent introduction. Another strength is that the course workload depends on how much you want to earn from the course. If you want to spend less time scrutinizing the texts and writing the commentary, you could do so by all means.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student especially if they have never taken Sociology before. This course is a great introduction into Sociology."
