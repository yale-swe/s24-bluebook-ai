    "Useful.",
    "Reasonably comprehensive look at exposure assessment, that uses both written and interactive exercises to help qualify and critique methodology and robustness of data collection per environmental stressors. Slightly skewed toward airborne stressors. But the examples are robust and engaging. Especially edifying: the week-long personal monitoring challenge and the critiques of landmark, (and not so landmark) research papers. The guest lecturers generally did a great job providing not only a change of pace and preview into other fields\/disciplines\/exposures.",
    "It is a small class, which is great. Also a lot of topics covered. Though",
    "The main strength of the course is that it is structured very efficiently. At the beginning of the semester we focus on building a foundation of the general concepts of exposure assessment. The second half of the semester allows us to put that knowledge to use in a variety of environmental health topics. Guest lectures really added to that portion of the class as well as the class discussions that we had with the guests. I would have enjoyed doing more exposure assessment assignments (e.g. air particulate, audio) without taking away from other assignments. The term paper assignment was a great way to end the course and really bring all of the topics together into a cohesive project.",

Easily commands the quality of the material although the quantity makes it a bit difficult to capture\/convey in only 2 hours. Always inviting participation and engagement.P.S. If Jodi Sullivan counts as a TA, she is wonderfully supportive.",

    "Instructor: Brian Leaderer \u00a0Dr. Leaderer was engaging in lecture but his teaching can improve if he would solicit more class interaction. This is particularly the case for the first few lectures were the material was more dense. The best classes were the ones in which we had a discussion and I felt that I took away the most from them.",
