    "I would absolutely recommend this to people currently enrolled in 602. It definitely deepened the learning I got out of 602 and even though I thought I already knew how to read a paper (and write a summary of a paper) this really enhanced my skills. I also learned a lot about how to verbally (out loud as opposed to in writing) communicate in an efficient manner about the science without rambling. I would definitely recommend this class.",
    "I definitely would...I learned much more during the discussion than I did in lectures.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class if you are interested in basic cell biology. Furthermore, it is a great way to learn how to dissect papers.",
    "I would recommend the class for a fellow student. I think it is better suited for students deeply interested in the cell biology subject matter. For those with other interests it still teaches a lot about how to read papers, understand them and critically evaluate.",
    "I would recommend CBIO 603. I would warn that it is a lot of work. I had heard that it would be a light class, as it is a seminar. This is not the case. At first I found it challenging to really dig deep into a new paper or papers on a new topic each week. As the weeks progressed, it became easier as I gained a deeper level of confidence with the scientific literature. This class is best for someone who knows cell biology well and has learned to read papers as a student and now wants to make the leap to approaching the scientific literature as a scientist.",
    "I would highly recommend any student to take this course. Each week, we learned from professors who are experts in their field. The paper topics overlapped with the lecture topics, which helped reinforce the material.",
    "I would highly recommend 603. If you're taking 602 and you want to get anything out of it, you must also take 603. It felt like the only class I learned anything in. The standards are high, but everyone really steps up to the challenge.",
    "Read the papers and think about them critically. It's hard and time-consuming at first but gets easier.",
    "I would recommend it. It is a typical seminar course. The instructors were of great help.",
    "Yes, I would recommend it because I learned a lot about the current fields of cell biology and the techniques that are currently being used to answer cell biology questions."

   "comments": [
    "I don't know if it contributed directly to my research but it definitely deepened my knowledge of cell biology, especially the more \"trendy\" topics that are cutting edge right now.",
    "It helped me understand how to dissect papers. It will undoubtedly contribute to my thesis research.",
    "As mentioned above, this course has greatly increased my proficiency in understanding and thinking critically about papers and experiments. The course also opened my eyes to new areas of research and introduced me to many professors, something very important to first years when exploring for rotations.",
    "This class was extremely helpful because the paper topics reinforced the material we learned in lecture each week. I not only learned a lot about cell biology but also how to read scientific papers, interpret them and critique them."
