   "comments": [
    "Reading scientific papers, quickly grasping some main concepts and research of different topics, including many diseases.",
    "This course definitely helped me learn how to properly read and analyze scientific articles much better than I could before.",
    "I thought I could read scientific papers before but now I really know I can. This course helped me to apply the concepts I had learned from my biochemistry and molecular biology courses to current fields of scientific research. It also helped me to better understand the process of formulating a research proposal entirely from scratch, whereas before (even in my own research) there had been much guidance and less independence.",
    "I learned how to read primary literature in various biological fields really, really well!",
    "Paper reading is always a good skill to work on.",
    "Writing research proposals, reading research papers.",
    "Great way to apply biochemistry knowledge after finishing the core mb&b classes!",
    "I've learned how to read research articles quickly and efficiently. I've learned a lot about different diseases and how research has sometimes collided with clinical.",
    "My ability to read scientific papers improved.",
    "Plenty of knowledge about the molecular workings of diseases, which is fascinating and also the kind of thing I'll forget in a year A clear understanding that I'm not very good at reading scientific papers, and a slight improvement in my ability to do that Some excellent practice doing literature review\/research\/a little bit of experiment design",
    "Reading scientific papers quickly and insightfully. Working with classmates to come up with conclusions on research questions. Medical science is very complicated.",
    "reading and synthesizing dense but canonical research papers"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "As with every course that depends on multiple lecturers, some are better than others, but for the most part everyone came in excited to talk about their topic.",
    "The weekly lectures were sometimes boring and did not add much to the experience of paper reading, but sometimes they were great. Great way to meet different faculties in MB&B. Interesting transition of learning style from Biochem I and II classes.",
    "I liked the structure of spending one day each week in lecture and one day in discussion. The diversity of faculty from different fields was also a plus. Perhaps one area that could've been improved was how each topic was focused around a disease and from that disease we discussed the discoveries and biochemical foundations leading to those discoveries, rather than having each topic focused around a field of biochemistry and discussing how that field had applications to the study of diseases. I say this because I felt at times that it was difficult to remember which topics were discussed under which disease context.",
    "Strengths: rotation of professors so every professor teachers about their fave thing. Holding you accountable to the readings by having quizzes. Weaknesses: the inherent weaknesses of group work--free-rider problem; impossible to write questions clear enough that all the anxious pre-meds can agree on what they meed. Those are both tough to improve, but maybe having a grad student look at the quiz in advance would help? Doesn't have to be the TA--could be any grad student who reads the quiz and takes a reasonable guess at what the question is asking. If the grad student can't tell, the question needs a rewrite.",
    "Lectures should be moved to Wednesday and the questions should be answered on Monday so that there is more time to read the papers.",
    "The casual setting of journal club was a nice change from lecturing and regurgitating material. This class tested critical reading, which is an important skill. I like how we have different professors and doctors lecture. Maybe facilitate more discussion. We mostly just read papers and try to answer questions. We don't find out whether we are wrong or not until a few weeks after we turn in the discussion question. An open discussion would allow for immediate feedback and focusing on parts of papers that were more difficult or interesting.",
    "Its strength was its great lecturers and its weakness was its poor lecturers.",
    "To be honest, the biggest thing that would have made this course better would be reading the papers more carefully myself. Having fewer papers to read (fewer reviews, perhaps?) might have made that easier. The design of the class is excellent - the lecture\/discussion module was a great structure for understanding and learning the papers. The minireview and final paper were among those rare and special class assignments where I knew I was learning something as I did the work. Feedback on the in-class questions wasn't helpful. It arrived very late, so we barely remembered writing those answers by the time we were getting the feedback. It also tended to deal with factual details, and since we never covered the same facts again that wasn't really feedback we could use.",
    "Strength: variety of lecturers, the collaborative environment of Wednesday sections, how organized the course is. Weakness: Papers and answering questions were rushed some weeks. I wish accountability were higher too, as it was easy for some people to not do the readings and just rely on other people to answer the questions. Several people come to mind.",
    "I really wish that there had been more assistance for the final paper. This was the first time that I had ever written a grant proposal style paper from research that was not my own, and I found it really difficult to come up with experiments for the final paper without much assistance. The TAs attempted to be helpful, but were often faced with designing experiments that had nothing to do with their expertise. That part of the class was very poorly planned out. I only got feedback on my paper a day or two before the deadline, and found myself ultimately turning a paper where I was not happy with a large segment of it. This was the first time at Yale that I actually felt completely lost about what to do for a research paper and it was extremely disappointing."

   "comments": [
    "Take this class if you are at all interested. The MB&B 301 prereq can be worked around if you are willing to teach yourself a few concepts outside of class.",
    "Yes, it's not too much work, but you learn quite a bit. I also felt like I was actually using some of the materials we learned during biochem I and II. Good way to meet more MB&B students and faculties. The two papers are also not very stressful.",
    "This is a really neat course! I would stress that you get the most out of this course right after you've taken MB&B 301 because many of the concepts learned there are applied here. I was really impressed with each and every lecturer, as well as with the TAs. I would say that what you'll get from this course isn't so much factual material that will stick with you for a while; frankly, I expect to forget most of the details before too long. It's designed more to really get you thinking like a scientist, specifically a biochemist, with analysis of the current literature and some writing tasks of your own. The course isn't cumulative, so the weekly workload is quite consistent and there isn't really such a thing as \"falling behind,\" which is really nice. I would highly recommend taking it!",
    "I loved MBB 449! It might be a bit more work than some of the other MBB electives you could take, but I felt like it really helped me learn to read primary literature and figure out what the important aspects of a scientific paper were. This course really showed how a succession of tiny facts can add up to something medically useful. Final paper is intense--plan well.",
    "Yes. It's a good class.",
    "I'd recommend this course for MB&B majors trying to get an elective out of the way. It's a fantastic choice among the MB&B electives- low stress, very interesting. Just be prepared to read a lot of scientific papers every week.",
    "It's a pretty interesting course to see the biochemistry you have learned come into play in the design of therapeutics\/medical anomalies in general. Make sure you spend time on your final paper though! Your course grade will essentially depend on that assessment.",
    "Great class! It's a good upper level elective. It's basically journal club led by a different professor each week. The topics and diseases are very interesting. Joan and all the lecturers are great! You get to meet other people in the major too.",
    "Take this class if you like learning about bio. You will learn a lot!",
    "Don't let yourself finish the MB&B major without taking this course. The guest lecturers bring in interesting topics, the course doesn't bother you with busywork and instead lets you focus on reading papers in detail, and the final paper will push you to be more comfortable reading and researching. You'll have an easier time if you take it the fall after MB&B 301, but I took it a year later and that was okay too. If you're really interested, take it during a semester when you don't have a heavy workload: if you have more time to read the papers in detail, you'll get more out of the class.",
    "It's a course whose quality depends significantly on how much work you put into it. This year, the Monday session was a background lecture, and Wednesdays were sessions in which you work in groups to answer questions given by the instructors. You have to do all of your reading between Monday and Wednesday, which can be tight and stressful. It's easy not to read the papers and just put the burden on other people to get a good grade for you, but anyone with the slightest conscience should feel uncomfortable doing this. The class works because of mutual trust and dependence. If some parties abuse it, the system falls apart. So don't be that person. The course also depends on how seriously you take it in that you can take an amnesic approach to it since the topic changes every week and you aren't required to remember topics of previous weeks. But if you really want to get something out of the course, take each week's topic seriously and try to draw some long-lasting take-home messages from each week.",
    "Advice: actually start on the final paper ahead. I started it during Thanksgiving so I had a good chunk of it done before the deadlines, but the experimental component of the paper was actually fairly difficult, so I recommend getting help on that."
