    "It's studio; it's everything you've been told about. Intense, very time-consuming, can permeate every aspect of your life if you allow it to, which you should, at least in intervals, because I think that's the best way to get the most out of it. Individual efforts of the students combined determine the level of the class, so don't slack or put in minimal work because that kind of ruins it for everyone else. Just embrace it; studio environment is as good as you make it, and it can be the most amazing thing you experience at Yale, or really uninspiring and annoying. Very late nights are the norm, all-nighters fairly regular, but nothing beats the post-crit 13-hour sleep and the tight community that studio cultivates.",
    "Yes. I have learned a lot in this course.",
    "Seeing as how this is a required class for the architecture major, I would just like to offer some perspective to future majors. It really is incredible that this class has such a dedicated team of teaching staff and a wide array of facilities made available to it, something that many other undergraduates will probably not experience in their time at Yale. The design process is overwhelming at times, and it is always easy to respond with a dismissive or careless attitude. At the best of times, however, it is a precious opportunity to explore a great breadth of the discipline of architecture and realise its influence on our built environment, and much, much more.",
    "Be ready to work hard. It is the first design course so be ready to feel lost. Section is like one more class period so you will be presenting work every other day.",
    "You don't really have much choice. Be prepared to put a lot of work in it. I will worth it."
