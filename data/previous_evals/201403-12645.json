    "I think this course may undergo some revision in future years, but as it was taught now I would recommend it if you're very interested in agriculture, anthropology, and development. But if you're not very interested in those topics, then I wouldn't recommend it. He spoke about focussing on the second half of the material more, which is modern agriculture, GMOs etc... In that case I would take it because it's very interesting and the readings are great. It's also free form and the prof. is interested in your opinions so it's a nice space for discussion. The first half is more archaeology and anthropology. It's interesting because it was new to me, but it could have been shorter. The workload is more than manageable, but Prof. Weiss is all over the place, speaks slowly and sometimes the two hours feel VERY LONG. But, as I said, it's a nice atmosphere for discussions if you have a good class.",
    "This was a really fantastic class. Professor Weiss has put together an extremely interesting syllabus and is a really interesting person himself, an archaeologist who's spent most of his life in the Middle east. He didn't seem to be a tough grader, but that isn't to say that the class isn't challenging, because if you took it seriously you were really challenged intellectually by the readings and in class. If you're at all interested in issues of food production and agriculture, you need to take this class. Actually, if you're at all interested in anything it's a good idea to take this class because it addresses the root of all of society's issues (e.g. why is inequality a thing? Also, weird fact #17: sheep are incredible). At times, I fear we may have disappointed Professor Weiss or made him fear for the future by how uninformed we were about certain old movies and current events, but I can only hope we made up for it with our strong writing and youthful optimism. I'm looking forward to our field trip to the Yucatan.",
    "Probably don't this class unless you are really REALLY interested in specifically the origins of agriculture. Don't expect discussions about current issues in agriculture. To be honest this is more of an anthology course than an EVST course. Professor assigned two extra papers that were not on the syllabus, so that was rough.",
    "This is a cool course on a topic you don't often learn about. If you're interested in the history of human culture, this is a great class to take, because agriculture has had such an integral role in society since it's beginnings 13K+ years ago. The readings start out manageable, but by the end we were reading a 400 page book a week. Still, they were interesting, and they definitely could be skimmed. Professor Weiss wasn't always the most organized, he ended up assigning two short papers (not on the syllabus) mid semester, and his lectures seemed to wander, but by the end of each one we'd always somehow, miraculously, hit the major points. Overall, I feel as though I have a much better sense of the role agriculture played in the development of human society."
