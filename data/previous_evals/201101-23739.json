    "Absolutely if you're looking to improve on speaking.Great class, reading is a bit mundane at first but gets better, discussions are a must so you should like to talk. Make sure you read and do your work though. Profs notice when you don't do the work. Also, hand-in homework isn't bad at all, but get to it early. If you get good grades, they can help with your grade.",
    "It's a good class to take. The workload isn't that bad and you will have fun for the most part. The discussions can get heated sometimes, which I personally enjoyed, and I felt that you often get the chance to actually talk about something you care and believe, not just analyzing what you have read for the authors opinion. I'd recommend this class to people like me who have already completed the language requirement and just don't want to forget the Spanish they've learned.",
    "I would recommend it, but I don't think anyone became fluent from it, sadly. I find that the best way to learn is to speak Spanish with natives, the second best way is to just learn vocabulary on my own and talk with myself, and the third best way is to take classes. I understand why people wouldn't take it, but I suppose I would recommend it.",
    "It is hard to do very well in this course unless you enter with strong speaking abilities (which I, based on my high school preparation, did not). The class itself is enjoyable and not too stressful, although the homework and preparation for the oral exams are surprisingly time-consuming (do NOT schedule your oral exam for the morning after Spring Fling). It can be annoying\/difficult to try to make yourself speak up, especially if you are not naturally talkative in a class discussion setting.",
    "Good course for those who either haven't taken much Spanish or haven't taken Spanish in a while. Somewhat advanced level of comprehension is required (it IS an L5 course), but definitely not as much as other L5's. Profesora Carballal was excellent, and she is teaching this course again, I'd recommend her over the other professors. The subject matter is a true potpourri: one day we can be talking about politics, the next about literature, the next about culture, but it does its job: my Spanish was much improved after the semester. The class isn't very difficult either; I got an A-\/A with not very much work. Make sure you get along with the students in the class!!!",
    "I don't know. If my Spanish didn't stay the same this semester, it almost certainly weakened, slowly and bleakly. Sometimes saying sentences in Spanish 3 times a week is simply not enough to improve or even maintain one's oral ability. But then again, I wouldn't have taken this course if it met more than thrice. Oh, and the regular assignments are small and annoying, like tics.",
    "Pretty good way to get your language requirement done. There's a lot of what can only be called homework which is annoying but its occasionally interesting and never overwhelming"
