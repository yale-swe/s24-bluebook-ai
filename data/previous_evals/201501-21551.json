   "comments": [
    "This class was a good introduction to seminar classes that consist mainly of student discussion. I am not typically the kind of person who speaks out in class, but in taking this class I learned how to better prepare myself to ask questions and make beneficial comments during class time. The readings were almost always very interesting, and I enjoyed the structure of the class as it traced the history of American consumer culture while constantly connecting it back to our lives today. Discussion sometimes veers off track, but I left most classes with new ideas of different facets of American consumer culture.",
    "I wouldn't recommend this class. Feel free to read some of the books on your own, but there's not much to say about consumer culture that can't be said in a class or two. The material and the seminar discussions became quite repetitive.",
    "I would definitely recommend this freshman seminar especially if one wants a writing credit, but with very stimulating and good readings. I would say if you are looking to really improve your writing this would not be the class to take. Its more of a comprehensive class than a learning about mechanics.",
    "It's a great introduction to a history seminar. If you can get in, I would definitely do it.",
    "I would not recommend this course to a fellow student. For having to read a book a week and write a paper every other week, I did not learn much. Moreover, the professor for this course was not very good. He did not seem to have a clear plan for the course, often gave long, incoherent, lecture-like comments in the discussions, and failed to give clear instructions. Instead of taking this course, I would strongly recommend taking anything else.",
    "Although I loved the syllabus, I think professor Agnew could have done a better job leading the seminar. The weekly writing assignments were good, but they were only conducted during the first eight weeks of the semester and on a biweekly basis. Therefore, 4 two-page papers that were essentially informal reading responses comprised 30% of one's overall grade. The weekly papers should have either been weighted less or conducted throughout the entirety of the semester. Also, professor Agnew's prompts for these assignments were very abstractly worded. With such a vague, subjective topic as \"consumer culture,\" Agnew could have made more of an effort to make the course more understandable for his freshman students. With little understanding of what constituted successful writing in his eyes, the grading of our assignments felt particularly arbitrary and unpredictable. Professor Agnew is quite a rambling professor; he seems better equipped to lead a lecture than a seminar. I signed up for a freshman seminar because I wanted a class focused on student participation and constant dialogue. Yet at times it felt as though Agnew only enjoyed hearing himself speak. It seemed as though he always wanted to tell us what to think instead of having us grapple with these topics ourselves, albeit on a simpler level than his own commentary. He would talk each class for at least 10-15 minutes at a time, ending only when students raised their hand to interject. Agnew could have made the class much more engaging had he been willing to take a step back and encourage everyone to participate.",
    "This class consists of two weekly discussions about readings assigned each week. The professor leads the first discussion of the week and students lead the second. The readings are mildly interesting, kind of a mixed bag, some are better than others. The workload isn't bad: a 12 page final paper and 4 500-word summaries throughout the course. The discussions drag on and are sometimes boring, and professor Agnew goes on long tangents that puts the class to sleep. He is clearly well-versed in the subject but is not concise in the least. Unless you can stand long-wided, sometimes abstract talks by the professor, I would not recommend this class."
