    "English 114 11 (US Sports and Media) is a study of texts and other media related to the subject. Some are long, some are short, some are boring, some are confusing, some make sense, and others are too technical. Combined, they all move beyond the simplicity associated for the subject. This class isn't easy, but one may think that after seeing the title. We wrote, quite a bit (about 25 pages over 4 assignments), and improved along the way. Take this class if the subject at least remotely interests you, and if you have a desire to improve your research writing abilities. I especially recommend this for freshmen. In addition to learning the common style for research writing, you more easily comprehend academic writings in all of your Yale classes and not just this one.",
    "4 manageable papers that were about interesting topics.",
    "Interesting and informative. Highly recommended.",
    "Good class for developing writing skills necessary for the rest of life.",
    "Take this class.",
    "A class in which you can bring your writing skills to a new level and ready many interesting documents about sports and media",
    "I would definitely recommend taking ENGL 114, as I thought I was a pretty good writer in high school but this class helped me to improve. If you like sports, definitely do this section. You can write about literally any topic in sports for the last 2 papers.",
    "It is a good class with good teaching points. I hope you like reading and writing though!"
