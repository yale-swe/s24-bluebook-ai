    "This class goes over all aspects of shooting a scene: writing, script analysis, camera movement, directing actors etc. It is focused almost exclusively on narrative film.",
    "Do a small amount of reading and write weekly reading responses (minimal time involved), make about 6 prompted short films, spend entire class reviewing that week's films. I would probably not take the class.",
    "Learning how to make an video worth watching.What makes a video interesting. What are the beginner's mystakes to avoir. How do you use a camera, a boom, final cut pro 7, write a script, interprete a script and direct actors.Recommend it."
