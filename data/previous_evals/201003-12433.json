    "Would I recommend this class? Hellz no, but it's survivable if you have to take it (i.e. are a Astronomy&Physics major or don't want to take the advanced physics lab or w\/e). The assignments (of which there are six, plus a power point and a silly little midterm) are simultaneously easy and incredibly time consuming. You'll feel like ramming a soldering iron up your nostril after spending four hours trying to calculate the standard deviation of a column of numbers in C, which you just did in two seconds using Excel. Prof. Bailyn's reputation as a friendly and engaging instructor is well-deserved, but the class has superficial content coverage and he'll basically force you to figure things out for yourself. After you're done, you'll have divined a few things about C, know your way around the terminal, and realize that counting error is the square root of the number of counts. (Of course, by doing that, you'll do cool things like calculate the mass of a black hole.) Oh, sorry, I just gave away the whole course.Writing this evaluation, I'm overwhelmed with a rush of disappointment. Instead of arming his students with an arsenal of cutting-edge research techniques, Prof. Bailyn wasted lecture after lecture with scattered remarks about what we did wrong on our previous assignment, simple mistakes that could have been avoided if 1) we had a TA who actually took time to work through the assignments with us or 2) were taught clearly what we should be doing. One bit of advice: make sure to spend substantial time on your write-ups so Prof. Bailyn will give you lots of +1\/2s.I hope that Prof. Bailyn redesigns the format of the course to something more in tune with Yale's best science classes: well organized lectures with wide and deep content coverage and then help sessions with a qualified TA to work through the nuts and bolts of the assignment.I suppose that this class could be some nefarious plot by Prof. Bailyn and the other shadowy astrophysics overlords to judge students' quality by seeing what they can produce in an aggravating environment with minimal guidance. Such a scheme could be greatly beneficial for the overlords and maybe long-term for the students. Indeed, if your love of astrophysics survives this exasperating class, you've probably made the right choice.Maybe I'm being too harsh. Oh well - if I wrote a hesitant, moderate comment, it might not have made an impression :)",
    "Definitely only for astro majors, good class in that it shows some real life research topic",
    "Definitely take it if you're thinking about a possible major in astronomy, but DO NOT OVERLOAD on courses. This course will take A LOT of your time.",
    "This class is an excellent preparation for research positions in Astronomy. The class is extremely difficult - it will push you to think in new and creative ways that you haven't had to before. YOU WILL STRUGGLE. That's part of the intent of the class, but you will come away with a lot of confidence in your abilities and a reassurance that you can handle tough situations and problems.Be prepared to work really hard. If you haven't taken an Astronomy class or a computer science class before then be prepared to work extra extra hard! You can do it, but I'd recommend getting a tutor.",
    "I saw the dawn. More than once. Bailyn is worth it.",
    "This class has many practical applications for Astronomy students. From using the telescopes to take images, to getting useful data from those images, to writing a program to use that data to find models for the thing you imaged, even to presenting in front of your peers, its all in this class.That said, if you are not comfortable with computer programming, this class will be very difficult for you. You will need to find a friend or tutor who can help you with the problem sets. Also, DO NOT leave the probmlem set till the night, or even week before it is due. As soon as it is assigned start working on it THAT DAY!",
    "I would not. Although I learned a lot, unless you have experience programming, you are going to be frustrated."
