   "comments": [
    "This class is awesome. It teaches you the science that you actually need to know, and it changed my perspective on a lot of contemporary issues. The class can be a bit disorganized at times but the material always kept me engaged.",
    "Definitely take this for a Sc credit. Parts of it are interesting and it's very little work.",
    "A incredibly interesting science class that's not hard. But you will learn a ton.",
    "This class had two distinct sections: first, microbes in plants and second, biology of sex determination. The title might be a bit misleading.",
    "In some ways this felt like a high school science course. Our hands were held through all the projects and all the material, which was nice, in that I never really felt lost, but it also meant that I ended up not really caring about the class. Pretty easy science credit (I would say that's why 90% of the class took the class) with fairly interesting information.",
    "A must take.",
    "I would recommend it.",
    "You will learn so much! Not difficult material, but really interesting. Perfect class for non-science people. A bit of bitch work, but besides the silly projects the class is very easy to be in.",
    "I enjoyed this class. It's disorganized, but the workload is minimal and the material is interesting.",
    "TAKE IT BEST CLASS EVER. Science is fun and nice. yes",
    "Absolutely take this class if you have any interest in science but aren't a science major.",
    "An overview of basic biology and an in depth discussion of biological issues. I would recommend this class to anyone except science majors.",
    "Take this class. No better way to fulfill your science requirement. Not stressful and incredibly interesting.",
    "Interesting topics, engaging lectures, informative sections. This class is wonderful.",
    "TAKE IT",
    "Take it. Great way to complete science requirement.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. It was a manageable amount of work, very interesting, and very well taught.",
    "Genes and Environment is probably one of the best classes that a non-science major can take at Yale to fulfill the science distribution requirement. There was a fair bit of work- 2 midterms, a final, and a few other projects- but the professors made it really easy to be prepared and do well (they gave us alist of questions from which the tests would be drawn for the last 2), so that it was never a drag. More importantly, they really cared about teaching science in a different way that would engage non-science majors. I learned a lot of really interesting things in this class about issues that come up all the time in the news and daily life, and I have much more appreciation for science in general after having taken this class. If you can handle walking up to Kline Biology Tower 3 times a week, definitely take this class!",
    "It was a great overview of basic scientific topics that are extremely relevant to biology and the world we live in. Definitely take this class. Great science credit. Lots of little projects and work that keeps you checked in easily and learning without too much effort.",
    "Yes.",
    "Genes and Environment is a perfect gut science class for non-science majors. Though there's a decent amount of boring busy work, especially at the end of the semester, it's really not that much, nor is it at all difficult. Professor Handelsman is a sweetheart and a more engaging lecturer than you'll find in similar classes. Though the hike up to KBT three times a week is annoying but honestly, you'd be hard-pressed to find a science credit that is this easy and decently interesting. Definitely recommend it if you need to fulfill the science distributional requirement.",
    "The best science class for non-science majors at Yale. I would definitely recommend it if you need a science credit or if you're just looking for a fun science class.",
    "basic earth science\/microbiology\/genetics. good for non science majors",
    "I would ABSOLUTELY recommend this class. I am not a science major and took this as one of my Sc credits. It turned out to be one of my favorite classes. It is incredibly well designed, covers very interesting information and is a truly rewarding experience. TAKE IT.",
    "great science course for non-science people.",
    "Great course for non-science majors. You will get out of it what you put in.",
    "take it if you need the sc requirement. everyone in the course is really helpful.",
    "Yes, an informative, reasonable and not uninteresting science class. Everything except the walk up to Sterling Lab!"
