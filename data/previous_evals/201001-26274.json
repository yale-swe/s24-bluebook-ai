   "comments": [
    "I recommend the course to students who want to learn more about South Africa, and the role of language in everyone's life. It's a good class, and a nice opportunity to get to know a professor very well.",
    "This is a great class. It is a bit of work but Professor Sanneh is really good and the class is very interesting.",
    "Take it, its a good class.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class! Professor Sanneh is a wonderful lady-incredibly knowledgeable, wide range of interests, genuinely interested in her students, great mentor. Readings are almost always interesting and cover a huge array of topics ranging from the early Dutch settlements, Indian community, hip-hop, nationalism during and after Apartheid, and more. Definitely accessible for students who follow South Africa in the news to those who have no exposure to the country or its history. Take it! Like many classes, the more you put into it\/ the more time you invest following current events and conducting extra research on the country's past, the more you will get out of the course. Also to note, the course uses many mediums-textual readings, films, music, TV shows- to investigate the dynamic South Africa culture.",
    "\"Fighting Words: Language and Identity in South Africa\" is an excellent, eye-opening class that you won't regret taking. Professor Sanneh was excellent and made every class engaging and interesting. Our class was very small, so we forged strong relationships with each other and our professor. If you are in anyway interested in languages and the fascinating history of South Africa, you will love this course."
