    "Yes, some vital information for the future.",
    "Best class I took this semester. Professor Addington is extremely knowledgeable, helpful and approachable. The course itself gives a broad overview of issues in sustainable architecture, as well as the historic background of some of the things we don't really pay attention to, but should. Assignments, while thorough, were enjoyable to work on.",
    "I come from a science\/math background and took this class because I'm interested in environmental issues and wanted to learn more about how they relate to buildings. To be honest, this class was not very interesting to me. It was pretty easy though - 4 assignments, one final paper, no exams. Also, Professor Addington is an amazing lecturer - she is so knowledgable her field and cares a lot about her students. Take it if you're interested in energy consumption in buildings.",
    "Yes. Go to all lectures.",
    "Really great course if you're interested in the course material. Light and manageable workload--no reading and several assignments and presentations that are pretty simple to complete and that you actually learn a lot through.",
    "This was an excellent class, providing an interdisciplinary and accessible overview of sustainable architecture. The lectures were interesting and the homework assignments were instructive. Professor Addington is one of the best professors I have had at Yale. I would highly recommend this class to other students.",
    "Anyone with an interest in architecture, urban planning, or energy should take the class, and it will also be of interest to people interested in policy, engineering, and other subjects. The material is accessible to non-architecture majors, and Addington is a good teacher. She is incredibly committed to the class, which is great, especially considering that she is an extremely prominent leader in this important field. She is on a crusade to change the way people think about designing buildings, and she has the ear of hugely influential people. Parts of the class are a little repetitive, but you will never look at a building the same way. And make sure you really are interested in the subject before you take it.",
    "Obviously I loved this class, but I think it's not for everyone. I'm a humanities person who appreciates science from afar, and I really liked the science aspects of this class, but I know a lot of people felt really lost and put off by the technical parts. I thought the material was made very accessible--I had to think some things through a couple times before I understood them, but, for the most part, the more technical aspects were very clear. Take this class if you're interested in buildings or if you're interested in sustainability--it'll change the way you think about both. Take this class if you're the kind of person who can be interested in anything as long as you're told about it by someone who is passionate.",
    "ARCH 163 is a great course. If you are interested in architecture, energy, or how we might help the environment, take this course! It's a survey of different strategies used to save energy and reduce our carbon footprint. Professor Addington is a great lecturer, the topic material spans a lot of different areas and has something for everyone.",
    "I found that students who are interested in technical things like HVAC systems really enjoyed this class. But I'm not, so I just couldn't pay any attention at all. The assignments weren't so bad, but they always seemed to sneak up on me. I found the class frustrating, because I had to do a lot of work in areas that are not my expertise. So only take it if you find the material really interesting.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone. It isn't too much work and you will learn a lot.",
    "I highly recommend ARCh 163 to any student interested in architecture, urban design, green building, sustainability, and energy. The professor and teaching assistants are fantastic, and you will gain a lot from the homework assignments and final project.",
    "In this class you will become familiar with some of the common strategies used in green buildings, but the main emphasis is on learning how to analyze these strategies with a critical eye. I would recommend this class to another student.",
    "I think Professor Addington is one of the most fascinating instructors I have ever had. Both her knowledge as well as personal experience made this class thoroughly enjoyable. At times, the material was a bit hard to understand, but overall the class was a fantastic window into the world of environmental architecture and many of her lessons still resonate with me now. I would highly recommend this course to other students.",
    "Absolutely. This is one of my favorite classes. It can be hard to find relatively applied courses at Yale that give you concrete, usable knowledge. Professor Addington is brilliant and manages to make technical information fascinating by tying it into its social context and demonstrating the limitations of current ways of thinking about energy and sustainability. I came out with a strong set of analytical tools with which to re-examine claims about sustainability, and Prof Addington and the class has inspired me to think about going into sustainable design. But, above all, as someone with an insane amount of experience in the field, her perspective is so, so cool - she is chock-full of insights about how to retool and improve sustainable design, especially pointing out where current attempts fail or serve as marketing tools rather than authentic strategies for addressing our energy usage problems. As far as the workload is concerned, there are 4 big projects and one final project or essay. They can be really variable in terms of work; I know some students get by doing the bare minimum, but I found myself gradually pouring more and more of myself into the projects, and being deeply rewarded by them. Although it is definitely possible to take this as a relatively low workload course, you'll get so much out of it if you invest.",
    "You will take this class and complete all of the assignments without a ton of difficulty, but it's hard to say whether or not any of it will really stick or feel thoroughly digested. Professor Addington is wonderful, though, and a phenomenal lecturer. If anything, take it to hear her speak about something she knows a lot about and feels very strongly about.",
    "Definitely take it. The workload is not bad and you will learn a lot even if you are not in architecture."
