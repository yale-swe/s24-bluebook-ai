    "It can be difficult at times, but it's much easier than the first semester. Nothing is as hard or time consuming as the electronics or Raman laser, and you get to build a steam engine!",
    "It is a great class for learning the art of troubleshooting technical problems. It is definitely time consuming and will cause frustration but it is one of the most important classes you need that gives you the skill set to do experimental physical chemistry.",
    "It is a lot of fun and its nice to be able to get out of the classroom and be able to do some experiments.",
    "A great continuation of 560L with less workload but just as interesting. Not nearly as much of a time committment."

   "comments": [
    "I'm an undergrad, so no dissertation research.It was really useful to see how these instruments actually work. I was completely ignorant of how one would physically build an NMR machine or what went on inside one, but this really helped me understand that. The dye laser I had more of an idea about, but it was still really useful.The computers one was semi-useful and got less into the guts of how things work, but did show us a nice tool.",
    "Answered above in all other questions",
    "This course not only helps with learning the ideas behind the modules, but also with being an experimental p-chemist and obtain actual data and spectra.",
    "Both laser and gaussian modules are very relevant to what I will do, and were great introductions to methods that I will use the rest of my career."
