    "Amy and Bill! Always challenging us to think critically, ask question, challenge our own assumptions, push farther. Bring a richness of practical experience and subject matter knowledge. Plus mad transferable skills- knowing how to manage a project well and apply tools to different contexts will likely be useful for MEMs no matter what their subject matter focus. Very applied with small projects every week to test tools out based on background readings and lectures, lots of discussions with classmates to workshop individual findings, great to be able to choose a project you're passionate about to focus on in a neat thought experiment to gain skills or helpful foundation for something you're actually going to do in the future.",
    "This course is a really great at providing some skills for project design and management. I felt it was one of the most practical skills courses I took while at F&ES. Amy and Bill are great and their instruction was clear, enthusiastic, and comprehensive.",
    "Amy and Bill have a wealth of knowledge to share. Highly recommend if you're thinking of going into wildlife conservation.",
    "Practical applications.",
    "Wonderful in-class discussions. Really engaging lecturer who helps you think through problems and challenges. Amazing class!",
    "Building on material over trajectory of course; exposure to practical material; discussions of how material applies in real world context ; group discussions ; open environment for discussion facilitated by professors",
    "Be able to use the tools in some sort of relevant wave was really awesome! I also loved that the class built on itself over time, and the final project was tying it all together! It was so much less stressful that way and made it a much more rewarding experience.",

    "It would be great to spend more on the activities portion of the project.",
    "Perhaps more group work.",

It might more exciting and useful to actually practice the facilitation skills that are discussed in the early part of the course especially exploring stakeholder interests etc.",

    "This course provided some much needed grounding in practice. So much of my work has been focused on learning theory, but this course was about design and completion of a project. That was very useful, especially as part of a professional degree.",
    "This class is especially helpful if you already have some experience with conservation.",
    "Thinking through these types of problems is applicable to any field of work. The processes and tools learned are incredibly useful (not just for conservation practitioners).",
    "On the surface, this course doesn't seem to apply too much to what I've been doing in my coursework at FES, but at the same time, it's given me a framework to think about environment projects and how after leaving FES, you could actually carry out something from start to finish, and how you would measure your success. I've already discussed these projects multiple times in interviews, and it's always raise some eyebrows!",

Think through what project you might want to focus on early on so you don't have to redo work as much after the fact as the semester progresses and you've applied tools to your initial case study- better not to have to backtrack with a new topic.",

    "Completing the assignments can sometimes be rather straightforward and sometimes be very time consuming.",
    "Take it!",
    "Positive and open environment for dialogue facilitated by professors ; directly applicable material ; overall recommended if it fits your professional interests",
    "Definitely don't fall behind. This course will be very enjoyable if you keep up and regularly meet with the professors and TA to judge your progress, and assess your approach. I saw people really struggle at the end because they hadn't worked at the right pace all semester. The more you do in the beginning and the more you iron out the issues you're having the more successful you will be towards the end. If you put in the work at the beginning the final paper will be much easier.",
