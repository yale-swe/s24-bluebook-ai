    "Poetry is a tough subject, but these authors really are the greats, and can be thrilling if one has the right mindset. I would be remiss if I had never gotten the chance to read and discuss Wordsworth, or Paradise Lost during college, and this is as focused and effective a setting to do so as one gets.",
    "NO. Only take this class if you absolutely have to for the major!!! Also I would strongly recommend taking it with with a different professor. The class was a totally hostile environment that was not conducive to discussion in the slightest. The workload is way out of proportion for what is listed as being an introductory class for writing about literature, as it is entirely 10-page papers unlike the usual balance of length. Unsuitable for any but highly confident writers. Constant digression in class meant that not nearly enough analytical material was covered, and that you're largely on your own for assignments on extremely daunting texts that are graded harshly.",
    "English 126 is a course that covers Milton, Pope, Wordsworth and Eliot. It was very interesting to learn about the major works that we did and the social and political context surrounding them. These are important works that everyone should read at some point!",
    "I highly recommend taking ENGL 126 with Professor Patterson. I have to admit I found her somewhat intimidating at first, but she's very caring and quite spunky and entertaining as well. She teaches because she loves to, and I think it shows. I also appreciated how she was always frank with us. She helped me find a great appreciation for Milton (completely changing my first impression upon opening Paradise Lost) and I thought she made the class a lot more interesting than it might have otherwise been. The works covered in the course are covered for a reason, and you begin to realize how influential these authors have been (particularly Milton).",
    "I would certainly recommend this course to others, as it is a great intro to English poetry.",
    "Take it, even if you're not in the major. It's good stuff to know. But take ENGL129 or ENGL130 instead, those are better courses.",
    "I would highly recommend this class to anyone who is an English major and anyone who wants to better understand the great literature of the past few centuries in conversation with some of the greatest English-language literature of all time.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone who is really interested in English. It's really interesting."
