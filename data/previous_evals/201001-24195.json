    "in Art 145 you learn about video art, you watch some video art, and you make video art. you can really make the projects whatever you want them to be. TAKE THIS CLASS. Especially in the fall, I heard it was under subscribed this year.",
    "It's a great class to take if you want to learn more about video editing and shooting techniques. It's a lot of fun and professor's don't get any better than Sarah Lasley.",
    "I would definitely recommend the class--you learn how to make the type of video you are interested in.",
    "Very laid-back introduction to digital video. Projects are very open ended, so better for student prepared to take their own initiative on projects and what they want to make films about. Good intro to final cut. You view a wide array of \"art films\" in class and sort of piece apart what that is. Good introduction to Final Cut and to shooting. More emphasis on editing than on technique of shooting itself. The critique of work itself is not so substantial, it's more of a practical introduction that gives you opportunities to start making films in a supportive setting.",
    "a great intro to video. take it if you're looking to expand your artistic practice."
