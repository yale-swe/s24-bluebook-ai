   "comments": [
    "if it's offered again, I would recommend having a semester of college latin before taking it. but it's a very good class, so if you're wiling to work at it, I think that anybody who if qualified to take it should! you'll have weekly quizzes, presentations, a paper, and two exams (final and midterm). a bit work intensive great class discussions, although some of the readings in class were entirely irrelevant to material on the exams.",
    "I would recommend it for those who like not only Latin, but also an exploration of literature. I would say this is an intensive Latin course that did not become bogged down in the actual specificity of the language, but rather utilized the texts as a jumping off point for serious literary analysis.",
    "If you are interested in Augustan authors, I highly recommend this course. The class serves as a very excellent introduction to Horace as well as a historical perspective on verse letters in general. It is also an excellent stepping stone into latin at Yale for AP students, as the workload is very manageable for a freshman, compared to some of the other advanced classes.",
    "An awesome class for getting into rewarding conversations about a classic selection of Latin poetry. Professor Kraus has a great sense of humor, so reading authors like Horace and Ovid is a real hoot. Plus if you're into writing letters at all, the discussions about the nature of the epistolary genre can be very thought-provoking and poignant. The quizzes are manageable to prepare for if you're responsible about it and there is a short final paper. The midterm and final exams are very fair."
