    "I learned a lot more french grammar and vocabulary.",
    "This course helped me to realize that I love French! I thoroughly enjoyed it!!",
    "I greatly enhanced my ability to speak and read French. I really improved my speaking ability, as the course greatly encourages speaking. My French as a whole improved dramatically this semester.",
    "Developed skill in French very quickly",
    "I developed in my ability to speak, write and read French. I am becoming more comfortable with the language and I am excited about continuing.",
    "I developed better understanding of French grammar and broadened my French vocabulary.",
    "Widened my vocabulary, improved my comprehension & understanding of spoken French, learned how to employ several tenses correctly as well as using different 'modes' of speech (e.g the subjunctive mode)."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Less reliance on the French In Action video curriculum would be nice. More in-class emphasis on the grammar, which is what we are tested on, would also be more effective to learning how to employ grammar rules in conversation.",
    "It is so much work. You know this, going into any language, but in not having take French in over year, I was way out of my comfort zone.",
    "It was an amazing class! Professor was great!!",
    "Less group work, but other than that, I loved this course!",
    "I really enjoyed the course and thought it did a great job keeping students engaged. My level of french improved dramatically through both in class discussions and the French in Action video series. The workbook homeworks, however, became a little bit repetitive and were very time consuming. Spacing out the homeworks more, or assigning less each night, would increase my attentiveness to each individual assignment.",
    "Great course overall. Immersion was very strong, use of multimedia, right balance of tests, homework, quizzes",
    "The pacing of the course can vary between weeks. It would help to have some consistency in order to anticipate the amount of work one could expect for a given week. The material, however, was generally engaging and fun. I enjoyed the small classroom size that gave me the opportunity to get to know my peers and professor.",
    "The class had a very good and supportive environment that I was comfortable speaking in, and our teacher was accommodating and understanding, and would take time to explain concepts we needed help with. More vocabulary review would have been helpful, because at first it wasn't clear where to find the required vocabulary words.",
    "Strengths: Integration of video & audio made learning easier and work more varied, discussion and practicing speech was encouraged in class a lot which really helped my fluency, the majority of the class was conducted in French which greatly helped my comprehension. Improvements: workload was insane! and the high volume of work sometimes felt repetitive and unnecessary."

   "comments": [
    "No, there is too much work that does not teach you very much. However, the course is required for continuation of French past L2 if you don't place into a higher level so perhaps it may be worth it.",
    "I would recommend this course, but only if they are ready to work for that grade.",
    "Yes! Great course for french",
    "Absolutely! I loved this course!",
    "I would highly recommend this course to others! Madame V (As we fondly called her) is one of the most helpful and enthusiastic teachers I've met at Yale. This course is fun and very educational.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. It is very fast-paced, but it is very rewarding to learn another language.",
    "Absolutely. As a way to learn French quickly, this was excellent",
    "I would recommend this course to another student if you are interested in accelerating your language skills. This course covers the foundations of French that are needed to understand the syntax and construction of the language. It is a large time commitment but the acceleration is worth the work.",
    "I would recommend this course to other students, because it is a very good learning environment and if the student commits the time, they will greatly improve in the French language. However, the student should be prepared to do a lot of self-teaching and learning completely in French."
