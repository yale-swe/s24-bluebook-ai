   "comments": [
    "No. but it's required, and it could be worse.",
    "This course was extraordinarily boring. The problem sets had nothing to do with the class or the lecture. The book used a series of computer programs to solve problems which are not offered to the student making them excessively long and rather useless. The lectures were bland and he hardly even acknowledged the class. Then, the tests were then a completely different story. Since the problem sets were so extreme, they in no way prepared you for the test. And for that matter, neither did the lectures. Tests were really a mystery (and very poorly written making them harder than they needed to be) and even after walking out, you have no idea how it just went.",
    "Thermo with Prof Vantassel is extremely organized, full of profound statements about the nature of chemistry and poorly worded midterm questions. Start the homework early. The exams and the homework problems have no resemblance what so ever (which is a very good thing) so try to keep that in mind when you study.",
    "Avoid if possible, though I know you'll have to take it. Sorry!",
    "Thermodynamics is a must take for CENG. I would suggest reading the notes daily and staying up on the reading assignments. PVT only gives four or five homework assignments, so you really have to try to stay up on the material. Class isn't that stressful, and is manageable with other difficult classes.",
    "It's hard. Make sure you understand everything before each test.",
    "The class was a very straightforward introduction to chemE thermodynamics. Lectures can be dry at times. Only complaint was that homework, lecture, and exams are not similar in any way. Lectures are mostly theoretical, homework were calculation intensive, and exams were nothing like the two - a weird mix of thinking and simple calculations. The subject could definitely be harder under a different professor, but PVT presents it in the clearest way possible. Tests are somewhat random, but they could definitely be more tedious and intense. Definitely easier with him than with other professors.",
    "This class requires a fair amount of work, but probably less than the average engineering class. If you're a chemE, you have to take the class; otherwise, you can probably find a better thermo class. Pchem tends to be taught better and is more interesting.",
    "No one is taking this class for fun, but it isn't bad at all."
