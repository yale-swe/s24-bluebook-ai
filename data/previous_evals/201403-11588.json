It was too short to address actual conflict resolution and the simulations were not very effective- except to show that negotiation is a long, frustrating process. If you have NO background in conflict res you may find this semi useful. Otherwise, it is just too broad.",

    "Group work was an integral part of the class. It was well-designed.",
    "Learning negotiation.",
    "One reason was that TAs arranged the groups other than people voluntarily forming their own groups. In too many cases, people set up groups with someone they had already known well and were not motivated to reach out to people they had not talked much with. I have seen it several times in other classes where US students form groups among themselves while international students ended up in one group. I understand that people would prefer working in groups that they feel comfortable with, and I have the same feeling often times, but I have been wondering how much the loss of different perspectives could be.",
    "My group was great- but often confused on the process of conflict res to go through.",

This provided me with the space to also observe my contributions, reactions and interactions based on the dynamics of the group. I did not notice any disadvantages.",
