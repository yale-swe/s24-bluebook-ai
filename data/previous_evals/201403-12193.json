    "Really nice and great discussions!",
    "I would recommend the course to anyone interested in literature (make sure you get into DS first).",
    "It's a great intensive literature course that covers a lot of ground. I would only recommend it to students who genuinely love literature and can handle the pace and momentum we build up by the end. It can be a struggle to keep up.",
    "DRST 001 06 is a class where, unlike in high school, you will finally be able to sit around a table and discuss literature. You will read some of the most brilliant works of literature ever written, and have intense and enjoyable discussions. The course will also help you grow dramatically as a writer. As a result, I would definitely recommend this course.",
    "We go through A LOT of books, fast, and intensely. It is DS, what would they expect? Of course, DS is an opportunity that no should give up, I'm a STEM pre-med kid, and I loved it.",
    "I would definitely recommend DS Literature to another student! Within the context of the other two DS classes, I feel that the course gave me an experience that I never could have gotten outside of DS. The level of communication and connection between DS classes is unparalleled.",
    "I would summarize the course as an introduction to the early literary texts of the Westwrn Canon. I would definitely recommend the class; however, if a student is looking to study these texts in depth over a longer period of time, DS won't provide that, but it is a great starting point for future classes or personal study of the texts.",
    "Although I wasn't sure for the first few weeks of section that I would enjoy DS Lit, this class really grew on me. Professor Bauer usually did a fantastic job of shaping class discussion, although there were times when I wished that he would step out of the class conversation and let it follow its natural flow. It was definitely the quietest and least argumentative of my sections, but we were nonetheless able to explore the themes of each text in meaningful discussion. Professor Bauer is a fair but critical grader, and I really appreciated the in-depth analyses he provided us with after grading each of our papers.",
    "I would recommend DS Literature for a student who knows that they are committed to doing the work and reading the texts. If they are not decidedly interested in DS, I think the course would be rather too overwhelming and demanding."
