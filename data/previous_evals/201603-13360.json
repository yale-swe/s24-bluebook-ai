Quite frankly, I don't like it at all. BUT, that is no reflection on Lauren, simply on the nature of the TF role. Lauren did a fine job."

    "This is one of the best courses I have ever taken, I don't know where to start. For one, the instructors are phenomenal, and I loved getting to know all the other students. I find so much value in learning in a small class like this one with a mix of undergrads, FE&S, YSOA, and YDS students all in one room, with instructors who care SO much about the students and the value of teaching. The Professors should receive an award for their work. They are far more dedicated to their teaching than any other professor I'be met at Yale. I am amazed by them. Yale needs to realize that a good researcher is not necessarily a good teacher, because few professors are as great teachers as Professors Grim and Tucker, and after taking classes with Profs Grim and Tucker, I am disappointed by most of the other instructors I've had at Yale.",

Tisa Wenger brought in several for a course at Yale Divinity School who might be great and are somewhat local, especially an expert on the Mohawk language. Or at the very least, perhaps Professor Ned Blackhawl since he's at Yale already?",
    "The registrar office insisted the instructors increase the workload of this course unnecessarily. This is a half credit course that nearly had the workload of a 1 credit course, which is completely due to the fault of the registrar office, because the original syllabus was much more reasonable. I have a feeling that the registrar office (whether consciously or subconsciously) insisted on these changes because the course focuses on Native American religions -- I doubt they would have been as strict with a course on Western religions. This is one of the best classes I have taken at Yale, and it deserves more respect. It would have been rigorous even without nitpicking on the part of the administration. Please have more faith in the instructors, because I want to reiterate, this is a phenomal class, and the professors are so dedicated, caring, and engaged."
