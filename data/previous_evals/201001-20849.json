    "Yes",

    "Rel Studies 770 is a very basic introductory theory course. I would NOT recommend this course for PhD students. The course was billed as one about methodology -- I was under the impression that we would be talking about how different disciplines make use of cultural theory. Instead, it was a very basic lecture course in which the instructor attempted to explain large concepts (\"culture,\" \"class,\" etc.) each week."
