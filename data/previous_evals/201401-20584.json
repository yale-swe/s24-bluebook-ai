   "comments": [
    "Definitely do it if you have little previous knowledge of French, as the course begins with an extensive review of L1. The syllabus covers all the important grammar that you should know in French, which really expands your range of expression after you complete the course. Prof Ngame makes the class really enjoyable.",
    "YES",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to another student. It will definitely prepare them for L3. The only thing I would warn another student of is the workload and homework every night, which can be a little much at times.",
    "I would definitely recommend French 121 to another student, it was my favorite course this past semester. It is a great place to start off studying French for students with a limited background in the language. The course follows the storyline of an American in France, and different introductory aspects of French are taught as the lessons progress. This way, students are not only involved in the story but also are learning how basic French is used in everyday situations. The class may seem like a lot of work because of daily homework and lesson reviews, but honestly everything you do prepares you for your tests and compositions so there is a huge benefit to the work. I learned so much in this class (SUPER small and Professer Ngame is an AWESOME teacher) and am now functionally fluent in French, so although the class is challenging it is incredibly rewarding as well."
