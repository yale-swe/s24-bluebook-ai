    "This class is easy -- but it's also frustrating in that students don't do any of the work -- if you take this class, do some of the reading, at least!!!",
    "Yes, as long as Jay Gitlin is teaching it!",
    "My favorite course of the year. Interesting, unique, low-stress, high reward. Everything a Yale seminar should be.",
    "Yes. Prof. Gitlin is a delight - enthusiastic, knowledgeable, and more than willing to spend time after class talking to students. You can expect snacks during class, a rousing singing of \"O Canada,\" and an intense debate about whether Quebec should separate from Canada (complete with appropriate flags). Simple midterm paper and a research paper to end the semester - nothing too strenuous, and Gitlin is always very understanding. Take this course!",
    "Seminar on Canada. If you like the material, take it, for it is only what you make of it. My one critique is that we waste a lot of paper. I think things should be more virtual - less handouts and more conversation. The best part about this course is the professor - he is a GEM. I brag about him all of the time. He is spunky and knows his stuff. Fo-real interested in Canada. I learned a lot of cocktail conversation. If you actually get into the class, it will be FUN. And there is a lot of food.",
    "Take this class. It teaches you things you will never forget, from its contents to what it teaches you about history more generally from learning the depth of such a narrow yet interesting topic.",
    "Really interesting! Professor Gitlin is a very inspiring professor with tons of knowledge! The structure of the class is not very organized, but it's the sidetracks that are the most rewarding.",
    "\"Quebec and Canada\" may not seem like the most interesting topic, but after taking this class you will realize that it is incredibly rich with material and food for thought. Quebec is a very interesting case study in identity, language, and colonization. A must take!",
