    "I did learn a lot about Lie algebras and ways of looking at Quantum Mechanics apart from solving the Schrodinger equations using Diff. Eq. methods. Overall though, I felt like I gained more practical quantum mechanics knowledge in my undergraduate classes. I have a great respect for Dr. Iachello's knowledge of algebraic methods, but I feel like I could have learned more of the roots of quantum mechanics if these techniques were emphasized a little less and practical problem solving was emphasized some more.",
    "It is a very fundamental course and will help me understand the concepts involved with my research in condensed matter."
