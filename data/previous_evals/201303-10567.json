    "Har, very hard. Reasonable workload, Psets take a few hours to complete and should always be done in a group. Midterm was relatively hard and doesn't test bio knowledge like most intro classes but rather your biological reasoning skills and you have to propose experiments and such. Section is fun. It's great to understand scientific papers after working with your class and TA to pick them apart. If Rivka is TAing, I highly recommend her.",
    "Don't take it unless you're forced to and have no way out of it. It is the worst course I've taken in my life. And most people taking the course think the same. Prof Mooseker is nice and passionate, but that doesn't make him a good professor. The course is unorganised, confusing, and definitely not an introductory bio course. It is a bunch of random facts about random things in cells and random papers about random papers. I came into this class thinking I would be a bio major (pre-med), and came out hating biology to the point where I'm probably never taking another biology course in my life. Very disappointing, especially when you think that you're at Yale.",
    "Yes! It's actually a good course to help prepare you for upper level bio classes and this stuff you actually don't know before coming to Yale (unlike BIOL101 which is essentially AP Bio in 5 weeks).",
    "BIOL 102 is a big leap from BIOL 101 in terms of the complexity of the material. Topics are covered in a great deal of detail and a lot of the material is complicated and can be very hard to understand, even for someone coming from a strong biology background. BIOL 102 is also more work than BIOL 101 as there are primary research papers assigned every week in addition to problem sets. As BIOL 102 is required for biology-related majors, I would recommend it to anyone legitimately interested in pursuing biology, especially because Professor Mooseker is a very engaging and entertaining teacher. However, anyone taking BIOL 102 must be prepared for it to be quite difficult, much more difficult than BIOL 101.",
    "If you can place out of this class, DO SO FOR YOUR OWN SAKE. This is an incredibly boring course that is difficult to study for because you will fall asleep in lecture and the lecture slides\/outline materials are disorganized and incoherent.",
    "I would not recommend Bio 102. However, it is a prerequisite for many biology-related majors, and thus I would unfortunately have to tell them to bear it.",
    "Only if they needed the credit!",
    "A very good course if you want to learnt more about cell biology or pursue more difficult courses in cell biology.",
    "People complain about it being really bad but you have enough resources to make it an okay experience. Also, he's really sweet, just unclear.",
    "Only take it if you have to!",
    "As Bio 101 - it is a requirement, so if you want to major in a bio related field or take upper level classes you don't have much choice.",
    "This class was very disorganized and confusing. Mooseker did a bad job of presenting information. If you have to take this for a major requirement do it, but don't have super high expectations. If you Mooseker isn't teaching, it might be better.",
    "I don't think it's at all a good representation of an introductory science course. Inevitably, this course is a prerequisite for bio majors, so those students have no choice but to take the class. Otherwise, I would strongly recommend you to absolutely avoid this course unless it is significantly altered.",
    "This course is often confusing and requires a significant amount of thinking outside the classroom to understand the concepts covered in lecture. The use of primary literature is interesting, but it could be executed more smoothly.",
    "Professor Mooseker is a good lecturer and you can tell he really loves bio and does his best to get the class to love it too. However it might be a bit difficult if you haven't taken AP Bio or worked in a lab before (I hadn't) as a lot of the class is based around experiments and reading papers. It can be frustrating at the time as the class seems like it would be a better fit for an upper level bio class after having taken an intro cell bio module, but nonetheless it's pretty good. It's quite disorganized which can be frustrating but it makes you think. Tests are difficult because you can't just repeat information you've memorized (like in bio 101) but this class will probably be helpful later on.",
    "I would summarize BIOL 102 as not an introductory course at all. Not that it is too difficult but rather not worth the time. I would not recommend BIOL 102 to another student unless they were going to major in biology.",
    "The course is a requirement for pre meds. Although it is challenging, you come out with feeling very accomplished and with applicable information.",
    "If you don't intend to become a science major or have not taken AP Biology, I wouldn't recommend this course. There is a significant amount of material covered, and it is often presented in a rather disorganized and inconsistent manner that it is hard to keep up.",
    "Biology 102, honestly, is a course you'd take if you HAD to, definitely NOT one you wanted to take for fun!! Biol 101 could be for fun, just not Biol 102 :\/",
    "Bio 102 is a very challenging module, and requires a lot of effort. Read the textbook before class and always review your notes after lecture. These two things are always helpful, but they are necessary for this course if you want to succeed. Definitely talk through the material and problem sets with classmates, and realize that the most important thing in doing your work is clarity and logic, not just brute memorization.",
    "Biology divided into four modules, each taught by specialists. I cannot stress enough how amazing this module structure is. Each professor brought in to teach his unit is incredibly passionate about what he does and transmits that energy to the classroom in such a wonderful way\u00e2\u0080\u0094science becomes FUN. If you aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t looking for that premed stress factor, please consider CR\/D\/Failing this one!",
    "Keep on top of your work and it should be fine. The class isn't all that enjoyable though, which makes that difficult haha.",
    "Bio 102 is the sort of class that nobody really takes for fun. It's not a fabulous class but it's a prereq for the bio majors\/premed, and by the end you will have a pretty good understanding of certain topics in cell biology (membrane structure, protein synthesis and export, endocytosis, the cytoskeleton, and experimental techniques). Make sureyou pay attention in lecture because the material builds on itself pretty quickly--especially pay attention to the toolkit unit because those techniques reappear again and again throughout the course.",
    "All the people who fear-monger and go on and on about this being ever so difficult should grow a pair. This was probably one of my favorite classes this semester, though it could have used some more clarity and a more sedate pace. I like Professor Mooseker a lot--he's basically Myosin Santa, and he's charming and wants very much to pass his own fondness for this material on to you. The material in question was much more interesting than BIOL 101's, especially because we came to it from the perspective of experimental proofs. You're probably taking this class because it's mandatory, but perk up--it's a wonderful learning experience, and the grading's not nearly as stiff as people make it out to be.",
    "Prepare for nothing but absolute confusion. The power points, psets, and Mooseker will leave you not understanding very much. I want to like Mooseker, but unfortunately his execution as an instructor is somewhat lacking.",
    "Only take this class if you need to! I ended up learning a lot, but I think there are better science classes out there. Professor Mooseker is a character and very entertaining but I don'tthink I am really ever going to use the material I spent hours and hours trying to learn. That being said, if you have to take it, you really do end up learning a ton!",
    "I would recommend this course. It's very interesting and the material is good to have as background.",
    "BIOL 102 was a very unexpected jump from 101. The class not nearly as organized, which is not helpful at all since the material is much harder in 102. You have to take it for pre-reqs, so do take it, but it is not at all a pleasant course.",
    "Ok intro bio course. Content is interesting but often presented very confusingly.",
    "Excellent course, although it is definitely not easy. I wouldn't consider this an introductory course just because of the level of depth and use of research papers.",
    "A lot more material covered than Biology 101, and very disorganized. If it was not so disorganized, then I think it would have not been as challenging.",
    "Biology 102 01 is an in depth look at the cell and a rigorous test on different ways to analyze it. The class doesn't move too fast, but it kinda kicks your rear at first. I would recommend it. It will make you a better scientist without your even stepping into a lab.",
    "Biology 102 introduced major concepts about cell biology. I would recommend it to any student that is interested in biology or needs the course for their major.",
    "If you are not required to, DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS. There's some valuable stuff in it, but it's just not worth everything else that it entails. It was confusing, unclear, frustrating and monotonous. When I was able to follow, it was interesting, but I had a lot of trouble following as did most of the class. After I got my first midterm back and got a good grade on it, I just stopped putting in the effort to string his words together into coherent sentences in my mind. You might scoff at me now, but trust me, it's really difficult to pay attention and understand what he's saying in that class.",
    "102 focuses on membranes and transport chains in cells. Unlike 101, the material is very different from what is covered in AP Bio. That is the main strength of this class. However, the material is also fairly disjointed and it is difficult to tell how things relate to each other. When we got to the first exam, I had trouble connecting what we had actually learned so far in the class. It just felt like we had talked about a lot of very random things in varying levels of detail and had been shown random lists of proteins and properties on slides.This class uses Piazza to answer questions outside of class, and, while usually helpful, the site sometimes showed that the instructors were not always willing or happy to help. Questions at all related to material on the homework would be deleted for \"trolling for answers\" even if they were very generally asking about the material and not the homework question. Once, Prof. Mooseker answered a question on Piazza saying \"good grief, did you show up for today's review session. hopefully one of your peers will answer.\" This answer was edited two days later after multiple follow-up questions were posted, but the original answer was shocking.I enjoyed reading the research papers for discussions but I also wish we could have gone over more of the concepts learned in class.I wouldn't take this class unless you need the intro sequence for a bio major or pre-med.",
    "Compared to 101, the lectures were disorganized and difficult to follow, although Mooseker was obviously enthusiastic about the material (and provided frequent demonstrations that involved him climbing on desks). Unlike 101, there are no weekly quizzes, just a midterm and final, so it's easy to fall behind. Pay attention in lecture, even though it'll be easy not to at times. The research papers read for section were an interesting supplement to the lectures and illustrated many of the critical concepts in the course.",
    "This class is hard to follow and unorganized, but you'll learn a lot about cell biology if you have the time to devote to studying it.",
    "Biology 102 is a necessary evil, emphasis on evil. Absolutely do not take it if you don't have to. Professor Mooseker is unorganized and teaches at a level that is inaccessible to the vast majority of the class. My least favorite class at Yale so far.",
    "BIOL 102 is not a class that I would recommend, unless you need it for your major or pre-med requirements. It is very disorganized, so you need to do a lot of work on your own to understand the material. Problems from the problem sets and tests did not seem fair, and they weren't good indicators of our understanding of the lecture material. The topics covered in the class were very specific segments of cell biology, making them very information-dense and it was sometimes difficult to see their relevance. There is a lot of reading of scientific papers, which was interesting exposure to experimental methods, but also not always very relevant.",
    "My guess is if you're considering taking the class, you probably have to do it for a premed requirement or major. But, it's actually a pretty good class, so don't dread it too much.",
    "Worth your time. Hopefully, it undergoes some change to make the experience better.",
    "I would say that they should take this course if they are very interested in biology, but to be prepared to spend a lot of time outside the lecture trying to absorb what was said in it and trying to understand it, because the lecture simply moves much too quickly. However, it was still an interesting course.",
    "Bleh. Makes you miss the structure of BIO 101. Interesting stuff, but just very difficult to follow and to piece together. Goes through lots of material very quickly, which builds up to a ton of info to know by the end. Not terrible, but far from good.",
    "BIOL102 was basically a mess. Don't take it unless you need to, or have plenty of time to spend piecing everything together. Mooseker is adorable and really tries to make the information accessible, but the stuff itself is just so dense that it makes it difficult to understand no matter how many times Mooseker forms lipid bilayers with the TAs, or dolphin kicks on top of a tabletop. I think this course needs to be reorganized so that we learn about the cell in general, and then go into the specific pathways instead of just throwing us into it without any context since we don't know what we're learning has to do with anything else.",
    "A difficult, yet interesting introductory course. The material is fascinating but, at times, difficult to understand. I, personally, found Professor Mooseker to be an unorganized and unclear lecturer, but he really cares. He gets actively involved in the material, which is nice. This is not an easy class, but it's certainly doable. Allow ample time for the problem sets, as they are much more difficult than those in 101. I would say that AP biology is absolutely necessary as a prerequisite. Others, though, might disagree.",
    "Different from 101; take this class and don't fret too much if something seems unclear to you. Mooseker does have a method to his madness...make sure to find a study group and make some friends to do the hw!",
    "Bio 102 should be taken by those who need the class, or want a good critical thinking challenge.",
    "Hard class but necessary if you need to take bio for premed\/bio major.",
    "good class, you MUST do a lot of outside learning to do well. take physics and chemistry first! makes it much much easier.",
    "Biology 102 is very different from Biology 101. You'll have to get used to Professor Mooseker's style, but after that he's a really great teacher\/guy that will make sure you understand the concepts if you just ask. Be careful to simply review everything on the slides and get the gist of the papers for the midterms.",
    "This class goes very in-depth in a small area of focus and can details you learn can be nit-picky, but it is interesting once you see the big picture. The lectures seemed to jump around a lot though and I found them hard to follow, so I relied heavily on the book to give me a sequence that made sense. I think the reason lecture seemed to jump around was because of the small details that were stressed and seemed unrelated, but they really all had a big commonality that could be hard to see at first with the new material.I think I ended up teaching myself a lot after feeling lost in lecture and not even knowing what questions to ask. I feel like I learned in the end though.",
    "If you don't have to take this class then don't take it, but if you're reading it then you probably do have to take it. Mooseker is very enthusiastic about this class and its topics, but I'm still not 100% positive I actually learned cell biology. I like the idea of using models to teach concepts, but there should probably be less focus on the models and more focus on the building blocks. The class kind of assumes that students have a strong bio background, which not everyone does. Either way, this year was more manageable than last year's sounded, but still not ideal.",
    "I would most definitely recommend Biology 102 to a fellow student. Ifound the material incredibly interesting. While at times the material was hard to grasp, the satisfaction that came from understanding it, and then being able to apply it to a Pset, or bring it up in discussion at the dinner table--was amazing.",
    "An awesome course that I looked forward to every week. Take it, especially with professor Mooseker.",
    "A large decline in quality will occur between BIOL 101 and 102. Not having the quizzes is nice, but the professor is confusing and doesn't know how to teach an intro bio course.",
    "I took Bio 101 and 102 as a Sophomore in the Fall of 2013. I didn't take AP biology in high school and I am not pre-med. This course is very difficult for an intro-level class, and I have some tips for any student who is in a similar situation as I was.Bio 101 is excellent. Biophysics and Biochemistry. The lectures are very straight forward and the study guides given out by professor Koelle are concise, and understandable. There are weekly quizzes, and they force you to keep up on the material throughout the course. There are 5 quizzes (maybe 6, I can't remember) and a Final. Section is pretty chill in 101 and you just reinforce topics that were covered in lecture. 101 lasts about 6 weeks, and then 102 starts after your 101 Final.Biology 102 was a nightmare. You change professors halfway through the term (Koelle to Mooseker). There are no weekly quizzes in 102, instead there is a midterm and a Final. Section gets much more difficult. You read fundamental\/breakthrough Cell Biology papers to prepare, and then you must answer questions about the paper during section. In 102 you are graded on section participation. Mooseker's organization on Classes v2 is horrendous. Instead of labeling each lecture as a different lecture (lecture 1, lecture 2, lecture 3, etc.), Mooseker combines lectures into units, so Unit 1 might have 3.5 lectures in it. He also adds and changes slides after he uploads them to Classes v2, so the students slides are different than his lecture slides. His lecture outlines are not clear, and they're much harder to understand than Koelle's outlines. Mooseker mumbles somewhat, and his sentences die off at the end so it's hard to understand. All in all, it's a messy, confusing and frustrating system of organization that takes away from the class.My advice for a student taking this class:Read the textbook before each lecture. Seriously, it's worth it. Readings took me about 2-3 hours for 35-40 pages. It sucks, but it'sso helpful. The next day in class, you take away so much more from the lecture and it pays off.Sign up for Enrichment. Surjit is the crown jewel of the Intro Bio Modules. Each week she holds an extra review session and you can ask her to re-explain topics that Koelle or Mooseker didn't cover completely, or went to quickly over.Take notes on your computer. Koelle recommends you print out the slides and write notes on them, but it's much more efficient to type your notes on the slides, you can type more quickly than you can hand-write. Mooseker adds and changes slides all the time, so it's easier to download the new slides than it is to print them out.Get a study group. Find some smart premeds who can help you on the Problem Sets.In sum, Bio 101 and 102 are good classes and I recommend them to anyone interested in Biology. But be careful, the material can get out of hand, and the don't count on 102's structure\/organization to be as good as 101.",
    "If you don't need this for your major, don't take it; it's too much stress.",
    "A moderately interesting course, but it was very poorly organized. Professor Mooseker doesn't always present concepts in a logical order, and it's often difficult to understand what's going on. Don't take it unless you have to (which is probably most of you anyway).",
    "BIOL 102 is a deep workthrough of cell biology. If you took AP Bio in high school (as I did) - this course will be MUCH more in-depth and a lot faster paced. Professor Mooseker doesn't hesitate to run through lots of difficult concepts in a single lecture, and expects you to keep up. He likes it when you ask questions, but being in a 200-person lecture makes that somewhat difficult. He uses a lot of \"big words\" very quickly in lecture, which can make it hard to keep up, but the key points are still clear and will obviously be reinforced in section. The exams are short-answer\/essay format, and large amounts of studying should be expected. This class is better than BIOL 101 in that the exam questions will actually test your knowledge of the subject matter rather than your ability to \"write nicely\". The problem sets are difficult (note to students: DON'T start them the day before they're due -- they usually come out best when you've given time to think over them), although collaboration is allowed - and I recommend you take advantage of that. If you're any sort of BioSci major, you have no choice but to take this class. If you're not, and want to see if you could be a BioSci major (or pre-med), then go ahead and take the class, assuming it doesn't put your workload over the top - it's not so difficult that it will put you into misery but not so easy thatyou can get away with whatever you want. It should give you a good insight into the rest of the BioSci programs.",
    "Yes. I was hesitant about the course going in because it is such a big class. I found that there were a tremendous amount of resources to help people in the class learn the material. I would recommend it if you are willing to put in the effort to learn the material.",
    "Professor Mooseker isn't the most organized individual on the planet, but he is very intent on making sure everyone understands the material. The material is rather difficult to understand at times, but you have to start somewhere and Mooseker has review sessions which are very helpful. The problem sets take up quite a bit of time and are probably the hardest part of the course. Both midterms were fair.",
    "BIOL 102 is a good introduction to cell biology. Take this course if you are interested in biology or cell biology material. Mooseker is a decent lecturer, although he is often confusing, feeble, and stuck in his ways. His in class demonstrations are funny and occasionally helpful in visualizing the concept. His slides are confusing so make sure to go to class and annotatethem. Discussion section is a necessary evil, but the discussion section leaders are great and make it worthwhile. Grading is much better than BIOL 101 and the tests more interesting to take.",
    "Biology 102 is not your typical intro course--Professor Mooseker has high expectations and treats his class accordingly. You will learn a lot in this class, even if you think you know plenty about the cell...there's a reason they make it hard to place out, even if you excelled at AP Bio. That said, it is nothing to worry about if you stay on top of the lectures and homeworks, go to section, and make good use of the (many!) resources that will be available to you throughout the course.In summary, if studying the inner machinery of a cell and how we find out things about it interests you at all, take the class!",
    "Only take 101\/102 if it is required for your major or if you are pre-med. Otherwise, it would be a drain on your time.",
    "Terrible. The Professor is terrible. Sorry, but you're getting another worst-than-Root-Canal-and-Congress rating this year again--still the same old Mooseker.You mumble underneath your breath for the key terms and explanations yet are somewhat clear for simple bio terms and concepts we all know. That is the most frustrating thing when the most difficult parts we need to hear are shrouded by your mumbling.Secondly, your slides are not organized well--I expect the slides I print out to match your slides in class. They oftentimes don't match up and I waste crucial time flipping through slides and realizing that it's not there and by that time, I missed all the important statements you just made about a concept.Third, your physical demonstrations do more harm than help. They aren't helpful most of the time and distract from class and are unnecessary.Fourth, you're terrible at explaining bio concepts in general. You may be an intelligent human being, but you are the embodiment of what \"being smart does not equal being a good instructor\" means. You are just that. Very smart? Yes. Can teach? No. They are not one in the same--I'd rather have a grad student who knows far less than you but is much clearer and direct than you teach the class instead. Maybe then will I learn stuff in a logical order.Fifth, there is no logical order of things we learn in class. We go from one scientific concept to another and there's no connection that's made between the material.",
    "Biol 102 is a challenging, but extremely thorough introduction to cell biology. I would strongly recommend taking this course! Although the material is very challenging and the problem sets can take hours, this course is very rewarding in terms of the quality and quantity of material that is covered. I have walked out of this course gaining a genuine appreciation for research in biology. Professor Mooseker works very hard for the students and Professor Chandhoke is always available though Enrichment. The time you dedicate into this course will definitely pay off!",
    "Again, if you're considering Bio 102, you most likely need it for your major, so take it. Honestly, it's nothing like Bio 101 - no weekly quizzes to help you stay on top of your game - and Mooseker in his style is just a lot different from Koelle. This course was definitely a struggle, but if you take it, make sure you read the book if you're not understanding concepts. I waited until reading period to do that and it clarified everything for me, but could have done more had I kept up with readings during class time. P-sets are also a lot harder in this class than in 101.",
    "BIOL 102 was a disorganized attempt to teach us experimental methodology without actual lab experience or a coherent set of lecture notes to learn from.",
    "Bio 102 should have been called \"How to Be a Cell Biologist When You Grow Up.\" The course emphasized lab procedures and historic experiments, and there was very little time devoted to the basic concepts one would expect in an introductory biology course.",
    "To survive this class (you will have to if you didn't test out of this module and happen to be pre-med or a bio major) you need to do your reading in advance. You won't know what you're evening learning about if you don't.Don't take this class if you're not serious about this class. You'll be in a lecture with 200 other kids who are very serious about this class, and you won't enjoy yourself.To be successful, you must do you reading in advance and you must go over lecture slides in advance. This class is extremely disorganized because it has only been taught for two years, so if you want to be successful you'll have to organize all of the jumbled concepts in your head before you even walk into lecture.Best of luck. You'll need it. And a lot of dedication to this class.",
    "Yes I would, to an AP Bio student. I took AP bio and this and 101 were a breeze. I heard none AP bio students struggled.",
    "Tough class, definitely not intro-level, but learned a lot. Take it if you have to, or if you want a challenge.",
    "Biol 102 is probably one of the best bio courses I've taken! It teaches you not only facts about parts of the cell, but also how these facts were discovered. It helps you build a solid foundation in experimental biology that is essential for anyone conducting research in a lab. The techniques you learn in the tool kits and papers you read about different experiments helps build your experimental knowledge of biology, rather than just requiring you to memorize facts without knowing how those facts came about. This course is challenging, but understanding and reading about the various experiments actually help you grasp the concepts in the course, so it is very important to understand and read the papers thoroughly. If you are seeking a future in scientific research of any kind, this course definitely prepares you well for that! I definitely enjoyed taking this course with Professor Mooseker because I felt I was learning information I could directly apply when working in the lab.",
    "The epitome of Yale's failure in Science.",
    "I loved this module! I liked it a lot better than 101. I felt like I was actually learning experimental techniques and how biology works. If you put the work in by doing the readings and going to lectures, you will learn so much. Prof. Mooseker is also very helpful and passionate - take the time to talk to him and ask him questions! Relatively low stress course, but do your work and you'll be fine.",
    "It is not a facts-based course like IB\/AP Biology. It teaches a way of thinking about biological systems.",
    "Compared to Biology 101, 102 is more detailed and interesting. It may not seem to be an introductory course, but you can get a lot out of it. I would recommend it to another student, but if you are interested in pursuing a biology-related major, you would probably be required to take it anyway. Again, the grading can be picky, but it was better than that of 101.",
    "Do not take unless you need it for your major requirements. While the course covers in great depth a lot of interesting concepts, the teaching is extremely poor, and students who do not have an extremely substantial background in cell biology previously will be lost a majority of the time.",
    "Although Prof Mooseker is a wonderful person and dedicated to the course, you will need to do a lot of reading and researching on your own to really get the material.",
    "I would definitely recommend Biology 102 to any student who is fascinated by cell biology and interested in learning more of the mechanics behind how a structure such as a cell, which we at first think is simple but turns out to be incredibly complex, functions. This course is also very useful for anyone interested in learning how to thoroughly read and annotate a complex research paper.",
    "Tricky material and lots of it. But very satisfying once you learn and understand the information. Mooseker was clearly invested in our ability to grasp the information (to the point where he held review sessions on Sundays for us). So it was tough material, but as students, we really were given all the resources we needed to make sure we understood it.",
    "Lectures super long. Improvement over last year but still a deeply flawed instruction of biology.",
    "This course is necessary if you want to take upper level bio courses, but it is very disorganized and many students find they have to teach themselves. Professor Mooseker is certainly passionate about this subject, which is admirable, but he is not an especially great teacher. I recommend students utilize the peer tutor to help with problem sets or studying before exams.",
    "Too much work to take for fun",
    "102 can best be described as a much more difficult continuation of 101. There's much less handholding, and the material becomes much more narrow and focused. On the plus side, there's much less of a focus on memorization than other biology courses; instead, you'll be tested on functional knowledge. The questions are more \"what happens when we change this in a cell\" then \"name each step in this particular pathway.\"",
    "You'll have to teach yourself most of it because lecture is hard to follow",
    "Take it if you're majoring in biology. Otherwise, choose an easier bio course.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. The material is fascinating, and Professor Mooseker has an in-depth knowledge on the subject matter and a passion for the material that shines through in his lectures. The course heavily emphasizes experimental interpretation, which is very valuable, and the problem sets are definitely challenging (work with others in pset groups!) but also interesting, puzzle-like, and make you think about the material in a new way.",
    "This course is just a hurried look through cell biology, and it is very disappointing if you are looking for real information. It is very irritating and the lectures are extremely disorganized.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course, it was very well taught, informative, and organized very well.",
    "Most of the people taking this are prospective bio majors\/premed, so it's required for them. DO NOT BE AFRAID TO TAKE THIS CLASS. This class had a bad reputation last year. As a result, many whiners in the class refused to put more effort into understanding the material when the class got tough, and instead blamed it on the professor. If you come into the class with a similar attitude, then your opinion of the class will be negative. But if you come into the class willing to think, willing to put forth your own effort into understanding the material, you will really glean a lot out of the class and learn lots of things, very thoroughly. And ifany of the reviews say Professor Mooseker is a bad teacher, then they don't have a heart because Professor M made every effort to let the class be accessible and understandable for all. He is so, so, so, so kind and patient. There are so many resources available in the class for those who are struggling. These resources were very useful for me, and helped me well. I've never had AP Bio, but I could handle the class reasonably. Take the class, and be amazed by how much you will learn.",
    "You'll have to work hard, but it's worth it. I think long-term, this will be one of the most useful classes for me.",
    "If you are taking the BIOL sequence it probably because you have to. With that being said, BIOL 102 is more difficult than 101. Use the study techniques from 101 in 102. Professor Mooseker recognizes that the material can be difficult and takes time and effort to make sure the students understand.",
    "Good class, more entertaining than the first module thanks to Prof. Mooseker.",
    "you will learn a lot of material and will remember a lot of it as well",
    "I have no clue.",
    "I would tentatively recommend 102. I learned an incredible amount, and the material is truly interesting. However, unless you have a strong background in basic Biology (beyond Bio 101, because I don't think 101 fully prepares you for 102), this class is quite difficult and in some ways is not truly introductory. However, Mooseker is a great professor and really open to answering students' questions. Also if you take it and are struggling, join the enrichment section--Surjit is the best!!",
    "Take it if you have to - again, very interesting!! You learn a lot. I never read a textbook chapter and still learned the material in other ways. You need to find a study group and go over the slides a lot.",
    "Its takes a lot of effort, and should certainly not be called an intro class. But it is a great foundation for research and understanding scientific pspers.",
    "After Bio 101 I would recommend to understand that this class will be much harder, especially the problem sets. Overall still very interesting for science people though.",
    "Take it because you have to. Decent cell bio class. A lot of people hated Mooseker's lectures but I thought they were fine. Do the textbook reading or you won't have any idea what the hell he's talking about. You can tell he's really trying to help you understand the material; the problem I think is that he mostly has experience teaching grad students so sometimes lapses back to assuming you know the basics of cell bio. His exams weren't too bad; they definitely could have been a lot harder. Psets are short but hard; just form a group to work on them and you'll be fine.",
    "As a science credit, no, but it's a prerequisite\/requisite for a lot of majors so probably students taking it are doing so out of necessity. Not a terrible class, but it's hard to stay focused in as it's not the most exciting material in my opinion.",
    "Unfortunately this is a prerequisite for the major and thus a lot of students must take it, I would not recommend it to those who want an introductory biology class.",
    "Yes, if you like biology. Section is great, but lectures can get a bit dry at times. At other times, they are very interesting.",
    "Yes, I would. Unlike Bio 101, the material inspires you to become a biology major. Although lecture moves quickly, the material is very interesting and is well worth the time spent into learning it.",
    "Bio 102 is an in-depth overview of cell membrane physiology and the experimentation techniques used in this discipline. This class is hard, but I would recommend it to another student because one does garner a good understanding of the techniques.",
    "It is a requirement, no I wouldn't recommend it if you didn't have to take it.",
    "Biology 102 was generally a negative experience. The class lacks the organization of most lecture courses, but that may just be because it is new. A lot of effort must be put in to just understand the material and the lectures seem to be a waste of time. Overall the material was not useless and you will ultimately get it, but it is a cumbersome experience.",
    "You're probably looking at this because you have to take the course anyways, so instead of reviewing the course I'll give you some pointers. Coming from Biol 101 this course is a big adjustment. The material is tough, but form a group and teach yourselves the slides. Sometimes while studying I would think \"I've never seen this before\" when I actually had, because Mooseker is not a great lecturer.",
    "Biology 102 is much more than an introduction\u00e2\u0080\u0093 we went quite in depth on a number of concepts. Professor Mooseker is very enthusiastic about the subject, but class is often disorganized and hard to follow. Expect to review the lecture slides a lot outside of class to gain an understanding of what goes on in lecture. Overall, the workload is manageable if you study with a partner and go to the peer tutor.",
    "Bio 102 is an intensive, interesting course that develops scientific thinking in the context of cell biology. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who is seriously interested in biology and scientific research in general; I would not recommend it to someone who just wants an overview of biology. That's not what this is.",
    "Pretty good course. Fairly disorganized, but Professor Mooseker is a great, smart person, and you'll get a lot out of the course if you put in the necessary time outside of lecture. Form a study group\u00e2\u0080\u0094it helps a lot!",
    "Intermediate level biology course, i.e. some biology or lab background required to be completely comfortable. However, recommended for major\/pre-professional requirements and if you simply love biology.",
    "BIOL 102 is an okay course. It is definitely more difficult than BIOL 101. The class really emphasizes critical learning and applying the knowledge presented in lecture. The class can become disorganized and annoying at times when the lecture slides do not correspond exactly with the slides posted online. It is almost impossible to take notes some days because the lecture slides posted online were either different or missing certain slides or out of order from the slides professor Mooseker presented during lecture. Professor Mooseker has review sessions throughout the semester that are very helpful for actually reviewing and understanding the material from lecture. The discussion section is a very helpful part of the class as well--you discuss papers that are relevant to the information presented in lecture and it is actually very interesting and helpful even though some of the papers are tough to understand. Professor Mooseker is a very nice person and definitely cares about his students and how they are doing in the course but he is sometimes difficult to understand because he mumbles and his voice trails off sometimes. Grading of the homeworks and exams was generally fair and not too harsh. Overall this class is very difficult and requires a lot of time and effort.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course if you want to lay a foundation for biology courses in the future. The amount of knowledge and the amount of thinking you achieve in this course in only five weeks in incredible--you go from talking about the structure and function of polypeptides to understanding the elegance of entire muscle fibers in just a few short weeks. The opportunities outside of class--such as lab tours, for example--also make the class worth taking.",
    "Similar to Biology 101, I would definitely recommend 102, but I would go to lengths to ensure that the student understands how demanding the course is. I would stress the benefit of paying heed to the instructors' recommendations of working on problem sets in groups.",
    "A good course. Study a lot. Goto piazza. The textbook they offer isn't so useful--not necessary to buy. Sit close to the professor for lectures. Sitting a bit far is not a good idea. Read lectures\/maybe textbook if you get it before class or day before class to understand lecture better.",
    "If they are interested in studying or majoring in science then i would recommend it. If they are not then I would not."
