   "comments": [
    "The material is difficult but very interesting. Take it if you're happy to work on difficult, open-ended proofs and do a decent amount of programming. There's also a fair amount of writing. It's rewarding if you're very theory-oriented.",
    "This course did a good job providing a theoretical perspective on machine learning while also giving students a chance to do some empirical investigation of concepts discussed in class. The workload was also rather light, and we only had three major assignments throroughout the term. Definitely plan to be self-motivated when it comes to studying the material, since you won't be forced to otherwise (by exams, etc.)",
    "Yes this is an interesting computer science elective. It really gives a good survey of Machine Learning. Angluin is really nice\/smart\/reasonable. I think I would take any class she taught. Work was not really traditional for a computer science class - we had about 6 written assignments. Basically read an academic paper and write a one page response. We had 2 theoretical problem sets, one applied problem set, and a final project (which is usually an applied project). So it was a good mix of work. No tests\/exams this year.",
    "I would recommend this class as an undergrad elective. I went in knowing next to nothing about machine learning and felt like I walked away with a very practical knowledge base.(although be warned that the lectures and problem sets are pretty theoretical). You're basically learning algorithms that develop statistical models or decision rules based on large data sets. The problem sets were well written, just challenging enough, and gratifying. They usually mixed some coding with theory. In addition, I really enjoyed working on the final project. Professor Angluin tried to make conference papers\/primary literature a focus of the class - several of our assignments were to read and respond to an important paper in the field. I'd never been forced to do this before and I think it was really good experience, especially if you're interested in learning more theory in the future. There's no final exam and the problem sets only cover a portion of the course, so sometimes I felt like I wasn't forced to master the material from lecture. However, I think I received a very good overview of the field and have a feeling I will return to topics covered in this course again and again.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. Professor Angluin is terrific. The material is difficult but really cool, and Prof. Angluin makes it completely understandable. The work is more in reading papers than in problem sets, which can be interesting."
