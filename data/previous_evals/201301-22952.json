    "Great course - take anything you can with Della Rocca. He is funny, incredibly smart and helpful, and will really help you understand the material.",
    "Only take this course if you are a philosophy major or are interested in hard philosophy. I took it as a political science major because I like political philosophy, but Leibniz is so different and abstract that I was bored the entire time. There's a story where a famous physicist reads a paper from a freshman student, and the paper is so poor that the physicist says, \"It's so bad, it's not even wrong.\" That's what Leibniz and the class discussions were like. For example, Leibniz is writing about how God chooses among possible worlds to create, and in class we were discussing what God would do if there were a tie for best possible world. It seems to me that what Leibniz has to say about this is \"not even wrong\" because, like much of his philosophy, it seems to have no relation to the real world; rather, it is simply made-up stuff that Leibniz believed. Monads? Souls? None of that stuff is even real, much less interesting to me.",
    "A great course. Leibniz has a vast corpus of writings and beliefs--many of them quite weird at best--but he's nonetheless very interesting to learn about. The three-teacher format had plusses and minuses, but mostly pluses: all three were very knowledgeable and the interplay was great.",
    "I absolutely recommend this course, particularly to anyone interested in the junctures of metaphysics and theology in the early modern period. Leibniz can be difficult to approach, given the breadth of his work, but this course provides excellent structure, and Profs. Della Rocca, Feeney and von Bodelschwingh, were great seminar leaders."
