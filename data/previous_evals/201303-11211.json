   "comments": [
    "If you are considering this course, you probably have to take it. Find a project that you like (maybe a competition) beforehand, and tackle it. Maybe have a team in mind before you enter the course although this team may get broken up.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to anyone who is interested in hands on engineering. I think it is invaluable in gaining experience applying engineering knowledge to design and build a device. I would warn students that this class is a lot of work, but if you are genuinely interested in it then it's absolutely worth it .",
    "This class focuses on all of the wrong things. We had long reports due every week and several presentations and lost points for the most nit-picky (spelling?) things. For instance, my group had our system working BETTER than the original specifications and were even able to demonstrate it during the final presentation but lost points because we didnt specify our budget, even though we were way under. Because of that, we got the lowest gradeAlso, This class is more work than any class i have ever taken, and then some. Prof Wilczynski is a great guy, and he gave everyone their top choice for projects. This led to an uneven distribution in people, leaving some groups with the same amount of work and fewer people.It was rewarding to go in a detailed design from start to finish. The teaching team was very helpful as well. Also, you probably have to take this class, so LISTEN: go directly to Nick Bernardo and ask for his help on anything. He is a magician",
    "I would recommend this class to other MechE students, but not to non-MechE majors. Working on a relatively complicated project is a great experience, and you will learn a lot doing it. Just make sure you have good teammates and a good project, otherwise you may end up wasting a lot of your semester.",
    "If you are a mechanical engineering major of any kind, take it! After years of theoretical, chalk board courses like thermo and fluids, this class revived my interest in engineering.",
    "489 is not a class on designing and building a project. It is a class on writing reports about designing a project. Reports consist of the majority of the work and inhibit your ability to actually spend time on the project itself. Be very careful about the group you choose. Make sure skills match with the needs of the project.Work: weekly reports (~15 pages), ~3 presentations, make the project work",
    "Dean Wilcynski was awesome. He put in so much time into this course, it was phenomenal. Every lecture he began with what he called a \"pregame\" which was just a little snippet of something current that had to do with lecture that day. But i twasn't always just a snipet--on the halfway course, he took a Geico commercial about \"Hump Day\" and dubbed his voice over it. That had to take a long time. He was super responsive to student feedback and very attentive to the progress of projects. He also showed a genuine interest in me as a person, beyond just a student in his class. When all was said and done, Dean Wilczynski cared, and it showed.",
    "This class was a good learning experience, where you got first-hand experience in the shop, but it was too focused on report-writing. Overall this is a good course and I would recommend it, but it could have been a lot better without the weekly reports.",
    "Team-based project design course focused on mechanical engineering design skills. Take it if you have to. If you don't, then shop it. It's a lot of work, and definitely not worth it if you don't want to put in the time."
