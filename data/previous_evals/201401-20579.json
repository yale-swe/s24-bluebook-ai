   "comments": [
    "Yes for someone who needs a second language credit",
    "Lots of work, but worthwhile if you really want to learn a new language.",
    "I would recommend it. It was fun and a good way to learn French.",
    "Good class. take it, you probably have to anyways.",
    "Personally, French wasn't for me I didn't love the weekly tests for a year, seems like a difficult language program In comparison to others",
    "I made a great decision when I decided to take French L2. The class is set up in a way that promotes practical communication in and comprehension of the French language. The homework in the class requires a decent time investment, but it is not overly difficult. The teachers are all engaging and very helpful. French is a fantastic language to learn and it opens a lot of opportunities.",
    "Take this class! The French program is one of the best language programs at Yale.",
    "Yes, a good language to take. There are many study abroad opportunities.",
    "I would recommend FREN 120 to another student especially one who has taken FREN 110 because it builds on concepts learned in FREN 110. I feel that I have an overall better understanding of french verb conjugations in various tenses and the use of basic grammar.",
    "I would recommend this course, with the caveat that it is very intensive and fast-paced, with a heavy (not overly difficult, but time-consuming) workload.",
    "Great!"
