   "comments": [
    "No. You are better off reading the books on your own time.",
    "No. Take any other policsci seminar. Don't be fooled by the fact that Shapiro is a big shot--you'll get nothing out of it. And you have no idea how you're doing since the final paper is worth 80% of your grade, which is kind of ridiculous.",
    "I would totally recommend this class if you are interested in political theory on justice and on institution-building.",
    "Non-Domination as a Political Ideal was a strong course. It attempts to explain a new topic in political science through philosophy, economics, anthropology, and historical examples like George Kennan\u0092s containment. Accordingly, the readings range from a discussion of egalitarianism in chimpanzee societies to Rawls\u0092s Theory of Justice. Professor Shapiro is an excellent teacher. He provides context for the readings before each class and then opens the floor to discussion; the questions he poses are very thought provoking. The course has two ten-page papers or one twenty-page paper, due at the end of the term. I recommend the latter, since you can explore a topic that really interests you and perhaps do on-the-ground research. The workload is manageable. I recommend the course.",
    "only if you are really in to political philsophy. this class is not a prereq for anythning, though it does meet the poli phil or seminar requirements for epe or poli sci majors. be warned- it is a lot of reading, and the grading iS VERY UNCLEAR (two ten page papers or a 20 pg paper, particiatipion is unclear, and you don't get any grades back).",
    "Good course, but often discussions are disconnected with the readings."
