    "I gained further understanding of my own data analysis abilities and how to better contextualize my data, particularly with non-parametric analysis. The skills I utilized are entirely specific to the data I analyzed and the research I conducted and really cannot offer a valid evaluation of the Senior Essay course in Psychology. However, I did not find my advisor to be very helpful in guiding me through the project or being punctual with our planning and researching until the final month of the project.",
    "I gained data analysis, statistics, literature review, and academic writing skills from this course. I learned to select key articles and synthesize large quantities of information in an informative way. I learned how to identify interesting components in data and conduct follow-up analyses in support of initial results or hypotheses. I learned to interpret data results in the context of my project.",
    "As the first part of my year-long research project, I was able to develop a theoretical understanding of my project by writing a 20-page literature review. Furthermore, I was able to run subjects and help set up the tools used to analyze the data we collected. Depending on the lab you are in, you can develop skills for setting up EEG or running fMRI, or analyzing that data. It is dependent on you to initiate. For me, I was able to read a lot of papers and ask questions to my grad students, who was very dedicated in teaching me.",
    "I learned about the importance of getting a full understanding of an area of interest before looking into what might be in need of further studying. I found that by reading and engaging with articles related to my topic of interest, I was able to learn a lot and narrow down what exactly I was interested in.",
    "I learned how to conduct an empirical research project from its very beginning stages to the very end. For this course, I had to design a study, build my testing apparatus, run the study on a population of subjects, record and analyze the data, and write it up as a research paper. The skills learned in this course cannot be paralleled.",
    "Organization, Data Analysis, Field Specific Writing.",
    "I not only learned how to better my writing in the APA style, but I also benefitted from working on projects from start to finish."

   "comments": [
    "My poor experience was partially circumstantial. The two original thesis advisors I had paired up to work with accepted job opportunities at other universities within the span of a semester. My project was abruptly drawn up and conducted without much prior knowledge. The psychology department should stress the value in selecting a thesis advisor early and the need to prepare backup plans if desired projects either fall through or are not feasible. The expectations a student and advisor have of each other should also be set by the department.",
    "My experience with the senior essay was well-structured with weekly meetings on data findings. I also had the opportunity to revise a couple copies of my draft with my advisor.",
    "I think this research course varies from lab to lab, but ultimately it is very self-directed. I liked that my professor and I set up deadlines and expectations together. For instance, the draft of my literature review was due at midterm, which was helpful in preparation for my final draft to submit for this course. It might be motivating and interesting to have PSYC 499 seminars in which students taking PSYC 499 can meet together and share what they are learning."

    "I would definitely recommend having some research experience as a psychology major. As someone on the neuroscience track, it is a great experience consolidating what I have learned in the classroom to the lab.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student looking to design and run his\/her own empirical research project."
