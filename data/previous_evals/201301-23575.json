    "After taking this class, I have decided which area I would like to work in. This class was my life-changing class.",
    "Even before his injury, it was hard to feel like Professor Mendelsohn cared a flying hoot about this class. I'm pretty sure he glanced at the syllabus on his walk over to Sage. Remember when you were in undergrad and you felt like the Professors felt like teaching you was charity work? It was a bit like that.On the other hand, Professor M is a brilliant economist, and when he shows up, has some interesting insights.Overall though, I think I would have been better off skipping class and going to discussion session taught by the TA.",
    "I appreciated Professor Mendelsohn's lecturing style. He shows a great depth of knowledge and has an engaging style. My one critique of his style is that he often cuts off students mid-question before they get to complete their thought.This was one of my favorite courses this semester.",
    "Readings were all old. Some classes didn't feel like they had a clear point and were disorganized. Notes on the board, slides in advance, or any kind of organization would have been more helpful. Sometimes answers to student questions were distractions. More guidance needed on how to actually do the \"data magic\", since \"how to analyze this data\" was tested on the midterm and final but wasn't fully discussed in class. Laura was great. Final was boring to take and didn't test the full range of what we had learned by studying on our own.",
    "I think the material of this course was comprehensive and relevant to the interests of FES students. The discussions were always enjoyable and clear and I appreciated the inclusion of econometric formulas and methods for analyzing the data of each valuation method.",
    "Although the course began strongly and we actually discussed the content of the assigned reading, the later we got into the semester, the less care was paid to the details of the actual economics. There was a strong disconnect between the attention to detail and the academic rigor of the reading material and the content of the lecture.",
    "This class is very important if people from a science background wish to expand their knowledge on valuation concepts, techniques, and how to develop robust explantations for economic, policy decision-making."

    "Professor gives really clear explanations about hard topics that would have been really hard to understand without his help.",
    "Prof M's hilarious comments - such as referring to the panel data technique as the \"great white hype,\" or that as environmental managers we will be the \"fashion stars of tomorrow.\"",
    "Expertise of the professor. Readings were great too.",

    "The depth of detail given to each method was incredibly helpful and insightful.",
    "A well-structured and sound introduction to the literature on non-market valuation.",
    "- The instructor: professor Mendelsohn is extremely responsive and makes his classes an interesting discussion. His knowledge and confidence in teaching are the main aspects that make his course really good.- The pace: the rhythm is set by students and their interests. The instructor does not try to impose knowledge, but is open to adapt the pace to students' interests.- The readings offering both sides of an issue: we are provided with different opinions on the valuations issues - this is really useful!",
