    "Highly recommend if you are looking for a good German Lit class that is not too much work.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course!! It covers many famous German authors and a variety of different topics\/themes. The reading is manageable - about one short novel a week. Discussions in class are great- just make sure you do the reading and speak up in class to get the most out of it. It also really helps improve your writing since it includes 4 papers (each with a rough draft) and a final paper.",
    "Yes, definitely recommend, because it's an interesting class and you get a lot out of it.",
    "This is basically a seminar where you get to read a variety of German and Austrian authors. I think this was a great course. The variety of texts that we have read was definitely a strength of the course. Sometimes I felt that I wanted to spend more time on one text and not move to another one though. However, I found time to evaluate a specific text more critically through writing the short papers.Professor Wetters is great. First of all, he is very understanding with deadlines. Second of all, he really appreciates all the comments made in class. He does not attempt to correct grammatical mistakes right away, which is important when learning a new language. He encourages one to talk in class.Take it if you are interested in German, Austrian literature.. The texts that we read were relevant and were the basis of popular films."
