    "-Differential topology -Key concepts include: review of manifolds, transversality, intersection theory -What it takes to give a good lecture",
    "Aside from the subject material, which due to the problem sets I believe I learned pretty well, this course was very helpful in learning how to present math. Receiving feedback as well as evaluating other lecturers was especially constructive.",
    "I got better at lecturing on new material, and I learned a decent amount of differential topology.",
    "The most important skill I gained from the senior seminar was how to prepare lectures and give them. I also got better at figuring out what is important to cover and what can be left to the reader\/audience."

   "comments": [
    "With Minsky, I think the strengths were that he tried to give the class more structure, by having us assign homework to each other. Otherwise, it's highly likely that I'd stop paying attention to lecture and almost certain that I would not review the book when there were lectures I did not totally understand. It's a strength because I like to learn math. but could also be viewed as a weakness if you are hoping for the seminar to be a snooze, but if that's really the case then why are you still a math major at this point?",
    "480 on differential topology was a lot of work for a senior seminar. Its strengths were Professor Minsky's feedback, and its weaknesses were the excessive amount of work.",
    "Though the problem sets required more work than previous years, it really helped for learning the material.",
    "The only downside to this course were the constant homeworks, which were sometimes hard to keep up with. On the upside, they weren't really graded, so in the end it wasn't a huge deal.",
    "This course had several strengths namely it did a good job of teaching us how to lecture and assign homework as well as grade it. Also, even though it was the students lecturing I feel like a learned a good deal of different topology. The main weakness is that some students were better lecturers than others and people often lectured right out of the book."

   "comments": [
    "If you are more interested in theoretical vs. applied math, and Minsky is teaching it in this particular semester, you should try to take it with him!",
    "I took the differential topology seminar under Professor Minsky. It was much more work than I expected, with problem sets twice a week, and preparing lectures on top of that. It was definitely worth it. I enjoyed solidifying my understanding of manifolds and their properties.",
    "If you can, take it with Professor Minsky. Everyone in the class gives a couple lectures, and each lecturer gives a short homework assignment from the textbook. A bit more work than previous years, but I think it's worth it.",
    "I guess, but if you're a senior math major you have to take this course anyway.",
    "I would definitely take the senior seminar with Minsky again. On top of the usual lecturing in the seminar he made students assign homework and grade it. This made people pay far more attention in the course and kept engagement up. We did differential topology which was interesting. It can be tough to get all the work done at times if you have other stuff but people were pretty lenient with homework.",
    "If Minsky is \"teaching\" this class, and if the textbook is Differential Topology by Guillemin and Pollack, then you should definitely take this class!"
