    "Yes if you have a little bit of Chinese and want to become fluent!",
    "CHNS 142 is a solid continuation of CHNS 132. The work is slightly more challenging than CHNS 132 since CHNS 142 is much more fast-paced. However, it is a very rewarding class.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student. This class moves faster than Chns 132, with more focus on discussions about the topics mentioned in the chapters. Students learn a lot of characters, and improve their speaking through the discussions and oral presentations.",
    "The Chinese heritage course is a great course at Yale. I have learned so much of the course of a year. There is a lot of work each day, but the effort you put in really shows when you can write essays in Chinese and create an oral presentation about a current issue in China. I would definitely recommend this course."
