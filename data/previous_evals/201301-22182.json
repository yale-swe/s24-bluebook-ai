    "Some of the statistics is interesting, but overall the course is boring and frustrating.",
    "I would recommend Stochastic Processes to another student who has taken a course in probability theory (can be from a department besides statistics) mainly for the course content. Thetheory of stochastic processes is not only key in probability theory, but is at the heart of a lot of upper level courses in sciences and quantitative fields and is also very relevant in the more everyday things such as card shuffling, image production, job candidate selection, and analysis of financial instruments. While David Pollard has high expectations for his students and aimed the curriculum at a high level, overall the class was good. The homework (once every other week, on average), for the most part, was fair, though was graded strictly. The final project for the course was a fun learning experience and is a nice alternative to a final examination. (The course was graded 60% homework and 40% final project.) From the way it sounds, the course covers different material each year depending on who is teaching. David Pollard was amenable to altering the topics covered this year based on student interest. This year he covered Markov chain theory, applications of Markov chains to graphs, Markov random fields, martingales, Brownian motion, and stochastic calculus. Although the course is challenging, I would recommend it to mainly to majors in mathematics, statistics, economics, natural and physical sciences, and engineering. Taking this class will definitely change the way you look at the world and will enhance your perspective on mathematics and statistics, especially if you have the opportunity to take the class with David Pollard.",
    "STAT 251 covers Markov chains, stopping times, martingales, and brownian motion. There are problem sets and an extensive final project. The problem sets are extremely difficult and the expectations for the final exam are somewhat vague. The course is very hard and it takes a good deal of time to really understand what has been covered in class. I would only recommend the class if someone is interested in the topics and has had some experience with the material.",
    "This is a fun class, and David Pollard is a good teacher.",
    "MATH 251 with Professor Pollard is a lot harder than other stochastic processes classes. We do not use R and it is much more theoretical and may be a better fit for mathematics majors than underclassmen statistics majors. It is a bit intimidating in the beginning because there seem to be more graduate students than undergraduates. It is a tough class and even though problem sets are 60% of your grade, they are challenging (10+ hours a week) and graded harshly. While not a necessity, comfort with mathematical arguments and proofs is helpful in completing the problem sets. There is no offered problem session, so if you have difficulty with the homework, you are pretty much by yourself. Unlike other math classes, it is hard to see the \"right\" answer and the \"right\" way to do it as the problems are not taken directly from lecture or the textbook. With that being said, it is a rewarding class. The class covers many interesting topics such as the Princess Problem, Markov Random Fields and Brownian Motion. Professor Pollard does a great job at presenting heuristic arguments as well as rigorous mathematical arguments. I did feel that the lectures were sometimes hard to follow partially because notation was confusing and because it is sometimes difficult to follow the mathematical argument given the fast pace. The class culminates in a final project that is worth 40% of your grade. Professor Pollard offers a list of possible final project choices and does check in on your progress every now and then, but you are pretty much given free reign. It is a great opportunity to delve into a topic and explain a mathematical argument clearly and precisely, but it is hard to know what Pollard expects and wants. Overall, challenging class, but you will learn a lot!",
