   "comments": [
    "I think that we spent enough time on each poem, and I liked that we were able to write protocols and reflect on what we read.",
    "This course provided the opportunity to read and engage with a poet that undergraduates otherwise wouldn't encounter. Graduate students did typically take the lead in discussion, but Professor Brantley did a nice job bringing the undergrads into the conversation as well, and hearing the grads' thoughts was very helpful as I formed my own ideas about the poems. The prospectuses were also a really nice way to dive into the poems: much more in-depth than a reading response, but not as formal as a lengthy paper.",
    "This course is excellent. The breadth of assignments, from protocols\/reading responses to a bibliography project to a final research paper, enables students to practice all the skills crucial for literary scholarship -- research, close reading analysis, writing both for presentation and for the page. The syllabus is also phenomenal. I thought the reading each week was manageable -- but still challenging -- and I very much appreciated reading criticism each week along with our primary text."

   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It gave me the opportunity to read poems that I may never had read.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to a student interested in medieval literature. The language is somewhat more challenging than Chaucer, but the course is well-paced, so it shouldn't be too much trouble. I really enjoyed reading all the works of the Gawain poet, and I'm very glad to have had the chance to think and write about them.",
    "Yes, absolutely. This course is a fantastic study of an incredible Middle English manuscript, which has inspired decades of scholarship but still holds a rich reservoir of potential analysis. This course empowers students to improve their English skills in several crucial ways. You will come away from the course a much better reader, writer, thinker -- and likely with a newfound appreciation for Middle English literature."
