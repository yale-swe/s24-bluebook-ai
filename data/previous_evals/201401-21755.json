   "comments": [
    "This is the best class I have taken so far. I have learned so much. However, it is a lot of work and the critiques might sometimes feel tedious.",
    "The first half of the class, you use paper, exacto knives, glue, and a xerox machine! This is not a class to teach you how to be an indesign whiz, it's a class to teach you to think about communicating visually. I thought the assignments were really valuable, though they do take a lot of time.",
    "This class will teach you the basics of graphic design in terms of form and visual thinking. Most of the work is done by hand, not by computer. I would recommend this class for a good introduction to what graphic design is, but beware of long crits.",
    "Yes, this is a wonderful class. I had previous experience in graphic design, and this still taught me a lot in terms of process, precision of idea, and concept formulation. Professor Bittiner is astute and has a lot of fun assignments planned for y'all. Be ready to throw out your preconceptions of what graphic design \"ought to look like\" and get ready to do some original, out of the box thinking. (Wow, that was a cliched sentence.) Also included with your purchase of the class: THE AMAZINGNESS OF SWISS GRAPHIC DESIGN, typography! fonts!, and cutting things out with knives hehehehehe Also, Helvetica.",
    "I strongly recommend this course. It is largely critique based in class, so assignments are often long as they require time to figure out (this process is then reflected on in the class critique). This learning process is great and encourages rapid development of design concepts and technical skill.",
    "I would recommend this class to students who have a high tolerance for critiques, as you will spend four hours a week engaged in them. The assignments really do help you develop your visual vocabulary and communication skills, and are generally fun.",
    "Intro Graphic Design is a good class if you're very interested in graphic design as a discipline, but the amount of work you need to put in in order to get any real payoff is large enough that I wouldn't recommend it to someone with a more casual interest."
