   "comments": [
    "Conversational Spanish really does improve your Spanish on an intuitive level; there are no lessons on grammar, and you probably won't even retain that much vocabulary, but the practice the course gives you is super valuable. The readings and films are generally great and relevant to one another; there are some tedious\/lame assignments, but that can be said of most language courses. The benefits outweigh the annoyances. In addition, Lourdes, while not the best professor you could take, is great and really makes an effort to help you improve; she often goes over the mistakes you made on homework assignments with you individually and makes an effort to include interesting cultural facts with lessons as well.",
    "I would definitely reccommend this class if you want to improve your speaking and wrting skills. You'll watch a lot of movies and do some cool readings, but be warned--it's not a gut! Definitely more work than I expected, but worth it for the most part.",
    "Probably not. I didn't really feel like my speaking skills improved. It is just a way to fulfill the L5 credit.",
    "This class is not for everyone. It is very participation based, and you will truly glean more from it if you put more effort into it. If you're bored by the readings and aren't talking in class, your Spanish will stay at the same level (or worsen). If you really engage yourself in the material and try to make class discussions interesting, you'll find your vocabulary and fluency improving.",
    "Spanish 151 covers a variety of vague topics, but that's really not the point. You speak a lot in a very informal environment, which means you can make mistakes and not get mocked, so it's very useful and constructive. The workload is reasonable (readings for each class with written work about once a week), with a few fairly easy tests and an oral midterm and final. Take this class to improve your Spanish before taking scary higher level classes, and if you can take it with Lourdes, do. She's lovely and so helpful, and makes the class really casual and enjoyable.",
    "Yes, this course is helpful to keep up with Spanish, though fluidity is difficult to obtain. Practice and participation is key."
