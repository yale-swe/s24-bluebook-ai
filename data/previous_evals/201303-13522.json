    "Question 14The course provided students with academic and professional management assets in broad range of situations and in different types of ecosystems and landscapes. From the skills and knowledge gained in this course, students are able to make any successful and relevant decision in ecosystems management, based on rational evidence. Most importantly, the course skilled students on how science could be valuable in management decision process even in very complex situations across different regions and biota.",
    "There were three professors, and three TAs. Instead of making the course better, it seemed like professors were not very well organized on the lectures and activities.",
    "The course was excellent. In addition the instructor provided some online vignettes which were extremely helpful",
    "Question 3This was a great class, but it had some kinks to work through. The lab component was massive and made the class a lot more week than it needed to be.",
    "This class functioned under a new structure compared to other years, which made it a learning process for faculty, TAs and students. There were some difficulties with time management, especially for assignments and exams, that made the class overwhelming at times. However, it was an excellent class for learning key concepts of ecosystem processes and ecosystem services.",
    "13: This was overall a great class. The field trips were great, and EXTREMELY helpful: it was great to be able to actually get a sense of what we were doing in class and in the lab by going out and seeing it in the field. The lectures were really good and the online vignettes were really helpful and definitely let me learn a lot. I would have loved to have one more field trip.More supervised time in the lab would have been really helpful. If our lab work could fit into the scheduled 9am-12pm lab time on Fridays, that would be ideal. Because we had to have regular lectures, scheduled lab time, AND work in the lab outside of those hours, the work load was a bit too heavy. But overall this was a great class and I learned a lot!",
    "A terrific course. Not only did I learn the basics of ecology, but I was challenged to think beyond the traditional definition of the field. I really enjoyed having the three professors teach the course.",
    "I enjoyed the paper readings and discussions. I thought there was a good mixture of science and management papers. Perhaps one thing to try would be to pair a 'management' paper and also a scientific paper - how does the 'management' paper use the scientific paper? Does it accurately represent the conclusions presented, or is something changed? Etc.The Richardson project was a great component, in that we got to experience fieldwork, labwork, and report writing (as well as seeing how scientists managers have to make some significant interpolations of data).The Gecko Woods project took far too long for how much we learned from it and for its percentage of our entire grade. Even with grouping into three, I'm pretty sure that amount of time that I spent individually on that project was considerably more than any of the three midterms. I would advise rewriting the assignment so that all the computerwork (running the model and making spreadsheets) can be done within the lab period (or within two lab periods) and then the write-up is done outside of lab."

    "The online vignettes were really great, as were the lab components. I liked having the final project based on lab work from the beginning of the semester to bring it all together. The professors were great at trading off the lectures and linking the topics we were discussing to relevant topics that we would be thinking about in our own work. There were a few lectures that talked about large-scale issues that I really loved and made me consider some of my perspectives on environmental issues.",
    "The best aspect of the course was how the students were constantly to challenge to question the current ideas in the fields. We were not simply feed information, but really forced to think and develop our own opinions. I also liked the emphasis on how humans fit within ecosystems and what we can do to ensure change.",

    "Coordination between instructors",
    "Our work at the lab would have been improved and done differently. I would suggest that students are supported during their works at laboratories.",
    "The syllabus and assignments were not clear. Instructors appeared to be unorganized.",
    "The second half of the course focused on demonstrating how the cycles and science learned in the first part are influenced by human management systems and how anthropogenic stresses influence these cycles. This was important part in helping us see the relationship between ecology and management. The discussions were provocative but sometimes cyclical and did not provide direction on how to approach combating ecological problems. Though this is not a management course and I recognize there is no simple or straight forward response to addressing ecological disasters, more direction could have been given on tools that have been used to address these problems since a lot of time was focused on management implications for ecosystems and landscapes.",
    "Class needs to be better organized to gain efficiency and maximum learning potential.",
    "More quantitative examples in class",
    "I think the professors were very responsive over the course of the semester to our feedback and improved most of what I would have otherwise suggested.",
    "A reorganization of the field trips relative to the rest of the course might be useful for students to make the most of the trips and their outcome",
    "The exams were unstructured and confusing. They did not reflect materials learned in class.",
    "It would have been useful to have more faculty\/TA support for creating the carbon budget, since the student groups were left pretty much on their own. The problem with student groups is that tasks are divided among members, which means that not all students are part of quantifying the budget. This should be reinforced by providing in class exercises in which all students participate.",
    "I didn't get much out of the Geckowoods exercise, so if that could be removed or modified that would be really good.",
    "A bit more clarity about how much time is expected would be useful. There were times that we had assignments that weren't on the syllabus or were more time-consuming than we had expected. But the professors were responsive when this was brought up and they said this would be considered in future versions of this course.",
    "More time in the field would have been helpful with the final project.",
    "Organization? I felt that often the requirements for assignments were unclear - were paper summaries due at 5pm or 9am? Did assignments need to be emailed or uploaded to classesv2?While I didn't think that the first midterm was too difficult, I think we were all a bit surprised at the quantitative aspect of it, especially since we had done very little of that previously (except for one in-class exercise with nitrogen, and the sample exam problem - which created lots more questions!) Arguing over the interpretation of the questions regarding the numbers was what made the test so lengthy, not necessarily a lack of understanding of (or failure to study) the material. So make sure that the exam material matches class material not only in topic but also in type."
