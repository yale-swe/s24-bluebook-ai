    "I do not feel that this course was highly valuable. Although the instructor seemed knowledgeable about the subject matter, there was little to no variation in the class discussions from week to week and what seemed to be poor organization. The online nature of the course also made it difficult to interact as a class and have effective class discussion. In addition, Professor Hsu did not smoothly facilitate lectures and deliver content. She would often ignore students' questions and did not always respond in a supportive way to student comments. She was often very reactive and combative in her demeanor while addressing the class or answering questions. Most concerning was that Professor Hsu often made insensitive or disrespectful comments. For example, there were a number of occasions when she offhandedly made racial comments and also several times when she openly spoke poorly of and negatively about other Yale faculty members and supervisors. In general, I do not feel that she acted in the mature, professional, and respectful manner, as a type of role model for the students, that I would expect Yale professors to exhibit.",
    "The lectures served to repeat many of the findings from the readings, but did not add new material or enhance my understanding of the subject matter. The TA's really were amazing for the trip to China, as the instructor was only with us for 3 of the 10 days we were there. The TA's ensured that we had a good schedule, met with appropriate people, and facilitated great discussions."

   "comments": [
    "The online portal used for teaching the course had many glitches. It could be improved better.",
    "The course content, delivery, and instruction all need a great deal of improvement. In addition to that which I stated above, the course was very focuses on Chinese views of China and the instructor did not bring in opposing viewpoints. She was also not receptive to opposing viewpoints when students tried to raise the issue.",
    "The technology still needs to be improved, and the time difference with Singapore is quite a lot to have to deal with twice a week.",
    "The online format did not work. There were consistent internet issues, difficulties hearing people, poor connections, etc. I would not take another online course again after this experience. It was difficult to learn and be an active participant due to the course design.",
    "- Technical aspects of the online course: it was often very challenging to have it work well - would be great if the university could invest in this so that it works properly and goes smooth. - The collaboration between FES and NUS was hard. Doing the policy memo together should be done differently, or perhaps not done at all and do something less stressful in collaboration instead (i.e. prepare and lead a discussion together). The professor also didn't put enough effort in to bring the two together, rather there was sometimes a bit of 'tension' between the groups as we come from such different places. - In general I would advise the professor to be more open to students and try to be reflective of her own position toward the class. I have personally struggled with the 'tough' attitude of the professor and there have been moments where I had to bite my tongue because I didn't feel that there was a safe space to be constructive but critical but I do think things were sometimes not ok (the highlight of that concern is that there had been comments related to people's race \/ country of origin - that occurred once or twice during the field trip - and even though I am sure this was all without bad intentions and perhaps not even realized, I think it was not all too professional and basically just inappropriate). The professor could in my opinion benefit from reflecting on her own 'attitude' as she is incredibly smart and thoughtful and knows a lot to teach us, but making certain negative comments repeatedly or being somewhat 'aggressive' or unnecessarily defensive in responses is something that I would definitely advise to try to improve. I'm just trying to be honest about my experience and I don't mean this in any bad way, so I hope it's ok to say it and I hope the professor will think about how to best reflect on how she can be the best example for her students which you should strive to be as a teacher\/professor. - The work load was a bit much in terms of what needed to be done every week, rather we should have an earlier start on the final deliverable and focus on that a bit more. It was very much tailored to undergrads rather than FES and grad students, so a bit more balance would benefit the course and the students.",
    "Technical difficulties during the online classes affected lectures, looking into alternative online platforms that perform better could be an option. The professor could be more receptive to students comments."

    "It was incredibly difficult to do group work with students at Yale NUS due to both time difference and that we couldn't meet face to face to write a policy memo. I appreciate the effort in trying to connect Yale FES students with Yale NUS students, but it more served to divide the two groups.",
    "I had a good experience from the group project. Exchanging ideas with someone from a very different background from mine was interesting and a good learning experience. It also enriched the research when trying to find solutions to the energy challenges in China. In regards to disadvantages, teamwork is always challenging. Trying to find a common ground to start working was difficult and the burden of the project was not shared equally."

    "There were often technology issues and we wasted a lot of class time trying to fix the sound, visual quality, etc. Since the instructor was sitting in the Yale NUS classroom and the rest of us in New Haven were on our personal laptops at home early in the mornings, it often felt as if the class was very separated and the instructor was much more focused on the NUS students that were sitting in the room with her. In addition, unless the overall course content and delivery of information is completely enhanced, I would not necessarily recommend this course to masters students. I do not feel that it was presented as a high-level masters course should be - both the instruction and content delivery were well below what I would deem appropriate standards for Yale.",
    "Take it if you have any interest in China's issues.",
    "While the trip to China was worthwhile and gave me great perspective, the rest of the class was logistically difficult and frustrating. The course lectures felt the same, week after week, as we had a very data-heavy approach to understanding the issues. A more nuanced approach could have been beneficial.",
    "Try to indirectly give the teacher constructive feedback. She is not an easy professor but she knows a lot and it's an excellent course, so I would recommend the content but I would also make sure you are aware and she is aware of that she has some improving to do.",
    "To be patient as this course is starting. Even though we faced some challenges, it was a good learning experience."
