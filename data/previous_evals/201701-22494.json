    "Contemporary tools for genomic analysis and the basics of python.",
    "I learned a great deal of coding skills, as well as a lot of ways to think about genomic data, both conceptually and practically. I also learned a lot about technology for getting this kind of data, and some of the history surrounding the field.",
    "I learned a lot about the basic methods used to analyze ChIP-seq, RNA-seq, whole exome, and other genomic data. I also learned how to do some basic coding in Python.",
    "I learned basic python and was exposed to the R scripting language. I learned a lot about how genomics is done in real research settings and became familiar with many file types and data bases associated with genomic data. I learned basic pipelines for the analysis of RNA-seq, Chip-Seq and de novo variant calling."

   "comments": [
    "Strengths: Thinking about the utility of different studies in genomics and emerging methods of analysis Weaknesses: I felt like the statistics was a bit shallow",
    "Strengths: Multiple arms of the course- the didactic part and the practical\/computational part. I really liked having both arms, because it rounded out my understanding of the field of genomics, which i had very little exposure to previously. Also the problem sets were very useful for getting hands-on experience with dealing with genomic data. Weaknesses: Class, particularly the tutorial schedule, was slightly disjointed due to Farnam shutdowns, technical problems, etc. But not really the fault of the course so much as just weird events. I wish the tutorials lined up a little more with what we covered in class.",
    "I really enjoyed the discussion sections and problem sets, I felt like they gave me a lot of practical knowledge. While many of the lectures provided interesting overviews of various topics related to genomics, I often wished that they had been a bit more practical, by focusing on situations in which those techniques would be informative, the specific tools used to perform the analysis, issues to consider when using those techniques, etc.",
    "As someone with no programming background, this course was a very challenging and humbling experience. If there was a preparatory \"coding for biologists\" type of course in the fall I would definitely have benefited from it. That being said, I have never learned so much in a single course."

   "comments": [
    "Yes. Helpful content and great teachers",
    "yes, it gives you a good starting tool set if you see these methods as important for your research",
    "Absolutely, everybody in modern genetics\/biology should take this course, since this is going to be a large part of how we learn about biological systems in the future. And, this is a great way to learn it, I learned so much and feel prepared to discuss papers that utilize genomic methods now.",
    "Yes, I think this course would be very useful for anyone involved in genetics research. While it cannot possibly teach students how to extensively analyze any kind of data they may encounter, I feel that it (at very least) prepares students to correctly interpret and think critically about the results of genomic work in papers, talks, etc.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student interested in pursuing research that involves genomic data. I would encourage students to work in teams on homework, but to be very careful to submit there own work and give credit where it is due."
