   "comments": [
    "If you want to continue studying Chinese, it's really your only option. Not as much written homework as L1-L2, but there's a lot of memorization every night.",
    "The course provides a solid continuation of the Chinese sequence here at Yale. The homework load is fairly heavy but reasonable, the teachers are enthusiastic and hard-working, and the topics of conversation in class are significantly more interesting than in previous classes. However, the emphasis on speaking skills could definitely be strengthened; I feel that my speaking skills have deteriorated slightly because of lack of opportunities for practice. Including more individual speaking practice during class would be very useful. Overall, this course strikes a fairly good balance between speaking, listening, reading, and writing (although I would prefer more of a focus on speaking and less of a focus on character writing). I would recommend it if you'd like to maintain or expand your knowledge of Chinese language and culture.",
    "Yes! but take into consideration the following comments:-Wang laoshi and Zhan laoshi are great (one of the main reasons you should take the class!!)but sometimes it felt like they cared more about us memorizing the grammar structures and phrases in our textbook (which, by the way, I wasn't a huge fan of) than improving our speaking skills.-If you've just come back from a summer program (Light), don't expect to get much out of this class, speaking-wise. Your vocabulary and grammar knowledge will definitely increase, but if you want to keep your speaking fluency up, you'll definitely need to also go to office hours, Chinese table, and find other outside resources.",
    "The class takes up a lot of time and can be frustrating for Light Fellows who just came back from a summer of intensive Chinese. It is still worth taking if you don't want to forget everything you learned.",
    "A continuation of the typical Chinese class. This level is fairly easy if you've completed a summer program and the only way to maintain your speaking capability.",
    "Without a doubt, I would recommend CHNS 150 to another student. Having said that, I will still say that if one decides to take CHNS 150, one needs to be prepared to spend time and efforts on this class. Otherwise, one will not be able to gain as much from this class as possible. It's so easy to spend the minimum amount of time needed to this class like I did, and looking back, I must say that I wish I spent more time in this class.",
    "Chinese 150 is really hard. The assignments could be better spaced so that all the vocab doesn't have to be memorized at the beginning of the week. While I understand that we will obviously move faster than we did in Chinese 110 and 120, I think the workload is a bit unmanageable. I also feel like the grammar we learned was not particularly well laid out in terms of why we were learning certain structures. It should be made more clear what structures are used for speaking and which are used for writing.That said, the professors were very enthusiastic and dedicated.They definitely are very willing to help their students, Chinese is just a really hard language.",
    "Take the course. It's one of the few classes at Yale with fair and transparent grading. Simply doing the work and showing up to class will improve your Chinese.",
    "I would definitely recommend the course to another student who is looking to continue their language study. The class expects you to study about 80 characters a chapter with 40 being potentially tested on each quiz. This being said the class is not overwhelming by any means.",
    "Great Chinese class. Progress isn't as rapid as L1 and L2, but it's great for learning more vocabulary and structures appropriate for discussing more complicated topics. A lot of work though.",
    "I would definitely recommend continuing with CHNS 150 - you start discussing more serious topics (although some of them seem really random at first), and at this point, you're still learning a lot of new vocabulary and grammar. Stopping Chinese before taking this course doesn't make a whole lot of sense.",
    "If you want to pursue Chinese language then yes of course !"
