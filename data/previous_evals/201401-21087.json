    "Well just make sure you end up taking it with a decent instructor. The learning material itself is quite basic.",

    "Yes, a very good L1\/L2 intro course. Doesn't assume any prior knowledge of German (I'm the furthest thing from being German) and I felt like I did fine.",
    "Fun class, easier than Spanish, French, or Chinese, but I still feel like I learned a lot.",
    "Christine Kim is not the most energetic instructor. Shop around. It's not the end of the world if you have to take this section, but there may be better options."
