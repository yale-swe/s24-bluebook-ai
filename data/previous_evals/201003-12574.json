    "yes. it's a great L5 german class",
    "I would recommend German 150. The reading material is interesting, and the class is fairly flexible, which is nice.",
    "German 150 is a good class to start L5 German. My German certainly improved, especially my reading. It is a little bit unpredictable\u0097I wasn't always sure exactly what the homework was, but Professor Gehlker was very nice and understanding.",
    "Good class to continue german skills without too much work. Lots of readings, essays once every week and a half to two weeks, the occasional test. German class is usually chill.",
    "If you want to get better at German, do it!",
    "A great capstone course in German. If you want to improve your German and have a good time doing it, this class is the right one. The class is a variety of readings, presentations, essays, movies, and current debates\/topics. The workload isn't terrible, probably 20-30 min a night, but definitely less than L1-L4 language classes. Take it!"
