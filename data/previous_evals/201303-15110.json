    "An average class at best. Lecture itself was pretty cool and interesting, although I felt we really only scratched the surface of the field. Scaz is nice and fun to listen to. However, the TFs are abysmal and the assignments are terrible. You use this software that is incredibly slow and frustrating, and the TFs cause more problems than they fix. Grading is pretty weird and not always fair. Take it if you need an easy CS class with a lot of fluff and little depth.",
    "If you're interested in learning more about robots, it's worthwhile - a very CogSci approach. You learn a little bit of everything, from MechE to CS to Psych, but that being said, if you've taken a lot of intro psych courses, it will feel very similar and be repetitive at times. I personally have been planning to pursue AI, so I feel like I gained a lot of necessary basic understanding for the field.",
    "I would definitely recommend CPSC 472. If you have a background in computer science (if you've taken 201), you're definitely well prepared for the class. Scaz is a fantastic lecturer. He makes class so much fun and he does a fantastic job of tying together everything you learn. The material is a little difficult at times but is very interesting. You study the theory behind robot architectures, machine learning, and ultimately attempt to answer the question, \"how can we create and classify intelligence?\" The problem sets and exams are challenging but fair. Overall it's a great class and definitely worth taking.",
    "An entertaining course. Covers robot design history, architectures, hardware, and algorithms. Professor Scaz is a very good presenter; I was rarely bored. Homework is a little difficult but interesting; you should know some C, but not a lot of programming is required.",
    "Not alot of work, grading can be tough, but you have plenty of time to study and work in psets. Generally a laid back class.",
    "If you're asking yourself 'should I take this class?', the answer is probably yes. The material is truly fascinating if you have any interest at all in robots or gadgets (and who doesn't!). Robotics is one of the few non-theory\/proofs, but still legit, high level electives in Yale CS. This is the history\/theory part of what used to be one class, and it feels at times more like an intro social science course (a more QR-ey one though) than a CS one. It never got very technical. Which was awesome for me, because I'm crap at that engineering stuff. Scaz is a non-boring lecturer, although he can get repetitive. You don't actually need to be a very computer sciencey person to do this, but you will need to know how to code in C if they continue using the (buggy) software we used on our p-setes. Also, the CS 202 'prereq' is completely unnecessary. There is approximately zero math in this course.",
    "It's an interesting class about robotics, with a strong cognitive science aspect. While he goes in to a lot of detail in class, the tests and problem sets require a very fair level of understanding for anyone with a decent programming background. This was the first time this class was taught and there are still some bugs with the problem sets, as far as the timing of the problem sets and the program - Webots - used to code them, but hopefully they will address these. Scaz is excellent in this field, so you should take the chance to learn from the best. The programming is not heavy if you're a comp sci major, but if you're not - I'm cog sci - make sure you're prepared to dedicate some serious time to learning\/coding in C.",
    "Very fun class if you want an overview of Robotics, but that's exactly what it is - an overview. You'll learn a lot of things, but nothing too thoroughly",
    "I found this course to be very boring, although most of the other people in the class seemed to like it. The course is a survey so you never really go that deep into any particular topic so, to me, the course boiled down to one long summary of all the things that people have tried in robotics that didn't work. The focus was always on what we can't do rather than what we can do and I found that to be a little bit depressing and also just not very engaging. The workload is very low though, there were five problem sets which took a total of probably 15 hours to do all semesterand then a midterm and take-home final, so it would make a decent 5th class if that's what you're looking for. It is also a change of pace for computer science majors.",
    "This is a course to teach you about robotics; wait, no, it's a course to make you LOVE robotics. So far, this has been my favorite Computer Science course by far. It covers a fascinating topic in an engaging way and the result is thoroughly enjoyable. I would recommend this course to absolutely any Computer Science major (and to anyone else who can handle the programming which, while nothing like CPSC 223 or 323, is complex and often abstract). This course made me stop wanting to go to computer science grad school generally and made me start wanting to go to grad school for robotics\/AI specifically instead.Scaz is a wonderful instructor; you will love his lectures!",
    "It is a broad survey course where occasionaly the lectures are really boring (i.e. on motor technology) but it is about the history of development to current state of robotics",
    "Yes if you are interested in robotics. It presents a lot of interesting topics, but isn't really organized. Hopefully this will change since it was the course's first year in existence.",
    "I would recommend this class. It's got great material. A lot of the material is almost more \"humanities\" type stuff\u00e2\u0080\u0093 qualitative judgments about different designs of robots. There is plenty of technical material, but it's not too unreasonable as long as you get started early on homework and go to class.",
    "Intelligent Robotics was a fascinating overview of some of the most significant milestones in the history of the field. The workload was manageable but some of the problem sets were frustrating and tedious.",
    "Interesting lectures and not too much work. I would recommend the class for someone who is curious about the subject.",
    "A phenomenal class for covering a lot of ground in a really fascinating field. Scaz is an amazing lecturer. Don't be fooled by how easy the class is during the first week, though-- a lot of things will speed up when you eventually hit machine architectures and then are expected to code somestuff later on. A lot of stuff, mostly in passing, will be thrown at you, so you can't fall behind or you will be absolutely and so utterly hopelessly screwed for the problem sets. The TA hours will be full of people who are equally as if not more screwed than you are for the problem sets, so don't rely on those as your backup plan for the problem sets. The only defense is to keep up with the material and make sure you understand all, if not most, of the things rapidly thrown at you in lecture-- a lot of stuff will be accompanied by complicated-looking technical thingy drawings, but don't be intimidated!",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. Whether you are a computer science student or not, this class is extremely interesting, and Scaz is a great professor. The problem sets do not involve tomuch coding, and the material is not overly technical. Don't expect to be working with real robots however, that comes later in separate course. As a whole, one of the better computer science electives I've taken at Yale.",
    "Great class - Scaz is awesome. Easy if you're looking for a CS credit, but very interesting. One of my favorite classes at Yale!",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone interested in learning about the history of robotics as well as where robotics is today.",
    "CPSC472 is a comprehensive introduction to the basic of robotics. No one topic itself is too difficult, but understanding how everything relates takes some effort. I would definitely recommend it, although a CS background definitely makes things easier",
    "Pretty solid cs elective course. Medium difficulty material, with better psets towards the end, and fair exams.",
    "Professor Scaz is a very engaging lecturer and I loved this class. Problem sets were very challenging but TAs are helpful.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to a fellow student. Although the course does not have the easiest psets or tests, the material is very interesting and on the cutting edge of where technology and robotics is headed.",
    "A huge waste of time. Do not take this course if you are a CS major. Halfway through the course, I thought this course was a scam. It's not at all technical except for a couple programming assignment. Half the lectures are about psychology\/cognitive science\/common sense. You won't really learn anything about building robots or robotic systems through this course. The problem sets are not intellectually challenging, just tedious and confusing. That said, the course has a relatively light workload. If you're a CS major, expect to be frustrated with the human interaction\/psychology \"lectures\" enough that you might drop the course. This course should be more of a guest talk series of some sort. To be honest, I just expected much more from this course than what I got.",
    "Yes",
    "This was honestly my favorite course of the semester, and I haven't been very fond of the few comp sci courses I've taken so far. The material was extremely engaging and I felt like I learned a lot by the end of the semester.",
    "Interesting class, great overview of concepts in robotics, take it!"
