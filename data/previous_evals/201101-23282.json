    "While I was not able to attend every field trip, the ones that I did attend were extremely well run and very interesting.",
    "I'm not sure I've taken another course that taught me as much as silviculture did. The field trips are super helpful, as well as fun and interesting.",
    "I think the course is very strong, especially Mark's lectures.I wish the readings were integrated more so I had more incentive to do them!I discussed one improvement with some other students, which would be have groups work on problem sets like the essay questions in the tests. (Maybe having students cite readings in their answers to problem sets would give us more incentive to do them.)",
    "Overall, this is the best course I have taken at FES. Dr. Ashton, Tom, and Brent were great to work with, and set the bar high for how courses should be taught at FES.",
    "Question 2 and 6: I knew NOTHING about silivculture, so for me the course was a bit to fast for me and unclear. I feel like a lot of people who already knew things about silviculture dominated the discussion, and I felt embarrassed asking my more basic questions or asking him to repeat. I would consider splitting this class up into 2 sections--one for more intermediate students, and one for complete beginners.",
    "One of the best classes I have ever taken as a student anywhere.",
    "If I could give Mark Ashton a higher instructor rating I would. I can't imagine anyone making a concept so fundamentally dull as silviculture so utterly fascinating. He's honestly changed the way I look at the world. I can't help but drive down the street and notice, \"oh, early successional species have persevered here due to edge effect\" and things like that. There is a lot of work for this course but it is four credits and the field trips can be demanding, especially as they are back loaded in the semester, although you are not expected to go on every one. Anyone with a land conservation interest and a non-foresty background should take this course."

I'm less interested in the NE, and we spend a lot of time obviously in the field learning these ecosystems. But I do appreciate that Professor Ashton talks about ecosystems around the world during lectures, and all sorts of models of silviculture, from community-based forestry to industrial. I think he does a great job of being representative of the array of silvicultural methods without giving preference to more traditional forms. Really appreciate him, overall--Ashton's the best part of the course!",

Field trips- Professor Ashton is a great tour guide and the material fit nicely with what we were learning in class.3. Being forced to turn in a rough draft of the paper before spring break- I know it is like pulling teeth, but it is very helpful.",

    "There is no professor like Mark Ashton. His enthusiasm and dedication are astounding. He is completely committed to the education of his students. He's got a fantastic sense of humor with which he infuses his lectures. His availability for appointments is so huge, I wonder when he gets his own work done!",

    "Not only was there a sense of historic continuity that made 8 am feel less bad, but the professor's enthusiasm also made this course great. His sense of humor helped me grasp concepts better. The course material was great, and having the powerpoints helped me focus for the exams. Field trips, though potentially 1-2 too many, were useful in helping us visualize the concepts we discussed in class. I also enjoyed the direction given to us for the final paper.",
    "The instructor is very responsive to the students questions.",
    "Mark is the life of this course. His excitement and humor were energizing in the early hours of the morning. His breadth of knowledge enabled him to skillfully balance discussion of tropical and temperate forests. The time and energy he spent organizing our field trips ensured that this will be the course we all look back on with the fondest memories of our time at FES.",
    "Its an introduction and is essential if you are interested in the field of Forestry. The field trips were immensely helpful in understanding the concepts.",
    "The field trips were fantastic. It may look like a huge time commitment at the start of the semester, but the outings are so enjoyable--such a great investment of time for the learning that happens, a great way to step out of the classroom and out of New Haven, a great opportunity to get to know your classmates and professor. Mark is really dynamic--in the field and in the classroom. He makes an effort to learn everyone's names and to figure out what your interests are, what makes you tick, how to poke a little playful fun. All of this really builds the class into a shared group experience, in which you get to know one another and him. I really enjoyed going to class (even at 8am!) and felt sad when the semester was over.",

Perhaps I already came in with a science background and so the basic concepts were easier for me to follow, yet I believe that this would be an enjoyable and great class from any background. Understanding of stand dynamics and a background on northern forest systems and their species is highly advisable but not key to getting the best from this class.",
    "The balance between academic study and field study. We learned the material, and then saw it's application to gain a deeper understanding.",

(carbon, ecosystem services, how inventory is conducted, etc.) For that matter, it might be nice for one of the field trips to talk to a working forester to ask about what they do on a day-to-day basis and to hear them use the silvicultural concepts we learned in class applied to \"the real world.\" It might also be interesting to have a couple of case studies or articles about each lecture topic listed at the end of that lecture so that we as neophytes can understand in what contexts the concepts are used.",
    "The instructor spends a lot of time per one slide.",
    "This course is impeccably well designed, so it is difficult to come up with any constructive feedback. My only concern is that over the course of the semester as students got more comfortable with Mark, they started asking more and more questions during lecture to the point of becoming obnoxious. I don\u0092t want to discourage people from asking questions, but towards the end I absolutely couldn\u0092t concentrate because all the questions kept breaking up the flow of the lecture and my own thought process in following it.",

This makes the assessments ever more valuable than when professors simply hand tests back with a grade on them.2. Tom did an excellent job as a TA.

The only recommendation I would have is to try to keep answers to student questions in those study sessions much briefer; many students became afraid to ask questions because they didn't want to take up time from other students due to long responses. For the instructor, the only suggestion I have (though this improved during the semester) is to look up more frequently; hands raised for questions often went a long time without being noticed (or were put down).",

    "Although there is not a lot of emphasis put on the readings, they can be very helpful. It is a little overwhelming, but don't be afraid to use them.",
    "1. Go to all the field trips- especially the Quabbin2. don't take too many notes- it is way more valuable to listen well and share the note taking with friends3. talk with the TAs- they know the material really well4. learn your tree species of new england and sri lanka ahead of time. shorea- especially key, as are dipterocarps in general",
    "Go for the field trips and attend the tutorial sections. It helps fill in the gaps.",
    "The book, The Practice of Silviculture, is superb. But if you don't manage to read much of it, don't worry, you'll get everything you need from lectures and from reviewing the old exams.",
    "Take this course. Pay attention. Go on the field trips. You won't regret it.",
    "This course is broadly useful to anyone whose career might involve trees in any manner.",
    "Take it. Take it your first year. The information is important, the field trips are a great way to bond with your classmates, and it is important to get to know this material and the professor who teaches it. It's a lot of fun, and (partly as a result) you will learn a lot.",
    "Prepare the paper as early as possible.",
    "Wake up early and go to silviculture breakfast. Don\u0092t set your alarm every Wednesday and wind up sleeping in. Go! Its fun! Its tasty! Its an FES tradition! And Ben makes the best buckwheat pancakes.",
    "Very helpful for people involved in forest as well as conservation. However be prepared for hectic end of the semester field trips.",
    "GO TO CLASS. and go on as many field trips as you can.",
    "Do the reading to get the most out of it",
    "Enjoy it! And start getting accostumed to brew early morning coffee if you are not a morning person.",
    "Get together with a study group for the exams. There's a lot of material covered and it helps!"
