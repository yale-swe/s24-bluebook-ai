   "comments": [
    "Bio-Inorganic is a very interesting course if you are interested in metals in biology. However, if a student is not so interested at how the metals work in the body, then don't take the course. However, considering that the course also covered some methods not previously discussed in other classes, the course is a good class to take to ensure that all types of chemistry are at least studied in preparation for further advancement.",
    "Take it.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student because important connections are made between subjects& different topics are put together to teach the most important aspects of bioinorganic chemistry.",
    "Yes, definitely. It was a great both general overview of how to think about bioinorganic chemistry while giving enough specific examples to reveal what is interesting and new about the science. Overall, it was a great class.",
    "I think the class was taught well but the material covered didn't really interest me. Would probably recommend it still... If Anne were teaching it again!",
    "Strongly recommended if you're interested in the interdisplinary field.",
    "I would recommend it, simply because I felt like I learned a lot in the course.",
    "Course gives a good look at the way that inorganic chemistry impacts biology. Highly recommend",
    "Yes I would recomend this course. The most obvious reason is that it broadens one's uinderstanding of how biological systems function and demostrates that metals play a large role in that. More relevant however might be the appreciation one may get from the difficult reactions that can be found in nature but we have yet to replicate. This latter point may serve as a point of inspiration.",
    "Chem 554 is a very good survey course. Take it if you are interested in learning about general topics in bioinorganic chemistry. The course provides great tools for reading papers and teaching yourself more about specific subjects. Don't expect an easy course, however, and don't expect to learn very in depth information about the systems studied.",
    "I would highly recommend this class. Ann does a great job teaching the material. The course isn't too difficult and is pretty interesting",
    "Techniques and common enzymes with metal centers."

   "comments": [
    "While this does not apply to my research, it did teach me more about how to look at papers and evaluate work.",
    "Learned a lot about bioinorganic. Hopefully I don't have to use it because I didn't find the topics particularly entertaining. :-\\",
    "It gave me an overall picture of this field.",
    "Before I knew nothing about Bioinorganic Chemistry. Now I know things - there was much knowledge deepening.",
    "I took this course because the courses I needed for my discipline was not offered this year, however, I still learned quite a bit about my own field and I think I benefited from thinking about scientific problems in a way that is different from how my field does so.",
    "Gives the student a better understanding of the inorganic chemistry biological processes",
    "In my case this course will better help me to understand other's research than assist in my own. At most biomimics could be interesting but I do not know to what extent my research caree will go in that direction.",
    "This course was very good for gaining a general understanding of bioinorganic chemistry and the techniques required for learning more about various systems. It prepared me for future study of literature on a number of subjects in chemistry.",
    "Apply my chemistry background to biological systems",
    "Didn't really help me in my field - but that's because I like organic chemistry."
