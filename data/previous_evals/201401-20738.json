   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this class to someone who really wanted to improve on their grammar. The homework consists of a lot of exercises and can seem like a lot, but in the end it's all very helpful.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student who wanted to practice their grammar before moving on to the more literature based L5 classes. I wouldn't recommend it to someone who wants to improve their writing or conversation skills, but more for a non-native speaker looking to fix their little grammar issues.",
    "Yes. It is a lot of work, but it's worth learning the grammatical material.",
    "While there's a lot of daily work for each class, it's well-taught and I did end up learning a lot. I took AP Spanish language junior year in high school and this class as a sophomore; although my Spanish was pretty rusty, I could still keep up. Solid course.",
    "Yes,I would recommend it if you are looking to really improve your Spanish grammar skills. If you're looking to improve your conversation skills, this is probably not the class for you though still feel like mine improved somewhat.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. It is a great way to brush up on grammar. It was a lot of homework and the tests were difficult but it was fun. Take it with Professor Valle!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student trying to improve his\/her spanish because it definitely does provide a really strong base in the language. DO NOT FALL BEHIND and do the homework. In some regards it is kinda similar to a high school class because you have daily homework, but it's great!",
    "This class is perfect for anyone looking to fulfill their language requirement in a fun and engaging way. Professor Valle is awesome, and class is low-stress (not a huge oral component) and usually entertaining. There's homework due every day, but it's not an insane workload. As long as you've taken AP Spanish or the equivalent, go for it!",
    "This course is good for someone with AP Spanish background. It's great overview of all important aspects of Spanish grammar.",
    "This class was a lot of grammar exercises and a few readings. If you're fine doing busy work, then this class is good for you. However if you are not good at doing daily assignments, then don't take this class as every assignment was handed in.",
    "A very rewarding class, if meticulous and time-consuming grammar exercises are for you. The class is very well taught and is quite comprehensive - the progress you'll make in your grammar will be tangible since you'll be doing SO much work for the class, but never TOO much that it's cumbersome. Everything in moderation, but a topic will be thoroughly drilled before a new topic is introduced. If you're placed into L5 and like me, are wary about your Spanish skills and would rather spend a semester building skills than applying knowledge \/ writing papers, take this class. You'll be happy you did.",
    "The perfect class for someone looking to refresh their Spanish after high school classes. As a non-literature class, SPAN 242 is probably one of the easiest L5 classes in the department, due to the lack of intensive readings. That being said, the course provided an exhaustive review of the trickiest elements of Spanish grammar, and the detail-oriented nature of the class proved difficult at times. Though the class is non-conversational, there was a good amount of in-class time for practicing speaking, and enough out-of-class writing assignments to practice writing too. Prof. Valle was amazing and enjoyable to be around; she made waking up early for class a little more bearable. I'm definitely glad to have taken this class!",
    "Excellent, but tough, course on Spanish grammar. I now feel so much more comfortable writing in Spanish."
