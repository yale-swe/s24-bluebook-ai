    "This is a very interesting class:One one hand you will learn so many amazing facts about immunology from some of the most famous names in the field that Yale could find. It is an opportunity unlike any other and has been one of the greatest bio classes I have ever taken.The workload is also very easy, 4 1 page PSETs that take ~20 mins each, and then a midterm and final.However, the sheer volume of material we are expected to know is quite terrifying, especially during the 2nd half where the course loses a lot of the coherency between lectures the 1st half had.However, I would greatly recommend this class to anyone interested. This opportunity will never come up again.",
    "This is a great course if you want to go to Medical School for sure.",
    "Pretty sick class (ha). You learn immunology from the people who have defined the field in the past and continue to define it. Ruslan, David, Sue, and Akiko are all incredible lecturers.It can seem scattered at times because you get a new lecturer pretty much every week, so you have to do some reading\/Wikipedia-ing outside of class if you want to put everything in context.I would have expected this class to focus on the big concepts of immunology because it is an intro class, but the presence of grad students and grad-school-bound students in the class made the memorization of hundreds of letter\/number-named molecules\/cells necessary apparently (rough final exam...). Pretty tedious and unimportant to a student not focusing exclusively on immunology, but the big concepts that you do learn are really cool.",
    "Great class on the immune system. Intended for upper level students, NOT an easy class to take for \"fun\"",
    "A good overview of the function and development of the immune system. Each section is taught by a professor who does research in that field\/made the relevant discoveries. I would recommend this to any bio\/pre-med students interested in the immune system, diseases, or really anything related to human health.",
    "I never really got to learn about immunology in high school, so I thought this would be a great chance to learn more about it. I think immunology is simply fascinating, and the professors who give the lectures are also amazing. They know how to present the basic concepts and also give you a taste of what's at the forefront of the field.Structure-wise, the class has one midterm and final and a few homework assignments. Nothing major. There is a lot of memorization involved though...booo.",
    "Definitely take this course! It is a lot of information and MWF 9:25 KBT objectively sucks, but it is so worth it. You leave the course having such a great grasp on the immune system. This is a wonderful overview course that really leaves you with a sense of knowledge and accomplishment. So many of the lecturers are great and you get access to so many of Yale's wonderful professors in a way that you don't get in a lot of other courses. Plus, the body is just SO INCREDIBLY AMAZING and you get to learn about how cool it is and all of the smart ways it has figured out to defend against pathogens. Also, the workload honestly isn't bad, just a midterm and final to study for and only 4 psets.",
    "Immunobiology is a tremendous course, perhaps the best biology course I have taken at Yale. It is a very beautiful subject taught by the most capable of instructors. This class has inspired me to potentially pursue immunobiology in graduate school. While there is a tremendous amount of material, it is mostly straightforward to understand. The workload is light, but the exams, especially the final, were a bit difficult, simply given the large body of material covered.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. Seriously. You get to interact with some of the best immunologists in the world. Everybody who teaches this class is at the top of their field, and yet still retains an awesome attitude towards teaching. I honestly cannot stop talking about this class; I've literally recommended it to every single person I know. There's definitely a lot of rote memorization involved, which can be difficult because the nomenclature of immunology is an absolute mess - but it's totally worth it.",
    "YES TAKE IT. Best bio class I've taken at Yale. All the lecturers are outstanding, and the material is super interesting.",
    "The course doesn't have too much work during the semester, but the midterm and final are very challenging. There is a very very large amount of material full of strange names and material, so be prepared for long study sessions. Also be careful that you accurately assess how well you did on the midterm because they are not returned until after the drop date.",
    "This class is a fair amount of work. Lots of memorization. That being said, it is a great introduction to the immune system.",
    "The field of immunology is evolving at such a rapid pace, and Yale is at the forefront of this research, so this course allowed me to learn about this fascinating topic in biology from some of the world's leading experts in the field. It was great! I also really loved how the lectures were recorded so that I could watch the ones that I missed, or re-watch sections of lectures that I was confused about. I thought that the workload (only 4 problem sets) and the midterm exam were fair, but the final exam felt unfair because it asked extremely detailed questions about many minuscule details that were barely mentioned in lectures.",
    "I'd recommend this to any one who wants to learn a ton about immunology in a well-controled environment. The class is difficult for sure but the material is straightforward--there is just a lot of it. As a result you'll have to work hard but your efforts will be rewarded I think.",
    "One of the best bio lectures at Yale, strongly recommend!",
    "Tons of material. Put in the steady work and leave multiple days to study for the midterm, even more for the final. If you put in the work, you'll enjoy it.",
    "The professors that teach this course are all phenomenal! Definitely take it if you are looking for an upper-level MCDB course."
