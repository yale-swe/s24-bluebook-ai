   "comments": [
    "Definitely take this class if you are interested in energy. It will provide you with a relatively in-depth understanding of key topics and issues in the sector. Also, this class is what you make of it. If you do all the readings, pay attention in class and go to office hours, you will get so much more out of it than if you just show up to seminar once a week. Definitely take advantage of Prof. Kessides and his knowledge\/experience - he is really nice and open to questions and comments.",
    "You have to take this Econ seminar if you're looking for zero work but still getting a good overview about energy issues. Kisses is an unreal professor, work is actually zero, its unreal.",
    "I would certainly recommend it. It is a relatively easy in terms of workload, but if you attend the lectures there is a lot to be learned.",
    "This is a really great survey course of energy issues, considering economic, regulatory and scientific issues. You'll learn about a variety of different energy technologies and the challenge facing society due to the energy crisis. It's not at all a seminar, but that actually works well because you really feel like you learn a lot and there's just a lot of technical things to go through that I don't think a discussion would be very helpful. The workload is manageable and the readings are interesting (there's often a lot of reading, but you can get by without doing it all). It's a very useful class if you have any interest in international development, energy or environmental policy.",
    "I thought the class was great. If you want to learn about energy, this class provides a lot of the basics and does so well. Professor Kessides is really nice and helpful, and is very knowledgable in the field.",
    "Take this class if you are an Econ major - and try to take the class if you can get into it!",
    "Do not take this unless you are a) good in the morning and b) dont already know a lot about climate change.",
    "An extremely relevant course, it provides an overview of our current problems\/solutions. This was more of a lecture than discussion with two papers (5 pg and 20-25 pg). Professor Kessides is very knowledgeable and helpful.",
    "Good class without a ton of work and teaches a bunch if you can pay attention but it is often hard to keep focus as the lectures get a little dry",
    "This class really gave me an excellent introduction to the different energy sources, and current obstacles to achieving large-scale production of each renewable source. I feel like I can now engage in intelligent conversations about energy topics, which is what I was hoping to get out of the class. All the readings were on the point and interesting."
