    "if you want to learn culture, yes. if you want to improve chinese, no. if you can't speak well, take a different class for improvement.",
    "Take this class! You'll learn a lot about Chinese literature, history and life. Su Wei is both knowledgeable and personable. Incredibly interesting and meaningful - I didn't find any lesson boring. Homework is super manageable but there is space for you to push yourself in terms of essay writing. Not many chances to speak up in classbut you can practice with the TA is you're keen on developing your conversational skills.",
    "Probably the best L-5 Chinese class around. A must take!",
    "Chinese 158 is a great class for anyone interested in gaining an exposure to true Chinese literature. As a non-heritage student, I can say with absolute confidence that anyone who has reached Level 5, heritage or non, can succeed in this class. Su Laoshi is a fantastic lecturer, and his knowledge of Chinese history, literature, and politics, combined with his intimate experience in those worlds, always made for interesting stories and class discussions.",
    "Overall I believe this course is quite underrated and I would actually highly recommend it to advanced Chinese learners who are interested in China's culture and society and who are able to be self-motivated learners. Unlike previous integrated Chinese courses like CHNS 151 and CHNS 154 that focus more on the mechanics of language like vocab and grammar over content, this course truly places the content of the literature we read front and center. What might be called the weakness of this approach may be: there is less hand-holding and guidance in covering the vocab and grammar than in the previous courses. But I believe that so much is gained through this tradeoff: class time is freed to focus on gaining a much more sophisticated understanding of the texts we read and of their social and cultural context. We were really challenged to \"taste Chinese\"- in reflecting upon and writing about the texts in a much more deep way than I have ever done previously in another Chinese course. Study the vocab on your own and work with the TA on any grammer confusion and you should do just fine on the exams."
