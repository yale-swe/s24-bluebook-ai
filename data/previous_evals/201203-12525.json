   "comments": [
    "Film 312a (Theory of Media) is a brilliant course covering a wide range of critical theory of the 20th and early 21st century. As we have ventured into a \"mass media\" world, it has become possible to discuss all forms of critical theory via media. Basically, this felt like a course that could provide the groundwork for an entire career in academic studies - not simply of film, TV, or the Internet, but literally anything that exists in this postmodern world.A MUST for Film Studies majors, a strong and engaging contrast for sciences-majors, and very interesting to anyone else.",
    "I would highly recommend this course. The subject itself is very interesting to discuss in sections and you, generally, won't get bored with the reading.",
    "If you like both theory and media, yes. If you only like media, definitely not. This class goes into extremely complicated readings (think French\/Italian intellectuals) and not a communications-based approach to media, if that's what you think the class is about.",
    "Theory of Media is a really interesting class. Would definitely recommend if you have an interest in media or philosophy because a lot about theorists and philosophers is discussed.",
    "If you're looking for an \"easy, fun fifth class\", look elsewhere. Between weekly reading responses and the sub-par lectures, on top of the two papers AND final, it really isn't worth it.",
    "Only if you are truly interested in the material. Definitely not a gut class based on the grading and the challenging readings.",
    "Oh God... This class.... I know it looks easy and a lightwork load, but trust me, it's frustrating when the Prof can't speak English well and yourTAs are cocky and condescending.",
    "You will gain new insight as to how media works and shape the world we live in, and that we might well be mere puppets of those in power. Though classes (and readings) can be rather dry at times, it is a class worth taking if you are interested in media.",
    "Definitely take the course. The papers are not too difficult, and the teaching fellows do an excellent job of helping you understand the readings. The course did not have anything to do with my major but I am certainly glad that I took it.",
    "Yes, I think that this would be a good intro theory course for anyone who is wondering if he or she would like to take more theory-based courses in the future.",
    "Take this if you are actually interested in the theorist covered. There isn't as much application to modern media as I had hoped so make sure you are interested in the readings. Casetti is a cool professor, but can be really hard to follow so be ready to not understand parts of lectures.",
    "Don't take the class because it gets boring.",
    "No. I did not really enjoy this class even tho Casetti is cool. I took this class because I was more interested in media, but the theoretical portion was so heavy and abstract that it made me lose interest. Many of the readings, in my opinion, had very little relevance to current media and I don't feel like I will use anything I learned in this class in the future. Maybe take it cred\/D if you absolutely need anothercourse.",
    "TAs are hard but ended up being easy, surprisingly a lot of work but would take it CR\/D",
    "It's a lot of theory, which I didn't enjoy. if you think you're interested in media in general, think of whether or not you like theory... it's very different",
    "Really interesting intro to media studies! Take it!",
    "This is an interesting look into the different ways that we can view media and the ways society has been shaped by it. I would recommend it if you are seeking to be a film studies major, otherwise it might be a bit boring.",
    "It was ok, there are far more interesting classes to take as your gut or humanities credit if that's what you're looking for. I was looking to branch out from my major, but the material wasn't quite what I was expecting.",
    "This is not a necessarily a gut course due the subjectivity of the material. It depends on the TA you have.",
    "Too abstract for me, but this isn't my field of interest. For artsy types, this could be useful. It was interesting at times for me nevertheless.",
    "Yes, makes you think in a different way",
    "This course is a good introduction to media studies from a variety of perspectives from technology to cinema. I would recommend this to film studies students for sure, but also to anyone with an iPhone or an email account (in other words, this class is relevant to everyone because we're all interacting with media on a daily basis).",
    "It is a very general view on media theory.",
    "Really interesting -- learning about how people communicate, who they communicate with and why, and how this has changed over time. How we interpret images, how advertising works, how media changes our perceptions of reality. Casetti is crazy and an engaging lecturer. Not very much work at all. Take this.",
    "If you're a film studies major, you have to take it, and its not that bad! Just do the readings, because they're important in the canon and they can always be applied to other film classes. Unless you're a film major, I can't really see why you would want to take this class. There are easier, more accessible and interesting classes out there.",
    "ALthough it's a compulsory course, Theory of Media is still fun, especially with the jolly Italian Prof. Casetti. Be patient with his accent and you'll find his summary very clear and helpful. Still, it really depends on whether THEORY is your cup of tea or not. Yet another fun part of this course is you can apply the theories to actual examples. During the course of testing them out, you'll have the chance to carefully think them through and reach a state of deep and thorough understanding.",
    "DO NOT TAKE THIS COURSE. It is very theoretical (despite popular belief) and everyone that took it said it was a mistake. Professor Casetti is very hard to understand and you will NOT get anything out of attending the lectures.",
    "I would recommend this course to students who enjoy reading theory. Be prepared for reading material that is not contemporary, but sections usually focus on relating the material to modern technology and topics.",
    "Yes very good survey class not too much work and fun",
    "Do not take this class - one of my least favorites at Yale",
    "This class is not one about movies and television and newspapers in the way you'd expect. This is a theory class about how EVERYTHING in life can be considered media through very heavy reading from Marxist philosophers."
