   "comments": [
    "I learned about cross cultural perspectives on child care, the evolutionary basis for practices, and how to analyze the reasons for and impacts of such practices.",
    "This class helped me think about the diversity of childrearing around the world",
    "Interesting perspective on child development and helped students in reading and writing scientific anthropology articles.",
    "I gained knowledge of childrearing across cultures from various perspectives: including but not limited to breastfeeding, co-sleeping, division of parental labor, alloparental care, discipline, and neglect. There was some sociocultural emphasis, but a lot of what we learned also had to do with the evolutionary biology perspective, asking us to constantly question why we raise our children the way that we do today. This knowledge was solidified through many case studies of modern day hunter-gatherers. We were also able to synthesize these insights with modern medical practices. The biggest insight I took away from this course was an appreciation for how people across the world do things differently than us. Is there such a thing as the absolute best way to raise a child? Not necessarily. People in different circumstances do things that best fit their situationand we should appreciate those differences as opposed to chastising them for it."

   "comments": [
    "This course was really interesting and I enjoyed it. That being said it felt fairly disorganized and we were only informed of deadlines and guidelines for assignments on a short notice basis. The group project was a cool way for us to explore in more depth the practices we had been discussing but it would have been helpful to have a little more guidance.",
    "The readings were exceptional, though there were too many. Often, students just skimmed in order to extract a question \/ comment to include in their reading response but did not read all the essays. So, would be improved by including fewer readings and instead, encouraging students to read them all thoroughly. Probably the greatest strength was that the class got along well and we had a good dynamic. Also, gave students exposure to topics in ethnopediatrics, which is not easy to get on Yale's campus. Also, a big weakness I felt was the group project. Some people in our group were taking the class credit\/D whereas others were receiving a grade. This meant that work was very inequitably distributed and it was not a good group dynamic. I would recommend re-thinking this research project, or grouping students taking the class for a grade together vs. credit\/d. Also, the assignments were not adequately explained with enough time before they were due \/ expectations were not clear. Would really appreciate a grading rubric. And, we did not know about the PowerPoint group presentation with enough time before it was supposed to occur. Did really appreciate the teaching & in-class dynamic though! And, thought that students leading the class activities was awesome! Though, there were too many \"think back to your own childhood....\" activities that weren't very educational. Would prefer more learning about other cultures \/ close engagement with the readings. Also, it's reading period and we still have not received midterm grades which is unacceptable. Should have more prompt feedback!!",
    "I feel that the topics presented within this course are truly interesting and engaging, and I am glad that we got to survey them. However, I feel that the readings presented were repetitive, an aspect which took away from the experience of this class.",
    "I really liked the idea of having student-led discussions and activities, but sometimes the activities seemed a little childish and I wasn't always completely sure what we were getting out of them on an intellectual level. The discussions were interesting, but we often ran out of time before we got to the questions we ourselves had posed, and I would have liked to see a little more time spent on those. The group project was also incredibly frustrating. Two students in our group contributed significantly less than the other two students, and it was very difficult to get some of the students to do much work at all in a timely manner. It would have been VERY helpful to do peer evaluations at the end of the project to gauge how much everyone contributed, because it certainly was not an even distribution of work.",
    "The biggest strength of this course is the instructors. Melanie and Claudia are incredibly knowledgeable, and genuinely care about the success of all of their students. Starting off every class with a meditation ensures that people are in the right headspace to participate in conversation. The structure of each seminarmini-lecture, student activity, discussionwas set up to display technical knowledge from the professors, while also allowing students to discuss things that were interesting to them. The final group projectwhile honestly annoying and difficult to designwas good way of learning skills related to actual research. In regards to improving the course, I would say that there are too many readings each week to the point where we often dont even discuss all of them. Eliminating the breath and going more into the depth of each reading might be advantageous."

    "This class is awesome & pretty easy if you're really interested in the topic -- comparative child-rearing practices now & in history. Definitely, we had a great class dynamic and the professors are awesome. Downsides though ---- group project is really challenging if some people are taking class for a grade and others credit\/d, really long time before you receive feedback on assignments, lots of group activities where you reflect back on your own childhood but don't really learn new content, which definitely is fun, but not very educational. So, overall, not very hard, though there was a lot of reading every week. Would recommend, but if you're the kind of person who likes group projects and doesn't mind not having tons of structure with the assignments. Awesome, approachable professors for sure.",
    "Yes, it helped me get out of my us centric view of child rearing practices",
    "I would recommend this course to another student, but I have liked other classes taught by Professor Valeggia more than this one, so if your objective is just to take a class with her, I wouldn't recommend this one. The concepts are interesting, but the readings are not particularly engaging and the group project can be really frustrating, although it is cool to do original research and work on something that could potentially be published.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another studentespecially one in the Education Studies program. So much of child psychology is taught through the lens of Western families and ignores variation that occurs in Asian, Latinx, Middle Eastern, and African areas. This course is essential for any educator or parent to break their preconceived notions.
