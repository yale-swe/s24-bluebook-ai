   "question_text": "What knowledge, skills, and insights did you develop by taking this course?",
   "comments": [
    "Learned entirely new ways of thinking about 19th century music, with a drastic shift from Roman Numeral analysis (in previous courses) to graphical analysis and geometric representation of keys\/chords in this course. I learned to think outside the confines of diatonicism. Loved the Brahms paper in which we had to argue whether a particular key relationship was 1\/4 or 5\/1.",
    "This class provided a phenomenally thorough and investigative perspective of case studies in music theory of the 19th century. I greatly improved my writing style and learned how to focus my thoughts. My tools of music analysis have also broadened to include useful techniques in graphing musical structures.",
    "This class started with Schubert songs and ended with Wagner. We learned different systems of music analysis (e.g. functional harmony, hexatonicism, octatonicism) and how these interact with one another. The discussion and papers required by this class forced me to hone my ability to articulate sometimes abstract ideas about music.",
    "Overall I think I learned how exactly the field of music theory operates--what it concentrates on, how music theoretic analysis works, what its purpose is. Music 210 and 211 sort of suggest this to you but taking 304 really reveals what the field of theory is. And it is one I enjoy - looking closely at music and thinking critically about what is on the page (and often forgoing consideration of all the other things your could talk about in the music, history, authorship, etc.). I think Cohn's approach, which is fairly accepting of all ideas and interpretations as long as you back them up, allows for the beauty in the music to shine through and doesn't lead us to get bogged down in technicality. The repertoire it focuses on is great and although I don't think I came out of it know that much about the broad strokes of 19th century music (it should be accompanied by music 352 for that) I will listen to the music differently from here on out.",
    "This course will forever change the way I listen to music. 304 is about more than just understanding the methods and habits of particular composers during a particular period... being exposed to Professor Cohn's approach to harmony and legendary body of academic work will change your entire perspective on music listening and the way you think about the \"core\" concepts from 210\/211. Rules are made to be broken and the romantic period finds a way to break all of them.",
    "Be not deceived by the title of this class, the focus is exclusively on methods of analysis and building conceptual frameworks. This is not a model composition class like the ones taught by Michael Friedman, the goal of this class is to look at and talk about a lot of challenging music that present analytical problems.",
    "A fantastic, intensive look at (primarily German) music from 1820-1890. Focus on neo-Remannian theory, taught by one of the foremost and most brilliant scholars of music theory out there today."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Great pacing of course material, from Chopin in beginning to Wagner near the end.",
    "This course is discussion based, so it is highly dependent on student participation and preparation (which, in the case of my class, was a good thing). Perhaps a slightly more structured approach could benefit those with less rigorous music theory backgrounds.",
    "The strengths are mostly listed above. It runs like a real seminar discussion which is great and a real testament to Cohn - that isn't always the case in music classes. The five short essays could have been spaced better. it really felt like I was drowning in this class for a while and then completely let up when we had months without essays. The presentations are always fine, but personally I would prefer to keep having Cohn run class and give us new material, though I understand why he wants us to engage with each other",
    "Strengths: -Very intimate seminar setting with lively discussion between some of the best undergrad musicians at Yale. I've never learned as much from my classmates as I did in this particular course. -Prof. Cohn is basically the leading harmonicist of our generation and the romantic period is one of his main areas of focus. Prepare to be wowed in a different way each class. -Design of the course is very purposeful and will help you improve your academic writing about music in a serious way. Lots of papers early on. Weaknesses: -Very few. It's not an easy course, especially if you're not a child music prodigy. But if you love theory, don't be deterred.",
    "This course is truly exceptional. It provides a very fresh set of perspectives on repertoire many of us are quite familiar with. It could be improved by shifting the focus of the repertoire to later in the 19th century, beginning perhaps with Schumann, having a midpoint at the late works of Wagner, and stretching to early expressionist works of Berg and Schoenberg.",
    "I think the current syllabus is well structured! I would appreciate extending the course slightly beyond the current temporal scope, and would have appreciated some more discussion of formal analysis (though I guess that's what Hepokowski's class is for...)."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Yes",
    "Please take this class, you will learn so much and Professor Cohn is incredibly knowledgable and understanding.",
    "Absolutely would recommend the class to any student who is interested in diving deep into some 19th century music while still getting a broad survey of compositional techniques.",
    "Music 304 was a wonderful experience. The class is discussion-based, and each class meeting focuses on a different piece of music (spanning, roughly, Schubert to Wagner). Grades are based on 5 short papers (about 750 words; the lowest grade is dropped), participation, and a final paper\/presentation. The workload was very fair and Professor Cohn was quite flexible. One small caveat: as a student who took the prereqs (Music 211 and 210), but no theory before Yale, I felt a little behind at times. Most of my peers had composing and\/or conducting experience, and they were overall much more comfortable with some of the basic theory concepts that I was (not that I didn't understand - just that it took me longer to see the \"obvious\" things, and discussion would have moved on by then).",
    "Yes. Obviously music majors will end up taking it which is great, but it is a rare class int he music department that can be really great for even those just a bit interested in music (though it does require a high level of previous knowledge).",
    "Absolutely. This is pretty much the holy grail of music theory courses. Professor Cohn's presentation of the material was consistently clear, well-structured, and fascinating. Consider Cr\/D if you're looking to take some of the pressure off!",
    "If you are interested in 19th century music, this course is a must! Professor Cohn teaches a fantastic course full of incredible music, and discussions are truly engaging.",
    "This is among the many must-take courses in the music department at Yale. The opportunity to dig into some really fascinating music with rigor and thoughtfulness under the supervision of a real master pedagog is not one to be missed.",
    "I would highly recommend it, if you're up for dealing with challenging music and tricky analytical methods! I wouldn't recommend it without really trusting your grounding in common-practice theory."
