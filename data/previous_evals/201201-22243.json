   "comments": [
    "This is a fascinating topic that relates to so much of our world, but you won't find taught in many places. The topic is relatively new, and this adds to the excitement of learning it. Just looking at pictures of fractals can be amazingly beautiful, and this class will help you understand where they come from and see them in new light. Complexity arises from simple rules. There are times in this class when it would be useful to have some familiarity with analysis, even though it is not a prerequisite.",
    "very interesting material, if you are interested in fractals, definitely take it",
    "This course needs to be revised. The concepts hang only loosely together, the difficulty varies unexpectedly from extremely easy to extremely tough, and we jump from one place to another. The text book is sketchy, unintelligible, ridden with typos, and the practice problems, if there are any, offer only limited help. Prof. Folsom was a good teacher, although I often had the impression that she wasn't really answering students' questions but simply repeated what she had said a few minutes before. But her instructions were generally clear. But all in all, don't take the course.",
    "If you want to learn about fractals in a more rigorous way, this is a great class for that. Folsom is great lecturer (so cute too!) and shows lots of pictures of pretty fractals before explaining the math behind it using everything from measure theory to chaos theory. Enjoyed my time in lecture and got a lot of the class.",
    "Great class. It's not as much work as most other math classes but it's definitely not a gut either. Definitely take it if you're interested in geometry and are majoring in some kind of math.",
    "This is good if you're looking for an easier, more computational course that counts for the math major. It's not the most interesting, but it is a cool synthesis of algebra, analysis and computation. Prof. Folsom is a good lecturer and will only get better the next time she teaches the course.",
    "This course was great! The course material is largely application based, but Prof. Folsom's lectures were often focused on the theory behind it, which definitely made the math more interesting to work through. I would certainly recommend this course to someone who really loves math!",
    "I would recommend it if you're interested in fractals from a theoretical mathematical perspective. The stuff you learn is not very practical, but it's fascinating to study. Take this class if you're prepared to learn some proofs\/or if you're a math major.",
    "I would definitely recommend Math 290! It was a really well-taught, interesting math class. I think it makes a great precursor to analysis, and it lays a foundation for how to write mathematical proofs. I enjoyed it a lot, and I would recommend it. Professor Folsom is also a great lecturer, and always available for questions. Even if I would email her, she would always respond promptly, and give me detailed answers to my questions. It's definitely not an easy math class, but it's worth it.",
    "Definitely recommended. Fractal geometry is really interesting, and this course provides a good introduction to it. Can be challenging at times, but it's very satisfying. If you want to learn about fractals, Yale is the place to do it.",
    "I heard that this class was relatively easy for the math department, but many people seemed to struggle this semester. Don't expect to ever use what you learn in this class, its not applicable to anything.",
    "The material's interesting, but at times it becomes a bit tedious. I think that any fractals class is going to struggle to reconcile the fact that fractals involves both sophisticated math (measure theory and so on) and rather simple stuff (linear transformations.) As a result, the material can go back and forth between being rather trivial and really sophisticated without much warning. The class did a good job of handling that, but it's an inherent problem. Additionally, the textbook had some flaws, mostly related to the fact that it's still being written.Professor Folsom does a good job. Her lectures are clear, her grading is fair and prompt, and she was always very helpful when I came to her with questions, either about the material or about taking tests late (when I had excused reasons to do so.)The bottom line is that it's one of the most conceptually simple classes that counts towards the math major, but it's also not incredibly satisfying.",
    "No. If Professor Folsom is teaching this course again, I would not recommend it. It is not because she is a poor teacher, but she does not specialize in fractal geometry and therefore, cannot give much insight or guidance outside what is written in the poor, half-written textbook. However, this course also has an unfulfilling quality of trying to teach us more theory than the prereqs really allow. We were taught some tools from measure theory in one day and while it is nice to attempt some rigor of the proofs in class, it is extremely unfulfilling as the majority of the class did not previously know measure theory and therefore, a poor foundation for the concepts was laid. You don't really gain any true understanding of the concepts taught in the class, just how to compute various dimensions of fractals...",
    "This class is one of the more interesting math classes at Yale, in my opinion. However, it seems that this is not Professor Folsom's area of expertise, and she does sometimes get confused about stuff. There's not much work (9 problem sets, and they take about 3 to 4 hrs each), and it's one of the easier math classes.",
    "Pretty cool class."
