    "Auctions and Bidding was a great, low-stress Economics seminar on a very interesting topic. We surveyed lots of basic topics in auction theory by reading and presenting papers. I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in that kind of thing and isn't terrified of derivatives and integrals.",
    "A fairly straightforward and low time-commitment seminar. I would highly recommend taking this course if you are at all interested in auction theory.",
    "Take this if you want a seminar that is less work and you can learn about some things related to auctions.",
    "Take it as a strong alternative to mathematical game theory, especially if you have interests in markets",
    "Auctions and Bidding is the type of class where what you get out of it depends heavily on what you put in. The class can be extremely math heavy or require no math knowledge at all. This is because the class is taught using actual papers with full mathematical proofs. Want to understand the proof? Be prepared to spend a lot of time reading math (although none of it is too complex for the most part). If thats not what you want, its also possible to get by focusing strictly on the overall results and conclusions. I recommend the former."
