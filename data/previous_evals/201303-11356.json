    "I think it's a really cool, unique way to fill a pre-1800 req for the English major, or if you're into really old literature (like, need-a-lexicon-to-translate literature), then this course is for you. I really loved all of the material, but it was definitely challenging and could drag a bit sometimes.",
    "Definitely recommended. Get your pre-1800 without feeling like you're fulfilling your pre-1800.",
    "It's somewhere between studying literature with a historical lens and studying history through a literary lens",
    "If you need a pre-1800 English credit or are just truly interested in medieval literature and later novels about medieval times, go for it. It is a normal English class and you will get out what you put in.",
    "It was a great course, well-organized, small, and very helpful. The chosen material is excellent and the two professors were extremely knowledgable on the subject. Great class! I took it only because I needed to fulfill my pre-1800 requirement, which I dreaded, but ended up enjoying every bit of the course."
