    "Good",
    "It was great to have extremely interesting speakers on a wide range of topics.",
    "Strong seminar. High level of speakers.",
    "This was an excellent seminar series and often my favorite class of the week. Having successful individuals come to speak about their career trajectory and their thoughts on the current healthcare system was inspiring and incredibly motivational. Often, I found myself remembering why I wanted to pursue a MPH in the first place.",
    "Hands down the best use of my time here so far.",
    "Strengths: Excellent speakers",
    "It's a good course to socialize and network. The only negative part is that it is on Thursday nights and a lot of SOM activities fall on that time slot. I would just like a better time than that.",
    "Great for HCM.",
    "fun to hear people talk about their career paths and current responsibilities",
    "One way to help integrate the HCM students into SOM would be to try to change the timing of this seminar so that it does not conflict with closing bell or SOM recruiting events. I'm not sure if there are any other times that would be feasible given the speaker's schedules, but just a thought. It might be nice to have some hands-on workshop style sessions.",
    "I enjoy hearing the experiences and stories of all of the speakers! They always have interesting viewpoints.",
    "Very inspiring speaker series to serve as an introduction for first-year students to learn about health care administration from different aspects. Astounding speakers.",
    "This course is fantastic and the quality of speakers that Howie invites is great.",
    "Very interesting to hear perspectives of different healthcare leaders in both the private and public sector. Extremely enlightening and valuable.",
    "Good!",
    "lovely way to learn more about people and how they got to where they are now."
