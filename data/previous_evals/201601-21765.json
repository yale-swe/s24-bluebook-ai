    "I would say that French 120 is basically just like French 110. You learn a couple of new tenses and more vocab, but the videos and the tests are pretty much the same, and the end of semester stuff (skit, final, etc.) is the same as well. I would recommend French 120 with Professor Vysosias to anyone who wants a more traditionally structured language course with an emphasis on grammar and vocabulary as opposed to casual full immersion (though it is still an immersion course).",
    "This class is a LOT of work but is definitely worth it. Yale's French program is stellar. It's harder than L1 because there's more grammar. You will definitely learn a lot and I can have a basic conversation in French easily.",
    "take it!"
