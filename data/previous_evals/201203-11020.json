    "Sure. I'll recommend it to a new student who want to do biology related researches.I learn some fundamental knowledge of biology. And I got a basic idea of how biological researches is conducted.",
    "This course was supposed to be a crash course in biology\/biochemistry where the students were exposed to various methods used in current research as well as current topics of research. I would not recommend this course though. It would be more beneficial for students to take an actual introductory biology course or biochemistry course.",
    "This course is a great overview of relevant topics in biology research at Yale; while it should not be expected to be a theoretical class in biology, it is very helpful as a tool discussing the leading edges of research interest and the fundamentals behind them. I would recommend this especially to students with little biology research experience."
