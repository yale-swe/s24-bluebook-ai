    "Take this class if you want to write a play! You may not totally get there if you're not willing to put in the time, but if you are, you'll find that you'll end up with a rough draft of a complete play, which is pretty sweet. Deb is WONDERFUL, warm and supportive and brilliant. You'll sit on the floor a lot and open up to your classmates. You'll read classmates' scenes aloud in class and chat about them in a gorgeously supportive way. It's a lot of fun!",
    "For getting you to write, and the experienceof working with Deb, I would certainly recommend this class. It's much more an open workshop than a detailed instructional course in the class of playwrighting, but if that's what you need at this point in your artistic life, it's indispensable.",
    "Yes, this is a fantastic class.Everyone will write this, so I'll just point out a two things you should be aware of. You actually have to want to write a play to get a lot out of this. If you don't actually want to write one, what should be a great experience will feel like a chore, and that's no good. Also, trust Deb and interact with her. She will respect you and help you in whatever way you need. She is really nice but she is also a serious person and a serious teacher and you should take her seriously (but also have fun).",
    "If you want to write a play and are willing to put in the time and effort to struggle through it this is a great course.",
    "Theater Studies 322 is a playwriting course. To be honest, there's not really a difference between introduction to playwriting and advanced playwriting. Both are aimed at providing you with the skills and critical eye needed to write a play. Deb is also great at helping you look into your own life from inspiration, and building outwards from that. Once the process gets going, it's really on you to write the thing -- the only deadlines are the murky \"half a play\" at the midterm and a final draft at the end of the semester. It's a phenomenal course and I'd recommend it to beginner and experienced playwrights alike -- you learn about yourself as well as about the craft.",
    "Take it. Even if you think you can't write, even if you think you hate theater. You will be the poorer if you graduate from Yale without taking this class. At the end, you will have gotten close with a group of great people, and you will have a play to show for it.",
    "It is a playwriting workshop that caters to the unique creative processes of each student. It was an incredible departure from the formal structure of other courses at Yale and a privilege to share four hours of each week with Deb."
