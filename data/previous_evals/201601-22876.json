   "comments": [
    "Physics graduate students are required to take this course. It is a standard treatment of electrodynamics at a more rigorous level.",
    "It is an important course to take for anybody working in physics or electrical engineering. It takes quite a lot of work and time to go through the problem sets. It is also good to come with a good background in vector calculus, as to not let the math get in the way of the physics too much.",
    "Its good to enhance your understanding of the topic, but not necessary since most of the materials were not different from the textbook.",
    "Be ready to spend a LOT of time on problem sets. The workload of this course was by far the largest. The problem sets in this course often took as much time to do as our other two courses' work added together. This would have been more acceptable if the P-sets had more engaging problems, but often they were just exercises in math, with very little physical insight (some problems were helpful, but most weren't).",
    "Overall a good course for learning E&M, albeit difficult. As long as you attend lectures and go to the TAs help session, you should be okay. Also, getting help from the professor one-on-one was helpful.",
    "I would tell them that I didn't feel I learned much on electromagnetism, but spent most of my time figuring out the gritty details in computations.",
    "Graduate E&M, it is what it is.",
    "It is a required class, so this question does not make sense.",
    "Jackson is dense and difficult, and this course will expose you to its full intensity. Problem sets are notoriously arduous and lengthy. There's some beautiful stuff going on at the core here, but be prepared put in a lot of effort to stay afloat. With some structural changes to lectures etc., the course itself could be more helpful to actually solving the problems, but as it stood this semester it felt like we were going at it on our own a bit. I recommend following along in Jackson in class, as there are so many equations to deal with at once. Good luck!",
    "This course is required for first-year graduate students in physics and applied physics. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone else unless they have a passionate interest in classical electrodynamics. For a student who was required to take it but whose primary interests lie in other fields, my experience was that it was very difficult and not very enlightening.",
    "This course simply followed section-by-section the non-relativistic chapters of Jackson's E&M textbook. Some of these topics are interesting, however our semester course was not taught very well. Hopefully, future versions of this course will be improved with either a different professor or a bit more feedback from current students.",
    "PHYS 502 is difficult, but I would recommend it, as I found the material challenging and interesting."

   "comments": [
    "I work in fields related very much to the topics in the course, so it is very relevant to my work and research.",
    "Well, we certainly learned Green's functions",
    "I know a lot more about green's functions now. The optics portion is relevant to my research. I'm glad we focused more on that towards the end.",
    "I do not feel that I know a significant amount more about E&M than I did before taking the course.",
    "It didn't. The amount of work necessary to be able to follow what's going on is so much that I'd rather just get a pass and learn what I actually need to know in lab. As I mentioned above, the focus of the class is such that I don't actually learn useful things for my research.",
    "This class is most likely the most important for my research \/ dissertation. I anticipate using these concepts in my research very frequently.",
    "It is a required course.",
    "There were a few relevant sections to my research (wave guides and optical fibers), however these topics were simply skimmed near the end of the course."
