   "comments": [
    "Well, if you took it last term you're still here. The same modules, but I found the second half alot easier. Definitely would recommend it as an easy, fun science credit. With cookies!",
    "An opportunity to look a little more closely at the scientific foundations behind some of the modern world's most important issues.",
    "I'm hesitant about this class. I was bored a lot of the time, frustrated by the work\/grades, and sometimes regretted taking the course. At the same time, I did learn a ridiculous amount of pretty important stuff, felt somewhat fulfilled by doing real science, and got a Sc credit! It was also a cool group to be a part of--I liked working with the same kids over the course of the year on science stuff.",
    "Take it! It is an awesome class and you'll never be able to take a class like this again.But definitely plan out your schedule wisely. It is an hour and a half long, so make sure to plan your Fridays with the least number of classes.",
    "An amazing course in which you get to learn about fascinating, cutting edge topics in science from incredible professors in a seminar setting. I would highly recommend this course to another student! You\u0092ll learn a lot, have a very manageable workload and be able to be directly involved in the course because of its small size. (Also, there are cookies, brownies, coffee, tea, etc. every class, which is a nice perk!)",
    "Just take it.",
    "I suggest paying close attention to the syllabus and reading up a bit about the scheduled modules. If you find most of them enjoyable, definitely take the class -- if not, you may want to try another class. Coffee, cookies, and soft drinks being delivered every class is a definite plus, though.",
    "If you're taking Sci030 already, you know what 031 is like. I would definitely suggest taking the second term, and the workload is reasonably light so you don't have to worry if it ends up pushing you from 4.5 to 5 credits,",
    "I enjoyed this class a lot. If you're truly interested in science topics in general, this is a fun and chill way to actually learn a lot of fascinating things. Not too much work, lots of good discussions and learning.",
    "Definitely! Light workload, very laidback learning environment, professor Kankel is really focussed on learning as opposed to grading. It's only once every 3 weeks when the workload gets tough (exams are usually open book so low pressure; assignments are for the most part super interesting), other than that just enjoy the lectures. And there's free coffee and cookies! Pizza for the last class too!",
    "Definitely.",
    "I whole heartedly recommend this course to both science and non science majors. It meets on Friday afternoon for an hour and a half and while this may seem inconvenient, I was always excited about going to class (and not only because Professor Kankel organizes coffee, tea and the most delicious brownies and cookies every week!). Class is really quite laid back and there is a good mix of lecture, conversation and discussion. There are 8 modulesof 3 weeks, each taught by prominent professors from a variety of departments. Some of my favorite topics were extrasolar planets, evolution, cosmology and genetic engineering. You're taught the major concepts for each of these topics without delving into complicated mathematics or challenging theory, thereby making it accesible for everyone while at the same time allowing for informed and interesting debates and discussions. For a non science major, the class provides insight and will give you more authority to join the conversation about current topics in science. For science majors, the course provides an opportunity to sample from different different fields of study, and to engage in conversations in a friendly setting. The work load is really much less than other classes, and you will thoroughly enjoy the experience of being in a class with only twenty people (for one, you actually know each other's names!). Take this class!",
    "SCIE031 is a great course for anyone interested in the latest science news and issues. Whether you're a math\/science major or a humanities major, this class wil be interesting to you. The course covers a variety of topics and gives you the depth to really understand the issues and innovations."
