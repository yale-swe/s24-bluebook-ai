   "comments": [
    "In this class, you will practice reading examples of Edo literature, organized by genre. There are many readings that help to ground students in Edo literary history, explaining the material history of the books themselves as well as the history of various genres, and the careers of important writers. Some practice with kuzushiji is also included.",
    "A course that will broaden one's knowledge of the Edo Period specifically, but in a more general sense the human project of literary and artistic production, the variety of aesthetic and social forces in play that give rise to a wide variety of works. Informative, entertaining, inspiring.I would absolutely recommend this class."

   "comments": [
    "I never felt comfortable with Edo literature before, but now I feel I can read Edo work with much less intimidation. It is helpful for any student of Japanese literature to have a strong background in Edo literature.",
    "The course provided much needed exposure to a period that will be important for me to understand. I feel like I have a solid understanding of the range of genres in play, the historical forces that spawned these genres, as well as individual works within each genres. I feel more confident reading kuzushiji, or Japanese calligraphy, and have the knowledge to use the necessary reference materials to complete the task. I feel confident now considering topics in the Edo period that may overlap with my future dissertation research."
