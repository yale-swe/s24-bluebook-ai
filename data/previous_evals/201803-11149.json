    "This course offered a historical, literary, and cultural introduction to the institution of French slavery (in the Caribbean basin and North America) and its representations and reworkings in Francophone literature spanning the late 19th, 20th, and 21st centuries. The course also treated questions of historical memory and monumentalization with respect to slavery.",
    "\"French Slavery\" is often not talked about, nor written about. The phrase his been hidden through years of revision and historical shame. This course pulls back that veil, and delves deep into the slave trade, and effect of slavery in French colonies and and lands."

   "comments": [
    "The course was well-paced and well-designed, combining introductory historical and theoretical materiels with aesthetic works (novels, poetry). My only suggestion would have been to explore in greater detail the relationship between the slavery and mimesis\/representation, since it seemed like this problematic (how to represent slavery in literature? what formal qualities does slavery require and\/or engender in the literary work?) lay at the heart of much of our discussion."
