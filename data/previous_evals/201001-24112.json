    "I would recommend using the colloquium as a chance to really start thinking and writing the senior essay early in the year. I would recommend that students do all their research in the first semester if possible and focus on writing during the second term. The colloquium actually had less of an impact than my choice of adviser for the senior essay.",
    "yes!",
    "DO AMST!!!! It is such a wonderful major. So much freedom.",
    "A year long paper is very hard but it is very rewarding. You'll have your ups and downs, but in the end it's nice to think you've accomplished something worthwhile. Just pick a topic that you're really excited about.",
    "It's a lot of work. But, definitely worth it if you are interested in going to grad school!",
    "A great help with the thesis-writing process, also not too time consuming. I don't think I'd change it, I loved meeting the other majors."
