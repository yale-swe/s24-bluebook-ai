   "comments": [
    "This is a really great course. I thought the syllabus was incredibly thoughtful and wonderfully inclusive of perspectives that are typically marginalized. The theme of the course was incredibly interesting and has definitely shaped the way I read literature going forward!",
    "The material in this course is fascinating and varied. Professor Campbell can be a bit frustrating in how often she talks relative to the students, but one can nonetheless learn a great deal from her.",
    "This is a very interesting survey course of 18th century literature, focusing on the motifs of consciousness and identity. The class covers a variety of genres - poetry, plays, novels, philosophy, critical writing - and uses this plethora of representations to map out a complex vision of shifting ideas about what it means to be \"human.\" Although English majors will have encountered some of the texts previously in 126, they gain a lot from rereading in a new, richer context.",
    "As its title suggests ENGL 242 traces the theme of consciousness through texts across various genres from the eighteenth century. I would recommend this course without hesitation to another student. The syllabus is fascinating, offering students access to texts to which they likely have had minimal if any previous exposure. Additionally, students have an opportunity to read narrative literature and philosophical treatises in conversation with each other. Prof. Campbell is a fantastic and heartfelt instructor, going out of her way to engage her students and make everyone feel welcome, heard, and valued in her classroom.",
    "A survey of 18th century British texts novels, poems, plays, treatises with a focus on representations and conceptions of consciousness. A worthwhile class if there are works on the syllabus that you want to spend time with."
