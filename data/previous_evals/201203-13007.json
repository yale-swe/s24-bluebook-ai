    "I would recommend this class to another student if it was being taught again during an election year. It was interesting to witness an election going on while you were learning about media techniques that candidates used to present themselves in the best possible light. The readings and screenings were relatively interesting, although the screenings became redundant after a while when they were largely focused on the recent few elections. You have a lot of freedom in terms of your midterm and final paper ideas, which is nice. The main complaint I have about the course is that the 2-hour seminar was boring at times.",
    "Taking this course in the midst of an election was a great asset, as you would have to wait four years from this review to experience the same, it might make you a bit less engaged in the topic materials. But this was a GREAT class. I would totally recommend that other students take this. The documentary screenings were mostly hilariously partisan, therefore entertaining.",
    "No.",
    "Do not take this class. I cannot believe my tuition helped pay the salary of a professor so thoroughly inept. He did not prepare for classes (no discussion prompts, plans of what media to show) and half of the weeks he spent 5 minutes trying to figure out how to hook his laptop up to the projector (even though he used it every week). The readings did nothing to elevate the level of conversation. It was the worst, most useless class I've ever taken. Stay away.",
    "This class was really good. Even though the class size was a bit larger than usual for a seminar, it was led seminar-style, so there was a lot of group discussion -- especially because the class was in an election year. I think this class will still have relevance even in non-election years as future students will be able to more accurately evaluate the effects of certain events etc. in the most recent election, whereas we were not able to with events so new and fresh. All in all, not too much work and an interesting class. Prof. Musser is awesome.",
    "If you are interested in the content, take the course! I learned a lot of interesting information that I definitely won't be able to forget in elections to come. Given the dynamic nature of the 2012 campaign, students had a lot of say in what direction we wanted the class to go in. If you prefer more structure and lecture-based classes then pass on this course.",
    "Survey of media influence on US Presidential elections since 1952.",
    "I wouldn't recommend it at this present time.",
    "Sadly, I would not recommend this class. With a title like this and during an election year, this class could have been AWESOME, we could have talked about media\/social media in the context of the elections and how it was affecting the election. Instead, we watched really bad documentaries and class discussions did not happen."
