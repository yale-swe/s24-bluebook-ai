    "Professor Morgan taught this class like a lecture instead of a seminar. We stopped doing the reading after the second week because we learned that he would just summarize it. If he ever teaches at Yale again (and I kind of hope he doesn't) he needs to actually lead a substantive discussion about what could be interesting material. This time the class was a 2-hour-long lecture that all of us quickly learned there was no reason to pay attention to.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to anybody interested in Jewish philosophy.",
    "This was a great class in which we got a chance to engage some really fantastic material. It's one of those classes that is what you make of it; if you push yourself do all the reading, you'll get a ton out of it. My only criticism of the class is that it could have been much more discussion based. Instead Prof. Morgan lectured for pretty much the whole time. Still, I enjoyed the class quite a bit and would definitely recommend it without hesitation to someone interested in the subject.",
    "What it sounds like. If you don't do the reading you won't get much out of it and lectures will be less interesting (Prof lectures the whole time though). Morgan's cool.",
    "Judaic Studies 281 was a discussion of Jewish Philosophy in the 20th century - how the events of the 20th century influenced the philosophy of Judaism. I would recommend this class to anyone with an interest in the philosophy behind Jewish beliefs and practices and how that philosophy is affected by world events.",
    "It was alright. I was frustrated that it was listed as a seminar, and yet was about 30 students, and primarily lectures by the prof. Disappointing, since I was expecting a seminar. Also, was much to much of a history class and very little actual philosophy being done.Students rarely spoke in class, and when they did it was always a question or comment to the prof. Never was there opportunity for students to engage in discussion together. Prof did not facilitate or encourage discussion, and thwarted it by his constant lecturing. Would be great for someone looking for a lecture disguised as a seminar!TON of reading assigned, and MANY books to buy. Not cool. and expensive. many of the paper topics rely on material from \"suggested\" readings, in the \"suggested\" books. (about 7 required books to buy and about 7 suggested books to buy. a lot).however, easy to get by doing less than all the assigned reading, if you read closely those selections for your paper topic, you can do okay only skimming the rest, or less.",
    "This class offered an excellent introduction to a collection of some of the key twentieth century Jewish thinkers. It was accessible to students without a strong Jewish studies background, although some of the intricacies may have been lost on students without sufficient knowledge beforehand. Professor Morgan was excellent - well-organized, responsive and impassioned - and I would heartily recommend taking this course if at some time he returns to teach it again.",
    "Yes.",
    "While most of Yale philosophy classes are of the analytic breed, this is a rare continental class - pulling on Hegel and Nietzsche (although you don't need any philosophy to take the class) it's a review of the major 20th century Jewish philosophers. For me, the post-Holocaust stuff was the most interesting and that's what we spent the least time on, which was unfortunate, but still... there's a lot of reading and ideas here to sink in to which are never covered in other philosophy classes.",
    "the class was basically a survey course of German and American Jewish thinkers from the 20th century, and if you are interested in the material I highly recommend it."
