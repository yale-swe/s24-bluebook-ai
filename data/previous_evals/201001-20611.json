   "comments": [
    "Spanish 912 is a course devoted to Borges and his effect on other authors, bothwithin and outside of the Spanish\/Latin American literary canon. I definitely recommend it to another student, and recommend that they read each story in great detail in order to take the most out of the course.",
    "This course consists of reading Borges' principal short stories (mostly from Ficciones) along with several major critical and philosophical works that relate to the stories. We also looked at the influence of Borges on other writers and philosophers. I would recommend this class because in order to study an author as complex as Borges it really is necessary to study with a professor brilliant enough to manage the content.",
    "If you have not read much of Borges, Spanish 912 will offer you an interesting initiation by encouraging you to consider Borges' literary legacy in a comparative context."

   "question_text": "How did this course deepen your knowledge of your discipline\/profession? To what extent did this course contribute to your dissertation\/research?",
   "comments": [
    "I hadn't read very many of Borges' stories\/essays before taking this course, which was a huge, gaping hole in my professional knowledge. This course helped me not only understand Borges better, but also to see some of the connections between many of the most influential Latin American writers of the 20th century.",
    "Borges is obviously an essential author to study. His writing not only affected 20th century writers posterior to Borges, but as we discussed in class, he also affects the way we consider writers that came before him. Thus he contributes to any line of research in literature.",
    "For the final paper research, the process of taking a canonical author and comparing him to someone contemporary who has not yet been canonized exposed me to one possible approach to literary research. I saw how it is possible to weave together a study of authors whose work already has a significant body of scholarship with a study of an author(s) with comparatively few critical articles.",
    "This course is a helpful preparation for the comprehensive exams, as many authors from the Contemporary Latin American list are read and discussed."
