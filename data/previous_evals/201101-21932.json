   "comments": [
    "I would certainly recommend this course. The concepts we covered are super applicable and important, historically, but most especially in terms of the world we live in today. Population growth is something we should all be learning and talking about more, and Professor Wyman is especially knowledgeable and enthusiastic about teaching it. There is room for improvement in terms of overall organization and structure, but both professors are incredibly kind and approachable and gifted teachers; it's almost worth it to take the class just for them.",
    "I'm not sure if I would recommend this course to someone... I suppose if you're interested in the relationships between monkeys, apes, chimps, and bonobos; abortion; various demographic theories; and random anecdotes from Professor Wyman I would recommend taking the course. Do not take it if you are interested from solely an environmental standpoint because not much material in this field was covered.",
    "This class is extremely interesting, and I learned a lot about a wide variety of topics, especially demographical tools, human evolutionary biology, and the problems the world faces today. Professors Drixler and Wyman were incrediblyknowledgeable and eager to share their knowledge with students."
