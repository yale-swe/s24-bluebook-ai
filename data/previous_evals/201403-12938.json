   "comments": [
    "I'd recommend this to a classmate who is interested enough in the subject (fairy tales, psychoanalysis, 19th century German literature movements) to be self-motivated.",
    "Gman 234 is an interesting mix of literature and child psychology. You will explore a lot of really cool things about fairytales and the culture and mentality of American and European society. I would recommend it if you have interest in the intersection of literature and psychology, and if you don't mind a slightly eccentric instructor. Professor Sussman is great though and really funny and enjoyable to take a class from. I would take another class taught by him for sure.",
    "This course was amazing. I loved the thematic and highly theoretical approach to the German Fairy tale and its many adaptations. I enjoyed the free reign we were allowed within the subject, encouraged by the very strong theoretical underpinnings we had thanks to Professor Sussman. Professor Sussman is a genuine person, caring, humane, passionate, and completely understanding of the many commitments of Yale students. His constant encouragement and enthusiasm uplifted me each time I went to class. I highly encourage students who are looking for a refreshing look at the humanities, and take a piece of that love for literature and the arts with them, to take this class.",
    "An incredibly easy class with little to no work and a lecture that you don't need to attenddefinitely a course that you can learn a lot from but you need to be willing to put in the work outside of class rather than relying on the lesson plans themselves.",
    "Begin with Brothers Grimm, go to Foreign Folktales, and then more heady theory. Sussman is a bit scatterbrained (sounds like a lot of hoopla) but if you can parse through the jargon and get at what he's talking about he says some pretty insightful things. Easy class. Lecture can get dry - don't have to come if you don't want to . Final projects low-strung, free-form, and fun.",
    "Take it if you want to learn about German culture in a bit of a different way and are not looking for very demanding lectures with a really nice professor who knows a ton.",
    "Yes. It is a very interesting course that allows us to discover the complexities of tales that we grew up reading.",
    "Absolutely. Take this course. Sussman is a legendary professor. You might get confused at some times, but as long as you realize its not about memorizing all the facts and more about the childhood sensibility and pure enjoyment of the course, you will have an amazing time. All the assessments allow you to put a creative bent on them and they do not feel like work. The reading is delight most of the time. There is something for everyone. The creative writers, the psychoanalysts, the folklorists, the cognitive scientists (we read Hofstaders, I am a strange loop), literature majors, german studies majors, scientists, people, investigators, explorers, fairy tale folk, lovers.",
    "I loved this course and would recommend it to anyone. It begins reading and categorizing German fairy tales, but moves on to theories of childhood and memory (we read Freud and Rousseau) and then adaptations of German, French, and Danish fairytales, both modern and contemporary (we read Kafka, watched Into the Woods). The course was a combination of straight literature, lit theory, philosophy and psychology. The interdisciplinary nature worked well following the passing of time but also the charting the expansion of these tales through popular and literary culture. There were 4 projects two major and two minor, half of which were creative, and all of which allowed the student to explore whatever aspect of the course was most compelling to him or her. Henry Sussman is incredibly kind and passionate about his work. It was a small lecture and he learned everyone's name and seemed genuinely thrilled by an and all contributions or discussions. This was his first year teaching it, so I think it will only get better and more streamlined. If you like fairy tales, folk tales, or children, definitely take it."
