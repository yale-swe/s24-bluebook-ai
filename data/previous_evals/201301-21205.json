   "comments": [
    "Would highly recommend the course. To be honest, I was hesitant about applying to the course and didn't apply last year because I thought it was going to be about military history and tactics. After speaking with the TF of the course, I decided to apply. The course does use historical examples that include military history, but the examples were appropriate and the readings assigned taught us just enough so we could think about leadership in general. I also really liked the readings because they taught me a lot about US history (that I already should have known but embarrassingly did not). The guest speakers were also great. It was obvious that a lot has gone into planning course.",
    "No questions asked- yes. Apply to this course, and if you get in, take it. You will learn more from this class than any textbook can ever teach you. You learn what skills are really needed in a leader, both from historical and contemporary examples. This class fortified my belief that leaders are not only made in the field, but also in the classroom.",
    "This class completely changed my worldview on and understanding of leadership while helping me to get to know many awesome peers. I can't say enough wonderful things about how it changed my life and world experience.",
    "Overall, this is a worthwhile course. It's not particularly rigorous, but a great opportunity to learn from an admirable person with significant life experience and true lessons to share about leadership.",
    "Yes I would recommend this course to other students from a variety of disciplines. In addition to the course focus on leadership,I learned a great deal about American and military history.",
    "This is pretty simple- if you are lucky enough to get in, you take it! It will change your idea of what a college course should (or can) be, and getting to learn from Stan, and from the other incredible students in the course, is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.",
    "I would summarize it as extremely valuable, somewhat challenging to accomplish the readings at times, but overall a rewarding experience. I would recommend that a student take this course if he\/she is willing to put in everything they have to it. If one doesn't put in the effort, I'm not sure they would take away much from the course other than the great instruction in the classroom. The corresponding readings and papers contribute to the overall effect - a healthy group dynamic results when everyone is contributing 100% effort each class.",
    "I would highly recommend INRL690 to any student, studying any field. The class focuses on developing theories, ideas, and practices to lead others. This is a must in any field.",
    "I would definitely recommend (and have done so) this class to others.",
    "I would whole-heartedly recommend this course. It is a survey in leadership course that aims to teach valuable leadership lessons and styles. It is seminar style, so the instructor leads the discussion, but he lets the students take it over. The class becomes very close, which allows for very honest and frank conversations. A lot of what you will learn actually comes from the experiences and insights of other students. The reading is very informative and insightful (and doing the readings is critical to succeeding in the class).",
    "Great course on leadership and what it means to be a leader in any context, whether it's military, business, or other. This course should be mandatory for every Yale student. People need to learn these things."
