    "Take this class if you want to do anything in the field of medicine\/biology\/physiology. It starts from the very basics and gives a very comprehensive overview of all the imaging modalities, how to use them and when to use them.",
    "I thought this class was useful for being exposed to current works at Yale in neuroimaging, but I felt we could have gone into more technical detail for it to be useful for me. A lot of this material could have been found in a review, but it was nice to hear it explained.",
    "This is a great course to get an in depth overview of neuroimaging and neuropsychiatric disease. I would definitely recommend it to others.",
    "I would summarize this course as a broad overview of some of the key imaging modalities used in psychiatric research. I would recommend this course because I feel that I learned a lot about imaging, a topic I knew little about prior to taking the course."
