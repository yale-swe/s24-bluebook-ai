   "comments": [
    "Good, interesting course that covers both computational and proof-based math. Prof. Lind (who unfortunately won't be teaching it next year) is genuinely more concerned with the beauty of the math and students learning than in grades and work, which is how it should be.",
    "The math behind the pretty pictures (though you do look at a lot of pretty pictures!) You'll also be introduced to some real and complex analysis, some topology, and a little measure theory. Good intro to proofs.",
    "A really interesting math course that combines a lot of advanced math. I would recommend this course to anyone that has a background in math and is interested in fractals, but be prepared to work hard to understand everything. Definitely worth it though.",
    "I would recommend this course as a fun and relatively easy math elective. It was not much work, but most of the course material was really interesting. Of course, you probably won't learn as much in this course as you would in other more intensive classes, and it's not really a useful course, but if you're at all interested in the topic, definitely take it!",
    "Math 290 is as close to a math survey course as you can get! Michael Frame was dead on when he saw fractals as a way to introduce students to the beauty of math. In the class you cover various aspects of fractals and how to analyze these pretty objects mathematically and precisely. In doing so, you see how all the different branches of math come together to help us understand fractals. I'm actually really excited to learn more pure math now!So all in all, if you're looking to learn serious math, this might not be the class for you. However, if you want to learn a fun subject and become acquainted with what math is all about, this is a great class to take!",
    "While still proof-based, this course is significantly easier and less rigorous that most of the Math department offerings. I would recommend it for those who are not sure if they want to take higher-level math courses; but not for those who have already taken a 300-level class.",
    "I would recommend Math 290 to someone who is looking for a fun, but not rigorous, upper level math course. The material covered is interesting and understandable even if you do not have a rigorous mathematical background. However the course lacked a coherent progression in topics and the textbook was unhelpful.",
    "Take this class. Professor Lind is super clear and very step-by-step. There\u0092s no way you could ever get lost. I came in with MATH222 being my last level of math and it was a great intro to proofs.",
    "It is ok. Would not recommend it unless you are interested in the materials.",
    "This was a good class. Prof. Lind isn't teaching it next year, and I don't know who will be, but the course was good. Very interesting material, perhaps one of the few courses in math where you get to learn modern math. I kind of wish we had covered more material, and I think that would have been more feasible had we had more regular psets, but the course, regardless, was incredibly effective and good at giving us a good introduction to fractals and multifractals and chaos ; as well as teaching us the basics of proof-based thinking.",
    "This class is fun and not very hard--for people who are into math, at least; I wouldn't recommend this version of Fractal Geo for students who are not as familiar with math or who aren't as good at math; take 190 instead, if that's you. Otherwise, this class is full of interesting material that sometimes overlaps with other classes in ways you wouldn't expect. It includes both mathematical and visual approaches to certain topics, which is part of what makes geometry so great. As far asmath classes go, this one is really interesting and significantly easier than most other 200+ level math classes. Professor Lind is fantastic, and it's a pity he isn't an official Yale professor.",
    "Cool stuff, off the beaten path, not difficult if you've done any serious math before",
    "It's a fun class that opens up your eyes."
