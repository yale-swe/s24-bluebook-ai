    "I love Britain, so I loved this class. Great classic Yale History lecture - no surprises here. Prof Semmel is awesome, this period is awesome, everything is awesome.",
    "I absolutely recommend this class. We learned a lot about British politics and how it changed so much in only about a hundred years.",
    "I would definitely recommend HIST 229 to other students! HIST 229 was a great way to gain insight into many of the political (as well as social and economic) developments of the 19th century. I had always been interested in the period and was pleasantly surprised to get a little bit of everything by taking this course--not just the political. Lectures were hugely helpful (it was great to not just be reading a textbook) and I enjoyed being able to delve into primary sources. Professor Semmel is a great lecturer: really engaging and approachable. I felt like he also made an effort to get to know the students in the class individually which made the class environment a lot more comfortable for all involved.",
    "Professor Semmel gives a good thematic walk-through of Britain's long 19th century. The two papers are very doable and so are the two exams. The final is significantly harder than the midterm, but only because of the scope. If you study and attend lecture, you can do very well in the course.",
    "A very good summary of the long nineteenth century in British history. Perfect if you are interested in political history.",
    "Definitely recommend, it felt like an obscure era made accessible, great lectures, interesting and not too much reading",
    "This was a great course. I loved the topic and the substance of the course, though the amount of material covered was sometimes a bit overwhelming. Yale is seriously lacking in history courses form this period. The readings were one of my favorite parts of the course. The lectures were rich in content but it would have bene useful to step back a few times and see how things were fitting together in the big picture. Semmel is an amazing professor. Clearly put tremendous time and thought into his lectures and choosing the reading selections.",
    "Oligarchy to Democracy is a great summary of the main domestic political, cultural, and economic developments in Britain from 1780 to 1914. The course covers the \"long 19th century,\" also known as \"Britain's imperial century\" -- but even though Britain was the dominant international power during this time period, the course focuses almost entirely on domestic developments and not the empire. If that's not your cup of tea (ha), take Semmel's \"Britain's Empire Since 1776\" course. I would definitely recommend the course, which covers the remarkable (and unprecedented) shift towards democracy in Britain without any violent revolution. That being said, Semmel sticks quite close to the historical consensus that \"Britain's political history since 1780 is one of gradual reform rather than violent revolutionary change\" -- I might've liked to see a little more nuance or complication injected into that story (which he only does a little bit at the end of the course). However, these are small gripes about an otherwise highly enjoyable and well-taught course that covers a time of immense change and intellectual ferment.",
    "A casual, fascinating history course with a relatively light workload. Took it as a 5th class and was very satisfied. Assignments aren't bad, and much of the research is provided or easily accessible. Readings are important for midterm\/final, but not essential on a week-to-week basis, allowing for schedule flexibility. Personally, preferred the first half of the course (more political history) to the second half (more social history), but entirely a personal preference and some students felt the reverse. Felt that the course did a good job of including and balancing both. It did mean that the course's character felt slightly different after the halfway point, but still greatly enjoyed the class."
