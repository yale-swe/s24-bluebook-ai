    "Great class -- take it with Jason if you can.",
    "A solid language class in which you finally reach the coveted status of being able to read a whole novel in German. The readings are good, the workload is not overly heavy, and it's pretty much what you would expect if you've taken German 110-130. I would recommend sticking with it, even if you don't have to for the language requirement - you will refine a lot of the grammar you've previously learned, and the workload is manageable enough that it's no real hassle. Take it with Jason Groves, if it's offered - he was a fantastic teacher and made the class a lot of fun.",
    "Good class! You'll learn German and have a good time doing it.",
    "Excellent class for improving your German."
