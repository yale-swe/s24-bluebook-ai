   "comments": [
    "I learned a lot of useful skills that I at first didn't think were going to be useful for my future research but was surprised to find how relevant this classwork was.",
    "Techniques and new knowledge in the field of cell biology. Current opinions and controversies over findings.",
    "Very little, if any at all. This class was effectively useless in developing any kind of critical thinking skills or a deeper understanding of cell biology. Classes (with the exception of Megan King, Patrick Lusk, Tom Pollard, and Michael Caplan) were either taught at a level that was far too simple and boring, or were way too complex and jargon-filled to have learned anything. On the whole, I did not gather any new information from this class and feel like the time spent in class and doing the homework would have been better spent doing almost literally anything else.",
    "I gained foundational knowledge in topics ranging across biology. My biggest takeaway from this class was learning how to effectively use literature to answer questions that I have. For the homework I relied heavily on literature and struggled a bit in the beginning. Over the course of the semester I found that my grades were improving and that not only in this class but in others as well I was doing better at finding articles I needed and within each article find the information I need.",
    "Great resource learning from expert professors, enjoyed the concept based homework assignments that promoted critical thinking skills",
    "acquire a in-depth and overrounded cell biology training.",
    "Several cell biology techniques as well as the seminal and ongoing research in each sub field of cell biology",
    "A better, more detailed understanding of molecular biology as it relates to research.",
    "Foundation of cell bio",
    "The biology of intracellular trafficking and of lipids.",
    "I learned about the basics of different concepts in molecular and cell biology. I also learned about the cutting edge research and discoveries in various sub-areas of molecular and cell biology which was very insightful.",
    "I've achieved some basic knowledge of molecular biology.",
    "Basic molecular biology",
    "I have previous knowledge of cell biology (undergrad). In 602, the lectures covered a lot of details I didn't know previously, and the homework made me think more about the topics. I improved my knowledge of cell biology.",
    "This course provided me basic understanding of cell biology and experimental techniques. It also provided the most up-to-date knowledge of various topics of cell biology.",
    "I learned about mechanisms of lipid transport and cell dynamics.",
    "More knowledge about cell biology."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: Hearing from such distinguished faculty, many of whom began the field of study or have greatly contributed to their area of research. Hearing about such a variety of applications and modeling systems. Weakness: grading by the various faculty, and the depth that some of the techniques enter. It is easy to fall off the train at the first stop when there are 30 more stops ahead.",
    "Strengths--exposure to several PIs who are interesting and engaging people and lecturers Weaknesses--The class was a waste of everyone's time. Assignments were time consuming and invaluable. Most lectures were mind-numbingly boring. Potential improvements--Please do not make this class required for graduate students. It is a waste of time.",
    "The course was good in that it covered a broad range of cell bio topics in some detail, and for someone from a non-cell biology heavy background it was very helpful. I do wish there was more engagement in the class past the discussion sections, without having to take the additional class - listening to powerpoints for many classes on end could get a bit dry, though I see the merit in doing so when the class is somewhat large and supposed to be introductory. All of the lecturers were well-versed on their topics and the variation in lecturers did add additional interesting perspectives to each topic.",
    "I liked that the teacher changed each week and that each person taught what they were most passionate and knowledgeable about. I also liked that there were now exams and that our grade was solely based on homeworks. I felt like i could relax more and focus on learning the material as opposed to cramming for a test. Weaknesses I thought was that it was advertised as a cell bio class for majors outside of biology but the lecturers seemed to teach to and write homework questions for people with a deep biological background. Things other students took for granted I had to learn as new information.",
    "Strength: taught by professors expertise in their fields. Learn so much cutting-edged techniques and knowledge",
    "Strengths: having various experts in their fields lecturing on topics. Weaknesses: major variability in how interesting the lectures were.",
    "Paper sections were useful as they were sort of like journal clubs but with more engagement and participation. I really got to dive deep into the papers. Weaknesses would include the lectures. Most of them were long and dense with material on lecture slides.",
    "The course was generally taught well by most instructors but there was some overlap of material between units due to multiple instructors.",
    "Lot of variability in grading of weekly assignments",
    "I like the discussion sections. For the assingments, I think sometimes the requirements are not so clear.",
    "The course is great, I don't have any suggestion to improve.",
    "One of the strengths of this course is to provide basic understanding of cell biology to students who do not have a strong biology background.",
    "It felt disjointed and rushed. While I didnt like all the papers that were chosen, I do think the discussion were the most useful part.",
    "I highly enjoyed the survey format. My favorite lectures focused on experimental techniques and how we know what we do. I also liked it when the instructor highlighted holes in our current knowledge. The homework assignments were very thought provoking."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, because it catches you up to the most cutting edge techniques. The homework isn't too difficult, and was graded fairly overall.",
    "NO. This class was a waste of time and did not help my development as a graduate student in any way.",
    "I would recommend this course for those without a background in cell biology or looking for a broad coverage of cell biology topics, taught by some of the leading experts on their own subjects.",
    "Yes, this course is very valuable for students who 1.) need molecular biology refresher and\/or 2.) seek a broad overview of applied molecular biology techniques",
    "I would! I really liked that they prioritized learning over grading and really focused on developing our understanding of biology.",
    "yes",
    "Yes, if they are interested in the specific topics listed on the syllabus. The class requires minimal engagement so those who are self motivated will get the most out of it.",
    "Yes, it reviews common experiments and basic concepts often used in research.",
    "Yes its a nice foundation of cell bio",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student who wants to learn about both the basics and the research applications of different areas in cell and molecular biology.",
    "Yes, this course is useful.",
    "Yes.",
    "Yes, I believe I learned a lot, so if the student has interesting in cell biology, I would recommend it.",
    "I would only recommend this course to students who are very into cell biology. If a student are curious about biology and want to learn a little bit more about it, this course is too in depth.",
    "No.",
    "Yes, it was exactly as advertised."
