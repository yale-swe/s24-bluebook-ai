    "An excessive amount of work. I don't know if I became a better writer, but I definitely wrote a lot. The fact that the topic was so interesting saved the terrible workload.",
    "I LOVED this class. I looked forward to it every day, and I absolutely loved doing the readings and writing, of course. Taking On Beauty opened my eyes and my mind to the world of thought on beauty. It was a great way to take a 114 class because I was super interested in the topic and really put a lot of thought into the way the ideas presented to me changed the way I saw the world, so doing the writing was a great way to explore that. There's a lot of freedom to explore your own thoughts and topics you're interested in, and the assignments are all really fun, a challenge but definitely worth the effort. Take this class!",
    "If you want to take this class, make sure that you thoroughly enjoy being creative and exploring art. We take a class trip to MOMA, so that was fun! The analyzation of art plays a huge role in this class."
