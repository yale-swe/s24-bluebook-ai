    "The material we learned was at the crossroads between art, computer science, math which allows me to utilize my strengths while strengthening my weaknesses.",
    "A cursory knowledge of the basics of many different aspects of computer graphics, a working knowledge of how to use Autodesk Maya",
    "I gained a greater familiarity with the computer program Maya.",
    "I learned the fundamentals of Maya software, and the core components of light, colour, image and animation theory.",
    "I learned a lot about the principles of computer graphics and animation as well has how to use the software used in the industry. I also learned about the math used in creating graphics.",
    "I learned a lot about the animation software, Maya, and general information about how we view and create animations. This made me think about how our image of the world is constructed, and I was able to compare the animated and real worlds."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The course is very good in the lab part but it is difficult to learn the material simply by listening to the powerpoint, it isn't until you do the hands on work that you understand it.",
    "I like the idea that the class is half theory half application. However, this was not carried out very well as the two components often did not connect well. I also disliked that there were often slides that were not explained and math that was not explained. Why bother showing it if we are not at least going to talk about what it means? The biggest issue with this class is that it is meant to teach Autodesk Maya, but neither the instructor nor the TA knows how to use Maya. In the future, I hope that a TA who is extremely adept in Maya is hired for this class, because Maya has so many little tricks and weird glitches. I had to enlist the help of a friend who had taken this class last year, and without him I have no idea how I would have gotten through this class because not even the TA knew much about Maya.",
    "The projects assigned were very engaging, although the instruction was somewhat confusing, while still being engaging.",
    "I took the course specifically because of my love of animated films, and my interest in understanding how they are made. I know there are a wide variety of reasons for wanting to learn animation skills, including engineering, game design, and reasons similar to my own. I think that the course could have been made much more engaging if all of the heavy theory content we did was tied more directly to its applications, and to the reasons we took the course. For example, in the first lecture, Professor Dorsey went through the trailer to Brave and spoke about the different techniques being used. Even simple exercises like this could make the two hour lectures much more engaging and interesting; for example, after learning a specific concept like ambient lighting or mesh surfaces, going through videos or models and looking at how these are used in different films to achieve different things would have been really enjoyable. Professor Dorsey often described verbally different applications for the theory, but actually witnessing it in every lecture would have made me much more focussed, engaged, and would have helped in understanding. I also think there could be more use of Maya, starting earlier on. Making the final project was a lot of fun, but doing shorter creative exercises throughout the semester (like the ball bouncing down the stairs pset, but perhaps with more creative license, and starting earlier in the semester) would have made the course more engaging as well.",
    "I learned a lot very quickly in this course and it was taught well, I only wish the class could have met more often (it only met once a week). I think that would have helped solidify the concepts.",
    "This course takes a while to get used to. The software is difficult and applying the mathematics correctly is very difficult with the first couple of practice sets. However, once you get the feel of the course, everything starts to come together. In the beginning of the semester, though, it might be helpful to spend more time in class explaining and exploring Maya. The software is confusing for someone who has never taken a computer science class before, and so the first homework seems overwhelming. The TAs are extremely helpful, but they could benefit from more time in class to talk about what the homework will involve and more open office hours. Otherwise, the lectures, though interesting, could include more engagement to truly synthesize the information."

   "comments": [
    "I would only recommend this class if you are genuinely interested in learning Autodesk Maya. That is why I took the class, and I got what I wanted out of it. However, the theory parts are lots of breadth and not enough depth, and quite boring. However, the psets were really fun!",
    "Yeah! This was a cool introduction to digital animation.",
    "I would, but I would be a bit hesitant. The course was very different to how I imagined originally. There was much more theory compared to practical experience using Maya. Overall, I am very happy that I now have the skills I do. However, I would warn the student that the enjoyable, interesting and challenging final project does not necessarily reflect the content of the whole course.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student interested in computer graphics because it provides a good introduction to the topic without requiring many semesters of advanced computer science training (as the advanced computer graphics class does). It's also interesting to learn how the films and advertisements you see every day are made.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. It is amazing to see your progress from the beginning of the semester to the end of the semester. It is easy to evaluate your knowledge and what you have learned, and all of the projects and practice sets are fun to do. It is a way of engaging computer science in a more creative way than typical introductory computer science classes."
