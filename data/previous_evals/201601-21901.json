    "Shiri is amazing, the class is fun. 10\/10 would recommend.",
    "I would recommend Hebrew 120 02 to any student who want to pursue learning Hebrew after L1 ! This is such a fun class, it becomes a constitutive part of your schedule and you get so much out of it (much more than the mere academic reward of learning a language). Also Shiri is great and so are the students.",
    "L2 Hebrew is a great continuation of the intro level and through lots of reading comprehension, writing, and speaking practice really helps students improve their skills and their study habits for learning the language (and probably languages in general). I would definitely recommend taking it (and not just because its required!).",
    "This was a great course for second semester Hebrew."
