    "Would definitely recommend the course. Excellent introduction to and deep engagement with spatial theory and the enmeshed terrain of history and space.",
    "I would recommend the class to a fellow student, but just warn them that they need to start very early on their projects to get the most out of them.",
    "Great course that I would recommend to anyone interested in spatial history and problems of space",
    "It's a seminar mostly focused on historiography, with the expectation of a large research paper. I would recommend it to another student."

   "comments": [
    "The course indirectly helped tremendously with my dissertation project. It was helpful in orienting my work across, between and within history and environmental\/geography disciplines.",
    "This course was important for me personally in introducing me to some theory I have been meaning to read. It was also helpful in providing an incentive for me to learn GIS, at least the basics, though I had to do this outside of class rather than being able to learn it in class.",
    "This class exposed me to a whole new aspect of historical thinking and inquiry that I would not normally have encountered. It also provided me with a basic introduction to some new research tools that I would otherwise not have found."
