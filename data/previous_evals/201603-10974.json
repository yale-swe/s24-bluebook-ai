   "question_text": "What knowledge, skills, and insights did you develop by taking this course?",
   "comments": [
    "I think the most valuable things I learned from this course are general pieces of wisdom. I learned more about what it would be like to be involved in making foreign policy and improved practical memo writing skills.",
    "I learned a ton about long-term thinking and personal biases.",
    "I developed an abundance of knowledge, skills and insights in this course, related to politics, foreign policy, strategic thinking, risk analysis, strategic\/executive communication and even teaching.",
    "I really enjoyed taking this class with Howard Dean. He has a ton of experience, and because of that he brought a ton of insight into our class discussions. In the past, the class has been described as a book club with Howard, and that is pretty true.",
    "This class was more about insightful thinking and how to have a real and genuine discussion more than anything else. It wasn't what I expected at all, but I still learned a lot about foreign policy over the years, but conversation often went far deeper than it has gone in my other Yale courses.",
    "I learned more about American policy within the context of historical decisions",
    "While I learned a lot about foreign policy, history, and great leaders in this course, I learned more about life than I ever thought I would. I learned that it is important to think through the long-term ramifications of a situation, anticipate your next move if you are wrong, form genuine relationships with people, and that you should always know your own biases. But more than anything else one thing has stuck with me: writing down 5 things you care about to make sure you do something that advances one of them everyday. You called it \"finding your polar north.\" I love that, and it's something that will guide the rest of my life. On top of all of these wonderful life lessons, I also loved the class set-up. All the papers were very different than my other classes which I liked, the simulation was great, and the guest speakers were a treat. Professor Dean also helped so much with paper feedback-- he was quick to give you advice and help you work through your ideas which helped me grow as well.",
    "I learned how to analyze the decisions of leaders and contextualize it to both the international environment of the time, as well as today's geopolitical conditions",
    "I learned much about the ins and outs of politics, especially in the context of major foreign policy decisions.",
    "This was my first global class at Yale, which obviously exposed me to a variety of items that I had never worked on before. I learned basic political\/governmental skills like how to write policy memos or how the NSC functions. Perhaps more importantly, one of the papers forces you to hone your skills of self evaluation. I learned to be better aware of my biases-- and that so many decisions are made not because they're best, but thanks to personal connections. I also learned how to examine so much of what I take for granted, or given, in a new light. It was very exciting taking this course during the election."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I really enjoyed the dinners for this class. I think it makes the class so much more fun when it is actually in session to know the other students and the professor on a higher level. I think that the opportunity to revise the first paper is incredibly valuable. Not enough professors give students this opportunity even though this is the only real way to improve.",
    "Exceptional course. This is something that the future leaders of our society need to take to understand the importance of maintaining the long-term perspective in decision making, and the factors that could lead to short-sightedness. I truly enjoyed this course.",
    "At times, it felt that the discussions veered off into unexpected places and would stay there, never to return to the topic intended for a particular class. Still, I enjoyed being able to discuss highly topical issues with the class - the election, right-wing politics, etc.",
    "Sometimes I wished we stayed on the topics of the reading a bit more and sometimes as though I felt a couple of people would unilaterally drive discussions but these were both small issues overall.",
    "I LOVED THIS CLASS. This class is taught by the AMAZING Governor Dean, who truly cares for his students. He teaches the course well, engages in all opinions and debates, and welcomes students of all backgrounds. I do not know how to put in words how amazing this class was!",
    "Strengths: The awesome set up of the course (simulation, papers, guest speakers, final dinner) Weaknesses: I think it could have been a bit smaller-- while I understand the course is in high demand I think a smaller group could have made the class a bit more intimate.",
    "The seminar felt very casual, which was great and conducive to honest, no-frills discussions. I was interested in the reading material, too. I can't think of any weaknesses.",
    "Strengths: Great level of discussion, variety of perspectives in the room",
    "Strengths: Not only is Professor Dean a fascinating individual, but so too are his guests, his teaching assistant(s), and the fellow students in the class. The readings are also continuously interesting. Prof. Dean is incredibly generous with his time-- and will take students out for dinner, have lunch, read over papers, etc. Weaknesses: I wish that we had slightly more structured discussion on the readings. I quite enjoyed them and would get slightly frustrated as topics veered away to a subject I had far less background on. While this is a fun and useful event at time, I fear it happened at other moments because other students hadn't done the reading (which happens from time to time, but I think since this was allowed, people felt more free to break off)."

   "comments": [
    "Definitely take this class if you can get in. Your discussions in class may not always stick to the readings but they will be unfailingly interesting and relevant to current politics. Howard makes himself very available to the students which is great.",
    "Take this course! You learn a lot and the class experience is incredible.",
    "Absolutely - I already have on numerous occasions. Best course I have taken at Yale thus far.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course! My one reservation is that it helps to have extensive historical knowledge in order to engage with much of the material. On the other hand, we talked about really accessible topics like media, elections, protests, and the like.",
    "100% absolutely",
    "YES. PLEASE TAKE THIS CLASS. GOVERNOR DEAN IS INCREDIBLE!",
    "If you get into this course, take it. While you will learn a lot about history, foreign policy, and great leaders, you will learn more about life than you ever could have imagined. Professor Dean is amazing at listening to you and providing wisdom--- not only is he a good teacher, he is a good person who really cares about his students. You will walk away from this course with lessons to take into your future career, no matter what that may be. The level of introspection that this course sometimes requires is unparalleled in other classes I have taken here-- and it makes everything you do so much more special. If you are going to do this course really try to do it all the way---dive in and embrace the material, the knowledge of your classmates, the wisdom of Howard Dean, and your own passion.",
    "Definitely.",
    "Yes. At times, it can feel like you're in a \"Democratic Strategy Meeting\" with Howard Dean, but it's worth it in the end. Great conversations about everything from domestic US policy to foreign affairs. Really appreciated the case study approach that looked at Presidential administrations, starting with Truman and ending with Obama.",
    "Yes, I would highly recommend if you are able to be admitted!",
    "Absolutely take this course with Howard Dean. I learned not only about major foreign policy decisions of the twentieth century, but from Howard Dean's extensive personal experience in politics I learned a great deal about what it's really like to be an American politician. This course compelled me to become more civically engaged and interested in policymaking.",
    "Yes!! You learn a lot from Professor Dean",
    "Easy class with good discussions. Howard is great! Definitely recommend taking it.",
    "Yes-- If you're looking for a fun way to discuss, often in new light, modern issues, take this class. I not only learned a decent amount of history and policy, but also learned to reevaluate thoughts I had taken for granted as facts. Professor Dean has an immense amount of insight-- and is very generous with his time. He's also not out to get you, as he makes clear on day one. This isn't a class where he expects you to be an absolute genius, but rather putting in the effort and being genuine matters more. Be warned: the final paper is a group paper. So be aware of the others in the class... like many seminars, classmates can significantly add or subtract. Overall, though, it was great! Guests are also awesome!"
