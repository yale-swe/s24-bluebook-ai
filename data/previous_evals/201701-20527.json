    "How to do estimations and random scientific things here and there.",
    "Great broad introduction to many fields of physics, genetics, environmental studies, astrophysics, and statistics. Prof. Reed makes lectures engaging and entertaining, even though the information lacks substantial depth. Many of the topics relate to things experienced in daily life, and I found myself sharing topics learned in class with friends.",
    "none. horrible class",
    "Overview of the science behind sci fi movies and novels. None of the proofs behind it, but the actual theories and equations that you can apply to solve \"real world\" problems.",
    "Honestly none. There's no reason any senior STEM major should be allowed to take this course. I literally learned everything this class in 9th grade and went to class three times. Shopping period, midterm, final. Out of respect for other students who would actually learn from this course and or needed this as a distributional requirement, this course should have limited enrollment. I do think the concepts and material are interesting, just too simplified for a large segment of the Yale student population.",
    "By taking this class, I feel as if I was able to learn about many different scientific topics, many of which I had not put that much thought into before. I enjoyed being able to relate topics that I'd read about in stories to real life concepts and learn more about them.",
    "I learned a lot about science and science fiction",
    "A greater appreciation of scientific literacy and a keen ability to estimate.",
    "I learned there's a lot that goes into today's technology that was first conceived as science fiction. I learned a lot of random facts about the realities of our universe and how we can and might interact with it. And I learned that I am inherently terrible at estimating when I'm not given any certainties to work with!",
    "Basics of physics and other sciences.",
    "A good overview of important scientific concepts.",
    "Very little. If you have a basic science education, you exceed the knowledge gained in this course.",
    "Estimation was something I never previously thought about, but now it taught me to think very generally and allowed me to dare and be imprecise.",
    "Didn't learn much, except for some very basic scientific concepts.",
    "The class was okay and helped with estimation.",
    "I learned how to apply science to fictionaly settings",
    "We learned pretty fundamental physics and biology and got a good understanding of the basics of the science behind science fiction stories.",
    "I don't feel that I learned or gained much from this class.",
    "A basic understanding of several important scientific concepts.",
    "I learned how to think critically in terms of estimation and using real world references. I also gained an appreciation for the complexity of technology and forces we experience daily but don't really think about.",
    "The ability to use quantitative science formulas and apply them to real world problems and theoretical innovations.",
    "The course covers a lot of material (most of which is not required on the exams) in very little depth. You'll be permitted to carry a cheat sheet into the midterm and a 2-page cheat sheet for the final. This isn't a course where you'll learn a whole lot that is useful, but it is interesting.",
    "i learned a lot about astrophysics and electrical engineeeing related topics such as binary and coding -- it was all approached in a manner that made everything very interesting and engaging",
    "Basic knowledge of engineering concepts for beginners",
    "great physics for everyday life class... learned a lot of random things that I never thought I would want to know but I think will be helpful in the future.",
    "Basic physics and some cool applications of it.",
    "This course aimed to integrate interesting science fiction stories, with the actual, hard science behind it. In this course, we learned a survey of different topics in physics, biology, etc. Skills we learned included estimation skills, applying formulas, and evaluating the science of science fiction, with the science of reality.",
    "A lot of cool scientific concepts: special Relativity, Reynold number, Artifical Intelligent, Information theory, Transitor logic... The problem is being an introductory course, the class does not have the time capacity and the minimal physics\/math requirements to delve deeply into any of these topics. Many of these topics (if not all) are covered in haste and left confusing.",
    "I gained knowledge in estimation, logic, and the basics of physics.",
    "I learned many modern science concepts that are used in science fictions.",
    "NONE other than confirmation that science for non-science majors courses need a serious improvement at Yale.",
    "Fun way to look at sci fi",
    "Critical thinking and problem solving skills with math and science subjects.",
    "A survey of scientific concepts used in science fiction books and movies.",
    "There is not much material in this course. I did learn about time dilation.",
    "None",
    "This course covers many frontier scientific concepts in many areas including the physics, astronomy, computer science, biology, and etc. The professor does not explain concepts in depth but some times they can be difficult to understand and do well in exams.",
    "Estimation was interesting and informative, and there were some updates and dispelling of myth that I had never heard before. Having taken physics in high school, much of the content was review, however.",

   "comments": [
    "Strengths: low workload, lots of science in it, office hours with the TF's are great. Weaknesses: material is really jumbled up and seem random sometimes. Hard to u derstand the concepts sometimes because Professor Reed doesn't explain them very well and assumes you'll understand because hey you got into Yale.",
    "This is an epic class in good and bad ways. Professor Reed is fun and engaged, but no one goes to class, everything is online, and he re-uses psets and exams from year to year (bad idea!)",
    "this course was absolutely terrible",
    "Great course taught by a great professor! No weaknesses, lectures are thoroughly engaging. A solid review with TA's that contained us working through some problems together would have been helpful.",
    "This class is legitimately interesting, but there's no reason any STEM majors should be allowed to take this course.",
    "For strengths, this class does cover a lot of information. Over the course, we tackled multiple books and multiple scientific concepts from each book. The variety of topics was very interesting. For weaknesses, the lectures can be somewhat dry. Also, it seemed as if some of the topics were diluted so much, that the ideas almost became convoluted. I wish in many cases, that he would have given us actual problems to work instead of most everything being estimations and scaling.",
    "The tas were very unavailable",
    "There was a never a time where I felt certain about the material; it would have been great spent more time explaining instead of breezing through the stuff we were actually tested on. It was really interesting anyway, and I was never bored (even if I was confused).",
    "Pi is not 10. Be a bit less far out on the first day.",
    "Professor really cared about the subjects and tried to make the lectures interesting and the problem sets were reasonable, but the exams did not resemble the work required on the problem sets or what was covered in class. Review sessions were HUGE misrepresentations of what was on exams. Lastly, there are simply too many physics topics and too few others. If that was the focus of the course, it should have been more up front about that.",
    "This course should probably not be offered again. Has few redeeming qualities.",
    "I felt that the curriculum was disjointed and hard to follow, albeit interesting.",
    "Great intructor",
    "Strengths: pretty simple problem sets, not a lot of work for the class. Weaknesses: If you don't go to class, you will fall behind and it is deceptively easy.",
    "This class is poorly taught in my opinion; we go through so many science topics and things still aren't explained in the best way that they can.",
    "I think that this course could draw more on how the technology applies to the real world and the movies\/books discussed and also how to do the real problems as opposed to simply discussing the broad concepts.",
    "Sometimes the material is not covered that in depth, so it's hard to develop a strong understanding.",
    "Theories and equations could be explained a little more thoroughly in order to make sure everyone gets the material. Clarity on slides and steps in equations would make concepts easier to follow.",
    "The course is poorly structured with many weird topics in one slide. The references to Science Fiction are tangential at best. The grading of the exams are highly inconsistent (my 60% was remarked to 90+%).",
    "strength: learned and covered a lot in a really cool manner, through the lens of sci-fi weakness: very superficial understanding of everything, no depth",
    "Professor was awesome.",
    "I liked the emphasis on homework problems since that really forced me to keep up throughout the year. Exams were vague to prepare for and I found it hard to study practice problems. Classes could be boring which made it hard to pay attention.",
    "The course could be improved by giving a little bit more explanations for some of the topics, and explaining the math\/science behind it. For example, for the unit on circuits, it was pretty unclear how to actually do the math behind it. Would've been helpful to go a little more in depth.",
    "I think the class was interesting and not too too difficult for someone with no science background. That means it did get difficult to understand at times. There are some topics like quantum mechanics that totally went over my head for a long time (I got some kind of grasp on it throughout the semester). The professor was very considerate whenever I didn't understand something and would kindly explain the concept to me over and over again. There will be people who found this course really difficult and others who find it easy, and it's really dependent on your background. I think you will know if this turns out to be an easy or not easy class for you. It was interesting to cover a lot of various topics, but we really didn't cover a topic in depth. I mean, the class isn't really meant for that right? However, it it still frustrating to not really understand a topic and be expected to take what you learn in class as is. I can definitely say I finished some homework assignment not really knowing what I did (but then again, that's for a lot of other classes too haha), but you accept that.",
    "Professor Reed is a great, amicable professor that tries his best to engage students with the course material. This course is designed to be fun, and not to be a burden. We aren't required to read all of the science fiction novels on the syllabus--just reading the outlines or summaries are enough. Furthermore, Profesor Reed walks us through the material of the class slowly and thoroughly, ensuring that we understand the material. An improvement I would suggest is including more variety of sciences in the syllabus. I felt that there was more physics than chemistry and\/or biology, and would like more representation in other branches of science.",
    "Definitely very minimal work, ASSUMING you either have the ability to grasp physics concept quickly or accept being majestically confused about a topic, several topics, or the entire semester. Psets are usually very short (think 1 page A4 with 3 short questions)",
    "This course does not use a textbook so it makes it hard to find alternate methods to learn the material if you do not understand the concepts when presented in lecture. Also, many students found ways to cheat on exams this semester which messed up the curve for many of the students who took the tests with integrity and who actually worked hard in the class.",
    "Very math oriented",
    "This course does a good job at giving students a breadth of knowledge in an array of scientific areas, though lacked depth in any one, making it challenging to learn all of the material solely through the lectures.",
    "This is a large lecture class. Sometimes you can get lost in the lecture but overall it is quite engaging.",
    "I am honestly struggling to name any strengths other than I found some of the science fiction stories mentioned in the class interesting. The main weaknesses are a complete inaccessibility and inapplicability of the material, an incredibly unstructured lecture delivery which made the topics ever-more difficult to parse through. Throughout the semester, I felt completely lost and stressed out about every single pset. The midterm and the final were both based on about 15% of the material we went over in class and asked incredibly obscure questions, the complete credit for which really depended on how lucky you were in putting the relevant niche information on your sheet of notes. In order to be improved, this class needs some serious restructuring, mainly in the way the material is delivered and presented in class and then coordinated with psets and exams. The TAs were also incredibly unhelpful and refused to give anything other than general pointers to where to find the information in the slides. Though I am sure the professor had the best intentions when compiling it together, I think the general accessibility of it ended up shooting itself in the foot and making it even harder for students to grasp the incredibly sophisticated concepts.",
    "Professor and curriculum",
    "Great class! Pretty easy but fun and engaging!!",
    "Covered a wide swath of material and gave an novice understanding of all of it. The pro is many things were covered, but the con is that it was all very shallow.",
    "Very low effort course (by design). The professor is very engaged though, which is respectable.",
    "It's so easy to not really engage with the course and do fine. Up until the final everything was pretty easy, and it's clearly a course for people who want an easy science credit. That being said, Mark is so committed and upbeat. He barely touches on topics he obviously knows inside and out, and major ups to him for not going crazy teaching humanities students how global warming happens.",
    "The materials of the class are interesting. We cover many topics that are not typically discussed in a science course. I wish the lectures can cover a bit about how to solve problems.",
    "Strengths are no textbooks and no final during finals period. Weaknesses are errything else."

   "comments": [
    "I wouldn't recommend this class unless you actually enjoy science. Yes the workload is very low, but the class itself is challenging and often boring for someone that doesn't like science like me. If you do still want to take the class, office hours are a great help for homework, I would make sure to check my work there every week. For the midterm, study the problem sets and slides; it's short and generally like the problem set, but you have to know the lecture slides well. The final was cumulative and seemed to be more focused on the first half of the class. Again, if you don't like science this is probably not the class for you to get your science credit, take an astronomy class or something.",
    "Pretty classic non-science science gut. Sneakily tough to get a flat A on, but you will spend no time on the work, so can be worth it",
    "No. Take a more rigorous and interesting science credit.",
    "A great course if you've never done physics before. It shows you the most interesting parts of many different areas of physics and is very accessible to non-quantitative people.",
    "Would not recommend. You learn nothing. It's taught terribly. Horrible class.",
    "Definitely take this course if you are looking for a QR with minimum work. Weekly psets that take a few minutes to complete if you understand the concepts, a short story outline, a midterm and an in class final. Professor Reed is a fantastic lecturer and the topics are very interesting.",
    "Only take this if you're not a STEM major and need a SC credit.",
    "Yes if you need a science credit",
    "I would recommend this only as an easy science credit. The class is fine, but it's not anything deeply interesting or intellectual. Almost all the ideas are very base level concepts, yet there is a variety of concepts which might interest some.",
    "Yes it is a good science class",
    "It was a very reasonable science credit that was somewhat interesting and not a lot of work.",
    "An amazing use of my final Credit\/D\/Fail course",
    "GREAT science credit. Mark Reed is an absolute gem; he is doing the people's work. He is a certified GOAT. Weekly psets take about 15 minutes and count for 40% of your grade.",
    "If you go to class and pay attention, you'll learn some interesting superficial knowledge about how the world works. It's tempting to not go to class though when the workload is so light (9 problem sets that take 1 hour max each). Exams are basically open-book (you get to bring in a cheat sheet) but be warned that they aren't \/easy\/, especially if you don't listen in lecture. Prof Reed is a decent lecturer (sometimes will end early yay!) and the TAs hold plenty of office hours, so if you need help, you can easily get it. I would think about why you want to take this class. As a second semester senior who has no physics\/electronics knowledge, it was stress-free and interesting. But it might not be the guaranteed A you're looking for.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class! The material is super interesting, and the work is somewhat doable if you make sure you go to office hours.",
    "good sc credit, material is mostly interesting. its very easy to do well. problem sets are easy as are the midterm and final, but you do have to study for them. theres no reading and you could get away with not attending lecture if you feel confident on the material (the slides are online, but if youre learning it for the first time some of it may be hard to decipher from the slides).",
    "If you need a science credit, yeah.",
    "There are better science credits. It is not easy enough or interesting enough to warrant taking unless the professor changes the course which seems unlikely.",
    "Great class and Professor Reed is always fun to listen to. The class is fairly low commitment if you understand the concepts. It is a nice science course to take if you're intimidated by all other aspects of science.",
    "Take this class for an easy A and a science credit. Do not take it for any other reason. I feel less intelligent having taken this class and I am embarrassed to have it on my transcript.",
    "This class is gutty and has some interesting themes, but tends to be disjointed.",
    "Incredible GUT you have to take it!",
    "If you are looking for a lighter science credit, this is it.",
    "No",
    "I would not recommend this course to another student. I hated this class.",
    "I would definitely recommened this course to non-STEM students trying to develop literacy in scientific fields.",
    "Yes. It is interesting science but non-science majors will find it not to be too hard so they can't take it.",
    "I would recommend this class to someone who is interested in science fiction or space. It helps build and appreciation and deeper knowledge of what is happening in the world around us. It's also a fun class, although challenging.",
    "Yes I would recommend to any humanities major looking to broaden their scope of scientific understanding.",
    "There are better guts out there for the Sc credit. This course, however, doesn't require attendance, so consider the (shaky) certainty of an A and not having to attend class.",
    "Yes, 100%",
    "yes, 100%! but don't approach the course like it's a gut, because it is not. only take if you're genuinely interested",
    "Yes. A great way to get to understand scientific concepts if you're not a science major.",
    "If a student had physics background I think they would enjoy it, but having no experience with physics gave me trouble with some concepts.",
    "If you are merely looking for a science credit, I would recommend taking a different class where you learn more. This class was somewhat interesting, but also was low key not a gut at all. Some of the physics concepts were really complicated.",
    "If you need a science credit, why not? However, this class is not great if you want to retain like, useful scientific knowledge and apply that knowledge somewhere else. It is interesting, the professor is nice, and the TA's are helpful; however, it's not going to prepare for anything else. It depends on what you want you're looking for. Oh, and it's also not as easy as people make it out to be. That part is very dependent on the person.",
    "I would recommend this class to other students, especially those in the humanities looking for an easy science class. The workload is minimal, and the class material is not extremely difficult to understand.",
    "No, really not worth it although Professor Reed is nice and funny",
    "Yes",
    "This is a great class for a non STEM student to completel their science requirement.",
    "If you need a fairly easy science credit, this is a good class. However, I wouldn't recommend it to a student who likes to have a depth of knowledge in the scientific concepts.",
    "Yes. It is a good science credit for students who enjoy reading science fictions.",
    "Unfortunately, my answer is not at all. This is not a reasonable course to take to fulfill your science credit by any means and is not worth the stress and the hit your GPA is likely to take.",
    "Yes it gives a useful skill",
    "Definitely take thi as a 4th or 5th course!",
    "A very good science class for non-STEM majors. Although some concepts are taught in HS physics classes, many of the concepts I had never learned before and would have no other way of learning than taking 5 other science classes. It is very good in the sense you get your feet wet in many fields.",
    "Not if you want to learn something.",
    "This is totally a gut and Mark Reed will give some interesting lectures. Just be aware that the midterm and final will be difficult.",
    "Yeah I mean take it if you need an easy science with no section, but don't kid yourself about why you're taking it.",
    "Mark is a great guy and enthusiastic lecturer (albeit a bit cringey at times). The class covers a lot of interesting concepts, but in the end it's just an intro survey course, so it often feels shallow and as though we're skipping around randomly. Good science credit but don't expect anything extraordinary.",
    "If you are interested in frontier science and technology, take this course. But be careful it's not a gut and you need to work hard to beat the curve.",
    "Incredibly easy class, although I feel that as a result I learned far less than I have in my other courses in Yale. This might be because I had more of a background in physics than the course was designed for. It is hard to tell if others' experiences were different, but I felt that I just took this class for an easy science credit and got what I came for.",
    "Easy Sci credit. However, after the 1st midterm the psets are tricky. The final was tricky as well.",
    "I would not recommend this course to another student, only because there's probably another SC course out there that could keep you actively engaged and teach you something interesting.",
    "Only if you desperate."
