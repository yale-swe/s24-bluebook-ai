   "comments": [
    "More focus on actual techniques for risk assessment. Introduction of some practical exercises with different models for risk assessment. The theoretical knowledge about different energy sources is not very related to risk assessment and was a non-necessary to many of the students in the class.",
    "The subject of the course extremely required practical application. There should be practical classes to exercise the methods discussed during classes. This course would be much more useful if it had a more hands on approach, instead of being only just theory based. At least that was my expectation before taking it.",
    "The course really needs improvement in training students on software that is used to train individuals in risk assessment.",
    "There should be COMPULSORY readings for EVERY lecture session. This course is extremely important and hence need to be made more rigorous. The assignments should be designed in a way that students are tested how well the concepts taught in class have been understood. Assignments must try and cover ALL the topics learned in the class. And in such case assignments consisting of literature reviews are NOT of much use. Each assignment should have multiple practical questions and should be more challenging that students need to learn the ERA techniques really well. There should either be a final exam or a paper. Having both at the end of the semester makes it difficult. Avoid having only literature reviews as assignments\/ exams. It does not help in learning ERA tools and techniques which are more mathematical or methodical in nature. In syllabus, include the readings for each class. Upload the material on Classes V2, date and class wise, else it gets confusing. Stick to the syllabus and ERA concepts.Energy technologies and LCA are covered in other courses hence total focus of this course should be \"Risk\" assessment.",
    "This class should really teach Environmental Risk Assessment in a way that is relevant to students' future job. The current syllabus design is not well thought through.",
    "I think the use of different softwares on data analysis should be considered with a view to expanding more on them."
