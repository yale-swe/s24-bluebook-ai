    "One of those uniquely Yale courses. It is a good experience. The entire workload of the course is a twenty page paper due at the end of classes (start this early), but the operas you read during the course are all still fascinating. If you take it you will really get an insight into how opera are made and you also get to go to an opera dress rehearsal at the MET.",
    "A study of opera librettos from a world famous librettist. Worth it!",
    "This course is fine if you're interested in opera and want to spend 2\/3 of every seminar watching video recordings of various productions. Don't expect any substantive discussion of the texts or much instruction about how to write the final paper. You basically sit and listen to McClatchy and watch operas every class. McClatchy is a good librettist himself and very amusing to listen to, but the class is not intellectual -- you just sort of learn what some of the greatest operas are about. The trip to the Metropolitan Opera at the end of the semester is awesome, and it's potentially worth taking the class just to get to see the whole backstage and every nook and cranny of the Met building.",
    "This is a fantastic class for anyone interested in studying opera librettos and their literary sources. The bulk of the work is reading librettos and their sources, plus one paper at the end. Professor McClatchy is a fascinating person and a wonderful professor, so being able to take a class with him is amazing. Overall I would highly recommend this class to anyone interested in studying the literary side of opera!",
    "Absolutely take this class if you're interested in opera, but otherwise I'm not sure. It's interesting to look at opera from the librettos, but if you don't know (or like) anything about the genre it might not make so much sense. We read source poems\/plays\/novels and their adapted librettos (sometimes a lot of pages, but pretty optional), discussed the adaptation, then the famous scenes from different productions. J.D. McClatchy is hilarious, not so PC, and super experienced in the real opera world, as a librettist, translator, etc. He has ridiculous stories and he will tell you. BEST PART: trip to NYC, for a final dress rehearsal of McClatchy's translation of \"Barber of Seville,\" followed by a full backstage tour, meeting all the singers, costume & sets people, etc. Unbelievable. Overall a great, unusual course.",
    "I would definitely recommend the class. It is a wonderful way to spend two hours every week and you will be exposed to many fabulous operas. The workload is very manageable but the only graded assignment is a twenty page paper at the very end of the class. As such, I have no idea what my grade will be which is slightly unnerving. I still loved the class though!",
    "Would recommend! Be prepared to work hard on the final paper.",
    "This class looks deeply at the literature side of opera. We spent classes watching portions of operas and discussing the various differences that result from adaptation. Classes were interesting and engaging, and I would certainly recommend this class to anyone with an interest in opera!",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course! The topic is musical, but the analytical approach is literary.",
    "An examination of the operatic adaptions of famous literary works."
