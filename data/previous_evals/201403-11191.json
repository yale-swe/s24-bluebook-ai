   "comments": [
    "An excellent survey of major themes and topics in IR, very good prep for the qualifying exam. For these reasons, I would absolutely recommend 695 to a fellow student.",
    "I would recommend the course to anyone who is seriously studying IR. It will prepare you well for the IR field exam.",
    "If you want an accessible overview of larger theories of international relations, as well as a summary of methodological problems and solutions, this is a class worth taking.",
    "PLSC 695 is a survey course that covers most big IR theory and a number of important debates within the sub-field. There is a relatively significant amount of important reading, and students must complete an 8-page book review and two 6-page reading responses. The final exam is a cumulative \"pick two questions\" essay exam modeled on the IR Comprehensive exam, which the course is intended to prepare students to take. While I think that a student with a strong IR background and time to study could probably take the IR Comp without taking 695, I would recommend taking the class with Dr. Sambanis to any student who wants to be intellectually challenged and grow from the experience.",
    "I would summarize it as a survey of theoretical literature in IR. I'd only recommend it to those seeking to concentrate in IR or looking to get a broad survey to complement their research."

   "question_text": "How did this course deepen your knowledge of your discipline\/profession? To what extent did this course contribute to your dissertation\/research?",
   "comments": [
    "The course was very helpful to learn how to break down an international relations paper and decide how valuable an author's findings really are. I benefited a lot from the class discussions.",
    "See above, although I would add that the special class on case study methods in IR was especially helpful for my thinking about the benefits and disadvantages of different methodological approaches to the study of conflict. In addition, the data workshop encouraged me to look carefully at datasets I initially knew little about, and demonstrated the value in thinking very carefully about measurement validity and the coding decisions used in the work we've read.",
    "I found the course to be particularly useful in thinking of how to apply what I am learning in my methods classes with larger theories. The course itself was more a requirement than leading to a dissertation, but I have added to my list of potential thesis questions based on the gaps in the literature pointed out by the instructor.",
    "While this course didn't introduce IR scholars to a lot of new works, it did encourage re-reading texts from a graduate viewpoint and, more importantly, viewing texts in dialogue with one another. There was also a lot of discussion on good methodology for conducting IR research, which will certainly help me in my future studies."
