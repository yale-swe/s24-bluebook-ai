   "comments": [
    "This class was much better than L1 and L2. There was more work expected of us, and thus I felt I learned more. Still not as good a language class as in other language departments in terms of structure and clarity of assignments.",
    "5 days a week PLUS section becomes a bit of a drag. If you're still taking Hindi, you're probably doing so because you're interested in South Asian culture and because of the nice (not at all stressful) language credit that is Hindi. I'm glad I took it, but this was my last in the sequence",
    "Standard language course, you really start gaining confidence in your conversational ability at this level.",
    "It got a lot harder this semester, just as all my other classes stepped up.Strengths: teachers are caring and understanding. Fast-paced learning.Weaknesses: lessons barely had time to sink in. We had no course packet, and I had to print things all the time, which got really aggravating.",
    "Hindi 130 helps you master the skills you learned in Hindi L1 and L2 and improves upon them. There are daily quizzes and assignments, but the workload is very manageable. Furthermore, you will not only learn the language but learn about Indian culture and history as well. I definitely recommend the class to any one looking for a fun way to learn a less commonly taught language!",
    "It's Hindi, you should know what to expect by the time you get to L3."
