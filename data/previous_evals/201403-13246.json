   "comments": [
    "Would recommend to maintain Chinese proficiency, especially if you did a summer program. Workload is very heavy especially in the first few days of the week.",
    "Even though it's intense, it's very manageable because there are never huge assignments due since it's consistently paced. I highly recommend it, especially because Chinese is such an amazing language and learning about China is never a waste of time. :)",
    "Be ready for the work, but the topics are extremely interesting and you learn how to really express your opinion about topics you care about in Chinese.",
    "Chinese 150 was a great continuation of Chinese. Coming back from HBA i could feel my speaking abilities slipping throughout the semester, but I continued to improve my vocabulary and grammar abilities. The workload was tough but compared to the summer it was easy.",
    "Definitely recommend all China scholars take this course - well taught and constructed",
    "This course is essential if you want to continue Chinese study at Yale. If you are interested in improving your Chinese I would recommend this course. You must, however, be willing to commit to it."
