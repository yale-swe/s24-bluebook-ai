   "comments": [
    "Yes. One of the best courses I have taken here.",
    "I think it's a great class to take Credit D Fail. There's a lot of reading, and you will really have to fight for an A, but the material is truly interesting, and it will deepen your understanding of a book which has influenced and inspired art and literature for centuries.",
    "This is a great way to begin to build familiarity with the Bible and to learn how to read the Bible in different ways than we're used to. I would absolutely recommend taking this class. I don't think there's a single reason not to.",
    "As someone without a religious background, this class was a really good way for me to become more familiar with the Bible; I didn't feel daunted by the material. The workload isn't too much (non pre-1800s track) with only 3 essays and two shorter assignments. The reading amount is not too bad, about 40 pages\/class.",
    "Fair workload, great reading list, excellent teaching. Professor Brisman is wonderful. The approach the course takes towards the text requires some adjusting to, but the class environment was always respectful. A challenging course, but completely worth it. Stretches students as readers, writers, thinkers. One of the best (if not THE best) of the English courses I have taken here.",
    "Wonderful course that both teaches you how to read and enjoy the Bible (as Nemerov's art history course might teach you how to appreciate art) and improves your writing skills. Professor Brisman is such a clever and poetic guy. Sitting in class and listening to his well-thought out lectures really gets to the heart of what humanities at Yale is all about.",
    "Bible as Literature is an attempt to highlight and investigate the multivocality of the Torah and the New Testament through their analysis as literary objects. Whether you come from a religious background or not, I would fully recommend this course.",
    "This course is a survey of the bible via the lens of multivocality. Each seminar is based on close reading of portions of the assigned text and one learns to read the bible from a literary perspective. That is to say, there are no assumptions in this course other than it is a work of literature, so it is as rigorous as one can get when approaching a text. Very insightful readings and lively discussions make this course one of the best at yale.",
    "Take it! The Bible is a foundational document, and Prof. Brisman is the best person to study it with\u0097and one of the best professors to study with at Yale, period. So good. So important. So inspiring. If you care about your own intellect, you'll love this class.",
    "A really wonderful class. Brisman is *brilliant* and brings you to think in ways you would not have before.",
    "Take this class! The reading is largely self-directed, and it is important that you keep up with the pace of the class, but it's definitely worth the time. Even if you're not an English or Literature major, the class provides a refreshing look at a highly canonical collection of works. You don't have to know anything about the Bible coming in to the class, but you'll certainly leave with a much better knowledge -- and a really informed look at questions of translation and syntax. The first assignment is intense, but not impossible, and well worth an essay during shopping period. You'll be glad you took this class.",
    "I highly recommend taking EGL 395. Yes, the course is challenging, but Professor Brisman offers a great deal of help and resources throughout the semester. The class is also set up to have a small lecture on one day of the week and a seminar the other day of the week. This setup allows the course to narrow its focus as the week goes on.",
    "I would recommend this class if you're an English major. It's useful to have a working knowledge of important Bible stories and Professor Brisman definitely provides that. However, if you're looking for a seminar where you'll get to discuss with other students a lot, look elsewhere. Classes consist of mostly just Professor Brisman talking and while he's brilliant, there's not as much opportunity for speaking in class as I would have liked. If you're interested at all in learning about the Bible in a literary context, whether or not you're familiar with it, this is a great place to start.",
    "I would recommend this course to students who do not know much about the bible and wish to gain an overview. The course can drag occasionally, but is typically interesting. It does have a fair amount of work, particularly if taken for pre-1900 literature credit.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone interested in learning more about the Bible and approaching the book in a traditionally unconventional way. I had extremely limited knowledge of the Bible coming into the class, but after the first couple of classes I didn't find myself at a disadvantage, so don't let the fear that others have grown up reciting verses deter you from taking this class. What is more, Professor Brisman is a knowledgeable and accommodating professor who nicely intertwines personal anecdotes to supplement the lesson and liven up class periods.",
    "A sweeping and incredibly worthwhile study of the Bible. This class isn't easy, but boy is it worth it. Prof. Brisman is brilliant, devoted, and a wonderful teacher (and an exacting grader). This class is a must take if you've read the Bible and even more so if (like me) you haven't.",
    "Instead of aiming to provide a more total sense of any part of the Bible, this course moves pretty quickly through the Hebrew Bible and the New Testament, using certain questions--like revision, intercalation, reinterpretation--as a window into the different Biblical writers' concerns, theological preoccupations, and stylistic tendencies. You really do start to see the Bible as a marvelous collection of books, and you have to grapple with all of the complications of that collection-ness. I would recommend this course. I didn't get the full sense of certain things in the Bible that I was hoping for, but I definitely feel that the Bible is open to me in new ways, and the course holds together well over the semester.",
    "Of course. Basically a must-take.",
    "Yes! You will have to read a lot of the Bible for the course, but the engagement with the material during class is well worth it.",
    "Yes, absolutely. It is a class that you should not leave Yale without. (That is to say it is both something you shouldn't let go to waste and also something you should feel obligated to take even if you do not want to.) Said another way: The Bible is something useful and meaningful with which to engage for an entire semester. Professor Brisman has a way with words. He knows what direction each seminar should take, and he's not afraid to lead the class there. This is commendable. He also fills each class period with wonderful personal stories, which are both funny and also full of a strange (and touching) degree of pathos. The class is also challenging in a lot of ways. (Namely, work-wise and mind-wise.) For those of faith, it really makes you think about what your faith means and how it is\/ isn't necessarily rational. It involves re-reading so many of the texts (and with great rigor) that you are (quite possibly) intimately aware of and thinking about them in what perhaps may be a radically new light. The workload is also extensive, particularly for the pre-1800 people.",
    "You should absolutely take this class. If you're pretty unfamiliar with the Bible (as I was) then the class is perfect for introducing you to one of the most important and influential works you can read. If you do know the Bible well, the class allows you to approach it from a very different perspective. The purpose of the class is to read the Old and New Testaments through a literary lens, i.e. finding justification for a problematic portion that doesn't rely on theology or history. Professor Brisman is amazing. He knows the material to an unbelievable extent, devises excellent lesson plans but doesn't shy from deviating from them when the discussion calls for it, and puts a lot of time and effort into his invaluable paper comments. He really pushes and brings out the best in his students. And as a bonus to all that, there isn't that much work. Three papers totaling 18 pages, only two of which count towards the final grade, two short assignments at the beginning of the class and at the beginning of the New Testament, and a brief final exam that doesn't count towards the grade. Take the class.",
    "Yes, Brisman is great. You'll gain a well needed introduction to one of the most important texts in the western canon",
    "I would recommend this class. Important material, obviously, and a very knowledgeable professor who takes your written work seriously.",
    "I took the class Cr\/D and loved it. Class discussions are always interesting, and frankly, you don't really need to do the reading to get along (although if you don't actually want to do the reading, you probably shouldn't be taking the class). Professor Brisman only gives grades for the papers on request (and the final barely affects your grade), which I liked a lot, but those taking the class for a grade found it a little frustrating."
