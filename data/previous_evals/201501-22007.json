   "comments": [
    "ENGL 135 is a great class for the inexperienced poet, but I imagine that people with some formal education in poetry should probably skip it for a more advanced class. The curriculum varies pretty substantially by instructor, so be sure to check their reviews; Margaret Ross is excellent. The weekly exercises are fun, and you can probably get away with bullshitting them, but if you don't care to do the class right, do everyone else a favor and take something else.",
    "While the class turned out to be more work than I expected with the original professor, it became it great poetic training. The class had weekly poetry readings (from both well known and lesser known poets) and exercises based on the topic for that week (varying from form, space, meter, etc.). We also had workshops in which we read and critique poems written by our fellow classmates in which each person was up for workshop 2-3 times. We were expected to attend a couple of poetry readings over the course of the semester and recite some poetry ourselves in class. The work was manageable but it's definitely not a gut if that's what you're looking for. If you are actually a poet, it's a valuable way to get your work looked at while learning from Prof. Ross who also offers to look at your work personally. Prof. Ross is sweet and inexperienced (at the moment) but that inexperience makes her class unpredictable, interesting, and flexible to the students interests.",
    "Yes I would recommend this course. It gives a great introduction to reading poems critically. The best part of the course is how much you get to write and rework your ow pieces. There is no lack of creative freedom.",
    "This class was amazing! The workload is very reasonable and does not feel like work, as it is very enjoyable. The seminar setting is great for an open discussion and you will feel inclined to join in, whether or not you like to speak much in other classes. I would definitely reccommend this class to anyone of any major.",
    "Yes, most definitely - especially for people who are new to poetry."
