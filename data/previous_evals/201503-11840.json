   "comments": [
    "This is a wonderful class! Sections are small, (only about 12 kids) so you really get to know your professor and classmates well. You generally have readings due before each class which you then discuss. You write 3-4 papers throughout the semester. You also analyze society and history through a specific lens which is interesting and eye opening.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who wants to improve essay writing skills while learning and discussing an interesting topic. Understanding some of the readings, like Heidegger's, and writing the assignments is likely to take much more time than time spent on other courses. Still, this should not deter you from taking the course.",
    "I would most definitely recommend this class to a fellow student as it is a class that transforms how you write, read and generally perceive things.",
    "Dear Freshman, please reconsider your decision on taking ENGL 114 because it is not what you think. Although ENGL 114 is widely advertised to all freshman, and you are strongly encouraged by many people to take it, I don't think this class really prepares you for academical writing. I will not evaluate and criticize this course in general because this is the only section I've taken, but I will give a example to show why this may not worth your time. Our first reading assignment is Martin Heidegger's work. This reading is not bad, but it does not function well as our topic for our first analytical essay. And since it is so abstract, there really isn't much concrete discussion happening. This is only one incident showing why taking this class might not be a pleasurable experience, but there are many more.",
    "All eng 114 classes seemed to have a lot of work but the class is helpful for your writing which is very important. This class sounded like one of the best ones because had a great class and the teacher was awesome",
    "This class was an exploration of the role of both literal and figurative objects within the lives of humans. I would recommend it to others because of its intriguing topic and great readings."
