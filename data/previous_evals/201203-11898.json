   "comments": [
    "A good class on linguistics, however you will not walk away with intro-linguistics knowledge. Definitely take it if you are looking to understand how to write about language as well as how to do some great research.",
    "This course is excellent for someone interested in linguistics from a political and anthropological lens. The lecture does cover some basic ideas of linguistics through grammar and phonology, but always linked to the idea of language diversity. Prof. Anderson has a unique lecture style, so it is worth making sure that it works for you (if it does, this can be a very good class. its just a matter of personal preference). At the same time, he is very knowledgable about the material and the context of language endangerment and diversity is so interesting that it is totally worth it. fund and thought provoking",
    "I would recommend this class if you need a chill writing credit.",
    "Basically a class to understand how many languages there are in a world through a variety of lenses.",
    "interesting topics though you have to write 5 essays, a term paper and weekly reading responses (short quests). Grading is tough and you do not get enough feedback. If TA changes, I would recommend to take this class. Don't think about it as a gut class -actually, linguistic requires a pretty scientific approach.",
    "This is a good writing credit for someone looking for a more scientific kind of writing. The material is very interesting, although it seems a bit redundant at times.",
    "You only have so many classes to take at Yale. Take only if truly interested in Linguistics. Was a rather dry class and a bit hard to go to class at times. I would strongly consider looking elsewhere to take a gut class, as it is not quite a gut."
