   "comments": [
    "If you want to take a class that will immerse you in the great tradition of Italian film and give you a route into the history of Italian political and cultural life since the turn of the century, all while watching incredible films that will change your perception of cinema today and in general, take Prof. Marcus's class!I would highly recommend this class.",
    "Italian 595 covers the hallmarks of the Italian neorealist film movement, as well as several expansions or disruptions of neorealism. The readings and Professor Marcus's lectures greatly elucidate the films, and you will leave each week feeling as though you have a very solid grasp of the film that was discussed. I would absolutely recommend the course.",
    "I would probably say that it was a very good course to take to get an overview of Neorealism as a whole. Given the focus of the course it would be less useful for someone wanting to concentrate on one specific director, but it would be great for anyone interested in film or in this period of Italian history. I'd recommend it.",
    "Yes I would recommend this class to any graduate student interested in Italian and film studies. It is a great introduction and investigation into Italian Neorealism.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class, which deals with the main issues raised by Nearealism: what do we mean by realism? and how this problem of representation has been dealt by Italian Cinema?"

   "comments": [
    "This course helped to broaden my own personal views on having an Italian background. It changed how I view cinema, and gave me more perspective on art. While it had no direct effect on how I play the violin, for example, through this class I was given the opportunity to write a film score, and I have a new appreciation for the composition of film music, and a deeper understanding of all of the facets of cinema.I also have a new-found appreciation for art critics, and their responsibilities to art as intellectual mirrors, as ways for interested parties to get at the intent of the art through understanding the various contexts in which the art was created. There is an art to criticism as well!It contributed to my research in that it gave me wider perspective on the applications of music and composition in the world, and was a generally inspiring course filled with brilliant students and a brilliant teacher.",
    "This course opened my eyes to the exciting, intriguing world of Italian cinema. I want to add film to my research interests, and I credit Professor Marcus and this course for beginning what I hope will be a long line of fruitful incursions into Italian films.",
    "This course allowed me to broaden my knowledge of Italian film studies, it will be invaluable for my career and I will always be thankful to Prof. Marcus for it",
    "The course was very helpful for my coursework, since Neorealism was a big gap in my knowledge of Italian cinema. It is also helpful for more general issues about realism that concern also literature and other visual arts."
