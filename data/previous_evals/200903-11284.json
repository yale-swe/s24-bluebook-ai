    "I would definitely recommend this class to anyone even remotely interested in Latin America. What is great about the course is you are able to draw from your past courses and build upon the ideas learned in micro and macro. It is also a great class for juniors looking for a senior project. There is a lot to be learned from Latin America.",
    "Yes! You'll learn a lot about very interesting stuff. It's an amazing class, the readings are very interesting and the discussions very engaging.BUT, be warned, that it is A LOT of work. A LOT of work. You'll read so much each week and then write about three short essays each week. In the end though, the work is definitely worth it.Another thing about the class is that we wrote so many short essays each week but rarely got any feedback. It's not that I care about the grade, but I wanted to know if I was doing the essays right, if I could improve somehow, if I had to change something. But instead, we just got a couple of essays back with a rather uninformative check mark.",
    "This seminar is an intense crash course about Latin America's modern economic history and the challenges it faces. If you are interested in the topic, you will learn so so much from this course. I recommend it highly, but be advised that the seminar's weekly assignments and readings are extensive.",
    "Definitely take it. It's a lot of work, but you also learn a lot. It's a good class to see all the theory that you have learned in the intermediate courses being applied to interesting cases. After this class, every single concept in macroeconomics finally makes perfect sense. Workload is heavy - you basically have to write 5-7 pages of essays every week. However, these help you focus on what's important in the readings and they also make discussion in seminar more focused and interesting. Prof. Engel is very good at leading discussion - he tries to make sure that everyone's questions get answered and he also devotes enough time to explain any new concepts that may have appeared in discussion. He's also a very nice man, and he really cares about you learning the material that he is teaching you and would always welcome questions from you after class. He really wants to get to know his students - we had lunch with him once on a Friday. Anyways, this seminar is definitely one of the best courses I have taken at Yale, so don't miss out on it!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. You will learn how economic theory relates to reality and how economic research is use to formulate policy.",
    "Econ 463 is a great class. You learn about the different policies that have been tried in Latin America to improve growth and how those policies end up working out. You leave the class with a great sense of the current debates in the literature. Professor Engel is great. He manages to keep the class on task and introduce funny and relevant stories about his experiences.",
    "I would definitely recommend it. An amazing course for all of the reasons above...My only complaint: the grading was very slow. However, that in itself is hardly a complaint at all. The class was very interesting, particularly if you have any interest in the region at all, and Professor Engel was always very engaging. I have no regrets about taking this seminar and I would recommend it to anyone else who is considering it. An amazing course.",
    "YES! One of the best, if not the best, classes I've taken at Yale. Professor Engel is really engaging and an excellent seminar leader. There's weekly assignments instead of a final or final paper, which makes the discussion much more fun because everyone has to do the reading. Also, come exam week, it's great to have no work left! I wish all classes in the Econ department were like this.",
    "You are going to learn a lot. You are going to read a LOT. But at the end of the day, someone will come up to you and ask, \"what's up with Latin America?\" and you will remember more than your fair share of problems to talk about. It's a lot of work, but good.",
    "Best class I've taken at Yale, hands down. Application of economic principles in the real world. If you're interested in economic development, policy, developing countries, Latin America, the biggest political and economic issues of our time, etc, then definitely take this course.The downside is that it is also the hardest (most work) class I've taken at Yale, hands down. Expect an average of 150 pages of reading and 1500-2000 words of writing PER WEEK, with a couple of problems sets and a presentation thrown in.",
    "Definitely. Professor Engel is brilliant and amazing. Be warned the essays each week are a lot of work, but they ensure that everyone does the reading, which helps discussion immensely.",
    "Econ463 is a great course to take if you're interested in macroeconomics and\/or Latin America. Be prepared though, you will do A LOT of work - there are assignments due on a weekly basis, but the reward is no final paper.Professor Engel teaches a great seminar with a good balance of lecture and discussion and is also very entertaining. I conside this course to be one of the best I've taken at Yale.",
    "First 2\/3 of the course:First-rate. After taking this course, I probably know more about the economics of Latin America than the US. The workload is pretty heavy--you have to read 2-3 papers per week and write 2-3 short essays (500 words), but you will learn a ton about economic conditions in Latin America, and class discussions are great because the short essays force everyone to do all of the readingLast 1\/3 of the class: way, way too much work. By this time the professor was having us read 4, 5, 6, or more papers per week. I have to think that the professor simply didn't realize how unreasonable the workload became. While it's true that there's no final exam or paper, you'll still probably do more work in this class than any of your other classes all year.",
    "Yes. No final paper, and the assignments and professor force you to get a lot out of class. Everyone has done the reading every week in order to crank out the assignment, so class discussions are interesting."
