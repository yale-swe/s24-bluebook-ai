    "I'd describe the class as one which treats the topic of identity more from an epistemological than an ethical perspective. Depending on the student's interests, I would highly recommend the course to another student.",
    "I would describe the course as an excellent introduction to the field of Personal Identity and would recommend it to a fellow student who did not have much exposure to the area already, as a good way into it. I would also recommend it to fellow students who feel they benefit from courses with greater structure, as that was provided by the weekly responses, mid term paper etc.I would not recommend this course to higher level students who already had a grounding in the basics of personal identity, on the grounds they might be disappointed with the level of discussion sometimes."
