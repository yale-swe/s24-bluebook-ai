   "question_text": "What knowledge, skills, and insights did you develop by taking this course?",
   "comments": [
    "I learned a lot about philosophy in theory and in practice.",
    "Learned a huge amount about different systems of education and the motivations behind them, mostly through class discussions and reading 10-15 different authors' works.",
    "Knowledge of the history and nuances of various ideas about education, its purpose, and how best to fulfill that purpose.",
    "This course gave an overview of the relevant philosophical frameworks in the field of education, but it mainly focused on political philosophy. We started with a modern interpretation of the meaning of education, then dived into literature of philosophers like Plato, Rousseau, Fichte, Dewey, Du Bois, Carter G. Woodson, and Danielle Allen, and their respective conceptions of the ideal society and the associated education systems. I would say initially my understanding of philosophy is that it deals with more abstract entities, but this course complements this perspective by exploring the more tangible relationship between individuals and the society, and how education systems can be utilised to achieve the political ideal.",
    "knowledge about philosophy and applying it to the modern world",
    "I learned a lot about important philosophers, how to handle higher reading loads, and thought critically about the structure of society and subsequent design of education.",
    "This course provided me with the traditional foundational philosophies, Plato, Rousseau, Fichte, Du Bois, and Woodson among others. I learned how to synthesize complex texts so that I could dissect and challenge the theories and connect them to contemporary issues in my reading responses, essays, and class discussions. I learned how to be flexible in my thinking, often arriving at class having understood the text in one sense and then leaving with another understanding after a conversation between classmates and the professor.",
    "This course examines perspectives on what an ideal education should look like ( should education strive to be democratic, or are other goals more important?). The first half of the course discusses early classics like Plato and Rousseau, and the second half tackles radical theories by people like Paolo Freire.",
    "As an education scholar, it was a great way to explore the theories of education outside of methods.",
    "Stanley divided the course into interesting units and philosophies to help us understand how education systems support and relate to political systems.",
    "This course was an excellent introduction to philosophies on education, starting with Plato and working towards Freire and Danielle Allen. The course dives into how education and democracy interact, including how the principles of liberty and equality come into play (or don't come into play) and what those consequences may be. Overall, this is not a course exploring what methods of teaching are most effective or such; it is a course that meaningfully explores what the fundamental goals of an education should be, and how the effects differ when the intents are different.",
    "I developed my writing and thinking skills. This class gave me the tools to more critically examine the media I consumed, and recognize the ways the institutions I took part in oppressed people."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This course was my favorite class this semester. The only thing I would say is maybe more organization around larger assignments.",
    "Great readings & discussions. Strength is definitely the professor. Prof. Stanley is a great mind and that really shows in class. I would recommend NOT taking it if it's at 9 am however... that's pretty early",
    "The material is mostly interesting. More graded writing with feedback would be helpful.",
    "The strength of this course is that it aims to cover a wide range of philosophical thoughts anchored in different societal contexts, which is very interesting as we can explore a variety of perspectives. The class is small, so we can have a more engaged discussion. Professor Stanley is effective in organizing discussions. We could juxtapose modern day observations and current affairs with the philosophyical ideas in class. Professor Stanley is also very flexible in syllabus and class discussion as he allows us to raise questions and discuss topics which are not in the syllabus but relevant to understand the material. Overall, I found the course really thought-provoking and I felt I personally learnt a lot. The weakness of this course is also to do with the material. We were covering a lot of material in one term so I felt it was a bit rush. Sometimes the discussion in class was a bit too broad and I felt we could have dived in deeper. Moreover, I personally really hope other branches of philosophy could be covered in this course, besides political philosophy. The reading can be heavy sometimes.",
    "- strengths: discussion, applied to many different topics - weakness: reading workload impossible",
    "Strengths: Professor Stanley is a funny and interesting man, he goes very much in depth about the covered topics, and Professor Stanley allows class discussion to be guided by what students are interested in. Workload is very manageable and some of the readings are very interesting. Weaknesses: If students don't come in with talking points, it can get a bit slow. Professor Stanley also cold calls a lot, which can be a bit intimidating.",
    "This course depends upon input from the students to facilitate a conversation between the professor and students. Professor Stanley would always add knowledge about contemporary issues or guiding questions to help steer the conversation and further our discussion. However, because the class met at 9am twice a week and had about 50 or more pages of reading per class, it sometimes was obvious that very few people had done the readings \/ were prepared to discuss them. In the future, (or for any 9am seminar class) I would recommend that the professor assign specific sections of the text to be read and also require reading responses so that they can ensure that students do at least some of the reading and therefore can have an even more engaging class discussion.",
    "The class is a small lecture, but feels like a seminar. This format makes it easier for students to engage. However, I sometimes felt like it was difficult for students to challenge the predominantly held views in the classroom.",
    "Strength: class discussion was lively Weakness: sometimes slightly disorganized",
    "I would say the biggest strength of this course was the discussion-based classroom style. We all sat in a circle and discussed what we interpreted of the readings.",
    "This course was always the highlight of my day! Professor Stanley very strongly engaged us in discussion, and the readings were well planned in that we could build each idea off of each other!"

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Yes!! I think learning about the philosophy of education is a really important thing for everyone and this class did a great job of it!!",
    "Yes of course.",
    "Yes, if you can tolerate professorial idiosyncrasy, the material is rather interesting.",
    "Yes. This course was very informative to learn about different perceptions of education and what it should look like. This class, however, is shaped by student response and engagement, so be willing to voice your opinion and topics that matter to you if you want to hear them discussed.",
    "I would recommend this course if you want to learn more about the function and philosophy behind a education system in the context of a society. It would help a lot if you have some foundation in political philosophy so you can grasp the connection between the conception of the society and the associated educational system more easily. It is totally ok if you are new to philosophy as well, as Professor Stanley tries his best to explain the concepts in more understandable language than the readings do, even though you are expected to assimilate the material after class in your own time to fully grasp the material.",
    "Yes, instructor is amazing not because of his specifically great structure or punctuality but because of the experience and knowledge he has about the topic and the world and him sharing the knowledge is both impressive and enlightening.",
    "Yes, it is a great introduction to philosophy in a low-stress environment. Professor Stanley gives students considerable flexibility to pursue any of the broad array of themes in the course.",
    "Yes!! I would highly recommend this course to another student, particularly those who have not yet pursued any philosophy courses and want to gain an understanding of at least foundational theories. However, this course excels because Professor Stanley includes philosophies that discuss black feminist thought, epistemic injustices, feminism, racism in the US, and fascism, all of which address and challenge power structures. He also encourages us to connect these topics to contemporary issues and our own personal lives.",
    "Take this class if youre interested in learning about education from a leftist perspective. Its a good intro level course for people who havent necessarily taken philosophy classes before",
    "Yes, it was great!",
    "Yes",
    "I would recommend this course to any other student, especially those interested in taking an introductory philosophy course. I think Professor Stanley does a great job of trying to include everyone and their thoughts into the conversation and the readings are eye-opening.",
    "This class is a must take for anyone even slightly interested in education, advocacy, racial issues, politics! For a first year who had never taken a philosophy class in his life, this class made complex topics very easy to understand!"
