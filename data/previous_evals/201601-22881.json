   "comments": [
    "I will absolutely recommend it to more students.",
    "Pretty standard introduction to GR. Covers basics of Manifolds and curved spacetime, Einstein's equations, relativistic stars + black holes, and cosmology. Uses primarily Wald. I would have preferred the course if there had been more physics and less math, and if we had followed Sean Carroll's book instead of Wald's. Some homework sets were fairly difficult, but Moncrief is very helpful at office hours. Not too much work overall. Both of the midterms were take-home exams. This made the course much less stressful, though they *were* somewhat difficult.",
    "I would highly recommend - outstanding introduction to the beautiful subject.",
    "This course is an excellent introduction to the mathematics of General Relativity and some important topics therein. The class was well-organized in the beginning, but near the end, the topics and problem sets were a little less coordinated. There are two take-home exams, both of which were a little lengthy, but (in my opinion) preferable to in-class exams. Professor Moncrief was quite responsive and very approachable.",
    "This is a good intro to GR course. It follows Carrol more than Wald, Some differential geometry may be a little helpful at first but not necessary. Challenging but not impossible.",
    "This is a wonderful topic, and since it is one of the two pillars of modern physics, I think any physics student should take it. It is definitely doable for an undergraduate student. Problem sets are very hard, and take an enormous amount of time, but there's only 5 throughout the semester. There are two take-home exams, with open-book and open-notes. They also take a lot of time, but are very doable and you end up learning a lot of cool stuff. All that being said, Moncrief is not the best educator (nor horrible, but not the best). He is absurdly knowledgeable, smart and can answer all questions though. It requires some self study if you are going to really get what is going on, I recommend Susskind's online lectures and the MTW textbook. Overall, recommend the course."

    "The course helped my to really understand the main ideas of general relativity. I'm sure it will contribute to my dissertation.",
    "This course has been absolutely eye-opening to me. It's just a fascinating topic, and Einstein offers a really different approach to physical law."
