   "comments": [
    "Awesome class! You go through the molecular and cellular mechanisms for many aspects of the immune response, and it is fascinating! There were lots of different lecturers, but for the most part they were good. There are four problem sets, one midterm, and a final. A lot of material, but if you're interested, it will be a blast. One of the best classes I've taken at Yale so far.",
    "If there were a \"top 10 classes to take at Yale before you graduate\" for science majors, this class would certainly be towards the top of the list. The class is team taught, and you get the opportunity to hear lectures from the professors who made the discoveries and are actively researching the topics you learn about. The course is well organized, and workload is definitely manageable: there's only one midterm and a final. Definitely take this class!",
    "I would absolutely recommend Biology of the Immune System to my classmates. This is a fantastic survey class that covers the complexities of the immune system. I honestly want to go into immunology now that I've taken this class. The work is very reasonable, and section is helpful. I would recommend that students who take this class take several days before the midterms\/finals to review all of the lectures, as you are expected to know a lot of detail.",
    "Really really interesting class. Love the topics we cover! The immune system is so fascinating! I do, however, wish the lectures were organized better. It was difficult at the beginning of the year because they jump around a lot.",
    "Probably the bio lecture that's most relevant and directly applicable to real life. The field is changing rapidly (some of the things we learn have only been discovered within the past year or so), and it's amazing to have the opportunity to learn directly from the people who are at the forefronts of discovery. It's an intense class with a ton of information to memorize, but it's worth it. At least try to take it Credit\/D. Even though all of the lectures are recorded, still go because the videos are bad quality and missed lectures can build up quickly.",
    "Immunology is a great class, and if you are interested in the material, I would highly recommend it! I am a Biomedical Engineering student, and I took it just because it I was interested, and the physiology class I took last year did not cover immunology. Be prepared, though, there is a lot of material to learn, but the homework and tests aren't that difficult as long as you've gone over all the lectures once. If you are able to keep up with the lectures, then the class won't be that bad, but if you fall behind (like I did) the week before the exam will be very difficult. However, the concepts aren't that hard and the material is fascinating. I would highly recommend MCDB 430. This was probably the most interesting biology class I've taken at Yale. I feel like really understand the immune system and all its complexities, and I've realized it's even more awesome than I thought it was before I took the class.",
    "Overall, this was a very nice course and very enjoyable. I learned a lot.",
    "'I would not recommend this class unless you are a bio major who thrives on detail. Because this class is taught by so many professors, it felt disjointed and it was hard to see the big picture. The professors are not engaged, there are no office hours, and TAs run much of the class. It is also very easy to fall behind the material, since there are only 4 problem sets, a midterm, and a final. Take with caution. Also, the syllabus is posted online, and it's actually more like lecture notes than syllabus. If you're thinking of taking this class, look through that - it's exactly what you'll be learning.",
    "MCDB 430 is a very engaging course that requires a great deal of preparation. As this course progressed, I needed to re-evaluate my study strategies and employ new study methods that would better suit the complexity and interaction of the ideas discussed. It is essential that you gain a thorough understanding of the concepts presented in the beginning of the lecture; each concept later in the course builds greatly on the ones before it. Be sure to read the book in its entirety, and study this material every day. This will be essential to keeping up in class and solidifying your comprehension of the course material.",
    "This is a good class, but I'd recommend taking it Cr\/D\/Fail because of how easily you can get docked for not having specific pieces of information. It consists of a midterm, four \"take-home questions,\" a final, and a participation grade (so there's section, which doesn't meet every week though). Immuno is like most biology courses, mostly memorization. Having grad students in the class is tough because a lot of them have already taken immunobiology. However, you do get instructed by some of the best researchers in the country.",
    "A very good overview of immunology. It's great learning from professors who are leading researchers in the topics they cover in class. I like the blackboard format too. However, class can be somewhat disjointed since there are so many lecturers. But if you're interested in immunology\/serious about science, definitely take this class!",
    "As a senior, I wasn't very motivated for this class. There are a lot of details that need to be remembered for the tests. But for all you immuno lovers out there, take it!",
    "it can be really interesting at times but also confusing, very detail-oriented and pretty competitive. i would say it is a good class to take if you are willing to put a lot of time and effort into it",
    "YES! Its a great immunology course. The professors are all very passionate and top of the field. Of course, some were better and more organized than others, but the good ones made up for the not as good ones. If you are doing research in the immunobiology department, you should definitely take the class. The workload is very manageable: 4 psets, 1 midterm and 1 final. The final was surprisingly harder than the midterm. There is section held every other week, so that was nice too.",
    "Take this class if you are interested in immunology. The lecturers are overall very good, and you will learn so so much. Be prepared to work for this course because there is A LOT of information."
