   "comments": [
    "Receiving feedback from your classmates can be extremely helpful, particularly in the early stages of your project. Josh Knobe is a great discussion facilitator and is extremely knowledgeable about every subfield of cognitive science. About the senior project itself: accept the fact that it is going to take longer to complete than you expect, no matter how early you start. Try to do as much as you can during the Fall semester, particularly if you are doing a neuroimaging experiment of some kind.",
    "I mean, you don't really have a choice. But you'll enjoy it!",
    "The reason to be a cog sci major is the colloquium.",
    "if you're a senior in cogsci you're taking this. start your project early.",
    "You have to take this class - but luckily it's amazing! You get to know all the cog sci majors and the awesome, cutting-edge research they are working on. I don't know if he'll teach it next year, but Joshua Knobe was also fantastic at spurning interesting discussion and providing strong support on how to advance with your projects.",
    "Presentations from fellow students on their research and interesting discussion on many topics. Definitely would recommend for all CGSC seniors, besides, its a requirement.",
    "This review is not terribly helpful, since no one takes this class except for cog sci seniors and all of them are required to do so. However, I enjoyed this class, so if you're taking it, know that it's a fun way to build towards a senior essay and it's only a pity that more majors don't have a similar system.",
    "This is one of the wonderful things about being a cogsci major. One semester of wonderful faculty presentations and discussions, one semester of your classmates discussing their research and ideas. If you go early enough, you can really workshop your project and get great feedback. And going back and forth with people who speak your language--fabulous!",
    "It's a good class. You get to hear a very broad survey of different ideas in cognitive science (maybe too broad), as well as hear what other students are working on."
