   "comments": [
    "How to strategically think about and implement a project",
    "I learned how to identify problems in global health, marshall resources to address them, and anticipate challenges I might encounter.",
    "I learned a lot about how to apply strategic thinking to a diverse array of global health concerns. This class gave me a framework for thinking about how to mitigate unintended consequences, work with limited resources, and achieve a targeted aim.",
    "I got so much out of this course. I learned how to think critically about how to frame policy decisions within politically charged contexts and how to think about isolating a problem and setting realistic objectives. This was absolutely the perfect end to the GH Fellows program, and an experience that I'm truly thankful for. I think I got more real-life skills out of this course (e.g., presentation skills, policy writing, etc.) than any of my other policy-relevant courses.",
    "Learned about strategic thinking in global health, how to scope + analyze a problem, harness stakeholder support, consider historical context, and present formally about a complex topic. Felt like a good capstone to the GHS program.",
    "Gained opportunity to expand my way of thinking about a specific problem, and then got to delve into that problem and try to come up with a big solution throughout the semester."

   "comments": [
    "This is an incredible course! You end up with a piece of writing that you will be proud of at the end.",
    "I thought the class was expertly designed and taught. There was a great balance of case study work with a focus on our specific issues that we each chose. I really liked the model of the class - overview of concepts, and then application for the rest of the class, it felt incredibly hands-on. One suggestion I might make is to learn about a concept and then have the optional writing assignments due the week after, instead of due on the same day that we cover that topic in class, just so that there's a bit more of an opportunity to get a grasp on the conceptual material before going out and applying it to our topic. I also think that students who know that they want to take the class should be encouraged to prime themselves around a topic by doing some kind of policy internship over the summer or during the semester, so that the project will be as practical as possible. I felt like I was much more invested in the project because of my specific policy interests, and I think passion is something Prof. Curry really encouraged here.",
    "This course was awesome! Would recommend pushing back the weekly assignments by 1 week. So, for example, we have the landscape assessment class and then during the week that follows do our own. This would help our work more closely reflect what is ideal. Strengths = small class size and ability to engage on a real level with other GHS and a professor who is awesome and we know well.",
    "New class, so as it continues the logistical things will get ironed out."

    "Absolutely! If you love global health and want to create some real change in the world, you NEED this class!",
    "Absolutely! The content is critical to all who are considering pursuing careers in global health, and Professor Curry is among the best I had at Yale.",
    "this class is great if you have an area of interest or a problem in mind that you want to work on. It's not too much work, and I think improved organization of the class next year will help lighten the burden of the work for big assignments. Prof. Curry is wonderful and very reasonable. Take this class!",
    "I would highly recommend this course to another student who wants to really take hold of a policy issue in GH and take it to the next level. Professor Curry is absolutely incredible, so do not pass up this opportunity!!",
    "Absolutely yes!!! I learned a lot, wasn't a lot of work, and Leslie Curry is amazing. It was fun to work with the other GHS. Readings were helpful and not too heavy. Learned a lot, and felt a lot more practical than other GH classes. My favorite part was that things felt more complex than in other GH classes, we acknowledged that most GH challenges are really hard to solve and then thought really pragmatically.",
    "Yes, it really allows you to take a new approach to problem solving. Prof Curry is great, and your TF can make a huge difference since they take care of all the logistics of the class. Global Health Scholars will benefit from taking this class, it is a great way to think differently about what we've been learning for so many years."
