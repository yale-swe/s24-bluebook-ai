   "comments": [
    "The content of this course was very interesting, but I thought that it was really difficult to do a systematic review without actually learning how to do one as a part of the class instruction. Luckily my partner had done one before, but without that I would have been completely lost. It is a great skill to have and I like the project a lot, but I think we needed to be taught how to do this in class if we are expected to do it.",
    "This course provided a nice overview of maternal and child health. It is one of the only courses at YSPH to provide instruction on this topic. We covered lots of relevant material and it was great to learn from the professor's expertise in the field.",
    "strengths: the professor (incredibly knowledgeable about the topics covered), format (good mix of lectures and student-led discussions), readings (not too much of it and focused on critical research)",
    "Strengths: The course taught me important skills regarding analyzing available knowledge while constantly and vigilantly improving your approach to Public Health. The professor brought a lot of his work experience into the course. The class has changed the way I think. Weaknesses: It felt like there was way too much emphasis on federal guidelines as the end approach. There are many available strategies for improving nutritional status. I wish we had talked more about some contemporary issues like golden rice or how monoculture effects nutrition. This would help bring the focus to how our world is being shaped and help us engage with this issue on multiple fronts. Some countries may have had an increase in status after a major world event or change in their society. But the issues were look almost at a strictly \"what should our advertisements say\" or \"what should this one specific government program do.\" These are not the only channels which affect peoples nutrition status.",
    "Over the course of the semester you will learn a tremendous amount about maternal and child public health nutrition, as well as how to write a systematic review. Dr. Perez-Escamilla is a leader in his field and is a role model in how to conduct research that drives policy.",
    "The course doesnt give students alot of opportunity for critical thinking or decision making, it is a good course for gaining a elementary understanding of child\/maternal nutrition and policies affecting it.",
    "Strengths: materal, layout of class Weaknesses: group projects can be difficult",
    "Rafael is extremely interesting and knowledgable. Loved all his anecdotes and experience. He is very inspirational. I really liked the organization of the class-- articles with written weekly summaries initially. Then, at the end as we got closer to the deadline for the systematic review we could focus on that without other assignments."
