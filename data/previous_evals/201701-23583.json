    "Honestly, I appreciate the constraints put on Mary and Luke by the software, but it would have been so much more helpful to have lab style classes where we worked through problem sets in Woodstock so that we could get more hands-on time with the software and a better sense of its utility. Some of the guest lecturers were a little dry and, without the software in front of us, it's hard to apply and retain what they're introducing.",
    "As and auditor, I am not the best person to comment in detail. I do think the materials are very valuable, and I am thinking of taking the course for credit in the future.",
    "The course was designed around several practitioners coming in to teach us about their experience with the subject matter. Unfortunately, this led to some inconsistency with the assignments, as well as some issues with instructors not being able to make it to class.",
    "This course was very frustrating and a poor use of my limited time as a student at FES. Learning the application of growth and yield modeling software is an important part of my interest in a career in forest management. I was very interested in applying principles I learned from Forest Ecosystem Finance, to the modeling software being taught in this course, however do not think that the course was organized well or taught effectively. I did not accomplish my goals for the course, and don't think most people did. About half of our assignments were canceled, either because they were poorly produced or no students understand the material. The class was only half a semester, and there were 2-3 classes that were just outright canceled, thus vastly limiting my availability to learn the material. The material covered was redundant and very broad, not actually training me in any concrete skills of anything. Overall, this is a very important part of an MF curriculum, but the way it was formatted and taught was incredibly ineffective. I now have a very surface level understanding of the concepts, but nothing more. Honestly, I probably could have gained this from reading a short book instead. My recommendation is to hire someone on who can teach the course once a week that has experience in a university setting with teaching and using growth and yield modeling software. If taught this way, with a strong lab component, the class should be made into a full 3 credit full semester course."

When a whole assignment gets scrapped from a half-semester course, its affects the learning outcomes adversely."
