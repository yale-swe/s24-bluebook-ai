    "Only take this class if you're really interested in learning specific grammar rules. There's not too much writing or literature involved, so it's a LOT of busy work and grammar exercises.",
    "FREN198 is a newly developed course that ultimately tries to prepare students interested in taking higher level French courses, as we learn \"grammar not simply for grammar's sake,\" to quote Mme Sherak, but simply to become better writers and to help us get better at revising our own writing. Although I can say that my writing has improved tremendously (in terms of grammar quality) I feel that the class lacked a bit of organization (which can be easily understood considering that it's a new course) and as such, did not reach its full potential. Nevertheless, one does cover a great amount of grammar within a short amount of time, resulting in better writing, and Mme Sherak is a very patient and understanding teacher.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course for anyone who is serious about improving their French. The course will offer a very useful review of advanced grammar concepts. If you really want to master the language, you almost have to take this course. With that said, the work load is probably heavier than the average upper level French class. So be prepared to take the class seriously and stay on top of your work, otherwise it can be frustrating. Regardless, it's worth it at the end because your French WILL improve. Take this class because Madame Sherak is a great instructor and the material is important.",
    "FREN 198 is a crash course in advanced French grammar, answering questions you have had since you started studying the language, such as rules for determining gender. It is a heavy workload, since you are learning the nit-picky rules of grammar, which are hard to learn without doing copious amounts of practice exercises. It does, however, greatly improve comprehension of the language and cements any grammar skills that had been a little iffy. Bottom line, if you love grammar and the French language, take it.",
    "Definitely recommended. It's a great way to improve your French and consolidate your understanding."
