   "comments": [
    "Lots of good stuff here. Should you take this class? Yes, unless: 1. You've already studied 2 or 3 or more novels on the syllabus. You're not going to go into any greater depth here than elsewhere, so at that point you might as well read the remainder in other courses\/on your own time. (except Zola . . . nobody got time for that) (except for hipsters in Ann Arbor) (and even then) 2. You don't care about literary history. A big part of the lectures is always situating the novels relative to each other in the French tradition. If you already sorta understand that tradition, or if that's not your thing in general, go close-read stuff with Duval, instead.",
    "I would wholeheartedly recommend this course to another student. The interaction between Professors Kaplan and Samuels are priceless, allowing for both moments of incredible insight as well as instances of utter hilarity. This class affords the opportunity to read classic French authors - Balzac, Proust, and Zola, among others - that you wouldn't normally have the motivation or background knowledge about French history to read on your own. The workload isn't overly excessive, either three medium length papers for a WR credit or a midterm, a paper, and a take-home final for non-WR. The reading can be a bit much at times but it is totally enjoyable reading, so it's not too overwhelming.",
    "Take it",
    "A solid syllabus. You read important novels that you otherwise wouldn't have had the occasion to read. I took the WR option, which requires 3 5-7 page papers- they took much out of me but I grew a lot from writing them. However, I had to rely mostly on my preparation from high school because the lectures were not very helpful, especially during the second half of the semester. Both professors are very charismatic people, but their lectures would benefit more from close analysis based on texual evidence. Author's bios and social background should not take up nearly important a role as they did. Section was more rewarding, as our TA picked out specific paragraphs from novels for us to analyze.",
    "Take this class. You will not regret it. This class gave me fun reading to do and still managed to be relevant to my life as a disillusioned STEM major! Doing the reading was often the highlight of my week actually. The papers seemed a bit contrived (it's hard to write in a focused manner when you are required to incorporate more than one work into a 5-7 page paper). But overall the papers served as a good way to delve into the aspects of the book that you actually found interesting. I liked the extracurricular activities too! And Professor Kaplan and Professor Samuels were so much fun to listen to.",
    "Great opportunity to read fantastic books. Remember, though, that it is a survey course, which means you won't go very in-depth with any novel. I personally wish I could have just taken an in-depth course on Flaubert and Proust; I prefer courses that go in-depth about a narrower topic. But some might appreciate the way this course introduces \/ orients you to French literature in a comprehensive way. Just think about what you want from a literature course! Finally, there's a lot of reading, but not much work, and great lectures.",
    "Good WR credit. Relatively painless and so enriching.",
    "If you're interested in reading amazing French literature, take this course! If you would like read and discuss in French, I highly recommend the French section.",
    "It is really really an amazing overview of French literature in the 19th and 20th Centuries. I would absolutely recommend it if you have any interest in French literature, literary analysis in general or just want to watch two amazing professors give lectures.",
    "Probably one of the best classes I've taken at Yale. Really engaging lectures on interesting novels that were fun to read. Obviously a good amount of reading, but it never really felt like a chore. Beyond reading, work is minimal. Short midterm and take-home final were no big deal, and the essay is decently straightforward with several prompt options. Overall, I learned a huge amount and really enjoyed every day of lecture and section. Given my background as a STEM major, this class really opened my eyes to the quality of humanities courses and the French department in general.",
    "It's a fast-paced survey of all the great French authors. I totally recommend if you're trying to cover all the greats in one class- but the reading can be a lot sometimes- especially towards the beginning of the year. As writers start using less words in the modern times, your reading becomes lighter! woo!",
    "Great course. Take the writing section.",
    "Amazing class",
    "Very good overview of frenh lit in the 19th century. Manageable and interesting readings. Was in the writing section, with 3 essays and no exams.",
    "Absolutely amazing. Take it!",
    "It's a lot of reading. I don't think I would take it again, but that's because I was not a huge fan of the novels",
    "Take this class if you can! The professors are fantastic and you will get a great introduction to some of the greats in the French canon. It is a lot of reading though so stay on top of it!",
    "Yes, fantastic course.",
    "Great introduction to some of the most important works of French literature. The lectures by professors Samuels and Kaplan are excellent--you should take the course, even if just for them.",
    "An incredible course in which you read a novel a week and discuss it with your classmates. One of the best classes I've ever taken.",
    "Take this class!",
    "Fantasticl overview of French literature from Stendhal to Duras. You get a great sense of the style and historical context of 9 key French authors. Definitely accessible and interesting to both those unfamiliar and familiar with the French canon. Professors Kaplan and Samuels do a phenomenal job of team-teaching (one takes the first half of lectures; the other takes the second half) and have a wonderfully banter-filled rapport during the \"debate\" section they do at the en dog each lecture. A fair amount of work if you do all the reading (especially in French), but easy enough to get by with reading enough to get the basics of each work\/author and going to lecture.",
    "It was an amazing course I learned so much and feel like I have such a good grasp of the French canon. I loved how the whole class felt like a tightly knit novel in itself.",
    "Great course. Very manageable in terms of workload and the books are all really fun to read. Both professors have their own styles, but generally give a good summary of what you need to know to understand not only the book itself but the general \"19th century French novel\" or \"20th century French novel.\" I'm not a humanities major at all, but I'm glad I took this class. Take it!",
    "very reading intensive, but the essay writing\/assignments are not unreasonable. roughly 90 pages of reading every 2 days.",
    "Absolutely! The professors are incredible, the reading list is amazing, and you'll really feel like you've learned something about French lit. Also, while there is a lot if reading, it wouldn't be a problem to not read every single page, as long as you have something to say about it.",
    "TAKE IT!!!! Kaplan and Samuels are fantastic lecturers and their structure of debating each other at the end of each lecture is so unique to my experiences of lecture courses at Yale and so deeply interesting, bringing such nuances to the topics of discussion. The book are so great - classics that should be read at some point in life. There is a lot of reading but it's possible to not do all of it and still be alright for the class.",
    "I would recommend this. The books were all a joy to read, although it is a substantial amount. Lecturers were amazing and so knowledgeable of the field. Keep up to date with reading to make the most of this class- I fell pretty behind. I was taking the English non-writing credit version.",
    "Great course. The syllabus (authors: Stendhal, Balzac, Zola, Proust, Sartre, Camus, Perec, Duras) takes you through the evolution of the French novel from the 1800s through the present day. Kaplan and Samuels are great lecturers -- their lectures incorporate both close-readings of the text as well as information about their authors and their status\/stature in french literary culture! These are two great professors. Samuels lectures on the 19th century novels -- this takes up half the semester and goes through Proust; Kaplan on the 20th century novels. At the end of each lecture, the professor who did not give that class's lecture goes up to the front and engages the lecturing professor in a bit of a \"debate\" or conversation about the work. This is often unsuccessful. But that's okay! Still a great course and fun to experience two professors in one course! TFs are great. Workload: not many assignments (3, 5-7pg papers for writing intensive or 1 in class midterm, 1 5-7pg paper, and 1 take-home final for the non-writing students). However READING IS SUBSTANTIAL. 100-175 pages per week. It's enjoyable stuff -- its fiction! -- but it's easy to fall behind, especially towards the middle and end. If you take this course, you should really do all the reading. You can \"get away\" with not doing all of it, but what's the point! It's a literature course!",
    "I would recommend, but not enthusiastically to be honest. I liked that I took the course, but it felt like hell because of the readings and unrealistic expectations for the writing section sometimes. I really didn't like the pressure to read 500 pages in a week for a single course, because it didn't let me actually enjoy the books. Instead, it made me kind of hate the novels. However, I found the course interesting. If you have a lot of work for a particular semester, I would not recommend taking this class because of the workload (don't be a fool, you actually have to do the readings for section in this class).",
    "LITR 214 is a fantastic survey course of 19th century and 20th century French novels. The course builds on each writer in a way that creates a narrative of its own (and which reminds the reader of the power of the modern French novel). Both professors are wonderful and have a great rapport, which is made even more evident in the fun \"debates\" at the end of each lecture. I would definitely, definitely recommend the course to any student even remotely interested in exploring the intricacies of the French novel (I mean, when else will you force yourself to read Proust and really enjoy it?)",
    "The syllabus for this class is AMAZING and makes the class worth taking, especially if you have any interest in French literature. Professor Samuels and Kaplan are really fun and know this material incredibly well. A great lecture and class!",
    "Absolutely recommend - a way to keep up your spoke, written, or ecrit French, your choice. Phenomenal material covered. Lectures are short little gems. One of those rare morning classes that you really look forward to. Not too much pressure, so that you can really dig down into the ideas presented in lecture. AND THE PROFESSORS ARE INCREDIBLY SMART AND FASCINATING TO LISTEN TO."
