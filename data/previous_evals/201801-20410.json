   "comments": [
    "I gained a very insightful perspective on the universe and my place in it.",
    "I gained a broad understanding of cosmological concepts as well as the history of cosmological theory and scholarship.",
    "This course was great! It opened my eyes to all sorts of concepts of which I'd only been vaguely aware before. In taking the course, I was hoping to gain insight into the formation of the universe, its fate, the nature and discovery of dark matter and dark energy, the expansion of the universe, and basic relativity--the course covered all of this! Professor Natarajan did a wonderful job explaining complex concepts in a way that was accessible and engaging.",
    "-Comprehensive overview of the history of the universe -ability to solve basic physics problem -overview of physical principles",
    "Gained a lot of insight into how one reasons about the cosmos and the conclusions of modern cosmology.",
    "Learned a lot about the universe!",
    "I learned about the nature of the universe, its properties, structure, history, and future. It changed the way I think about life in this world.",
    "Certainly I learned a lot about the structure of the universe and its strange features. The class focused on equations and mathematical representations of things as much as on concepts.",
    "This course gave me an extensive overview of all the interesting discoveries found so far to the challenging and still unsolved problems in astronomy. In this class, I learned everything from the very basic principles and laws of cosmology like Newton's laws to more broad laws and concepts like Einstein's law of special relativity, black holes and inflation. I also got some insight into the sizes, masses and distances of relative stars and nearby galaxies. It helped me build a solid foundation about universal material that I think every person should know. In the more technical terms, I learned how to approximate my calculations when needed, how to feel comfortable dealing with very large numbers and how to write an academic scientific paper.",
    "A great introduction to our current understanding of the universe, beginning with a historical perspective and then moving into what we currently know - with a constant look at where the limitations of our current knowledge (which is fascinating to see). Provides a chance to learn about and then practice with the most important equations in cosmology, helping you understand how we can calculate what we know. You leave the class feeling like you have a solid understanding of how the universe works, which is great. Taught be a great professor too, with interesting problem sets and a fun final paper."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The course was entirely lecture-based (this is a good thing). The readings the professor assigns aren't essential. Neither is the TA's discussion section. (also a good thing) The challenge of this course is the math. Even as a physics major, I had a lot of trouble with much of the math in the class because the professor never did example problems. It would be improved if the professor (or TA) ran through example problems.",
    "This course does a great job of exposing students to the most important concepts of cosmology. Occasionally I felt that topics might have been a tad too advanced for an introductory course intended for non-STEM majors, but overall the course was fine.",
    "I think the material could be fairly interesting, but I found the material was not conveyed in the best way. I think the course could be improved with more attention on the way material is taught, and also with more organization - what exactly we were supposed to know for tests was never conveyed, and some test questions included material we had simply never seen before.",
    "The course engages with some pretty interesting topics--the structure of the universe, etc. But I didn't feel like there were adequate resources to help me fully understand them--the TA wasn't great, and the professor wasn't particularly available. And for a non-science major who's really lousy at math, I felt that the expectations of what we remembered from high school math and physics were high.",
    "strengths: lectures were incredibly engaging and interesting! Prof natarajan is a great lecturer and presents the information in a comprehensive story. weaknesses: high time pressure on test, lots of picky calculations",
    "The lectures were a great way to see many of the big picture results without getting into the nitty-gritty mathematics. The problem sets give you a taste of some cosmological calculations. The course is designed poorly, in my opinion. I think there needs to be a better way to prepare students for the problem sets and exams which are worth so much of the grade, like more in class calculations, or multiple section times to ensure everyone can make it.",
    "Professor Natarajan is very knowledgeable and super nice but the course was kind of shockingly hard! Could have been that I just didn't have an adequate physics background.",
    "Strengths: Well taught, interesting material, assignments relate to course material and allow one to engage with it. Weaknesses: It was too late in the afternoon; the class conflicted with other things, and it was sometimes difficult to focus. The final paper was long and tedious. I felt that a paper which was only on a very small part of the course or on a tangentially related topic was not a good way to cap off the semester.",
    "I think it was too much at times to have to do several readings for this class on top of the problem sets and tests, and to ask students to buy three books that cannot be found free online. I also think that the in-class tests were slightly longer than they should be given the limited amount of time that we had. I also wanted to have section at a more reasonable time of the day. Other than that, the lectures were incredibly interesting, I really enjoyed the material being taught, the problem sets were at a reasonable level of difficulty for the most part and in general the course is very well structured and thought-through. It was a nice blend of historical facts and discoveries, present challenges and prospective theories.",
    "Strengths - wide breadth of class material, great professor, fascinating content, good slides to aid revision, interesting problem sets that will challenge you and make sure you understand the content. Weaknesses - minimal. Touches very lightly on relativity, and so this class goes well with a relativity course too."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "I would recommend taking it if it interests you. A humanities-major with anything short of a college-level physics background should not take this class for a QR credit. For a STEM major, this class won't fulfill any requirements you don't already fulfill. So take it only if the material interests you.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student who is looking for a moderately difficult science credit. The midterms were quite challenging, but the class is curved and the problem sets were doable. I also liked that the class had a final paper instead of an exam.",
    "If the structure of the course was improved, I do think it could be recommended. However, as it was when I took it, I would not recommend it to another student.",
    "Absolutely! It's a great course for anyone curious about the universe and looking for a lecture to open their mind to some seriously big-picture ideas. The math skills required are very basic, although some of the concepts are definitely difficult.",
    "YES!! A medium-level workload but still highly engaging class. You'll learn a lot, but you won't feel overwhelmed.",
    "First of all, NOT A GUT. Don't take this if you're looking for a gutty SC credit. If you are interested in the material, it is definitely a good way to see a lot of the big picture results. The structure of the course is annoying, though. The lectures are very qualitative (and bit dull at times), while the problem sets and tests are very quantitative. The tests are extremely rushed, and the lectures and problem sets don't necessarily prepare you for them. The minimum length for the final paper was much too long for the assigned topic, which was to summarize recent research on a chosen topic. The problem is that truly understanding the research papers requires high-level mathematics, and broad-strokes summaries barely fill the page.",
    "I would. At the end of the day, I came away with new knowledge about the universe and a new way of thinking about my life. I'd recommend taking the course with friends, and I think my experience would have been better had the class been earlier in the day.",
    "I'd recommend this class to someone who is strong in math already. The \"Introduction\" part of the name is technically accurate--you don't need to know anything about Cosmology beforehand. But I don't think this is an especially good class for non-stem majors (at least not ones who care about their GPA.)",
    "Absolutely, I highly recommend taking this course. It is not heavily work-loaded, and is very rewarding to look back and see how much interesting and challenging facts one could learn about our universe in a mere 3 months.",
    "For anyone who has ever looked up to the sky and wanted to know more about what happens, then this is a must take class. You realise how much we understand (and how little you understood until you took this course). Really interesting and builds a solid foundation in cosmology.",
    "No."
