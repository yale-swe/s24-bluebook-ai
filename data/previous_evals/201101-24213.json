    "Weakness: Too much discussion.",
    "This course is great for anyone interested in the different nuances of mental health. I learnt a lot about how assessment, monitoring and evaluation of interventions takes place. The class is very realistic with case studies and papers that reflect what's happening on the ground and therefore teaches you in a very different but adept manner.",
    "Best class I've taken at Yale, no question. Much more real-world applicability than most Yale classes and a variety of interesting readings and assignments.",
    "This course was extraordinary in all areas.",
    "I loved the flexibility of this course--we could focus on the issues that we found most interesting or applicable to our career aspirations. Whereas I lose interest in most courses sometime in the middle of the semester, I stayed engaged with this course for the entire semester. The material was fascinating and the classes were great--I looked forward to attending them every week.My one suggestion for improvement is to make deadlines and assignments a little more clear. Sometimes assignments would sneak up on us (e.g. the midterm evaluation), and I wouldn't be sure if I was missing something. It would also be helpful if the syllabus listed the books that would be needed at the front or if the chapters were uploaded to classesv2--sometimes I wouldn't have time to look at the readings until a couple days before class and would be surprised that I had to track down a book to read a chapter."

    "Instructor: Wietse Anton Tol \u00a0Wietse is one of the best professors I've had at Yale. He's extremely learned and very interactive. He's a great facilitator for discussions. There's always a way to question and reach an answer that's satisfactory if you're talking to Wietse. He also gives you a lot of freedom in the class to be able to study and write on subjects that interest you personally, which is another beauty of this class.",
    "Instructor: Wietse Anton Tol \u00a0Best teacher I've had here-extremely accessible and friendly while also challenging students to do their best and think problems through more thoroughly.",
    "Instructor: Wietse Anton Tol \u00a0Wietse did an excellent job in guiding discussion and responding to difficult and complex questions.",
    "Instructor: Wietse Anton Tol \u00a0Wietse was an excellent instructor. He ran classes very well, provided helpful feedback, responded to our feedback, andhad great personal experience with the subject matter."

    "Take it!",
    "I highly recommend this class to anyone in the social sciences, public health or the sciences. It holistically takes into account the different aspects of human life that influence our mental health and how we should address them. It's a seminar style class with a lot of insightful discussions. If you do decide to take this class you won't regret it.",
    "Please take this course if you are interested in the subject material. Best class and best teacher I've had at Yale.",
    "I would strongly recommend this course to any students who have an interest in humanitarian aid, and mental health work in low and middle income countries.",
    "Take this course!! The subject is really interesting, and the instructor has a lot of field experience. This was probably my favorite course from YSPH--I actually wanted to do the readings and go to class every week."
