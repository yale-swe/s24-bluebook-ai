   "comments": [
    "This is just a fantastic writing course, and the legal aspect of it makes it engaging.",
    "We learned how to read, how to think, how to argueto argue with force, to argue in the alternative, to argue with a deep sense of the tentative. And through all that, we learned how to write, not merely as good lawyers do but as good and thoughtful readers, students, writers, and citizens do. The sheer yield of this course is remarkable. To have grown so much in 13 weeks of study is a pedagogical achievement.",
    "I learned how to craft a sentence. More accurately, I learned how not to craft a sentence.",
    "This course teaches two sets of skills: (1) how to read, write and think about law and legal argument, and (2) how to write clearly, concisely, and with purpose. Both skills are certainly worth developing, no matter your major or career trajectory. In the end, students leave the course with the abilities to think more critically and meaningfully about law and to express themselves more efficiently.",
    "How to think, write and speak about law.",
    "Legal thinking was a new way of thinking for me. It was rich, textured, and I found myself questioning my answers more than almost any subject I've studied before. The course let me delve into the complexities of this new approach, these new rules. I loved the Speluncean Explorers case. I enjoyed our readings. And the style exercises, though sometimes annoying, truly did help. I think this course helped me to understand how to enter a conversation, to find my place in ongoing discourse and to see where I might add something new. This course made me more interested in our legal system, more critical of it in some ways and admiring in others. To sum up: I learned how to write better and think better and speak better.",
    "A new appreciation for why some writing works and why some writing doesn't. A working understanding of the complexities of law and why it's so important.",
    "This was one of the best classes I've taken. Andrew Ehrgood is one of the best teachers I've ever had. Taking this course made me a better writer and a better lawyer in that order. Half the course focuses on writing style while the other half focuses on legal analysis. Every class was fun, engaging, and different. I learned from Ehrgood and from the other students. This is one of those classes where the workload is tough, but every minute you spend is well worth it.",
    "The most useful part of the course was \"writing\" about the law, not so much \"thinking\" about it. Professor Ehrgood does a good job at compiling some very helpful tips on style."

   "comments": [
    "This course really does make you focus on your writing. At the same time, the discussion is interesting and thought provoking. The way that Prof. Ehrgood balances the semester is fair, as we focus a lot on important exercises during the beginning of the semester. Some times I felt that discussion time was too administrative (going over what we're going to go over in the future), and not as engaging as it could potentially be.",
    "I found the teaching, especially the style section of the course, to be quite dogmatic and focused on memorization and learning to write according to the ways that Professor Ehrgood writes, which is obviously not the only good option out there. I wished we could have had more time with the class to ask questions and debate the legal issues, rather than spending hours on end talking about style or going over the facts of a case.",
    "Some might mention all the work and the rigor as a problem, or that the second half of the course was not as light as one expected, and that's a problem too. I disagree. This class is known to be a heavy lift and rightfully so; it should be hard, becauseall of the work we did was important. The only suggestion I would offer for next year is to require every student to deliver a presentation. It will give everyone the chance to integrate the stylistic and analytical principles weve studied into speech. That might, in the long run, increase how well they comprehend the material. Further, that could serve as a useful opportunity to study Robinsons discussion on diction, even if Rowe v. Pacific Quad is removed from the syllabus to accommodate the presentation unit (a worthy sacrifice, I might add).",
    "It's amazing. Professor Ehrgood does a great job making all of the information you need available. While there is always room for improvement, I can't think of a specific example to provide.",
    "This course is so well organized. Professor Ehrgood has this down to a science!",
    "I wish there were a bit less work at the beginning, but it does seem kind of necessary. I deeply enjoyed the spelunkers case. I gained a lot from one on one meetings with Ehrgood. And the class dynamic was fantastic-- Ehrgood does a wonderful job of creating a class community.",
    "This was an excellent class! I don't think it can be improved. I would only suggest some kind of public speaking unit so students can really practice their G20s: make everything you write speakable.",
    "The most useful part of the course was \"writing\" about the law, not so much \"thinking\" about it. Professor Ehrgood does a good job at compiling some very helpful tips on style. The problem with the \"thinking\" about the law course was that we focused on one fictional case for the entire semester: the Case of the Spelunkean Explorers. It is difficult to stay engaged for that long with any case, let alone a fictional one."

   "comments": [
    "If you are even just thinking of going to law school, there is no reason why you shouldn't take this course. If you want to improve your writing, there is no reason why you shouldn't take this course.",
    "I would for sure recommend this course to another student. Regardless if one is a prospective law student or not, my critical thinking skills became significantly better from this course. This class will prepare you well for law school and will help you understand how judges think (to some degree).",
    "Professor Ehrgood is a very kind teacher who clearly spends lots of time going over his students' work. That being said, I was very frustrated with the class's dogmatic approach to writing. If you are already a strong writer, you will not appreciate being taught grammar and style like it is a second language. This iteration of students in the seminar was also more than 75% male, and there was an extraordinary amount of man-splaining allowed to happen during section, which I imagine happens most years. We spent a significant amount of time every seminar just going over the syllabus and doing style exercises, while the interesting legal questions were often glossed over in the last minutes of class. It often felt to me that this was a class far more about memorization than about intellectual challenge. If you are an underclassman hoping to get some exposure to the law and want to practice the basics of writing with a professor who really does give a lot of time to meeting with you, it's probably a great class. If you've already had exposure to law through internships and are already a strong writer, you will find this class frustrating.",
    "The greatest class that I have taken at Yale. To design a course where students learn so much in 13 weeks about how to write, argue, and think is a pedagogical achievement. You will work long hours in this seminar, not merely from the amount of work but also from the opportunity to give your best to Professor Ehrgood, without doubt one of the finest and most caring instructors at Yale. He works twice as hard as the hardest-working student in this class. This is one of the finest humanities courses at Yale. Seize the opportunity to take it and to give it your best. If you do, you will, like me, think about this class for decades to come.",
    "YES! This course will improve your writing AND your thinking!",
    "This course teaches universally important skills, and does so very well. It is a privilege to learn from Professor Ehrgood. Make this course a priority if you care about intellectually engaging course material and good writing.",
    "Definitely take it if you can get in. The best writing class at Yale.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student interested either in the law or in writing more clearly! Professor Ehrgood gives you so much feedback. There is a lot of work in the first half of th semester, but it does get better in the second half.",
    "Absolutely take this course. First, let me be clear-- it's a lot of work, especially in the beginning of the semester, but also pretty much throughout (between your 3 style tests and paper and revision and oral presentation etc.) Make sure this class can be your priority. Ehrgood is a legend. Super dedicated and organized, witty and friendly and quirky enough that it makes you and the rest of class like him a bit better. He cares about this course a tremendous amount-- so the heavy work you put in feels less bad because you know he reciprocates the time and effort (even more). You'll become a better writer, a more thorough thinker, and all these other good things that you want out of your education. This course didn't rock my world or change my life (although this is the case for many), but I deeply enjoyed it and would recommend to all who are interested in law or thinking and writing better.",
    "Would highly recommend this course for the one on one attention you get in it. Over the semester, I had 4-5 individual meetings with him, scheduled for 45 min but often lasting an hour, where we talked about writing, but also about life. The course is best in the weeks before spring break, where it's also the most work intensive. The weeks after break felt a little less carefully planned and thought out. Overall, this is the best course I've taken at Yale. Definitely most enjoyable classroom experience (first time I've enjoyed a seminar!). Style test points sometimes felt arbitrary, and grading was pretty opaque (only had first and maybe second style test grade back before the credit d deadline). Final was also pretty difficult, and there was a short final paper too.",
    "This class is stupendous. The amount of time and effort that Prof. Ehrgood puts into this class makes it worth taking even if you're not particularly interested in law. Your writing will improve, and you will grow as a thinker as well. I found the work I did for this class (which was considerable) was more than worth it. I looked forward to this class every day. Can't recommend enough.",
    "This was one of the best classes I've taken. Andrew Ehrgood is one of the best teachers I've ever had. Taking this course made me a better writer and a better lawyer in that order. Half the course focuses on writing style while the other half focuses on legal analysis. Every class was fun, engaging, and different. I learned from Ehrgood and from the other students. This is one of those classes where the workload is tough, but every minute you spend is well worth it."
