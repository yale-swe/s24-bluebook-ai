    "Summary: be exploring major texts within the realm of political science alongside texts concerning methodology, we explored the strengths and weaknesses of current approaches to political science research. In particular, we explored the use of qualitative material and archival research to supplement quantitative research. I would recommend the course depending on the interests and research of the student. For myself, as someone hoping to do work in political science, the course was immensely helpful in orienting me to the ways that political science arguments are formed and supported.",
    "Yes, I would recommend it to any student interested in broadening their set of methodological tools and learning the fundamentals of performing historical research in political science.",
    "The class provides a helpful overview of the historical methodologies in political science. I would definitely recommend t to another student looking for an overview of historical methods.",
    "Yes, it is a class that accomplishes its purpose."

   "comments": [
    "I am not a PhD student presently, but hope to be at some point. I strongly believe taking a course like this now, as a Masters student, is better equipping me for the type of research I will do in the future. Even if I don't go on to do doctoral level work, it was immensely helpful for me in thinking through how arguments are being made and supported within the social sciences.",
    "Above.",
    "This course will be very helpful in preparing for the Qualitative Methods field exam. I will also use the methods skills acquired in this class in my dissertation.",
    "This class definitely helped me to gain a better understanding of how historical and archival work is done, and it did help me to think through my dissertation."
