    "You know what you're getting yourself into if you've come this far! Just like research for credit, but double the hours. One advantage is that there is no research write-up required in the fall semester.Be prepared to spend a lot of time in lab. You might want to think about planning your course schedule to give yourself large, uninterrupted blocks of time for research. By the end of the term, I was averaging around 30 hours per week."
