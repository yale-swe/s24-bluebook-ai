    "The Dissertation Prospectus Workshop helped me learn to communicate about my project clearly and concisely. Because our cohort members have different disciplinary backgrounds, each meeting was an opportunity to work on translating my ideas to an audience of people with different kinds of expertise. Professor Brooks helped us to shape our projects into coherent and manageable form, and to locate the stakes and importance of our projects."

   "comments": [
    "This course provided helpful structure to the prospectus-writing process and I received support and feedback from my cohort members and Professor Brooks which helped strengthen my project. The workshop was an important space for building cohort community and for helping us to each feel competent and committed to our projects (and supportive of each other's projects). I think this course could be improved if there was more energy devoted to writing feedback. I think I could have benefited from trading draft-writing with another cohort member, and receiving feedback not just on how I presented my writing, but on the work itself. I think the meetings could have been more productive if there were a component of reading each others' work beforehand. I also think that it might be helpful if the first meeting (or meetings) take place at the end of the 2nd year. We really needed to come into the first workshop meeting prepared with our dissertation idea, and I think that was a surprise to most of us. If we had met at the end of second year, it could have prepared us to spend some of our summers developing our projects."

    "This workshop is a wonderful opportunity to develop your prospectus with support and guidance. I am grateful for the time and attention Professor Brooks gave to our individual work, and to the ways that she helped us develop our cohort community. It was a very helpful part of the prospectus-writing process."
