    "I learned an immense amount about typography in this class, and how it is such an important part of graphic design. The projects we worked on really pushed me to be creative and think critically about my designs, going through various iterations to make them better.",
    "Typography 1 teaches and trains the eye for design. Through the process of several projects, students learn about different typefaces and the different implications of varying usage. In addition, students learn through exploring different methods expressive typography and setting type in book format.",
    "This course gave me a better grasp of the process of approaching designing text-heavy projects. It gave me several pieces to include in my portfolio, and boosted my confidence."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This is a class more based on critique and discussion than direct learning. Therefore, it is possible that the quality of instruction may vary greatly with who is in the class.",
    "This class is very interesting for any student interested in graphic design. It has a good balance between learning through experience (projects) and learning from research (1 small presentation). One thing this course lacks is motivating students to be present for critique. Since most of class time is devoted to group critiques, students' attendance is important. Critiques can allow students to gain meaningful feedback and inspiration from their peers. Perhaps if there was a small portion of the grade based on attendance (maybe still allowing a couple of unexcused absences), this would be less of an issue.",
    "I loved this course overall! I wish we had spent a little longer on the second project, the elements poster, because I felt like we had less time to workshop it as a group. I also wish Alice had just reminded us each class about what was due the next class. A few deadlines got shifted and I was sometimes confused (this is maybe just a personal organizational problem though!)."

   "comments": [
    "If you are interested in graphic design, I would highly recommend this course. It is a valuable introduction to one of the most important parts of graphic design, typography, and you will learn so much about how to use type in interesting and creative ways. Alice is a wonderful professor and critic, not to mention a very successful and talented graphic designer in her own right. The class is a big time commitment if you want to produce good work, but it is absolutely worth it.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who is interested in Graphic Design. Typography is an important part of design and this class does a great job of teaching it while remaining very enjoyable.",
    "Yes! This class was great & Alice is great. The course is centered around 3 major projects (2 books and a poster) with other small projects thrown in (a type journal, various exercises). Knowing how to work with type is so important for a designer, but it's easy to overlook, and this course is essential to anyone who ever wants to work on projects with words. Alice is very kind but also very good at what she does and provides gentle, but constructive feedback."
