   "comments": [
    "Yes but only if you have a strong background in German history, otherwise you will be left in the dust.",
    "Really good class about German war culture and history",
    "SO HARD, SO GOOD.",
    "This course is an overview of German history through the lens of military culture and events from 1618 up to the present. It basically focuses on the Thirty Years War, Frederick the Great, Napoleonic Wars, German Unification, World War I, the interwar period, World War II, and the postwar era. German history generally was covered, but the focus was on the military culture and its relationship with society.",
    "An engaging lecture that covers fascinating material. Prof. Tooze is a pleasure to listen to. It is a fair amount of work if you don\u2019t have some experience with the topic, but the class provides a great baseline to explore European and\/or military history in more depth. Highly recommend.",
    "If you are at all interested on why Hitler was able to rise to power and how the European Union developed afterwards, then I think this is the class for you. You really get to trace themes about Germany's military history from the 17th century to the 21st, which was amazing and stimulating.",
    "This course was overwhelming, in a generally good way. Information comes flying at you, and its impossible to remember or even write down everything Tooze says in the lectures. Even more than that, it feels like you're being taught a book - the arguments are beat into your head, and it seems like some things (freeing the serfs in East Prussia? should have something to do with Prussian society and war?) are just not covered because they don't fit into the arc of the book. That said, its a wonderful class, and both of those weakness are also strengths in a lot of ways. With a fantastic section, this course could be the best you take at Yale. With a less impressive one, it will still be very good, although you may not be satisfied that you've done enough questioning Tooze's arguments.",
    "Great class to take if you\u2019re interested in military history or are looking for a course that covers WWI and WWII. The bonus is that we also study a good portion of the Cold War. The readings are manageable and relevant to each week\u2019s theme. The lectures can take time to get used to, but the professor makes a convincing argument about Germany\u2019s historical narrative that runs throughout the course.",
    "Interesting material. Not that much work. But, the exams aren't that easy. It would be a great Cr\/D\/F.",
    "A fantastic class. Not too much work and very interesting.",
    "Awesome lecturer, definitely take this class. It can be tough at times because it deals with so much content, but the tests aren't that tough. But Tooze is an amazing lecturer. Content is a mix of military history (battles, etc.), changes in German military thought, and how it fits in politically with the world. No papers, just a midterm and a final. Good class to credit\/D",
    "Great course even if you know the world wars pretty well. This course tells the story strictly from the German perspective as well go before and beyond 1914 to 45. Prof. Tooze is a great lecturer although he tends to read his lectures which means they go very fast. It also gets difficult to take detailed notes. But the readings and the section should supplement whatever you miss at lecture. In general yes take this course if you're interested in German history at all.",
    "Yes! My first history course and it was a great experience.",
    "Absolutely take this class. It is a complex, but nevertheless fascinating lecture course which dispels many myths to which the title of the course may allude. An absolute must for any history major and anyone interested in military history.",
    "i would definitely recommend this class. it was a very intriguing humanities course",
    "Absolutely recommend. Possibly the best course I've taken at Yale. Even apart from the fascinating way in which Tooze presents history (he approaches it critically and most of lecture is persuasive arguments about why his interpretation is correct; he doesn't just state his interpretation of events and expect you to accept it), there are important thematic connections in the course to law, psychology, really lots of things. A course that makes you think.",
    "Take it. One of the most solid history courses I've attended.",
    "Absolute must-take. This is an intensive crash-course in Germany military history, but it's incredibly interesting, even if the topic seems narrow at first, as it did to me. After taking a bunch of cultural history classes at Yale, I was starving for straight facts, and that is exactly what this course delivered (along with context and significance, of course). Tooze's lectures are jam-packed with information--this is not a class where you can afford to zone out--but that makes it all the more motivating to do well. The workload is light, and the material is interesting and important. TL;DR- definitely take it.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to anyone, regardless of major. This class will change one's perspective and thoughts on German and European history. German history classes are also a rarity because of the complexity of German history, but Professor Tooze makes the class coherent and excellent.",
    "Absolutely yes!! Professor Tooze is an engaging and eloquent lecturer. He chose an interesting lens through which to view German history, which made the course focused while covering hundreds of years of history. I feel I have a deeper understanding of German history and its relationship to war but also a deeper understanding of history as a field of study.",
    "For history majors, this class is definitely interesting with a low workload. For other students, if you need a fifth class and are willing to cred\/d, take this class. I didn't find it as interesting as some of the past reviews, but there are no essays and it was a good fifth class.",
    "Absolutely.",
    "TAKE. THIS. CLASS. It is awesome, it teaches a great deal about our modern world as well as the past, and it gives one a framework to look at what is going on in the world. Fascinating subject, and an incredible lecturer. Not too much work either, just be good on the midterm and final!",
    "Amazing course. Definitely take it whether or not you are a history major\u2014it's fascinating. Professor Tooze is a little intimidating but the lectures are amazing. Also do the readings, because they're all very, very interesting.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course: it's an amazing lecture, and interesting readings. The course is not hard either.",
    "Definitely",
    "One of the best history courses you will take at Yale. Without a doubt, take it!",
    "Yes I would recommend it.",
    "Not as much as military history as you would think. Readings are not that bad albeit a bit long. What you would expect. Grade is all on section participation and two exams. Exams are ok.",
    "Harder than average history class that gives you a good grasp of european diplomacy from the German perspective.",
    "This is a very interesting class on German history. It moves quickly and Professor Tooze assumes you have some knowledge of European history, but if you go to lecture and do the readings you will be fine. The workload is totally manageable. I recommend this class.",
    "This is a good course, but I think it is overrated. Prof. Tooze is brilliant and has some very interesting insights on German warfare and its effects on German history. However, I thought he was a sub-par lecturer. He speaks very quickly and in a tone that rarely puts emphasis on the most important points, as a good lecturer should. It is just him reading from a well-crafted transcript and using very erudite words and not taking any time to explain hardly anything. The lectures I found most interesting were those that I had some background in. Had I had a strong background in European or German military history, I\u2019m sure I would have gotten a lot more out of this course. But I had none of the above. I took this course hoping to get some background in European history from a German perspective and, to some extent, that\u2019s what I got. But there are better courses here if you want to learn about European history. However, I did learn a surprising amount about military history. He also seemed very disconnected from the students and I didn\u2019t get any sense that he cared about us, though that is likely just his personality\u2014he may very well have cared for his students. That said, it was a pretty interesting topic and section was always very engaging, despite how there were over 20 students in my section. The midterm and the final seemed pretty fair to me."
