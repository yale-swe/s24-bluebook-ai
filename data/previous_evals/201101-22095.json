    "Gah. This class was annoying. Was way too slow 90% of the time (like, seriously, turtle's pace) but the homework would take forever and then there'd occasionally be a lecture that I wouldn't be able to follow for more than five minutes. Joe Chang's very sweet and all, but the class is very disorganized -- very long psets released Sunday afternoon and due on Tuesday, not telling us when the final or midterm is, not getting problem sets back, etc. It's also not really that interesting of a subject (though coding is lots of fun), I'm sorry to say.That being said, it's not really a *bad* class -- Professor Chang is very, well, happy, and his voice is entirely understandable, and the homework, while long, doesn't require much thought. As close as the math department comes to an easy A, I guess, and you don't really have all that many other options for decent classes to take after 241.",
    "Stochastics is an interesting subject, and the lack of in-class exams makes it a great choice for a math student who is already taking many exam-based classes. The work is relatively light, the material isn't too challenging, but the material is still interesting to learn.",
    "Take it. Useful, not too difficult, very interesting. If you're considering this, you're probably halfway decent at math, and you'll do just fine.",
    "no.",
    "Yes, I highly recommend it.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to another student. The class fits all majors: mathematics, economics, biology or even some humanities.",
    "This is a good course if you're interested in the material, and have some experience with more formal mathematics. Problem sets are very manageable and interesting, and the examinations were both take home which helps the stress. However, later topics were covered in a very \"hand-wavy\" fashion, which could be frustrating if you are interested in a more formal treatment of the subject.",
    "As an applied math major, I found this class very challenging - one of the more difficult and time consuming for me in the major."
