    "tough material, don't take it if you're not an engineering major",
    "Eh? Good course, but terrible instruction.It's required for the major; if you're not MechE, there's no particular reason to take it.",
    "A fun subject, though the material was a little confusing at times. The lectures could have been better.",
    "Not a very exciting class, but not difficult. Don't take it for fun. Take it if you have to. Workload is average.",
    "It is required so try to bear with it as much as possible.",
    "I enjoyed this class, even though it can be a little dry at times. It is much better if you are willing to put some effort in. The problem sets are tough, but if you go to section, then both the professor and the TA will answer all your questions. The professor is really nice, though he speaks very quietly and his handwriting is sometimes impossible to read, but so long as you show some initiative, he is willing to meet you in the middle.",
    "This is a foundational mechanical engineering course. Be prepared to work consistently every week and spend time on the problem sets. Even though the professor is really friendly and helpful, you might find the lectures hard to follow, which will result in spending more time studying for the class. The final project takes a lot of time at the end of the semester.",
    "Unless you need it for a major, or are interested in beams, driveshafts, bridges, etc, I would stay away.",
    "I found the material of this course very interesting, but the lectures are extremely boring and not at all conducive to learning. Be prepared to learn everything in this class by reading the (admittedly excellent) textbook on your own. There is a long, unclear project due at the end of the semester, whichrequires quite a bit of work and meetings with the professor just to understand what is being asked. The exams were partially open-book, but were quite challenging. A difficult experience.",
    "LOVE. THIS. CLASS. If you're at all interested in structural engineering this is absolutely the class for you. Literally, it's the first class you'll take that actually shows you a true application of kinematics and statics. It's difficult, but manageable. And the teaching staff will help you every step of the way to make sure you know what's going on (but make sure you ASK for help, don't flounder on your own). The workload is manageable-one pset a week. Honestly, the teaching staff really makes the class. Kailas is wonderfully encouraging, and incredibly fair. Do make sure you go to class and section, though, to establish a connection with him. When it comes to the \"project,\" go to him right away so he can spell out what he wants: he won't do that on the assignment sheet itself.",
    "Only take it if required. The subject matter isn't all that interesting, and the professor doesn't make it anymore so. Be prepared to teach yourself from the book (if you like me and tend to drift off in class about halfway through)."
