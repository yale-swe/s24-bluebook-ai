    "Although the material from the course was pretty widespread and vague, this class provided the structure and time for me to plan out my senior thesis. This class should have been more organized and relevant, but I appreciated the assignments because they gave me time to learn about fellowships, write proposals, read up on material, and overall be in a much better position going into my senior project.",
    "This course exposed me to new areas and styles of scholarship in the field of Black Studies. In particular, I developed stronger skills working with critiquing visual art and working with archival sources. Additionally, I learned a lot about the process of developing and proposing a research project."

   "comments": [
    "strengths - the assignments relating to the senior project were helpful. Especially working on the funding stuff in the beginning of the semester. weaknesses - the readings, blog posts, and library visits were a waste of time and class discussion seemed lack luster",
    "This course is strong as an exploratory study of different areas of the Black Studies literature. Its strength comes from raising important questions about the scope, definition, and importance of Black Studies as well as questions about the nature of its subject(s). However, the course does claim to be one centered on methodology, and while I was exposed to different methodologies, instruction on different designs and techniques, as well as how to craft the most appropriate methodology for one's own study could be more structured and clear.",
    "The course could be structured better to help students brainstorm together and with their professor and to have conversations about each other's interests rather than focusing on hefty theory and having long conversations about topics that may be irrelevant to the majority of student's work. The course wasn't structured well to allow students to grow together. It was very set on developing projects individually without little space to brainstorm critically together until the very end. There were too many class visits to sites unrelated to most students' work and engaging with triggering material--for example, visiting the British Arts Center and looking at British archival material and artwork by white artists. There was little space where one's own positionality was addressed in the classroom except from students who already came into the class with that type of thinking."

    "Yes, but only if you want the time to work on you senior project before senior year.",
    "This seminar can be incredibly helpful as you prepare to write a thesis in your senior year, but in some ways its potential to be helpful depends on your level of engagement. Additionally, being clear on what you hope to get out of the course and what the expectations are as early as possible will make this course a better experience.",
