    "Sure go for it",
    "French 140 is a great class to prepare for more advanced work in French, as the compositions, presentations, and in-class speaking become more and more complex throughout the semester to give proper preparation for L5 work. Professor Skorupa is great, and she makes the coursework both fun and clear.",
    "French 140 was a lot more work than French 130 and it felt less rewarding (like more of a burden), so I would recommend that the student stop at 130 if they have the option. It's also a ton of reading, but that means my reading and comprehension skills increased a ton, but I think my speaking ability got worse.",
    "I would recommend it for a student who wishes to continue his or her studies in French. For someone who is planning on dropping the course after this level, it's a lot of work (though rewarding as one sees him or herself improve throughout the course of it), and admittedly, it can be very tiring to be there and doing the work for it every single day. The literature they cover is fantastic and easy to discuss, and from what I've heard and experienced, all of the instructors are great!",
    "Yes! If you want to keep up your french, L4 is definitely the way to go!",
    "It was a lot of work, but it pays off. Your french will improve A LOT and you will leave the class feeling like you can actually speak the language",
    "It's a continuation of all the French you've been doing. You have to talk and read a lot. Prepare to read 50 pages of Un Sac de Billes a night by the end.",
    "A great class that using audio exercises and some great book discussions to improve spoken French. There is a lot of work done on grammar as well using written exercises. I would recommend it.",
    "A good and enjoyable French class though I'm not sure how much I really improved."
