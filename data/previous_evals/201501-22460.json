   "comments": [
    "I would recommend it. Even if you are able to waive this class, it's generally enjoyable and interesting. It's just a ton of work.",
    "It's a lot of work. Between the quizzes, the lab reports, and the psets, you will always have something to work on at home. However, the amazing instructors and TAs make the lab an enjoyable and educational experience. If you put in the work, you should be fine.",
    "Great course, you learn so much in the lab and do so many techniques. Aruna and the TF's are all really knowledgeable and always ready to help. The only downside is that the labs are deceptively long and stressful, even if you start early-ish (weekend before they're due). Always start them as early as possible.",
    "You have daily quines and four solid lab reports. The amount of work is very reasonable for a double credit lab. The exact grading rubric wasn't stated, but the sample lab reports were very helpful. Overall this was a very good class for a double credit science lab.",
    "Great, time consuming course that shows you how to do many important lab techniques. Lab reports are absolutely dreadful though. Take if you need or want to know many experimental techniques."
