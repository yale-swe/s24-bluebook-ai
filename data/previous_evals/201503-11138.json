   "comments": [
    "good for a general overview\/intro to different diseases, but i did not get much out of this class overall.",
    "PATH 690 01 is a seminar serious where pathology researchers discuss their current work. I would not recommend PATH 690 to another student because I do not feel that I got much out of the course. More of an introduction to the different research topics would have helped me better understand the complex disease pathways.",
    "I will recommend it since I can learn general ideas of different diseases in this course.",
    "PATH 690 01 provides the opportunity to learn about cutting-edge topics in pathology and to interact directly with experts in these fields. Lectures are inspirational and interest-evoking. I would recommend this course to another student.",
    "Yes I would. Especially a student interested in cancer research",
    "PATH 690 is a course that provides a general overview of many different pathologies that relevant today. Lectures focus on molecular mechanisms of disease, epidemiologies, history of disease, and treatments. I would recommend PATH 690 to another student, because the course exposes students to many different areas of research that are ongoing today.",
    "I would recommend the course depending on the student's interests. The course is labeled molecular mechanisms of disease, which I believe is a slight misnomer. The course focused more on specific diseases than general molecular mechanisms. If the student is interested in learning about common pathologies, with some mechanisms than I would recommend the class.",
    "I feel that the course is interesting as a survey but is poorly organized. I would not recommend it due to the poor organization of material that make it hard to follow."

   "comments": [
    "This course deepens my knowledge of my discipline mostly by providing the opportunity to learn cutting-edge research and selected topics in pathology and directly interact with experts in these fields. Learning about the techniques and future directions in many research areas contributes a lot to my dissertation\/research topic development.",
    "Definitely helped me to broaden my knowledge of other diseases.",
    "This course introduced me to a number of different areas that I can consider studying for my research. It also provided a base knowledge to allow me to better understand the research of others.",
    "This course broadened my interest is human pathologies, and how to combat them. Some of the information may be useful throughout my PhD."
