   "comments": [
    "The most important skills gained in this course are the ability to read and write well in Russian. At the beginning of the semester, I was comfortable speaking Russian but really struggled to read and write academically. Now, at the end of the semester, I can do both! The course really stresses the difference between spoken and written Russian. I have also expanded my vocabulary and grammar, and gained a much better understanding of Russian parts of speech and the roots of Russian words.",
    "I developed a much greater understanding of Russian history and the Russian language and culture in this class.",
    "I learned more Russian grammar and a lot of history. In Minjin's class, we got to work on speaking and writing a lot and sounding natural and understanding more.",
    "I was with Minjin so the experience is slightly different from that with Constantine. My ability to comprehend Russian orally has improved dramatically. Minjin conducts the class entirely in Russian, unlike what I have heard\/seen from Constantine's. My vocabulary has expanded immensely both from Constantine's textbook and essay reading assignments but also because in Minjin's class we get so much speaking time. I feel way more comfortable speaking in Russian because I have been doing it so much. The grammar has started to come naturally and when listening I don't really need to think about \"decoding\" the cases being used the meaning is starting to become intuitive. We also, of course, did a lot of grammar including gerunds, participles, numbers, dates, imperatives, aspect the right way, and learning various helper words\/phrases that can be used universally.",
    "I furthered my knowledge of Russian and learned a lot of Russian history in the meantime. I have a much, much better basis of Russian grammar than after L1-L4.",
    "Significant knowledge of the period of Russian history between Catherine the Great and Nicholas the First, in addition to knowledge of participles, imperatives, numbers, and verb conjugation.",
    "Russian language, particularly vocabulary relevant to 19th century Russian history",
    "I continued my study of Russian, particularly grammar and history, and became a better reader of Russian language.",
    "much deeper understanding of russian grammar and some history",
    "I worked on developing a higher level of proficiency in Russian",
    "This class drastically improved my Russian. I can now write, speak, and understand Russian far better than four months ago, and my vocabulary has grown tremendously.",
    "I improved my reading, listening and speaking abilities."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: the reading and writing assignments really improved our skills in Russian. Deadlines are not super strict in the course, which to me can be taken as a strength or a weakness :) There are not too many exams, and the exams are graded kindly. And, of course, Minjin was a fantastic professor. I highly recommend her section, as it had an added emphasis on oral proficiency. Perhaps the only weakness is that the vocabulary we learn feels a little antiquated and not always useful, but I didn't really mind - and think these new words will be useful in academic contexts though not in daily spoken Russian.",
    "The only thing I wish there was more of is opportunities to practice the language. The homework applies concepts but doesn't drill them into muscle memory or language fluency. This is in part due to the lack of resources as the language is not very broadly taught to English speakers, especially in the US.",
    "The course is organized well, although I think the textbook could include more practical vocabulary and phrases that we could use in colloquial Russian. Otherwise, we got a lot of speaking time and had many writing opportunities so we could improve.",
    "The strengths are definitely Minjin and the textbook. Minjin is an excellent teacher and really cares about your growth in speaking and writing Russian. She writes detailed feedback on every assignment so it's very easy to see where you can improve and how to do that. She often gives us mini ungraded practice quizzes which help build our vocabulary a lot. She is also very kind and supportive! Constantine's textbook is honestly fantastic. It doesn't treat you like a baby so you can actually understand what is happening grammar wise which helps so much plus if you have any questions you can go to his office hours since he literally wrote the book. The only weakness I can really think of we don't always have enough time to discuss the essays in class and read aloud but that's not a huge deal.",
    "Strengths: incredibly interesting material and a fantastic, caring lecturer (constantine). Weaknesses: very little conversation in class, and pretty much all vocab\/readings were about history and politics, meaning that it's not exactly the best class for improving your speaking skills. it's also an easy class to slack off in and fall behind in, given how generous Costantine is with deadlines and grades, so if you're not pushing yourself to do the work, you might not get much out of it.",
    "Overall glad I took this course. I have studied Russian history a lot but still felt that I learned a good amount here, particularly from the Russian perspective. The grammar and vocabulary sections are extremely useful and have further improved our command of the Russian language. The course focuses more on writing and reading than on speaking, which can be a bit frustrating at times but is par for the course in an L5 class. Students should be prepared to attend Russian table or find other ways to keep up their speaking skills, if they are so inclined.",
    "Strengths include the small class size, that ensured opportunities to speak every session. Weaknesses include that the syllabus was released on a week-by-week basis, making it hard to plan ahead.",
    "The strengths are entirely in Professor Muravnik. He is one of the best teachers I have had in my life. He cares immensely about student learning and does not dwell on silly details. He is friendly and cares about his work. Its tough to maintain your Russia bc especially if you return from the summer program, but Constantine works hard to develop your readings skills.",
    "I learned a tremendous amount in this course. The grammar was very well taught. I wish the history portion had been interspersed more.",
    "The class is well organized around the historical essays. However, it could use more interactive assignments like the presentations.",
    "The class succeeds in offering students with a lot of practice with speaking and writing Russian. The only weakness would be the specificity of the vocabulary (related to imperial Russia), which is very useful, but more practical vocabulary could help."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student looking to continue learning Russian. I think this course is particularly helpful for those hoping to use Russian in an academic context: students looking just to practice daily spoken Russian might be a bit frustrated by the niche words, etc. I loved that Constantine's textbook taught us Russian language through reading short essays on Russian history. Finally, language exercises are not about silly hypothetical scenarios but rather important facts that will enrich our understanding of Russia. The class also places a large emphasis on the roots of Russian words, which give you the tools to improve your Russian exponentially.",
    "Absolutely.",
    "If you want to get better at Russian and start learning the more complex, but useful, parts of Russian grammar, take this course.",
    "Yes! This course was amazing and my Russian improved dramatically. If you are serious about learning Russian and willing to put the time in then definitely take this course. If Minjin is available, take her section. It will probably be smaller so you will get more attention which for language learning is essential. Plus we get to learn a lot of Russian history in the form of essays which are very interesting and increase your reading ability substantially. One of the best courses I have taken here.",
    "yes, but with a few caveats. This course really is what you make of it. Constantine is an incredibly chill grader, and has very lenient deadlines for pretty much anythingwhile this is great, it also means that this is an easy class to slack off in, and unless you put pressure on yourself to improve your Russian and study the vocabulary lists and read the essays when you're supposed to, you might find that you're learning very little on a week to week basis. It's not a great class to get better at conversation, since a lot of the time is spent either listening to a lecture or answering questions about history readings. The vocabulary you learn, while very useful for discussing history and politics, is not exactly the most relevant for, say, living in Russia (for example, we learned verbs for several different ways to execute prisoners, including \"to quarter,\" \"to hang,\" and \"to kill by firing squad,\" but I don't think we learned a single piece of vocab relating to food all semester). That being said, the history stuff is fascinating, and Constantine is basically a living encyclopedia of Russian history\/grammar\/etymology (I mean, he wrote the textbook himself (and he gives it to you for free in a pdf)). If you put effort into this class, your Russian can go up exponentially, and the stuff you learn about can be truly fascinating (and really cements your understanding of the language). Constantine is also simply a fantastic guy and a really caring professor, as well as a great lecturer. If you've taken Russian up to L4, you should definitely take this course, but plan from the beginning to make an effort, and don't let it become the only Russian in your life, since you'll definitely not be learning as much useful vocab or conversing as much as you did in L1 through L4.",
    "I would recommend this course. It's a good transition between a pure grammar language course and a pure \"ideas\"\/discussion language course.",
    "Yes, it is a good way of continuing your study of Russian",
    "I would highly recommend to anyone that they continue studying Russian, especially if they have not had Constantine as a professor. While my learning of Russian slowed while you take it 3 days a week, I did really enjoy studying under him and learning history.",
    "yes. i learned a lot of russian grammar",
    "Yes, to anyone interested in learning and continuing their studies in Russian language and culture.",
    "If you are taking Russian, yes. If not, no.",
    "Definitely! Amazing class",
    "Yes"
