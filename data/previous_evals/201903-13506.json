    "Professor really needs to improve his handwriting in notes.",

    "Lectures were kind of messy. A lot of stuff was behind schedule. I think the reason for this is because the instructor tried to cater to every single student especially those who asked a lot of questions during lecture. I learnt a lot from his answers and greatly appreciated them, however, I think this could be better managed in terms of perhaps having separate sessions for questions etc.",
