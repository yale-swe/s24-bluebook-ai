   "comments": [
    "The material was so well organized, it was easy to follow along. I liked the accountability in this class, being called on for readings was an excellent motivator!",
    "The course was very well organized, covered a range of subjects concerning coastal ecosystems and did a good job of integrating biotic and abiotic factors of coastal ecosystems, as well as social aspects surrounding topics.",
    "Reading scientific articles on a wide range of coastal issues and dissecting them in class; I feel much more knowledgeable about coastal ecosystems now.",
    "Wonderful class. I really enjoyed the field trips and found them to be a valuable learning experience.",
    "Shimi is a rock star. Such a great lecturer and somehow makes a 4 hour class interesting, engaging, and fun all the way through. I can never tell how he does it but I leave every class feeling like I learned a ton and didn't mind it in the least.The cookies and coffee break is clutch.The student presentations\/papers were great. They let us explore our interests in more detail and I learned a lot from other people's presentations.The class size and community feeling of the class fostered a great learning environment- definitely my most close-knit class.The themes running through all ecosystems were well emphasized and were a great way to pull everything together.",
    "Reading the primary literature and discussing the major points in class. I feel much more comfortable with journal articles as a result.",
    "The variety it was not just Shimi lecturing all the time.",
    "Great exposure to primary literature on coastal concepts. Nice discussions and student participation. Concepts were clearly explained.",
    "The course material was presented clearly and questions and discussion was encouraged. I liked the amount of primary literature that I gained exposure to through the course. I think that it is useful to be able to analyze primary literature, and that is a skill that the students were able to hone through this course. The field trips were a great component as well and allowed for a synthesis of many of the concepts that we discussed in class.I also appreciated how we were able to ask questions on the readings via email before class. This allowed for a more streamlined class that focused on the areas where students had the most questions."

   "comments": [
    "I thought it was a somewhat unfair disadvantage that we were expected to know redox and the N cycle. It would have been helpful to go over this a little more in class, or if you had an optional reading or session for students. I got by through the exams\/quizzes, but still don't totally understand either.",
    "As with any general course, we seemed to run through some subjects rather quickly. It may be beneficial to determine the most important subjects, perhaps based on an initial survey of people in the class in a given year, and go into a bit more detail on those fewer topics.",
    "I don't think sending the weekly question was particularly useful. There could also be fewer quizzes.",
    "Can we have a few more guest lecturers and\/or field trips with these people? All four field trips were focused on salt marshes. While I know this is a big focus of the class, for those of us not as focused on SMs, I would have liked to go on a field trip to the rocky intertidal or a friday option to go out on the Sound.",

My feedback would be on the N-cycle, as i went to office hours, and got the basics but still didn't understand enough compared to the level of understanding expected in the class. More preparation for an N cycle lecture would have been very helpful.",

    "Instructor: Troy Derek Hill \u00a0Troy was an accessible teaching fellow. He was always willing to meet with students outside of class, and he was great at explaining concepts. Before the exam he ran a review session that lasted about three hours to make sure that all of the students' questions were answered. He was a great teaching fellow."
