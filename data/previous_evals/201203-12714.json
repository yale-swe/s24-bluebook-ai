   "comments": [
    "This class is pretty dope. Lectures move at a good pace and are pretty interesting, and prof. Shao is very funny. The small class size (about 10-12 students total) made it a pretty relaxed environment, and I learned a ton about programming languages and compilation. You build an entire compiler by the end of the course - how awesome is that!I also feel like we had a great mix of theory and implementation, because I feel I can write a compiler for pretty much any language since I know the principles well. The first 4 psets aren't too hard, but type-checking and the main backend assignment both take forever. I did CodeGen because I heard it was the toughest and it was a lot of work, but I also learned a lot about assembly code and the stack and function calls and tons of other stuff. I did RegAlloc for my final project and it was pretty straightforward.I'd highly recommend that everyone take this class!",
    "A systems course that will teach you about more than just snippets of code. Professor Zhao is really great, and the moment that you run the first program compiled by your compiler? Amazing. The assignments are tough but not unreasonable, and it's a great chance to brush up on functional programming.",
    "Take this course to learn about functional programming. Zhong is a good lecturer, but the material is a bit dry. More difficult than the average CS elective, but less difficult than 323."
