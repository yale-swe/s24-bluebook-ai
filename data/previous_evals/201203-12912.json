    "My experience with research won't necessarily replicate, nor even resemble, anyone else's. The most important factor is probably your immediate mentor, who is probably a graduate student or postdoc. The professor only sets the tone of the lab, but he or she is unlikely to be very personally involved in your experiments unless your lab size is fewer than 3 people. I was fortunate to have perhaps the best mentor in existence - knowledgeable, flexible, tolerant, yet meticulous. I have been working with him for several semesters and I have learned an immense amount of practical skills in the lab. Depending on the nature of your research, you may find yourself in a science building late in the evenings or early on Sundays, or in the 35 minutes between your two classes, but hopefully you find some regular hours as well. While I was not required to write a report, be aware that a written or oral summary of your research is a time-consuming endeavour.",
    "It's great!",
    "I would recommend Chemistry 490 to any student in chemistry. The course gives students the great opportunity to research chemistry for credit while attending weekly hour-long lectures on scientific ethics.",
    "Take this if you want to get credit for the research you are doing. Just be careful in discussing how many semesters you are going to do with Professor Zilm (DUS) and your PI.",
    "Good opportunity to synthesize knowledge from the Chemistry program of study in applying coursework towards experimental problems.",
    "Great. You usually take this because you have to, but it really is whatever you and your PI make of it.",
    "Research is the heart of the Chemistry major! Do as many semesters of this class as your schedule allows.",
    "It's research for credit! Fun, reward, and enjoyment depends on your project and your desires.",
    "Yes, CHEM 490 is a great opportunity to do your own research and since you can choose any professor you like, I think it is a huge waste if you do not enjoy it.",
    "You are pretty much just working in your lab, so your experience will be whatever you make it to be. No real extra requirements other than attending the graduate student ethics class."
