    "Hindi 110 is a good introductory language course. You begin by learning the script (which is surprisingly easy to learn if you take time to practice for a while on your ownin the first couple weeks), and then you begin to learn grammar. This semester, we learned how to construct basic sentences in several tenses. You also learn a lot about Indian culture through the study of the language.I would recommend Hindi to another student because it is a low-stress language course. Quizzes are given once a week, but they are easy A's if you do your homework and study the vocab lists. The only frustrating thing about Hindi 110 is that some students already have a basic knowledge of the language (i.e. their parents speak it). As a student with absolutely no previous knowledge of Hindi (and I mean NONE), I would still say that this is a very do-able language class. The only advantage that these students had over me was that they were better had understanding the subtle differences in the spoken language because they had been hearing it all their lives.",
    "Fantastic class. Not too much work, but you do learn a lot if you put the effort in.",
    "Definitely take Hindi! It's a fun, easy language and the professors are great. Plus, it's very low stress.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS!!! Hindi is a super cool language. This class is a super reasonable amount of work and you will come out of it having actually learned something. One of my best decisions to take this class!",
    "I would absolutely recommend Hindi to another student, as long as they're willing to be flexible. The class isn't very organized and sometimes it moves too fast, other times it's too repetitive, but the professors are great and it's a beautiful language. Weekly quizzes, nightly homework that can get a bit overwhelming sometimes but is usually very doable, a fun midterm skit, and an even funner final project.",
    "Good. It's taught by multiple teachers so it can feel disjointed sometimes. Both Seema and Swapna are very kind and helpful. Certainly not one of the harder language classes at Yale. It can actually be quite fun. Weekly quizzes and a few other assignments for the midterm and final. If you're interested in India, give it a go.",
    "I highly recommend this class as you learn so much without it being overwhelming. Sometimes it is frustrating memorizing the grammar with vocabulary with the Hindi script but it is very rewarding at the end of the course knowing you are able to do all those things. At the end of Hindi 110 you'll be able to have a very basic conversation but also be able to read and write completely in Hindi.",
    "This is a great language which opens up a part of the world that is usually not available to us.",
    "Yes!"
