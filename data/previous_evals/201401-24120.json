    "Great variety of speakers",
    "I like having a lecture series about CDE research, it's really interesting and gave me ideas about who I might want to work with and how to structure my own research practice in the future.",
    "Good, some speakers were a lot better than others.",
    "There were a variety of presenters. I would prefer more frequent seminars.",
    "Great- I love hearing\/learning about various research topics in CDE and getting the chance to meet faculty\/researchers from other schools and institutions.",
    "It would be helpful to get reminders of when the class is taking place, since there wasn't a regular schedule.",
    "Interesting way to learn about different subjects in CDE. I frequently stayed for the SBS lectures as well.",
    "cool talks, good way to get to know what other professors are doing in the school",
    "Good way to meet faculty in our own departments and learn about what they are doing.",
    "good food this semester!",
    "Don't kill people in your experiments. Got it.",
    "Seminar for CDE was only required once a week - I would have liked for there to be more, but also more diversity in topics. Most were very research heavy and would have liked to know more opportunities post-MPH outside academia."

    "great opportunity for student to learn more about research"
