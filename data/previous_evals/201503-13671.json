    "Thomas is a great instructor, very clear in explaining the concepts and spot on. The challenge really comes from the client and managing the project, which is beyond his control.",
    "Professor Swarr is engaged and clearly cares a lot about the topic and his students. However, the lectures were often difficult to follow and engage in. More, shorter assignments would have been helpful. It would also benefit the course quite a bit to have a lecture hall set up and have more interactive lectures instead of holding them in the computer lab.",
    "This was the worst class I have taken in years. There was an enormous gap between the concepts taught and their application. The fact that the SimaPro software was given to us over a month after the class started did not help at all... It is hard to figure what was learnt in the class. Also the fact that SimaPro can be handled by only one team member does not help at all for learning.",
    "Professor can be a bit more strict - else students will take advantage of the professor & class.",
    "The professor can be a little bit muddled, especially when explaining some of the overly-nuanced details during excessive lecturing. However, he's a really nice guy who wants you to learn and will help you understand SimaPro and the homework. The problem isn't necessarily him, so much as it is the irrelevant lecturing. The pace of the class altered between ridiculously slow (during all the lecturing) and fast (when we had homework assignments in SimaPro). This could be improved with more time devoted to explaining SimaPro and how to use it, and less time lecturing about the theoretical ideas of LCAs.",
    "Because this class had no prerequisites, I came into it expecting a very introductory course to LCA thinking and modeling. I felt like we did not begin with the basics, and the course was taught at such a high level that very few of us understood what was going on for most of the class. The information and concepts were not accessible; I felt I needed to be taught in a much more elementary way, at least leading into the heavier concepts. Also having both a client project and an introduction to LCA and SimaPro was too much for one semester. Prof Swarr was very kind and unbelievably helpful, however the information was simply not delivered in an accessible way to those of us who had no experience with LCA or industrial ecology.",
    "Please hold this class in a different classroom - it was impossible to have class discussions as all the students were distracted by their computers in front of them. This class should focus much more on technical skills and mastering SimaPro and not have lectures on tangential material that is also discussed in other FES classes. I would also recommend NOT doing client-based projects at least for this intro-level class. A lot of the teams had incomplete data, which made the projects more difficult and as a result hindered the mastery of the software. While having perfect data is not realistic in the real world, it would be beneficial to fully understand the functionalities of SimaPro before diving into client-work (perhaps students could take a second LCA class that would include a consulting project.)",
    "#4: LCAs are complicated and everyone wants to learn them! The course is just too ambitious to have students start with zero knowledge of an LCA and then complete one for a client. There should be a final LCA project but perhaps a second more advanced course that is client based. Otherwise, industrial ecology or something similar with LCA exposure should be a prereq.",
    "Question 9: Tom was very responsive to the students but sometimes appeared a bit disorganized when setting up team meetings. We were, however, able to meet with him whenever we needed to discuss something important.",
    "More time should be spent doing theoretical LCA's (without using SimaPro). The current structure was not very helpful.",
    "The professor needs to be more definitive in giving instructions and his requirements."

    "My one-on-one interactions with Professor Swarr discussing my project were by far the most instructive and valuable parts of the course. Swarr is generous with his time and it is very much appreciated by his students. He adds a lot of value and knowledge to the subject.",
    "Very practical application - great system perspective and important concepts for thinking about business & the environment. Speakers were interesting: allowed for practical application and sharing of experience. Good idea with client projects just very intense for 1 semester (however, how can improve team work for projects? It must be clear from the beginning that this class will demand a certain amount of work - in our team for example people were to busy with other classes\/extra-curricular activities that most of the group work fell on 2 people out of 4!!!). Good projects\/client selection!",
    "A lot of practice with the software SimaPro which give me technical skills. Also get a sense of what lCA is, and how to do it.",
    "Getting to apply your learning to a real-world project. The client project makes this class, even if you get a troublesome project\/client. The project is essentially where 90% of your learning comes from.",
    "My client project was interesting, and in the end the results were illuminating in my understanding of the relevant topic. Prof Swarr was extremely helpful and responsive when we did not understand something and in guiding us through our projects.",
    "Learned a tremendous amount and activities made students learn and use SimaPro.",
    "SimaPro exercises.",
    "I thought the class was a great introduction to SimaPro and that we were able to get our feet wet using the software.",
    "The consulting project and client interaction was great. I had a good group so it was always fun to work on.",

   "comments": [
    "The lectures were difficult to follow and were often a bit too high-level. A lot of the material is covered in other classes. More detail on LCA specifically, or a quarter-long lecture series with a quarter-long project would be a better structure.",
    "Finding a more energetic person to teach the class, someone who is more structured and allow for better learning. Also, it would be great to find better and more proactive TAs who can help while we run in class exercise instead of hiding and be on their computers all the time. I was really expecting more from a university as Yale... what is the reputation for if it is not possible to attract talented professors?",
    "The lectures are too high-level for basic understanding for our projects",
    "client project work: our team did not function well - I had to be behind all of my team members to make sure they do work. If someone commits to the class they should make sure that they commit as well to the work related to the client project. For some students the end result for the client and its quality requirements seemed not to be clear - importance of clarifying expectations! Unfortunately, last classed mixed up through fire alarm. Not ideal to have one class moved to reading week. People will not attend. Get the software installed earlier (I know this was already a concern but CSSSI should know that this is happening every year?!) Be more clear with IT team.",
    "The instructor can organize the class in a more tight way - while this is a project-based course, students engagements in class are also necessary. Also, group work always faces a problem of suitable task division and the effectiveness of each member. While not all, but some of the members always postpone the tasks of his\/hers, and don't contribute as much as others. But the grading\/score of the whole group is the same - it's unfair to those who contribute more and support the project most.",
    "The format. I think it would be good to reduce the lecturing and readings by at least 50%, and instead focus on having students learn the ins and outs of the program and then do some critical thinking and discussion around the applications of LCAs, the pros and cons, etc. We could come to the same conclusions as presented during lectures, but in a way that would be much more engaging and would help the information stick. Also, the lab room is not an effective space for listening to lectures and participating- too many distractions, can't always see other students or the front of the room. It should be moved to a classroom that would promote more discussion and force people to focus.",
    "Should not be a client project and LCA intro in one semester. Material needs to be taught in much more elementary, introductory way. i.e., start off with how to think through a flow chart\/basic LCA model; do together in class; then apply attribution, consequential, etc., and build off of that. Material was too high level and inaccessible, as was reading.",
    "The amount covered. Could\/should be a yearlong course. Part a. conceptual and Part b. applied. Tom's lectures where great but demonstrations in SimaPro to the class could have been more streamlined with in class activities students had more guidance replicating.",
    "Projects and using SimaPro.",
    "This course should definitely have some field trips. Where students can have the opportunity to see real applications for LCA in industries and businesses. Important issue: this should be a small class with few students. The professor and TAs need to give more personal attention to each one. Otherwise the tool makes it really complicated to learn and explore.",
    "I think that there is a lot of information that can be taught about LCA but it can be difficult to pack all of that in while still allowing for time to work on the group project. I would have preferred more group work time in class than lectures.",
    "The homeworks in the beginning of the class were frustrating for learning SimaPro; it would have been nice to walk through them as in class exercises to turn in rather than homeworks. Lectures were often not very helpful and difficult to follow in the computer lab. The lecture aspect of the class could use some restructuring.",
    "the lectures. wihtout hands-on experience in simapro, the course wasn't incredibly useful.",
    "More involvement from the professor and TAs on monitoring the client relationship and refinement of the project scope. Our client for example was highly unresponsive and unengaged which made us lose motivation to deliver."

    "The group project was the main component of the course. Working in a team for a long-term engagement with a client was a valuable experience in people, time, task management.",
    "Disadvantages: only one person had the Sima Pro model and used it as tool to steer team meetings in its favor. The overall team experience was horrible to say the least as this guy kept complaining he was doing all the work and nobody else was. Even though I kept on asking whether I could help in anyway I was basically called incompetent cause I was not familiar with the model. Whoever decides to take on the model leadership should sign an agreement of some sorts stating the willingness to take on extra work and the willingness to explain other team members the steps he\/she performed to run the model... otherwise it is just unacceptable that this one person learns everything about LAC and SimaPro without explaining anything to the other members and pretending the other members understand what he\/she has been doing.",
    "Not best team - people were not very committed. Most of the work was done by 2 out of 4 people. 1 person had no clue of what was going on and did not make any efforts to understand more. Even though - I felt we did a good job in the end (hopefully). At the beginning we struggled with understanding what first steps are with the client (GE). Thus would have been helpful to have clearer information either through class or from Ge. They just handed us 2-3 documents with names but we did not know if this was their work, if we should use it or if this was from GE (--> clarification necessary), BOM data was handed over much later (which lead to had to go and measure lamp 3 times). Some information could have been shared with us from beginning: ex. not as precise as demanded from client,... a lot of learning by doing :)",
    "Group work always faces a problem of suitable task division and the effectiveness of each member. While not all, but some of the members always postpone the tasks of his\/hers, and don't contribute as much as others. But the grading\/score of the whole group is the same - it's unfair to those who contribute more and support the project most.",
    "Advantages: We divided and conquered the project work, which made it much more manageable. We got to work on a real product and discuss real-world LCA issues with our client. Overall our team was functional and effective. Disadvantages: One person sort of micromanaged the rest of the team, and some of us were less familiar with the model than others. Despite attempts to start early, we still ended up doing most of the work on the model and the data gathering in the later half of the semester, feeling pretty rushed.",
    "This was a very large project and would have not been possible alone. I was grateful to have a group to think through things with and split the work. It was very hard to find time to all meet for lengthy amounts of time which the project often required. Also one of my team members was out of the country for a long period of time and did not put in as much work as the rest of us which was disappointing.",
    "On a team, some people get more time in SimaPro than others.",
    "Working in group with people with different commitments and skills was a challenge.",
    "Overall, I think our group suffered from miscommunication at many stages and we could have done a better job working together as one instead of working as individuals. We each were fairly independent people, which did not lend itself well to extensive teamwork. There were some members of our group who did not complete the tasks that they had said they were going to complete.
