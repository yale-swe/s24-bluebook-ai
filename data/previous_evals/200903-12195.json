   "comments": [
    "If you enjoy the women's perspective on literature, I would recommend this course. Some of the points of conversation were beat over the head, like the difference between women and men's autobiographies, but you can also make this course into what you want it to be.",
    "Yes, it's an interesting course.",
    "Not worth it...unless you are absolutely sure you will love the subject material. Definitely take a minute to look up the books on the syllabus and make sure they sound like something you would want to read.",
    "Broad overview of autobiography as a category- really pushes you to push your own definitions and boundaries. The class is great if you're interested in different cultures, especially from a feminist perspective. The reading is heavy, but you should do as much of it as you can, because it's all quite interesting.",
    "I would recommend this course to those interested in how women tell their stories and how they construct and portray their identities. It's an enjoyable course that covers a lot of fascinating material -- including some wonderful autobiographies and some thought-provoking feminist theory. Some of the readings are hit-or-miss, and some of the theoretical texts are a bit dry, but the issues the course explores are extremely interesting, and I felt I learned a great detail about autobiography and cultural issues surrounding the ways in which women tell their stories. The workload isn't overwhelming, although there are only two papers (and a final project), both of which were somewhat challenging to write, as they required connecting autobiographical and theoretical texts that weren't necessarily very related. (Most of the autobiographies are from the Middle East and Southeast Asia, while the theory is predominantly Western, which posed some challenges.) The class also requires making blog posts and participating in discussions on the blog (i.e. commenting on posts), which can be a little time-consuming (especially since it wasn't clear how much blog participation was required), but the blog is also a nice way to continue discussions outside of class and gain a better understanding of some of the material. In general, if you're willing to tackle the reading (there isn't too much) and participate actively in discussions, this is a wonderful course that exposes students to some great autobiographies, films, and speakers.",
    "I liked this course overall. The readings (aside from some theoretical pieces) were very interesting and they are the type of books you would pick up to read for fun. The class discussions were a little unstructured at times, but all in all a class worth taking. I took it to fulfill a writing requirement and the workload was not bad at all.",
    "It was amazing. That's pretty much all I have to say.It's a must-take, for sure. The best course I took. It opened up my mind, improved my analytical skills and honed my writing skills.Most of the readings were all interesting, even if some were dense; a lot of them were fascinating.",
    "An excellent course that forces you to think about something we very rarely consider in academia -- yourself! That said, those looking for an easy class where you can just talk about yourself should look elsewhere. Professor Chanda requires that you think about your own experiences in the context of the theorectical and autobiographical texts you read in class; in so doing, she offers a new perspective on a familiar subject (i.e. our selves). While I was intimidated by the level of discourse at the beginning of the class, by the end I felt like she had helped me (without ever explicitly doing so) achieve a higher level of thought.",
    "Take it!!!! The reading is fabulous, the professor is GREAT, and the opportunity to write an autobiographical work at the end offers a chance for critical self-reflection, something we don't make enough time for at Yale.",
    "You write 2 relatively short papers, a couple of one page reading responses, and then create an autobiography, which can be pretty much anything you want. The readings are great and discussion is fun.",
    "I loved this class. You are able to discover autobiography and indeed writing as an art in a very fulfilling way. There is a lot to read but the material is varied and therefore it doesn't seem a chore. Also, for a writing credit the essays are reasonable - quality is expected more than a ridiculous quantity.",
    "Whatever you're looking to get out of this class, you're not likely to get it here. Do not be fooled by the professor; she's deceptively nice and won't hesitate to turn on you if you get on her bad side.Don't bother unless it's with another professor (not Chanda). It's not worth her power trip. Seriously.",
    "I know a few people who really liked this course, but I know quite a fe more people who were disappointed with it. There's a lot of reading and a lot of the reading is very repetative. But it was not a bad writing credit, in fact we got to write our own autobiographies at the end of the course, which was so much fun!"
