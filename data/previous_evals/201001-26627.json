    "The seminar style class was a strength - namely small class size allowed for participation and looking at material in depth and with a critical eye. Another strength was having guest lecturers who were experts in a particular substantive area that was the topic of focus for the day. Although the class was strong in terms of attempting to incorporate a number of pedagogical styles, there is always the danger of too much variation (breadth v. depth) that could be improved in the future. I would have liked to see a little more robustness of articulation of the human rights framework in addition to the multi-level determinants model to look at countries undergoing political and economic transition.",
    "Strengths: very interesting discussions, speakers, and participation from all the studentsWeaknesses: discussions could sometimes lead off topic and certain themes or other important relevant points from the readings would not be disucssed.",
    "A fantastic course with fascinating material taught by a dedicated and interested professor!",
    "STRENGTHS: (1) Selection of articles - good diversity of methods, viewpoints, and countries(2) Use of innovative teaching activities- Skype video conferences with people working in the region, films about health issues, and student-led discussions and presentations kept the class interesting(3) Structure of course - helpful to start with general perspective on transition, then move through specific health topics(4) Structure of assignments - nice to have midterm, presentation, and final paper linked to same topic; this helped me dig deeper into the contentWEAKNESSES\/IMPROVEMENTS: (1) Blog posting - maybe class was too small but the blog did not really take off; perhaps making it a 'requirement' to post on the blog dampened students' willingness to spontaneously comment, as postings were considered part of the grade. Perhaps have the blog but don't require students to post.(2) Final synthesis activity - this should be refined further; perhaps integrate the multi-level framework activity earlier in the course (e.g. fill out the table gradually over the semester?) and focus final session on key themes that could be applied beyond the region. If human rights framework is part of final synthesis activity, would also be good to have some background readings related to human rights for the final week, or integrate those readings earlier in the semester."

    "Instructor: Teresa Marie Janevic \u00a0Teresa is a really approachable teacher - she is accessible and responsive to student questions and feedback directly in class and over email. She was more than happy to discuss term papers with students. The suggestion I would make in terms of teaching style is that I wish Teresa had been a little more assertive in sharing the depth of knowledge she has around this area of work, instead of only focusing on the readings. I think, however, for the first time teaching this course, Teresa was great!",
    "Instructor: Teresa Marie Janevic \u00a0Dr. Janevic was very accommodating to the students' schedules and interests. She would bring up very interesting points to lead very fruitful discussions.",
    "Instructor: Teresa Marie Janevic \u00a0Interested in the material and our understanding of it. An excellent teacher.",
    "Instructor: Teresa Marie Janevic \u00a0STRENGTHS:- Excellent firsthand and academic knowledge of health issues in the region; great to have an instructor who knew the ground-level realities AND the literature- Good discussion facilitation skills; able to keep the conversation moving and cover key points from readings even with a small class- Creative and flexible teaching style; developed tailored activities for each class session and was able to adapt them and still cover all material when scheduling difficulties arose- Friendly and accessible; very responsive on email and in conversations outside of classWEAKNESSES\/IMPROVEMENTS:- Summarize key take-aways at the end of class: the flip side of Teresa being a great discussion facilitator is that sometimes I was unclear on what her own opinion was of the literature under debate. It would have been helpful to perhaps conclude each session with a review of the key points that we should have drawn from the readings\/discussion (or perhaps summarize at the start of the next class)."

   "comments": [
    "It's a good course if you are interested in how transitioning economies and political systems affect human health. There are different frameworks under which health can be characterized and this class attempts to articulate the common ones.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student interested in understanding how economic and political changes affect health. One limitation is that it solely focuses on Eastern Europe\/Former Soviet Union, which some prospective students may not have a strong interest.",
    "This is a really fascinating course! It looks at key health issues in countries of the Former Soviet Union and Central and Eastern Europe, including drug and alcohol abuse, mental health, HIV\/AIDS and tuberculosis, and reproductive health. It considers social, political, and economic determinants of these health issues and what interventions are possible at the community, national, and international levels. The class is structured mainly as participatory discussions of the assigned articles but there are also expert guest speakers from NGOs working in the region.I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It would be interesting and valuable for someone who is familiar with public health but not with the region, or for someone familiar with the region but not health issues. Teresa is an extremely knowledgeable instructor - it's worth taking the class just to learn from her!"
