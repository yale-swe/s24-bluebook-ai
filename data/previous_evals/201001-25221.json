    "psych 495 is a great way to get (half of) a credit. it introduces you to the wide variety of fascinating research being done at yale. plus it's literally no work other than sitting in a lecture which is fantastic.",
    "Definitely recommend. Very fun and a great learning experience.",
    "I would recommend it. You learn about doing research, and this is not just some boring first RA job -- you get to play with monkeys from day 1. The monkeys are fun, and everyone who works in the lab is great. The time commitment is sizable for a half credit, but it's more like playing than working so unless you think about it like you're going to class (which you shouldn't), it's really not burdensome.",
    "Yes, good way to get involved with research.",
    "I would recommend the Zigler lecture series to other students. It's neat to listen to an expert in a new topic every week, and it's a nice way to earn an extra half-credit instead of taking a full-credit class.",
    "Great way to get a half credit to fill in a dangling half from a language requirement.Lectures are kind of boring though. But it's easy, you just write a paper.",
    "I would recommend working in a lab that you find particularly interesting, especially if you are considering continuing with psychology after you graduate. This experience can show you a different side of psychology that you might not get to see in lectures.",
    "I would definitely recommend it!",
    "Absolutely. It is worth the walk over to the lab. The monkeys are amazing and its a class that is nothing like just sitting in class and taking notes.",
    "I would definitely recommend the course, particularly if, like me, you haven't had lab experience and are looking for a way to learn more about the lab setting. Everyone is friendly and helpful, and working with monkeys is fun. The lab meetings were also interesting, because Professor Santos frequently brought in researchers from other areas to talk about their research, and hearing different perspectives and the question and answer sesions at the end was always enlightening.",
    "Do it! Whether in Laurie's lab or another lab, research is a great way to actually do the kind of things you learn about in your other classes",
    "Fantastic. A great way to earn a half credit if youre a psych major.",
    "It's great to actually work in a lab doing research. Highly recommended.",
    "Definitely!",
    "If you're interested in psych research, this is the right course.",
    "Good learning experience doing what real psychology is like.",
    "Take it, you get great experience.",
    "Yes, it's a good way to fulfill part of your senior requirement for Psych majors. Also, it's good to get lab experience and see the results of your hard work!",
    "Definitely take if you have a .5 credit slot available.",
    "Take it and make something good out of it."
