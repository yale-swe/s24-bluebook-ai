    "I learned some interesting mathematical techniques, but overall I think this course was below my level.",
    "The MATLAB and Fourier transform.",
    "I learned analytical methodologies as well as MATLAB skills in this course.",
    "I mainly learned some basic Matlab coding (mostly through the final project) and the significance of the Fourier transform operation.",
    "This course taught me a lot about statistics and the various methods used in science to correctly interpret data. I also learned basic skills in MATLAB, which I had not used before (though I have done some programming before).",
    "Using biostatistics, FT and modeling to solve bio questions",
    "Learned stats, Fourier transform, large dataset analysis",
    "Learn basic MatLab programming skills. Learned some basic stats that is useful if you have no background. The Simbiology lectures felt very long (anyone can figure out how to use the software just by playing around with it for an hour). It was difficult to learn anything useful from the Fourier transform module - the class avoided the math as much as possible, and without the math, you can't really get an intuition for what the FT is doing.",
    "Better insight into quantitative tools for data analysis and manipulation of large datasets",
    "Introduction to Matlab was very helpful",
    "Matlab coding.",
    "In this course, I learned methods to quantitatively study biological systems, including statistical assessment, mathematical transformations (Fourier methods), simulation of reaction networks, and analyzing large data sets.",
    "I learned what coding is and how it works and what it can do in Matlab. I had no idea before. However much of my learning came from discussions with other students and not from the instructor themselves. I had to google a lot too.",
    "I learned methods of statistics, the significance of a p-value, and how to use MATLAB to build models as well as analyze big data.",
    "I was exposed to different topics within biochemistry and biophysics. Very surface level, not much in depth.",
    "I learned broad ideas about Fourier transforms, statistics, Matlab coding, and large dataset analysis. Each unit did not go far into detail, but instead gave us tools with which we could delve further if we desired in the future and taught fundamental concepts.",
    "Not much. The final project taught me the most out of anything - practical use of SimBiology.",
    "MATLAB programming, data analysis, and Fourier Transform."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I think this course could benefit by having clearer connections between the sections of the course. For example, the statistics section shouldn't be as far away from the data analysis section as it is.",
    "Strengths: The course is really friendly to a student who is freshly new to MATLAB. Weaknesses: The course is too simple for students who have already know MATLAB and the basic knowledge of statistics\/modeling\/Fourier Transform.",
    "I like the composition of the course, as multiple instructors covered their own portions of the course. I also like the fact that we got the oppotunity to work on our own project.",
    "I think the course could have better organization overall. The statistics project did not seem well planned. The statistics lectures did not do a very good job teaching any statistical methods, so I think it was difficult to try and apply these methods to a dataset.",
    "The course is very well organized, and the different modules flow well into one another. There was a clear logical progression from one topic to the next. Many of the topics, like the foundational statistics talks, will be useful to everyone no matter what specific topics we decide to study.",
    "Strength in diversity of skills but grading and expectations a bit unclear",
    "There wasnt enough time for each module to be thorough, particularly since they were so different in subject matter.",
    "This course contained a lot of interesting material. In general, too much time was spent on statistics and Fourier methods and too little time was spent on modeling and large datasets. In addition, very little feedback was given on coursework, making it difficult to assess my own progress throughout the course.",
    "The course could be improved by providing more of the math background when discussing statistics, as well as building up students MATLAB knowledge prior to teaching applications.",
    "Strengths was that is introduced a lot of topics I had no prior knowledge in, but the trade off is that mainly I was just made aware of their existence and can't apply them to problems I need to solve. Maybe focus on less topics more in depth? Or instead of lecturing make each module a project to force interaction with the material. The final project was the most helpful part of the course.",
    "The strengths of the course are that we were taught the basics of each topic by professors who work with each topic regularly, and they broke it down well for people from all backgrounds. One weakness would be that the class could feel very disorganized due to the nature of having multiple instructors over time.",
    "This class should not survey topics - we've all heard of most of these techniques and what we need is practical understanding. I would divide the course up into modules and have one project per module.",
    "The professor can be more organized with each other. There are many different parts in the courses, which I think is very seperate."

   "comments": [
    "I think if you are unfamiliar with math or computing this class might be useful. However, anyone with even basic computational or mathematical skill won't get much out of this class that they couldn't get from reading a textbook on their own.",
    "If the student want to learn MATLAB from the beginning, I think I will.",
    "Yes, I this the knowledge in this course is useful, especially MATLAB applications.",
    "I would recommend it to someone looking for more of an introduction to statistics, modeling, coding, etc. Since I have not studied these topics in depth previously, the information was useful to me. But for someone who has done this kind of computational work extensively in the past (especially in MATLAB), they might find the course too basic\/repeating things they already know.",
    "Yes, it's useful to learn for further study.",
    "Yes , its a good way to be exposed to new concepts",
    "Yes, it gave me an opportunity to become familiar with techniques like crystallography and electron microscopy and the analysis behind the data.",
    "Yes. It teached basic coding in matlab and also Fourier Transform.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. The course provided a foundation for using quantitative biology to study a variety of systems.",
    "Yes. While the course was not exactly well organized and easy to follow, it covers important topics that any researcher should know how to use in biochemistry or biophysics.",
    "I probably would not only because I do not feel like I have developed clear skills I can apply to my research so it was kind of just a time sink.",
    "No, it was not very useful."
