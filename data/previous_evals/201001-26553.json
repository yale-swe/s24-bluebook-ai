    "It's a great class, and if you're interested in North Africa, or don't know anything about it (like me), you should take it! It is a lot of reading and writing in French though, so make sure you're fairly comfortable with your French.",
    "interesting.",
    "You might look at the course title and description and think that this class is not for you. I assure you, if you enjoy French and are even remotely interested in post-colonial theory, you will love this class. Definitely shop this class even id you don't end up taking it.",
    "Maghreb is a great L5 if you're looking to satisfy the language requirement: light workload (3 papers and a presentation), with no quizzes or tests. The reading can be pretty hefty, but skimming\/focusing on important stuff makes it more bearable. Overall definitely good for French speakers.",
    "I would recommend French 215 to another student who had a keen interest in the culture of the Maghreb or in political relations between the Maghreb and Europe, but not to someone who was only casually interested in the course. It's a fair amount of reading, so I'd recommend that only students who are interested make the commitment.",
    "There is a lot of reading and sometimes the books are hard. The workload isn't too bad (2 short papers, a longer paper and a presentation). It's very interesting if you're interested in colonialism. The themes we talk about are applicable to current times which is always an extra benefit.",
    "I was hoping that by taking this course I'd be able to categorize the contradictory narratives of the Maghreb, but the course helped me understand that it's a complex place and that its complexities can't be reconciled, though I have a much better understanding of them now. Unique literature that reflects the troubles of the region, and Professor Tamalet provides deep background. Lots of reading in French, helpful if you're comfortable with skimming.",
    "I would absolutely recommend French 215 to any student of french literature interested in North African culture and history, or any french student who is interested in exploring french literature outside the western canon\/european tradition."
