   "comments": [
    "The material is pretty interesting, especially the statistical mechanics portion. Definitely take it with Skiba if you can - he explains things very well, and makes the class fun. Great for the physics major or even for a non-major looking for physics at a deeper lever. Not too hard.",
    "You know you're only taking this because you have to.But it's a lot of fun. Prof Skiba is the best (no but actually) and you'll learn some really nifty stuff. Stat mech is one of the last new ways of thinking you'll get in the physics major, and it's a really nice breath of fresh air.",
    "Overall, it's a well-taught class, with a lot of interesting new material - especially the Statmech stuff. Definitely an improvement over Physics 201. My only complaint is that the final didn't really test the material we covered in class.",
    "Do you want to pursue a physics major but also have as much fun as if you were going out to Toad's (a safe, sanitary, intellectually steeped Toad's, that is) twice a week? Then you have just a single option. Take PHYS 402 or any other class offered by Professor Skiba. The content covered by the course is fun and exciting, but Professor Skiba brings new dimensions to the words \"fun\" and \"exciting.\" And he'll teach you how to integrate over those dimensions too. Also, he's hilarious and lecture was boring a grand total of zero minutes over the course of the semester. If you don't take this class, you will regret it for the rest of your life. Don't take PHYS 430 because you're hell-bent on looking good to a graduate school. You use the same textbook, so if you really want, just read more on your own time. Take this class and marvel in what an awesome professor Professor Skiba is. It will be the class of your Yale career.",
    "Good course I liked it fine, a bit harder than 401 but if you are going to take it you probably have to for your major.",
    "Yes, but only if you have to. There are more fun science classes out there",
    "You should absolutely take Physics 402. The course is taught very systematically, and each lecture provides a very thorough and satisfying amount of knowledge. I would probably say it's the best class I've taken at Yale. If Professor Skiba is teaching the class, then you are less likely to get lost in lecture, because he is always very willing to go back and repeat an explanation or two. Take this class.",
    "A great continuation of 402. Professor Skiba did a great job picking up where Shankar left off, covering stat mech and E&M. Overall, I'd recommend taking this course if you took 401.",
    "Professor Skiba is the nicest most likeable professor anyone could ask for, but the lectures were hard to understand and the tests were really tough.",
    "If you're thinking of taking 402, you've taken 401 and probably don't have much of a choice. If you're on the fence, I would say take it. The little intro to stat. mech is interesting and the E&M material wouldn't be very difficult if you have a good knowledge of multivariable calc. If you want to save yourself a lot of time and headache, brush up on your multivariable calculus before this class and the E&M part will be much easier to understand."
