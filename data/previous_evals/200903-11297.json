   "comments": [
    "It's pretty much like the second semester of AP Calc BC (if you took that in high school). I'd recommend it to another student; it wasn't too interesting but also not too much work and a good way to fulfill some of the math requirements for pre-med.",
    "It's just a bunch of random calculations that seem pointless at the time, but then come back to make sense much later. I would recommend this course to students who don't mind having their minds boggled in a mundane way.",
    "It depends. I lot of the students have taken Calc AB or BC in high school so watch out, but also the material is well presented. It goes a little fast at the end. it will very much be a challenge the weekends before tests, but otherwise, it's not too bad.",
    "Yes, math 115 was a class based more on reasoning than pure math in my opinion and that made it a lot easier. The class was really great and helped my math reasoning skills exponentially, I would certainly recommend it to others.",
    "if they can handle math and want to think of grades very specifically on a curve-basis",
    "Basic overview of BC Calc.",
    "Math 115 is exactly what you'd expect, a continuation of whatever calculus you've done in high school. It's not super exciting, but it is a prereq for alot of things and also I suppose worthwhile if you just feel like taking some more calculus. If you do take the class take it with Joe Lauer. He is great. He explains things very clearly and makes them easy to understand. He is also very accessible for office hours. So basically if you're going to take this class you definitely should take it with him.",
    "Math 115 is essentially Calculus BC. I thought it was a good class, but I know many people hated it and were just taking it to fulfill a requirement.It's really important to get a good instructor. The instructor can make or break your experience in this class.",
    "A more in-depth study of basic ideas in calculus. I would recommend this class because it covers relevant material and is not too difficult for the average student.",
    "It is by no means an easy course, and it might be dull at times, but it does get more interesting later on, particularly in infinite series.",
    "Mathematics 115 is a rigorous \"Calculus II.\" Be prepared for weekly problem sets (up to 4hours) and spending time at numerous help\/tutoring sessions to fully comprehend and keep pace with the section. Exams are weighted heavily, but instructor led review sessions are invaluable. Best suited for the class are those who have taken and done well in both AP Calculus AB and BC."
