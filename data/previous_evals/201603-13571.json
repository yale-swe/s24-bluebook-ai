    "This was an incredibly informative course. The computer exercises in particular were very helpful, and would recommend adding more of them in the future. The course covered a wide breadth of useful information; I originally did not consider it as I thought it was a basic introduction to genetics, and would recommend re-naming it something like \"Genetic Epidemiology\" to catch students' attention and to more accurately represent the course content.",
    "Strength: very well structured Weakness: the timing is not well-designed, class is too long",
    "I would have benefited tremendously if Andy did a problem or two in class before assigning it OR posted the answer key. He would go over the material quickly at the start of class, but I personally needed more time to grasp what he was saying, where I went wrong, and I what I needed to do differently in the future. By the time I processed his first explanation, he would be way ahead again.",
    "Excellent course. Very oriented in genetic concepts and genetic analysis. It is great to have workshops for two basic genetic analysis software (plink, mlink). Overall, great option if interested in genetic research.",
    "The course materials are excellent! Very relevant case studies are included in the powerpoints and they prove very useful as references. Additionally, the amount of interesting concepts covered are tremendous, but there just isn't enough time to go in-depth with each one. Which is sort of a balancing act, as with everything."

    "Instructor: Andrew T. DeWan \u00a0I struggled and spent a lot of time frustrated. it was never because of Andy. Despite my personal frustrations, I can never say that he didn't care. He went above and beyond, truly cared, and was always accessible and quick to respond. He tries hard for his students and that's all you can ask for in a professor.",
    "Instructor: Andrew T. DeWan \u00a0Excellent instructor. All his lectures were clear and very illustrative of each concept. He was very comprehensive in the workshops for plink and mlink.",
    "Instructor: Andrew T. DeWan \u00a0Definitely one of the most knowledgeable professors I have come across. Lecturing style makes it so feasible to answer questions in tandem and his responses are always to the point. Moreover, he is always willing to rework problems assuming different initial values to help further explain a concept. Beyond the class, he is very accessible and open to discussing student interest and academic goals.",
    "Instructor: Andrew T. DeWan \u00a0Very responsive to his students. The contents of the course could be more up-to-date.",
    "Instructor: Andrew T. DeWan \u00a0Excellent"

   "comments": [
    "A very useful course outlining the basics of genetics, how\/why genetics matter in epidemiology, and how genetics can be assessed with epidemiological methods.",
    "Highly recommend for those who are interested in genetics with bio background, for it could be challenging for those without.",
    "This class is not for students without prior experience in genetics, but rather genetic epi\/stats. If you're not well versed in general concepts, you will struggle.",
    "Excellent introductory course for students interested in genetic research.",
    "Would definitely recommend it. A taste of genetics, bioinformatics, personalized medicine, genetic disorders, etc, which would help you identify any specific interest without going into either too in-depth.",
    "Yes"
