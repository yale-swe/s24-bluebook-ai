   "comments": [
    "I got the chance to work with primary documents in Manuscripts & Archives and it really improved my ability to analyze them.",
    "This course taught me how to do original research using historical archives, particularly those at Yale in the Sterling Memorial Library and Beinecke. It was a great way to learn how to take advantage of these tremendous resources.",
    "This course covers the extensive relationship between Yale and Japan, how those relations came to be and how they developed over time. The course also focuses on introducing the study of History by encouraging individual research into primary documents, and provides ample guidance for navigating through such a project.",
    "As the name suggests, this course taught me all about the interesting, eclectic, and unexpected ways in which the histories of Yale and Japan are intertwined. Beyond that, however, this class was my first real exposure to archival work and true research. The paper was a lot of work, and I think it gave me a great taste of what's to come with the senior thesis in the history major. Professor Botsman was really great in helping us learn how to use the archives and vast supply of resources that Yale has to offer!",
    "I learned a great deal about accessing wealth of archival research materials, and how to write an original paper from primary sources.",
    "This course focuses on improving students' archival research skills. It does an excellent job of walking students through the process of conceiving and then following through on a research idea while introducing students to an interesting and unexpected part of history.",
    "Became more knowledgeable about Yale & Japan's long connections through particular people and places, US-Japanese relations, and how to write a research paper."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The best part about this course is the hands-on experiences you get with materials from Manuscripts and Archives, along with Professor Botsman and the librarian's seemingly unlimited knowledge about Yale and Japan. There is so so so much to explore, to discovery, and to learn. I only have positive remarks about this course.",
    "The strength was the beginning, where we got to discuss the greatest examples of Yale-Japan connections using readings and interesting objects in the collections, as well as the final paper which was a good opportunity for independent scholarship. The second half of the course was dedicated to the paper, out of necessity, but that made it hard to fit in the best part of the class which was discussing Yale and Japan connections. Having a number of assignments helped us to get a broad experience with the materials, but maybe allowed less time for learning about Yale and Japan than hoped.",
    "The course is scheduled to introduce students not only to the relationship between Yale and Japan, but also to guide students in researching primary documents through an individual research project. The course is well-designed to meet these goals, the first half focusing on introducing various connections between Yale and Japan, while the latter (and throughout the course in general) focusing on providing guidance for primary document research, with various librarians offering their tips on such research.",
    "I thought that this course was really well balanced all around. I really enjoyed the readings and didn't find them to be too onerous; I thought the student presentations were very interesting, and enjoyed presenting my own; and I thought that the paper was an engaging challenge that helped me develop skills that will be necessary next year. If I had to name a weakness, it would be that the assignments were occasionally difficult to complete due to the limited hours of Manuscripts and Archives. Being a varsity athlete, I found it difficult to manage the open hours of the reading room with classes and practice.",
    "A serious strength is that students aren't immediately expected to know how to research, and instead are given several weeks to familiarize themselves with Yale and Japan's mutual history to find inspiration for a thesis.",
    "I think the course could be improved with a slightly more rigorous schedule for classtime. I often left class feeling that we had talked about interesting things, but was unsure of if there was a \"point\" to the lessons or a unifying narrative.",
    "The course's strength's lie in the many special trips to the Beinecke and Manuscripts & Archives to look and discuss materials housed there, the good connections to Yale & Japan in the context of U.S.-Japanese relations, and the solid introduction to writing a lengthy research paper. I think submitting partial drafts or extended outlines of our research paper might have been more helpful than some of the other checkpoints we had in the class for the paper, but if you are working\/thinking about it ahead of time, the paper is manageable."

   "comments": [
    "Yes - a great way to familiarize yourself with the Manuscripts and Archives resources at Yale, and to learn about both Yale's and Japan's histories.",
    "Absolutely take this course, even if you do not have any background in East Asian studies, Japan, etc. This is a class with value for any and every student.",
    "Yes! It was an intellectually stimulating and interesting course featuring materials i wouldn't have had the chance to examine otherwise.",
    "This is a terrific course, especially for those interested in the history of Yale or the modern history of Japan. It was also a big commitment.",
    "Absolutely. Take. It!!! This course covers the extensive relationship between Yale and Japan, how those relations came to be and how they developed over time. The course also focuses on introducing the study of History by encouraging individual research into primary documents, and provides ample guidance for navigating through such a project. There are librarians that offer so much help on how to start a research project on primary documents, and Professor Botsman is so approachable and eager to help you. I would absolutely recommend it to anyone interested in History as a discipline in general, Japanese history and\/or the history of Yale.",
    "Yes, of course! This was a great course taught by a great professor who obviously cares about his students and is passionate about his work.",
    "Professor Botsman is a treasure. If you haven't taken a class with him, you should seriously try to do so before you graduate! This class is a great example of what makes Yale great--it takes advantage of the profound resources that Yale has and that other schools do not. This class would not be possible to teach at Harvard, Princeton, or anywhere else simply because the same kinds of connections do not exist! The workload is not overwhelming, although the paper is a lot of work, so make sure you start it early. Highly, highly recommend.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course for anyone remotely interested in their school's rich past or just history in general. It's also a fantastic way to familiarize yourself with archival research.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in Japan or Yale's history!",
    "I would most definitely recommend this course to another student. The materials we were able to supplement our learning through the Beinecke and Manuscripts\/Archives were amazing, and would not have been possible without this course. Professor Botsman is an engaging teacher and discussions flow naturally in class. A great class in looking at some of Yale's history, U.S.-Japanese relations, and Yale & Japan's own extensive historical connections."
