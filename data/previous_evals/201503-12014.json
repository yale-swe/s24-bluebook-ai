    "Low pressure, but since it's a fun class and I enjoyed the material I put in a lot of work for the creative project and tried to do the readings, and other people did too. Everyone probably took it for fun and loved the professor and enjoyed the works, which made for a good seminar. It's probably possible to take this class and enjoy it even with a heavy workload in other courses.",
    "Yes.",
    "Yes! take it.",
    "Great class! Definitely niche, but you will see amazing films (some that you can only see through this course) and develop a thorough understanding of the way queer avant garde film developed following World War II. The final project is also a really wonderful opportunity to flex your creative muscles, as you have the option to either write a paper or do a creative project. Professor Gregg is amazing - he is insightful and engaged in class discussions and is great at facilitating discussions among students in the seminar. He is also really great one-on-one and seems to take an investment and interest in each student's unique perspective that they bring to the class.",
    "A historically-minded survey of the postwar avant gardes whose films, falling now under the rubric of 'queerness', broached the possibility of an experimental cinema paralleling its counterparts in Europe.",
    "This was a GREAT class! Professor Gregg's insight into this interesting genre is invaluable, and the works were on the whole quite interesting. Don't take this class if you have traditional tastes or are faint of heart when it comes to explicit imagery. Do take this class if you're looking to expand your horizons and get weird."
