   "comments": [
    "This is a great seminar. There were two essays and the readings were manageable though some were harder to understand than others. Eyerman is an awesome professor who is very good at leading discussion. Like any seminar, having a good group of engaging students is important but other than that, the class was very enjoyable and it really changed the way that I look at society, art and culture.",
    "Take it! A lot of reading, challenging at times (but always in the good way), but interesting material you get to walk through with an amazing prof.",
    "Sociology of the arts is a great class, Professor Eyerman is incredibly nice and knowledgable, and the subject matter is fascinating! It may be useful to brush up on your pop culture though, i found that we talk about rap music a lot, something i know very little about.",
    "Yes! Take it! Do it! You get to talk about Lady Gaga \/ Ke$ha \/ Jersey Shore all you want!",
    "I took it without really knowing what sociology was (it was my first sociology class) and because of that I think I was lost most of the time. Also, I didn't like our class discussions because I think they confused me even more; but if you learn well in this format, it is an interesting class that deals with interesting ideas.",
    "This class was an interesting course, and I would recommend it because the teacher was nice and the discussions were thought provoking, but I often felt like the readings were super long and completely over my head. Getting through one was like sifting through a train wreck. And then we had to write a reading response each time, which was fairly difficult after having only a vague understanding of what we read about each time.",
    "Great class. You should take this especially if you have taken Prof. Eyerman before. You will not be sorry.",
    "If you're interested in the social consequences of art and popular culture, this is the course. It is a bit theoretical and focuses a lot at first on critical theory and the Frankfurt School, but they are all applicable to modern society and how we consume art and pop culture. Discussions in class ranged from street art to Lady Gaga, but you are free to pretty much bring up any example and everyone is excited to comment. Eyerman is fantastic, so be sure to take this with him.",
    "I would highly recommend the course because it gives a good extensive look as various forms of popular culture through the 17th and 20th century."
