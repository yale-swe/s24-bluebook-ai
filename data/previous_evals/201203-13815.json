    "Very intensive class that expects the students to know through second semester of quantum. Although the work was very hard, the homeworks were only given every two weeks and you would be able to check the homework with the answers in the back of the book. Additionally there is no final and an oral midterm which last 10-15 min. In place of the final, you have a presentation and have to write a 8-10 page paper in which you discuss a \"hot topic\" in optics. Although this takes up a ton of work, it makes up for the little work you can get away during the rest of the class and you actually learn about something really cool that you get to choose on your own.",
    "This course is good for anybody interested in applications of optical ideas-- optical fiber, photonic crystals, etc-- or interested in using Maxwell's equations a bit more. Not a class for people interested in lenses.",
    "It is like a mix between Science Friday and a normal physics class. It is really interesting. p sets are due every two weeks, the midterm is oral, and there is a paper and presentation in lieu of a final exam.",
    "This is a nice class that will expose you to a vast array of topics in modern optics and applications. This class does not go in depth in basic geometric optics, and students are expected to already have some background in this area. Topics include wave optics, polarization, Brewster angle, phase contrast microscopy, fiber optics, interference and diffraction, Fourier optics, photonic crystals, and more exciting new ideas in optics. There was a lab tour, an oral midterm exam based on conceptual questions, a problem set every two weeks, and a final presentation and paper on a topic of the student's choosing."
