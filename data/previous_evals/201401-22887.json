   "comments": [
    "I would recommend the class to another student, but they would have to be enthusiastic about historical linguistics generally. There is a lot of reading involved, and if you want to keep up you have to take a lot of notes to supplement the fairly bare handouts. Else, if you look back on a handout long after the class, it will be fairly hard to decipher.",
    "I suspect that this course changes somewhat in content and style depending upon who teaches it, and so to a fellow student I would preface my recommendation by saying that it will probably be a very different experience for them. The professor noted on the first day that he wouldn't be talking about computational phylogenetics, for example, which would be interesting. As for this exact course, I found it personally quite helpful, but I think that some other students might have found it less helpful - for example, there was not very much information about syntactic change, so if that's what you're into you might be a bit disappointed."

   "comments": [
    "Itmade me look 'under the hood' of the conventions and 'principles' often invoked in historical linguistics, and consider how they relate to the actual generation-by-generation process of transmitting knowledge of language.",
    "Lectures during this course, along with the Indo-Aryan seminar last semester, have led to one of my portfolio papers and will hopefully lead to my QP research. I feel that this course has been immensely helpful for my understanding of language change, and it may turn out to have kick-started some ideas that will lead to a dissertation."
