   "comments": [
    "I improved my fluency in french and learned many different grammar rules and vocabulary.",
    "Vastly improved reading, writing, and speaking skills, much closer to fluency.",
    "My knowledge of the French language significantly improved by taking this course. I personally found the L4 curriculum to be both challenging and manageable. I was especially fond of the literature we read throughout the course, as I found the stories themselves to be quite interesting and not too difficult to read. I also feel as though my grammar was assessed well - I liked having grammar sections separate from other forms of work, so that I could pay special attention to refining my skills.",
    "French 140 is grammar-intensive for the first half and reading-intensive for the second, with emphasis on vocabulary and writing skills.",
    "My listening comprehension improved a lot through the identifications exercises, the audiotape exercises, and the emphasis on spoken French in the classroom. Many of the grammar concepts were familiar to me previously, but I feel much more confident in them now and they seemed a lot more straightforward learning them in this setting than in high school.",
    "I improved my general French competency.",
    "French language: ability to use French in conversation, to comprehend literature, etc.",
    "I learned how to write, read, and speak French at an exponentially higher level!!"

   "comments": [
    "Some of the homework listening exercises are lengthy without a whole lot of apparent value. The exams can be fickle in difficulty, but that's consistent with L3 as well.",
    "I found the layout of the course to be very strong. As explained above, I was particularly fond of the grammar sections and the literature selected. In future, however, I would recommend spending more time working on oral skills, in terms of one-on-one assessments or conversations with the professor. I think this would be more helpful as opposed to speaking into a microphone to answer oral questions on an exam.",
    "The course packet material has exercises that don't help students improve their grammar and quite frankly, are a waste of time.",
    "The readings and course packet exercises all were helpful in building a broad basis of grammar and comprehension. I think I would have appreciated a little bit more of supplementary vocabulary even if it didn't directly relate to the literature, because that's an area that I know I'm lacking, but the exercises for the vocab we did have were helpful. More emphasis on long-form speaking would have been helpful to feel less nervous on tests, but I did appreciate the discussion-based style in discussing the reading and other material.",
    "The audio programs and activities in the course packet were, in my mind, more effective than in French L3. Though I certainly appreciate the curriculum's efforts to include a diversity of authors and stories on the syllabus, and I feel like I got a lot out of the readings, a few of them felt oddly chosen. \"Un Sac de Billes\" is an excellent book but the chunks of reading assigned almost nightly took up a disproportionate amount of time and quickly became frustrating. The \"Diversite\" readings were all well chosen and largely enjoyable however. I'll admit that while \"La Symphonie Pastorale\" is far from my favorite piece of French lit (and confirms the stereotype about French lit being full of sexual taboos and vaguely paternalist narrators) it was on the right reading level. It also seemed to me that there was less writing in this class than L3, so perhaps the balance could be tipped to a tad more writing and a tad less reading.",
    "I thought it was structured very well, overall no complaints.",
    "I think that the course is rigorous, but the workload is good because you get a lot out of the course. I think the evaluations need to be changed much. Studying for the listening section of the test was very difficult. I would spend many hours writing down quotes from each character from the novels we read. For the final, I created a 20 page document that I used to memorize quotes from the texts we read. I wonder if this was the best use of my time. I felt that I could write much about each character and in-depth about relationships between characters, and that merely indentifyung quotes was not indicative of the numerous hours I had engaged with the text. Also, I do not like that 15 points of our test grade comes from speaking. It seems very impersonal that these clips are sent to someone that doesn't work in New Haven, and does not know each persons individual past experience with French. Since there was no speaking part of the placement test, it is not fair to include it as regular tests. I would regularly lose more points from the speaking section of the exam than the rest of the 85 points combined and receive little feedback. It felt very defeating that despite my attempts to work with a French tutor several times, go to Tuesday night office hours, go to French tables, I only received a 15\/25 on the final for speaking, a 60%. This would also effect my participation in class. I felt very uncomfortable speaking during class and sharing my ideas, because I was so un confident in my speaking ability. Finally, I took french in high school, but the class was never too rigorous and I never had much guidance. We never worked on speaking. Because of this, I think the speaking portion is tailored to students who had a good basis in low-levels of learning French, which I did not have. It seemed I couldn't make up for it, no matter how hard I worked.",
    "The strengths are definitely the emphasis on all facets of french learning: speaking, reading, writing, and grammar."

    "Yes! I think this is a great class to improve your french.",
    "A fine continuation of L3. If you took L3, it's basically more of the same.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to any student who wants to improve their knowledge of the French language. The material is both engaging and thought-provoking, without being too intellectually challenging.",
    "Coming into college with a long background but shallow understanding of French and halting proficiency, I expected the course to be incredibly difficult, and instead found it fun and engaging. For 1.5 credits, the workload is not any more intense than other classes, and easier to keep up with because it's due every day. The atmosphere was relaxed, yet everyone took it seriously enough to commit to pushing their spoken French and participating in group review. I would definitely recommend taking Imane's section - she is sweet, patient, and helpful in understanding where you're going wrong.",
    "Imane is an excellent TF, super helpful and positive. The class is definitely a lot of reading, especially towards the end of the semester, but if you want to continue improving your French it's well worth it.",
    "Yes I learned a lot!",
    "Yes! You will learn and improve SO Much!"
