    "Yes! It is not the lightest workload but if you enjoy graphic design, totally do-able.",
    "This course is all about refining the skills you picked up in Intro. As for recommendations--DEFINITELY, but I'm the type to recommend Yale art classes left and right. My only words of caution are that you'll be MUCH better off if you're well acquainted with Photoshop and InDesign (and Illustrator, kind of), and if you start familiarizing yourself with the resources at the Digital Media Center.",
    "AMAZING. Phenomenal. Take it. It will change the way you see the world and the way you create anything.",
    "Intermediate graphic design was great! I learned so much. Pamela is an amazing professor and invites amazing designers to present their work to our class. It is a 4 hour class on a Friday, but so worth it! Be warned that it is more work than intro graphic design, but again it is worth it. Everyone in the class is very interested in desigb making the class very engaging. Take it!",
    "If you enjoy design and want to continue learning about it, take the course. Very good 2nd step.",
    "Difficult to say. Mostly because of the all-in one period, I'm tempted to say no, but the course does have very fun prompts",
    "Absolutely. Shop the class to make sure you like Pamela's teaching style. Basically, there are weekly assignments (some of them ongoing, spanning a longer timeframe) and you iterate and \"evolve\" your concepts. There are critiques, as should be expected, but what really set the course apart because of Pamela's teaching was her eagerness to bring in guest speakers, take us on tours and visits to book collections and design firms, show us movies related to design... A great exploration for someone who wants something beyond what they've experienced in Intro."
