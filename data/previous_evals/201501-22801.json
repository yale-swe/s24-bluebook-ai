    "I would recommend VIET 140 to another student if they already have a good background in Vietnamese and want to improve it. Be wary of the high expectations of what you need to know.",
    "Definitely take Vietnamese L. 4 if your Vietnamese is already at a decent level. You'll learn a lot more vocabulary in L. 4, and although the class is every day, the homework is manageable. The professor is excellent, and learning Vietnamese is quite fun I think. Class is small, and usually you bond a lot with the other students in the class. The other students are really cool! Thay Quang makes the class amazing, and I promise you that you will like him a lot. Learning Vietnamese, especially if you are Vietnamese American, is a valuable thing. I enjoyed this class a lot, and I think you will to! Shop it at least.",
    "Absolutely take this course to understand more about Vietnsmese culture and language."
