   "comments": [
    "I would absolutely recommend this class- far more people ought to take Russian at a serious level than do so.",
    "Good mostly conversational class for student interested in taking more russian but not focusing on translation and literature.",
    "An advanced Russian course that involves more elevated discussion of cultural issues, though a bit lacking in time since it only meets three times a week. It's important to do the work that is asked, or else the class time can't be maximized to be productive.",
    "If you're reading this you probably already know whether or not you're going to take it, but as language courses go, this is a very good one. The focus is on learning something about the Russian geographical and cultural self-understanding relative to Europe and Asia, and on developing the ability to recognize and reproduce a more official style of speech (prepare for the myth that word order doesn't matter to vanish).",
    "Yes, if the student were interested. It was a very good course which built my understanding of the Russian language as well as the Russian culture."
