    "I definitely improved my writing and grammar skills as well as became more comfortable speaking. By the end of the entire yeah of intensive german, I definitely feel solid in my basic skills and am able to converse extensively with people in german.",
    "I felt like my German grammar and confidence speaking improved a lot over the course of the semester. I also learned more about German culture and cities"

   "question_id": "YC403",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "To be improved: more practice on specific topics",
    "Strengths: so much time is allotted to having us just speak with our classmates, which is crucial for conversation abilities. Every day we could talk about our weeks, what's going on in our lives, and other every day conversations in German. It's a small class, so the amount of participating each student does really helps us improve. Weakness: feedback for our essays wasn't substantial enough. When we turned in essays, it would only be mark ups of what was grammatically wrong, but no comments on the flow of the paper. Also, i was sometimes marked off on my revision for errors i had made in the first draft that hadn't been corrected by the teacher, which was annoying because they weren't brought to my attention.",
    "This course is an amazing way to quickly learn german in a small, close-knit learning environment. But you have to be prepared to work hard every day of every week. In short, this class is perfect for people who are seriously devoted to learning german.",
    "This second half of the course was very well run but I think a new textbook might be in order, and things such as forum posts\/online homework really dragged the energy of the course down -- there was so much \"busy work.\" I personally would prefer more paper worksheets, as we began to get later in the semester, instead of the clunky online interface that rarely corresponded perfectly to what we were covering in class.",
    "The course could have been a bit more rigorous in terms of vocabulary improvement. I would have liked to feel more confident in my writing ability"

   "comments": [
    "Absolutely take the intensive course of German. Once you settle into the rhythm of doing a chapter from the book a week, it is very easy to follow along and you learn so fast. By the end of the year, you will feel very comfortable with German grammar and pronunciation, which is incredible.",
    "Definitely, but it is a commitment",
    "I would highly recommend this course if you're serious about german. The class was a lot of fun and i went from having 0 german to being able to speak without difficulty with native speakers over the course of 2 semesters. However, this class is a ton of work and you should be aware that this course will require a lot more effort than most language classes.",
    "This is the best way to learn a language. And if the language you want to learn is German, take this course.",
    "Yes! Taking an intensive language is amazing. To learn so much so quickly is really great, but I suppose that the downside is that it might go away as quickly as it came."
