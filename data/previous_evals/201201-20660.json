   "comments": [
    "Don't take this unless you want summer money.",
    "A class all students should take",
    "Take it! This course allows you to pick the brains of brilliant men. Not only will you learn about strategy and war, you will also learn about thinking. Each instructor thinks markedly differently than his peers, which makes the class a rich team-teaching experience.",
    "I strongly recommend GS to any students who are prepared to take it seriously (i.e. do all or most of the readings). It has the potential to be a class on par with calculus and econ that can truly alter a student's worldview. My advice is to take the experience, professors and other students seriously, but always be ready to critically analyze everything that is said.",
    "Studies in Grand Strategy is such an amazing opportunity to learn from some of Yale's best professors, and to really challenge yourself with classic readings that will prove beneficial in any field.",
    "Only take this class if you want GS money for the summer -- That is its only redeeming quality. People in the class (from professors on down) are full of themselves. And the material is terribly taught.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. The professors are super interesting, and people generally try to do the work, which makes class really, really good. Try to actually do the reading because it is quite interesting. The workload beyond that actually isn't bad (three papers). Overall, GS teaches a very cool perspective on the world, and the seriousness of the class really impresses that upon you.",
    "Yes - I would recommend it to another student as long as they knew what they were getting into. The class requires a lot of time, which I enjoyed. However, the grades on the papers seemed more arbitrary than earned.",
    "Highly recommended",
    "I would recommend Grand Strategy to students at Yale who want to leverage Yale's ability to bring students from every corner of the University into the same room to discuss the future. GS is for students who want to engage students of different disciplines and\/or different beliefs. For an undergraduate, this is an easier task to accomplish outside of a course like GS. But, for graduate and professional students GS presents a rare opportunity. It is worth the time and effort to apply for the course and to participate in GS."

   "question_text": "How did this course deepen your knowledge of your discipline\/profession? To what extent did this course contribute to your dissertation\/research?",
   "comments": [
    "GS provided a valuable intellectual experience in two ways:1. It exposed me to history and literature that I had never read (everything from Thucydides to Machiavelli). This gave me a crash course in the Western cannon (useful for those who did not take DS), and an excellent excuse to read some great works.2. GS provided a different analytical perspective than standard social science classes. This is not to say that either approach is superior, but being exposed to both is very worthwhile.",
    "I did not....",
    "This course reminds me that there is a big picture to think about. Grand strategy teaches students to think about all of the floating components in any given situation\/organization\/time period. This mentality is immensely helpful for making sure that I do not become bottled into my individual program.",
    "N\/A on the dissertation (grad school student). I thought the class provided a great overview of Grand Strategy as professors Gaddis, Hill, and Kennedy see it.",
    "For me, the first semester of Grand Strategy (classroom portion), dovetailed into issues in which I am already invested. It's an excellent overview of elements of strategy, military\/diplomatic history. But, the dinners and discussions that occurred during the first semester, outside of the classroom, stretched the conversation beyond the syllabus. If I were in another discipline and wanted to understand the potential value of GS, I would seek out former GS student to discuss the course in depth. I would say this though: the second semester moves away from the reading toward group presentations and crisis simulations. And I write this, as I am preparing to conduct my summer project, which is different for each member of GS. At its best, GS should deepen your knowledge of yourself. This course is a rare bird."
