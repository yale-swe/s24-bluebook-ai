   "comments": [
    "Great overview of different periods& styles of French lit. I took this class cred\/D after having already fulfilled my language requirement, and it was great. I read books I'd been wanting to read, contributed a lot to class, and kept up with my French. I also learned a lot about French history too, which was a nice bonus.",
    "It is a gloss of all the major developments in French literature and it is a great for somebody who wants to read more French",
    "French 170 is a great class for students interested in french literature. It addresses both the written and oral aspect of the French language and allows the student to really advance into being able to read french literature and discuss it during class discussions and in papers. Overall, it is a great class for those who are looking for a more advanced course of L5 French, but the professors are also supportive and guide the students through the course very well. Because the readings are often also books, the reading from one class to the other can be a lot during certain times.",
    "The class is a welcome relief from big lectures! Do take it, but you will have to do a lot of work, such as writing a reading response\/essay for EVERY class, and a five page midterm."
