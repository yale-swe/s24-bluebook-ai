    "The course provides students with a diverse selection of readings that broadens one's perspectives and helps to formulate different questions that one should ask while thinking about the history of medicine and public health. I would recommend students to take the course if they would like to have a solid grounding in the types of histories of medicine that are being written.",
    "Course engaging with the history of health and medicine and America through close reading of range of secondary texts (rather than primary or historiographic). Topics ranged from midwifery and public health to mental health and smoking.",
    "This is a seminar class in which you get to read a number of very interesting books and have a discussion with colleagues from various backgrounds.",
    "Perhaps not to all public health students, but to those with a serious interest in history and especially historiography."
