    "There wasn't a ton of mixture, especially toward the end. But I don't consider that a negative. The class was necessarily discussion-based after we finished the introductory lectures in the first half of the semester.",
    "I wish there were clear themes attached to each lesson - we discussed a great number of elements for each case, but I would have appreciated taking a moment at the end of each class to step back and look for the big-picture lesson. All online & free materials was excellent.",
    "Course was very well organized and followed a logical path.",
    "A. The syllabus was very detailed and easy to follow D. The class maintains a similar structure, but the assignments get progressively harder which is appropriate for the course level",
    "The connection between the discussion and the case study is easily understood, which kept the overall organization of the course very clear."

    "Ed specifically asked us to comment on his difficulties with speech this semester. Frankly, I only noticed it two or three times over the course of the class, and when it happened, it was a minor interruption that lasted a few seconds before we identified the word and moved on. In other words, it simply was not an issue - so little so that I was surprised when he asked for feedback on it.",
    "The best seminar-format class I've ever been in. After I stopped being infuriated by it, I appreciated the way Ed plays devils-advocate and challenges your answers equally, be they right or wrong.",
    "Instructor was excellent, but there were some contradictory moments in the course; moments where we heard a new term that had previously been discussed differently. For example, it wasn't until the second to last class that we were told there should be no more than 4 core values. Although this type of thing isn't necessarily inconsistent, it seems odd to spend so much time defining certain concepts only to then turn around and discuss them as if they are \"gray areas\" and vice versa."

    "I ended the class a bit frustrated that I hadn't quite had that \"click\" moment that would help me to get the \"right answers\" on these cases, but I am encouraged by the fact that Ed says these cases were increasingly difficult and that it takes time to get good at such exercises.",
    "I learned a lot but wish that I had received more feedback instead of just a big X on my arguments, especially after spending a significant amount of time on them. To just get an X without feedback because you didn't get the \"right\" answer in a class that is about coming up with leadership ideas without knowing the actual outcomes seems inefficient.",
    "I found this class to be very challenging as it forced me to think outside my general understanding of our organization. Because of this I found this class to be the most valuable to my education and I hope to carry the information with me",
    "The course offered the students a toolkit. The methodology was more important than the cases themselves, and can be implemented in many different fields. It was also made clear how important it is to understand the industry and the organization's position in it. The closing statement of the course was exceptionally memorable."

   "comments": [
    "The only suggestion I have is to eliminate the seemingly-arbitrary numbers system of grading the weekly assignments, and to provide written feedback on those assignments when placing an \"X\" over items we got wrong. In a class where answers are more complicated than \"right or wrong,\" it would greatly help to understand the complexities of our learning if we were to be given even a brief explaination of why we received those \"X\" marks. Other than that, this was my favorite course of the semester. Hugely helpful in evaluating how organizations make decisions. Extremely fulfilling because it was challenging - challenging in concepts, not workload. Certainly the most complex thinking I've been asked to do all semester. I appreciated it greatly.",
    "I'd appreciate more time looking at the bigger picture, and a little less time on the fine details of each case. Many times, students would have to interrupt discussion of the case study to ask a big overarching question about the course material - I feel like spending more time on concepts and big-picture lessons from each study would be helpful to prevent this. In the last 20 minutes of the last class, Ed grouped the cases for us with the \"moral\" of their stories, but I would have appreciated getting that mid-discussion.",
    "Ed, if you had delayed speech I never noticed!"
