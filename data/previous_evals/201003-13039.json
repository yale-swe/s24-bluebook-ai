   "comments": [
    "This is a good survey course for anyone interested in French lit. Because they fit so much material into one semester, there is no time devoted to some of the longer more famous novels which is a little disappointing.",
    "Take it! Professor Girard is great and the workload isn't too difficult.",
    "I would recommend 170 for another student if he or she has no background in French literature. This is a good survey of all period of French lit, and we read a lot of major authors. The works are good selections and not too difficult, but don't take this course if you are looking for deep literary analysis.",
    "I would summarize French 170 as being a challenging introduction to French literature. There is a sizeable amount of reading but if you like French literature, you will find most, if not all of it, interesting. Discussion is encouraged but this is not really a \"conversational\" class in the sense that you find yourself speaking more than three or four phrases over the course of a class period depending on your participation style - think of an English class, in French. The material is fascinating, though, and Mme Girard is a caring, incredibly intelligent professor. If you love France, reading, and writing, you will love this class!",
    "FREN 170 offers a comprehensive overview of important French literary figures and works from Medieval ages to the 19th century. Mme Girard is a wonderful and fascinating professor who offers a wealth of different insights from her French background and from different viewpoints that makes the class discussions interesting. The workload consists of a lot of reading, from differing styles, and three essays for the semester. Although the reading quantity is sometimes overwhelming, the course is designed so that detailed examination of any particular work is not required outside of the student's own interests. FREN 170 is intended for students to be introduced to works and get a general sense of French literature, and is in no way an intensive study of any one period or work. If that's your intended goal, I highly recommend this course.",
    "Good class, strong syllabus. If you're the type that enjoys random tangents about the author and the history of the texts you're reading, then you'd certtainly like this class. Madame Girard is very knowledgeable and spends more than half of class time providing the context of the novels. However, I personally didn't enjoy her teaching style because we had a minimal amount of time to speak in class (we mostly listened to her) and my spoken French definitely deteriorated over the semester."
