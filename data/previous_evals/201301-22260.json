    "Slow reading of Spenser's poetry. Good pace.",
    "I didn't like Spenser at all in English 125, so this class was a risk for me. I'm glad I took a chance on it - not sure I \"like\" Spenser any better, but working through \"The Faerie Queene\" was a good experience in the end. The reading pace\/workload is reasonable.",
    "I would recommend this course! Spenser is a lesser known English writer than many who we encounter at Yale. And yet he often deals with the same themes as Milton, is as clever and witty as Shakespeare, and as lyrical as the Romantic poets. I was very pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed reading The Faerie Queene. It's entertaining and lends itself to almost endless discussion. The reading is very manageable, as is the workload, and the challenge of this class exists not in struggling to do all the work, but in struggling to improve one's own writing and literary analysis through periodic assignments and the final essay.",
    "Everything Spenser and everything great in the world. Take it if you want to read a fascinating poet with a truly insightful, invigorating professor!",
    "Absolutely take this class. Spenser is a crazy genius and his work is amazingly difficult and frustrating and just plain amazing. Professor Nicholson is brilliant and does an amazing job facilitating discussion. One of my favorite classes at Yale.",
    "A lot of time spent thinking about chastity and the way it relates to friendship. If this strikes you as interesting, dive in. If this doesn't--stay away.",
    "This class is a wonderful chance to get to know Spenser and gives you the opportunity to enjoy his writing (something that I found very difficult in English 125). Professor Nicholson is a wonderful teacher and seminar leader; she is a wonderful combination of sharp and kind and gives you ample opportunities to work with her on your writing and final essay.",
    "If you even have the slightest inclination to try Spenser, take this class. Decidedly one of the best English classes I have taken here and thoroughly enjoyable. It does take work, but it's absolutely worth it.",
    "This is an intensive study of Spenser - the reading is a lot, like any senior seminar, but because you're reading just one work for most of the time its really easy to get behind, so be warned that you actually have to do at least 2\/3 of the reading to keep up. I really liked the class and I'd recommend it to any junior or senior English major"
