   "comments": [
    "stronger understanding of proof-based math and the theory behind linear\/matrix theory. better mathematical thinking overall.",
    "We learned both how to approach math from a proof-based angle and the core areas of linear algebra.",
    "I learned about how to do proofs and think about dimensions appropriately, as well as trust myself to create logical arguments about complicated topics.",
    "I learned linear algebra.",
    "I learned not only linear algebra in an extremely comprehensive manner but also how to rigorously prove all of the theorems of linear algebra. I learned more in this course about math than I ever learned in a previous math class. While extremely challenging, the end was result was absolutely worth it.",
    "A great course on linear algebra. Definitely improved my proof-writing skills (which were nonexistent before taking this course). Also learned some good applications of linear algebra techniques, but would recommend Math 222 if you want more concrete problem-solving techniques. This was definitely more of an abstract course.",
    "I learned the fundamental theory underpinning matrix theory and linear algebra. I also learned how these two areas of studies can be applied to areas like physics and computer science.",
    "The class really teaches you to improve on time management because the psets are so long. The content of the class also allows a notable development in the way you reason.",
    "A thorough background in proof based mathematics and linear algebra",
    "-An introduction to how to write and think about mathematical proofs -An in-depth understanding of the theory behind linear algebra",
    "Rigorous proof based introduction to linear algebra.",
    "I've developed a strong background in linear algebra. Because the course was proof based I learned the fundamentals and nature of linear algebra.",
    "I became a much more logical thinker during this class.",
    "The basics of linear algebra. How to write proofs. How to finish 10-hour problem sets the night before they're due every week.",
    "More insights than any other math class I've ever taken; it was incredibly interesting to utilize matrices as vectors as sort of a starting point and then from there take matters to extremes.",
    "I learned a very large amount of linear algebra, and this course gave me a strong foundation in both linear algebra and logical reasoning in general. I still don't know how we got through so much material.",
    "Developed strong logical reasoning skills, and ability to think in new ways, and applying theory to practical applications.",
    "I learned a lot about the nuances of linear algebra, and the theory behind important concepts that apply to many different fields. Furthermore, I feel that I learned to think in a different way; this was my first proof-based math class, and I thought it was a very valuable experience in learning how to think and solve problems in clever ways.",
    "This course was a perfect introduction to college-level proof-based mathematics, very different from the calculus courses. Especially Prof. Auel's elegant lecturing and the design of the course managed to reveal the inherent beauty in mathematics and the joy of actually knowing and making sure of why you know mathematical theorems instead of just plugging numbers. Also linear algebra is a corner-stone in my prospective major, computer science, and I see first hand through the diversion lectures on Goggle PageRank algorithm and Heisenberg's uncertainty principle how useful linear algebra is in the sciences. I truly recommend this course anyone who enjoys dealing with abstract notions, and mathematics.",
    "I gained such a vast amount of knowledge about linear algebra and matrix theory from this course. The hundreds of problems and proofs that I did this semester really improved my logic skills, and I think it prepared me well for taking more math and logic classes in the future. The class also gave me an insight into a new side of math that I had never been exposed to before, and it confirmed my belief that math is most likely what I want to pursue as a major.",
    "This was the first time I took a more proof-based math course. I learned a lot about how to do that tyoe as math, in addition to the linear algebra.",
    "This was my first true linear algebra class, so I learned a lot about linear algebra. Much of the class was new information.",
    "I improved my mathematical problem solving skills and my ability to understand complex problems. This course really expands your ability to think deeply about difficult concepts, a crucial skill. It also helps you develop an incredibly robust understanding of the key concepts of linear algebra, one of mathematics most important fields. It can also help you see the fun of mathematical problem solving, an invaluable appreciation to have.",
    "I learned a much greater understanding of linear algebra, and more importantly I became a lot more comfortable doing proofs. From a linear algebra standpoint, I learned about vector spaces, linear transformations, solving systems of equations, determinants, eigenvalues and diagonalization of matrices, and orthogonality\/spectral theorem.",
    "I learned how to think like a mathematician. Linear algebra is very systematic. I learned how to approach the system from scratch and to master the system.",
    "An understanding of linear algebra through a very methodical process.",
    "This class enabled me to develop skills to think mathematically beyond computation. It allowed me to understand how to write mathematical proofs to prove statements, thinking about the underlying logic of the math rather than the rules for computing quantities. It also furthered more traditional mathematical skills such as problem-solving and computation.",
    "This was a truly life-changing course. If this is the first time you have done rigorous mathematical proofs, it will literally change the way you thing about solving any kind of problem.",
    "I learnt how to think in a far more mathematical manner. I had only had a cursory exposure to formal, proof-based mathematics, and this course was a great way of dipping my toes into an incredibly rich, and diverse subject. I learnt a lot about Linear Algebra: its history, its application to different fields like Computer Science and Physics.",
    "A general understanding of linear algebra.",
    "This was my first math class that's theory-based, so I got a lot of insight into the process of proving things in mathematics. What I liked best about having to prove things in math is it really forces you to engage with the material that you know and solidify your understanding of it before you can build on top of that knowledge and move on to the next concept. I think this type of learning process is something that I can carry over to other classes, so I'm really happy that I got to take this class!",
    "Different way of thinking about math- this was my first proof based math class.",
    "It's a fantastic course through which I learnt so much about proof-based mathematics.",
    "My strength in proof writing was by far the greatest improvement I achieved.",
    "I developed basic proof-writing skills and got a glimpse of what it's like to do higher level mathematics. For me, these were the most important parts of the course. I can also do basic linear algebra now, with quite a strong theoretical understanding that allows me in many cases to find quick solutions to problems that would otherwise be computationally intensive.",
    "I learned a ton about linear algebra and also about proving things in general, great class.",
    "Proo-based linear algebra is unlike any other math course I'd taken up to now. Most other courses simply build upon previously established rules. Linear algebra takes you to whole new worlds of math in which you have to go through the process of establishing the rules yourself. It's a very different way of thinking in which this course certainly trains you. From this course, you also learn a lot about student collaboration and self-discovery. The class time this course is given isn't really sufficient to cover all the nuance cases for each new set of theorems, so it will require you to learn some on your own.",
    "Linear Algebra",
    "I hadn't taken either linear algebra or a proof-based math course in the past, so this course really taught me more logical thinking skills and an intro to theoretical math.",
    "Came in with zero proof-writing skills, and am now competent in working through basic algebraic theory (and some more fun stuff)."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The class builds from the ground up the theory of linear algebra, starting from vector spaces and fields, and thus gives a very strong understanding of the theory behind all of its methods. lectures were the biggest ever and also i think lectures only serve to reinforce the book - book provides all the theorems you need.",
    "Asher is quickly becoming a Mathematics department legend, and while the PSets were ... long ... the classes were engaging, the material was awesome, and the professor was kickass.",
    "The course could be improved with clearer exam review.",
    "I think this class should not be taught at 9 am. Professor Auel is fabulous and his lectures are amazing, but many students stopped coming partway through the semester because they were unable to get up science hill at 9 am. While that may be proof that Yale college students are lazy, it is also partly due to the difficult psets from Math 225. A consistent group of twenty five students would stay up in Dunham laboratory until 3 am finishing the pset the night before it was due, and then would be too exhausted to get to class any earlier than the 10:15 time at which they would just show up to turn in the completed pset. If the class were later, these students would be able to sleep after pset night and still attend lecture.",
    "This course is extremely well taught and very interesting. One way to make it better would be to spend more time on inner product spaces and normal\/orthogonal matrices and operators, and perhaps less on vector spaces\/ subspaces because that material is more straightforward.",
    "I think the class was taught extremely well the professor made sure that we knew everything we needed to know and did a remarkable job at using the textbook but not reading tediously from it in lecture. Although the classes are taught very quickly, the lessons are well structured and easy to follow.",
    "This class is very demanding, but the rewards are well worth the effort.",
    "The first half of the course is very good. Perfectly paced and clearly explained. The last two weeks were kind of messy - I suppose it's partly due to how everything becomes much busier at the end of the semester - unfortunately that turned out to make up most of the final. I wish the same pace was kept throughout the course, rather than it being so back-loaded.",
    "Strength: clearly taught balance between challenging homework and fair exams Weaknesses: office hour times beginning of the class was rough if you didn't know how proofs were structureed",
    "The class has a large workload but you really become engaged with the material.",
    "Asher was a very clear instructor and I learnt a ton over the course of the semester (probably way more than in 222). And I got a much deeper understanding of linear algebra \/ matrices as well. However problem sets are way too long, and we didn't manage to complete the book (222 covers single value decompositions etc) since the freshmen (and in the spring this class will be full of overeager freshmen) keep asking annoying questions in lecture. Also the class was much bigger than in previous years (70-80ish compared to 20-30 or so) hence it really should be split into two sections or more.",
    "Nothing that I can think of everyone I know in the course loves it. Maybe more office hours with the TA before the night of problem set? Sometime on the weekend potentially?",
    "I thought that the lectures were very interesting to listen to, and Asher makes it fairly easy to understand some very abstract topics, like eigenvectors and diagonalization. I also thought the psets were fun, especially some of the problems that he creates himself (not the ones from the book), but please DO NOT save it until the night before because you will die. I didn't particularly enjoy the two in-class quizzes he gave us just because they don't really cover that much information and are short. I feel we'd be better off without them.",
    "The strengths are that it is probably the first introduction to many students, as it was for me, to formal mathematical proofs. This really led to increased logical reasoning skills. However, I would say that sometimes the problem sets were too extensive, even over preparing us for the what would be on the exams. Sometimes, we covered topics outside of the scope of the exams, but I found these to be interesting, and even a motivating factor. They showed the possible practical applications of a lot of the theory we were learning.",
    "It was strong in that it covered a lot of material in depth, the structure was very clear and well-organized; 9 am was the worst part of the course",
    "The strengths of this course are that it covers a broad base of knowledge regarding linear algebra and matrix theory, and I think it gives students a good insight for what to expect with more advanced math courses. Also, the professor was great at clarifying confusing things, and there was a TA and a peer tutor to turn to whenever further help was needed. The weaknesses were that there was a lot of material covered in such a short amount of time, so it was easy to fall behind and feel lost. Also, the weekly workload was incredibly large and ridiculously time-consuming.",
    "You learn a lot, and I enjoyed the class. The only weakness was that I don't think we spent enough time on actual problems, rather than proofs; by the time I got to the final, I knew the theory very well, but could have used more time with solving the types of problems that were on the test.",
    "The only issue of this course, was the last two weeks of material are very important, but covered extremely fast. I wish we could move more quickly through other material and cover this stuff a little slower.",
    "This course is taught incredibly well, assigns very helpful problem sets, and provides excellent resources for assistance. I'm not sure there's much that could be improved. Maybe even more office hours would be an improvement, as this was an invaluable time and resource. However, I understand the time of the instructor and TA's is limited.",
    "This course was fantastic overall. One of its strengths was the quality of lecture. Both the material and the way it was presented was very interesting and engaging. I also thought the course provided a lot of ways to get help through office hours, if necessary. This course had no weaknesses in my opinion.",
    "This course is very well organized. I got timely feedback. And both Nati and Charles are fantastic.",
    "P-Sets are difficult, but the assessments are manageable , and overall a very rewarding class. Perhaps some of the Psets could be made shorter, but overall I have few complaints.",
    "The largest strength of the class is the problem sets, particularly the unique questions that Professor Auel puts on each one. These questions allow one to develop a deeper intuition for linear algebra beyond computation. Professor Auel is a good lecturer who helps students understand the course material, although he can move through material quickly if not already familiar with it. Beyond the problem sets and the class meetings, the best part of the class is the network of support available if a student has questions. The teaching assistant was excellent, and Professor Auel was always happy to meet with students for office hours.",
    "While the course is awesome and fascinating, it is a ton of work. Expect to put in no less than 6 and usually around 10 hours per week working on problem sets, and they're very difficult to do without office hours or some kind of extra help unless you're a math guru.",
    "Great professor, and a very well structured course, if you make the expected effort.",
    "I was under the impression that this class is supposed to be a smaller, seminar-type class. I think the enrollment was just unusually high this semester. I wish that the class had been split into two sections, just because it would be nice to take a challenging math class in a more intimate setting. (Although, if this had happened, there would be a possibility that Auel won't teach the other section, and I would hate for some students to miss out on the opportunity to take this class with Auel.) That being said, Prof. Auel and the rest of the teaching team did a really good job of trying to get to know the students and paying attention to their individual needs as much as possible despite the size of the class.",
    "Really well structured and taught. I felt like more material was crowded into the last couple weeks (this was just an impression) which was a little stressful.",
    "It was great when office hours were expanded to earlier in the week so that students could get help earlier.",
    "The professor truly made the material understandable and encouraged us to better ourselves.",
    "It was a great course, very well organized. I liked how the material started very simply but each chapter built on the foundations of the previous one and by the end of the semester we had kind of built a very elaborate and powerful system. That said there was a pretty large amount of work and I wonder if all of it was necessary. I spent most of the week each week working on my linear algebra homework. I didn't mind the proof-based problems, but I sometimes got annoyed when I had to spend hours doing computations.",
    "Professor Auel is a wonderful instructor and was integral to my experience of the course. His lectures was always very clear in terms of objective and process and very well laid out. The latter half of the course was definitely a lot more fast-paced, and occasionally I felt there wasn't enough time to digest what was happening - but the office hours did make up for that.",
    "Strengths: It will push you. The TAs are amazing, and if you can make it to the professor's office hours, he or she will also be a great help. Weaknesses: The format of the class makes for a very stressful time completing the psets each week. Honestly, I would prefer to have three shorter sections throughout the week, rather than two long sections per week.",
    "The course content is very comprehensive and you learn a lot of linear algebra Problem sets are too long, makes it hard to put enough effort into every question, and to seek help at the problem sessions\/office hours Lectures just go over textbook proofs and are not very useful",
    "The course covers a lot of depth and a lot of breadth in a short amount of time. I did often find myself wishing we had more lecture because reading the textbook itself was often difficult."

    "if you're interested in linear algebra from a theoretical standpoint, take it. take it if you're considering a math major. don't take it if you only need linear algebra as a prerequisite for more applied things.",
    "Much better than 222, but much harder than 222. If you really want to learn linear algebra and don't mind the pain, then I would highly recommend this class.",
    "If you are fundamentally interested in mathematics and ready to do a lot of work, it's a great class. Auel is extremely engaging and helpful and his explanations are clear. Just be ready to spend a lot of hours on the p-sets.",
    "I would absolutely recommend the course--there's a reason why the enrollment grew so much. That being said, I think that if you just want a challenging version of Math 222, this class is a little fundamentally different: it's more pure \/ theoretical mathematics.",
    "I would recommend it to a student who needs it for a major. The workload is intense and the material is not easy, but it is overall a good course.",
    "This class is perfect for someone who loves math, has taken some linear algebra and proof-based courses before, and who does not care about sleeping. If those apply to you, absolutely take this course because it will completely change the way you think about math.",
    "For sure. Take this course to learn how to write proofs. Definitely helped me think logically about math and introduced me to how mathematicians operate.",
    "This class has really high highs but also really low lows. Professor Auel is an absolute gem-- he cares so much about his students and genuinely loves to teach. I actually made it to most of his lectures, and I usually never get up before 10 for any reason. The exams are also extremely fair. The PSETs on the other hand were absolute pains to do-- all-nighters became the norm for my Wednesday nights each and every week. You definitely learn the material from doing the PSETs, but prepare yourself for the time commitment. Overall, this class was worth it in my opinion.",
    "This course is incredible, especially if taught by Professor Auel. The material is not too hard (except maybe getting slightly more complicated in the second half of the course), but the problem sets will be longer than usual.",
    "Strongly recommend to anyone interested in math or the physical sciences. It really is an enjoyable class (one of my favorites so class).",
    "Take this class with Asher Auel if you can.",
    "I will recommend the course, but only if you are aware of what you are getting yourself into. I have never taken a math course that has been so consistently well taught and well-explained, but also extremely challenging and difficult. Professor Auel is one of the best math teachers I've ever seen in my life, let alone Yale. He cares deeply about the subject and will make you care about it too. The course gives you a solid grounding in how to write mathematical proofs, which is very useful. The problem sets are very hard, but manageable if you start early and go to office hours. This was a course that required lots of work but was very rewarding. If I could redo my semester, I would still take it again. The one caveat I have is that the final exam was unfairly difficult, in a way that made me doubt everything I liked about what I learned from the course.",
    "Take this over 222! Each p set feels like an accomplishment. They take 12 hours but you prove a lot of cool stuff a long the way. You also get a solid introduction to proofs and proof writing. The office hours and sections really helped me understand parts of the lecture\/content I wasn't getting.",
    "I would recommend this to the student if he\/she\/they were incredibly enthusiastic about linear algebra\/math. This is definitely not a class to be taken lightly.",
    "Asher Auel is a fantastic professor who made this course one-of-a-kind. I learned a lot and really improved my skills and my interest in math.",
    "Asher is a really clear lecturer and one of the best in the department, and I left the course with a much deeper understanding of linear algebra than say if I had taken 222. That said the workload is significant - problem sets regularly spanned (ha) 15 pages and took 10+ hours a week, and the curve is awful - in the spring it's full of overeager freshmen who actually have time to do the homework and study and the average on the midterm was a 96%, for example. Problem sets are heavily proof-based but the exams are mostly computational, so watch out for that as well. But if you can put in the time and effort it's probably worth taking, and you'll discover if you can deal with proof-based math \/ higher math courses as well. Also maybe take it credit\/D if you're not a freshman.",
    "Definitely recommend, it exercises a strain of critical thinking that not everyone (me for example) has been exposed to and really should expose themselves to for the sake of a better imagination at least.",
    "A wise man once told me, \"Take 225 instead of 222, it will be so much more fun.\" I am very glad I listened to that guy because Math 225 was the best math class I have ever taken. The course goes in-depth into the underlying foundations of linear algebra (what is a vector space, e.g.) and works its way up to eigenvectors and even a lecture on the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. Asher Auel is one of my favorite math professors because he has that passion for pure math that you can't find just anywhere, and he knows the material like the back of his hand. Also, he likes to occasionally make jokes or give us anecdotes about Grace Hopper. I know that the workload in 225 is fairly high, but if you like math even just a little bit, taking 225 over 222 will pay massive dividends by the end of the semester.",
    "As an alternative to Math 222, I would recommend this course to only a particular type of student. Math 225 is not for the faint of heart, or for those that are just looking to complete a requirement. If so, just take Math 222. However, it is for those students who have a deep interest in Math, or want an introduction into deeper mathematical concepts. This is unlike any math class I have taken, it does not rely too much on rote memorization (although there is still a decent amount of it). Instead, it often relies on your problem solving capabilities and your adaptability. Being able to apply theoretical concepts and approach problems at multiple different angles. If a student is looking to improve these aspects, and is willing to do the arduous workload, then this course is for them.",
    "If you're interested in math or computer science, I would highly recommend this class. Linear algebra is a very important topic to understand well, and it is super valuable for all sorts of work in STEM fields. It also makes you a lot smarter, in my opinion.",
    "This course was a perfect introduction to college-level proof-based mathematics, very different from the calculus courses. Especially Prof. Auel's elegant lecturing and the design of the course managed to reveal the inherent beauty in mathematics and the joy of actually knowing and making sure of why you know mathematical theorems instead of just plugging numbers. Also linear algebra is a corner-stone in my prospective major, computer science, and I see first hand through the diversion lectures on Goggle PageRank algorithm and Heisenberg's uncertainty principle how useful linear algebra is in the sciences. I truly recommend this course anyone who enjoys dealing with abstract notions, and mathematics.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone who wants to pursue math and\/or wants to greatly improve their logic and proof-writing skills. However, only take the course if you are willing to put in an incredibly large amount of effort into it and spend a significant portion each week doing the problem sets.",
    "Yes, the class was extremely interesting. Of all the linear algebra class options, I believe 225 is probably the best one. It is challenging, but you learn a lot.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student, no matter what you are studying. This course is an incredible opportunity to expand our thinking capacities, develop better problem solving skills, and learn about a key area of mathematics. It is very well taught and you will learn a lot. The instructor, TA and peer tutor are incredible!",
    "I would certainly recommend this class to another student if they have any interest in mathematics. Although the homework can be long\/difficult, the class overall is extremely rewarding. You will learn how to do proofs very rigorously and learn a lot of new, exciting material. Asher Auel is a great lecturer and his lectures on Google's Page Rank and Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle are among the most interesting.",
    "If you like math and like figuring out hard problems, you will love this class. This class has made me fall in love with math. And do problem sets with a group! Those Wednesday nights and early Thursday mornings will stay in my mind for ever.",
    "Yes, you get far more out of this than from 222 as far as I've heard from my friends. I definitely didn't need to take this class, but I'm glad I did.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student if they are willing to face challenging problem sets. The proofs can be difficult to formulate and figure out, and each problem set does represent a significant investment of time. However, if you want to understand how and why things are calculated in linear algebra, then this could be the class for you. It starts from the axioms for fields and vector spaces, and from these simple statements builds up the entirety of linear algebra, which is a very satisfying pay off for the time invested in the problem sets.",
    "I would only recommend this course to a student willing to put in the work. That being said, if you are willing to do it, it's a fantastic course.",
    "Yes!",
    "I think this is probably one of the most challenging intro classes I've taken at Yale as a STEM major, so I would only recommend this class if you're really interested in learning pure math and you're willing to put in the work. The problem sets are long (you should expect to spend a long time working on them and going to office hours to work on it with other students) and the class also probably involves a lot of just sitting there and thinking about the concepts and how to prove stuff. Other than that, if you're really interested, it's totally worth taking this class (especially if Auel is teaching it again!)",
    "Professor Auel is great and if you're willing to put time and effort into this class you can get so much out of it.",
    "I would whole-heartedly recommend this course to anyone who is thinking of possibly doing a math major or who shares a passion for math. Prof Auel is probably one of the best professors you'll encounter at Yale and this course made me understand so much more about mathematics than before.",
    "Extremely time consuming.",
    "Yes, and I already have--the increased breadth and depth compared to MATH 222 is worth it.",
    "I withdrew from this course on the last day of the semester. It was really tough for me. And yet, I definitely think it's worth taking if you have any curiosity about higher level math. Professor Auel is an excellent lecturer, and he also seems to have a knack for picking great teaching fellows, (which is pretty important!). Every part of this course is designed to give people who didn't do 230\/231 the chance to have an awesome, rigorous experience of math that gives at least an initial idea of the proof-writing, rigor, and beauty of this discipline. And linear algebra seems to me to be a topic perfectly suited to that task -- it has a kind of visual, intuitive, (perhaps deceptively) simple quality that makes it accessible in a way that other topics might not be. Note: I didn't take math 120 in preparation for this course. It might have helped me somewhat in terms of mathematical maturity, but you definitely don't need to have taken 120 before you sign up for this course. What you do need are great work habits. Start problem sets on the day they're released, and work on them bit by bit rather than getting left behind, and you will do fine. In this way, math 225 is like any other tough STEM course. But unlike some of those courses, math 225 is extremely well-taught, so if you do put in the time you will absolutely be rewarded for your efforts! Highly, highly recommend!",
    "I learned a ton from the class but they really aren't kidding about the workload. It's not just that the material is difficult, which it is sometimes, it's just that there is an enormous quantity of it. There's homework each week, and even if you work at maximum speed I'm not sure you can regularly do it in under four or five hours if you do it well.",
    "YES. If you want to learn some math (having no background), or IF YOU WANT TO LEARN LINEAR ALGEBRA, TAKE THIS COURSE AND NO OTHER. Professor Auel is the BEST and you will LOVE and UNDERSTAND the subject, because how can it be otherwise. You will start with the basics of numbers, and what they can do, building up definitions that will take you to concepts like vector space. And from there, you will discover ways to add properties to that thing, and know it inside and out, because you created it. Other people might think they know linear algebra, but in fact, you will know better things, truer things. There's a solid problem set every week, but you can do it, because I believe in you, and there's helpful TA sessions.",
    "If you can, take it with Prof Auel! If you want to learn about mathematical logical reasoning - and not just the applications of linear algebra, as used by different fields - this course is a must. It isn't too difficult, but still fairly rigorous.",
    "I would recommend it to someone only if they are either a math wizard or they are willing to work extremely hard. You will gain skills from how much this class pushes you and the material is honestly very interesting, but this course takes a lot of work hours.",
    "Yes if you need the content",
    "I would definitely recommend this course - Professor Auel is fantastic and it's pretty amazing to see where you are at the end of the course compared to the beginning. I came in with literally no linear algebra or proof background and it was still manageable, but challenging. After taking this class, I feel like \"math\" I've learned before linear algebra is more like calculation, and this is where the math actually starts.",
    "I would recommend taking this course. I took it to be able to use linear algebra with knowledge of its foundations later in the scientific research field. But: it was just really fun material (besides the fact that the psets are on the tear-your-hair-out long side). Tests and exams are 100% fair."
