    "I would.",
    "CHEM 505 is a good elective course to give you a sense of the current state of the field of DSSC & artificial photosynthesis and current challenges that researchers face. Having four professors teach the course gave it a good variety of material as well as perspectives\/approaches. I would recommend it, as I got out of the course exactly what I was looking for: a better sense of the field and what exactly artificial photosynthesis is.",
    "Overview of energy usage, photosystem 2 and solar cells.",
    "I would recommend this course as a non-stressful elective to people interested in alternative energy.",
    "I would summarize it as an interdisciplinary approach to developing solar energy technologies. I would definitely recommend the course to anyone interested in solar energy, green chemistry, or just looking for an interesting chemistry class in general.",
    "An overview of photovoltaics and artificial photosynthesis as applied to Dye Sensitized Solar Cells",
    "If students are interested in the subject matter they should take this course and they can learn a lot, however I would warn them about the disorganization",
    "No, I feel the course due to its singular focus on DSSC is too specific for a wide topic such as \"alternative energy'",
    "The course focuses mainly on solar technology, photosystem II, and briefly mentions other relevant technologies. I would recommend this course if the interest was mainly on solar energy. If the student was hoping for a broad introduction to alternative energy as a whole, I would not recommend this course."

   "comments": [
    "This course didn't really contribute to my dissertation research, as my research is in III-V semiconductor solar cells. However, it did give me a much better grasp on the DSSC sub-section of the field of solar energy.",
    "Not really",
    "I learned a lot an alternative energy that I can use in my research.",
    "This course gave me a better understanding of all of the different approaches there are to solving problems in the alternative energy field. In research it is very easy to get tunnel vision, so learning about a wide array of techniques and topics that all build off one another towards a common goal was useful in developing a healthy mindset about research.",
    "My research focuses on algal biofuels and it was helpful to have a introduction to photosystem II and how such a system functions."
