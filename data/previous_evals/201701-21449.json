    "No I would certainly not recommend this course to anyone who does not absolutely have to take it to fulfill the language requirement or otherwise. It is plainly a bad course. The syllabus has been the same for many years and needs a revamp. 5 days a week at 9am along with at least an hour of work a night is counterproductive to the learning process. Plainly, I would strongly suggest not to take it; and if you do end up doing it (for one reason or another), don't burden yourself with the earliest section (unless you are one those morning people).",
    "I liked the class and think the French program at Yale is pretty intense, but is really good. I'd recommend to someone who likes French and is placed into the class."
