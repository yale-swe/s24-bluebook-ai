    "The course is structured to expose one to the broader body of Aramaic literature and the studies therein. Semitic 532 01 continues where the previous semester concluded. I would suggest this course to anyone interested in Aramaic because it effectively gives one the tools to conduct research in a rather broad and under studied body of literature."
