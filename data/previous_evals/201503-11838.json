    "Any ENGL 114 class is going to improve a student's writing, and really teaches incoming freshman how to write a college level paper. This section in particular, on travel and tourism, is a good class for anyone who loves to travel or who is interested in thinking about travel in many new ways. I would recommend an ENGL 114 class to all incoming freshman, and would suggest this particular section if the topics mentioned above are of any interest.",
    "If you're looking for the easiest way to get a writing credit, this is not the course for you (and ENGL 114 in general). However, if you are looking to greatly improve the quality of your writing (and perhaps have an easier road in the long run) then this course is an excellent choice. The quality of discussion and reading in this class is excellent. Perhaps more importantly, you will become excellent friends with all of the students in your section and form a great relationship with your instructor. The grading in English 114 (and this course as well) treats an A grade as \"publishable material,\" but people also do not get bad grades. Pam is an excellent instructor and challenges you to become the better writer that she sees in you. Would recommend to anyone up for the challenge.",
    "A useful introduction to academic writing if you are unfamiliar with how to write in a scholarly manner.",
    "Travelers and Tourists is a very challenging class but it is also lots of fun! To be honest, the readings may seem very hard but they're not as bad as what I've heard from other sections: its dense material but in a digestible quantity. Pam is a wonderful instructor, I really recommend taking this class just because she teaches it! This class is a lot of work and may seem hard in the beginning but I really feel like my writing has improved a lot now. I definitely recommend taking this class but be aware that it's not going to be the easiest class you can take.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student, but I would warn that the assignments can pile up and that you have to be curious about travel and tourism in order to find the material really interesting, because it's a great class and really improved my writing (which is the most important takeaway in my opinion), but I didn't know exactly what to expect content-wise and I think a class with a topic such as this won't appeal to everyone. I would summarize this class as a freshman seminar where we look at travel and tourism from various perspectives and through different lenses as we hone our critical reading and essay writing skills.",
    "Yes, and definitely for students who have any interest at all in travel and perhaps its sociological explanations, or want to improve their academic writing in general.",
    "English 114 Travel and Tourism is an English seminar that explores authenticity, or lack thereof, in traveling. Throughout the semester, students critically analyze the texts of distinguished scholars to determine if travel can ever be authentic in a world in which everything is staged and presented for viewers.",
    "It's a great class if you're really interested in Tourism and Travel, as well as the reason we decide to travel as a society and what implications it has on the world around us. Some of the readings can be dense and harder to work through, but in the end everything's a lot of fun to think about.",
    "I recommend this course for anyone who has never experienced academic writing, and would like to gain knowledge in the area for the future. Rather than becoming a better writer immediately, I learned the changes I needed to make in order to improve, which is important. However, do not expect a sudden overhaul in your writing and massive improvements in your grades on papers. It's more about learning the art of academic writing than suddenly transforming into an amazing writer. That would take much more time than the course allows.",
    "Yes, it did teach me how to write like a college student."
