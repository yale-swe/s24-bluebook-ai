    "TAKE THE CLASS. Even if you don't already love the intersection of math and music, it is so eye-opening to see it in its full glory. A reasonable amount of work and a wonderful instructor.",
    "Absolutely take this class! The experience of learning new analytical tools and then applying them to pieces was super good for my analytical writing skills. The math is cool and you get some good ways of approaching post-tonal music.",
    "If you are interested in the theory of tonal music and structures, this class is for you. If you are interested in developing your chops with set theoretic analysis, this class is for you. If you want to just spend some time thinking hard about the world our musical system lives in, this class is for you. Awesome awesome experience with this class.",
    "This class is a really interesting look at various ways of using math to analyze music! Sometimes the connections were obvious, sometimes they were more tenuous -- but it didn't really matter, because the math was always fascinating and new and the music was beautiful! There isn't very much work -- five analysis papers, problem sets that we went over in class, and two exams. You definitely don't need to know any higher-level math at all to take this class, but you probably need at least to enjoy using mathematical\/logical approaches to problems.",
    "DEFINITELY take this course. Even if you don't like theory. Or math. Take it."
