    "I would absolute recommend this course - it's a must take. It makes you think about your body in ways that you have probably never thought about before, and in a variety of contexts. You learn about history the body and its relations to other people and the environment by looking at the history of US and across the world, current practices, and major thinkers such as Marx, Foucault and Butler, which i think everyone should learn about at some point (this course being a great intro to these people).",
    "It was definitely philosophically centered and did a lot in terms of helping me think critically about culture but it was not exactly structured, and I never knew what to expect.",
    "Very good class. Nobody in the class was a WGSS major, so the varied backgrounds definitely made for interesting conversation. Professor Grewal is an excellent seminar professor and I would highly recommend this class."
