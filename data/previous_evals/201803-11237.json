   "comments": [
    "TAKE THIS CLASS! I learned so many things about the field of humanitarianism that completely changed my worldview.",
    "I was exposed to the many dimensions of humanitarian work, from political and ethical environment in the aid sector to the role of partnerships and Responsibility to Protect. The case studies and guest lectures in particular offered exposure to the wide range of knowledge and skills humanitarian work requires.",
    "I learned a lot about the complexities associated with humanitarian crises and spaces around the world.",
    "Learned how to critically analyze humanitarian interventions mostly in theoretical terms but with many grounded examples.",
    "I gained a lot of insight into humanitarian interventions and the general nature of humanitarian\/development work. We learned about various case studies and discussed themes of accountability, ethics, political sovereignty, and others.",
    "This course taught me the importance of viewing humanitarian interventions and strategies from a variety of different perspectives, most importantly the local populations receiving aid. I learned how to critically evaluate texts and understand the importance of anthropology, especially as it relates to medicine.",
    "I learned all about the ethics and complications of humanitarian interventions.",
    "how to do critical reading, succinct writing all related to human rights and humanitarianism",
    "I feel like I learned how to see the complexity in humanitarian interventions.",
    "Conversing about the theoretical and practical challenges to humanitarian intervention; anthropology literature on the topic.",
    "Great course that surveys different topics and considerations within the humanitarian field: ethics, different types of humanitarian action, sovereignty, humanitarian spaces, military, etc. Learned how to do critical analysis.",
    "I learned about a wide range of different humanitarian crises in recent history, how different organizations responded, and what the impact was like on the ground. I learned about the importance of ethnography as a tool to understanding the impact of humanitarian interventions on people's communities, daily lives, and overall well-being beyond the statistics, stereotypes and generalizations. I also learned about the difficulties multi-mandate organizations face when they must remain accountable to donors, the communities they serve, and humanitarian principles.",
    "This class gave significant insights into the difficulties of humanitarian actions and issues faced by the field."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: Great professor\/TF, amazing readings, good grading system Weaknesses: Less class discussion than I would have wanted! We had a ton of stuff to get through (which was great!), but this didn't leave a lot of time for the class to discuss.",
    "Strengths: The literature and research papers, the range of guest speakers from all different background with experience in the humanitarian world. Weaknesses: Unstructured class time and vague instructions for assignments. The themes and material discussed also became redundant.",
    "The course is great and the readings are really interesting. Sometimes the themes for each week are a bit nebulous and vague, but sometimes that is demonstrative of the complexities associated with the definitions and terms. I wish we focused a bit more on case studies because they were really interesting. The work load is very reasonable.",
    "Perhaps more well-facilitated discussion amongst students. The potential for deep engagement is there but not brought to full potential.",
    "This course was excellent, and Prof Panter-Brick brought in many great speakers. The only thing I would say for improving the course would be doing more case studies in which the entire class was spent focused on one specific case.",
    "Guest speakers were incredible. And the subject material \/ readings were always engaging. Nevertheless, classes themselves felt very unstructured.",
    "Strengths include the students in the class, readings, and critical analyses. Class discussions could have been a bit more structured, as could the final projects, many of which overlapped with one another.",
    "No weaknesses. i thought it was incredible",
    "Strength: professor, guest speakers, diverse mix of people in the class Weakness: more discussions of ethics, sometimes I felt like we weren't really having more nuanced or productive conversations surrounding humanitarianism, I think this is because sometimes people would not do the reading. If there's another way to hold people more accountable, that would be ideal. Also mixing readings from other subjects such as history, memoir, speeches, press releases behind the US government interventions, would be more productive as it would help us understand how different actors actually view and approach their work.",
    "I really liked how we were encouraged to engage in the 'human' aspect of humanitarian interventions. I did not like how the class had little to no structure, and even though we were encouraged to engage in the 'human' aspect we we're really engaging with many personal stories or learning anything that we could actually utilize to hopefully make the current system better.",
    "The readings were interesting and contained a variety of perspectives. Guest speakers brought perspectives of working in the field. Critical analyses, the writing assignments, offered opportunities to crystallize thoughts and form opinions. Small group discussions in class were productive. However, class was often unstructured and perhaps not demanding enough. Often readings were not discussed. Feedback on the critical analyses were minimal.",
    "Strengths: kind, well experienced professor with great insight from field; good reading selections; surveyed a lot of topics; great guest speakers. Weakness: I think the class size was too big to have productive discussions -- I think it would be way improved if it were capped at 12 or 14; would have appreciated a little more depth into topics (which I think could be achieved by smaller class size and better discussion); sometimes felt a little disorganized.",
    "One strength was that the guest speakers we heard from came from a diverse range of expertises and had vastly different experiences, which gave us insight into multiple perspectives within the humanitarian sector. It was also a wonderful experience to be able to speak to authors of the work we read, and especially to have Prof. Panter-Brick as a teacher, who could share with us her stories from the ground and wealth of experience in the field. One way in which the course could be improved is by requiring more critical analyses and giving students dates by which they must complete at least one, two, three, etc. This would help avoid a mad rush at the end of the semester for students who put off writing their CAs. Also if all the weeks were organized around more clearly defined topics, such as our second week on ebola, that might facilitate more in-depth discussions of specific humanitarian crises.",
    "The class benefits from its unique format: some classes follow the typical seminar format of discussing readings, some classes combine discussion of readings with presentations by the professor, and many feature a more dynamic discussion format in which guest speakers provide synopses of their own work and then pose questions to the class. Professor Panter-Brick manages to hold your attention extremely well while also building in breaks into class time, so students can approach each topic refreshed. The only weakness is that you may read upwards of 100 pages for a single class, the topics of which may not even be discussed depending on the format of the class."

   "comments": [
    "YES !! TAKE THIS CLASS !! YOU WILL LEARN SO MUCH !! If you are someone thinking about going into this field, or just curious about it, this class is essential.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to students interested in refugee work, humanitarian aid administration and politics, and interested in hearing from experts in the field. I would not recommend this course for students not interested in giving presentations or practicing \"hard skills.\"",
    "It is a really great writing credit if you're interested in the topic.",
    "Yes, especially for those who might be interested in the humanitarian sector.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to another student. The teaching is great, and this class will offer insights that are hard to find in other courses. Whether you are interested in global affairs, anthro, public health, or medicine, this class has a lot to offer.",
    "Yes! Anyone considering nonprofit, international affairs, global\/public health, or education work should consider taking this class.",
    "Yes. The professor is so interesting and engaging. It was my favorite class at yale. So awesome.",
    "Yes! It a great opportunity to learn from amazing humanitarians and view humanitarian not as a linear but diverse and complex field. Sometimes I felt like the class wasn't giving us the whole story or that many were a little rectulant to share or challenge the field of humanitarian, I think a discussion of anthropological methods would be more helpful to the class, i.e the ethics of doing such research, research as a means of intervention and the like. The diversity in the class was good. Some anthro\/some global affairs\/some STEM. However, I think writing down how people from each discipline can take the class will be more helpful in the future and create less confusion during shopping period.",
    "I would not recommend this course to another student. I felt like I learned very little and although the readings were interesting, we almost never engaged with what our course work was and our class was largely just talking about anything (regardless of the topic). Also, we talked a lot about the issues in humanitarian interventions but I never actually learned ways to mitigate these issues or how to hopefully better the field that I hoped to go into in the future. This was pretty disappointing for me.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student specifically interested in humanitarian interventions. A student who is more interested in anthropological theory and methodology should consider another course.",
    "Yes -- good class and great survey into different topics and considerations in humanitarian fields. Professor Panter-Brick brings great insight from the field and is very kind and warm! Readings are interesting and there are great guest speakers. Class is sometimes a bit disorganized and would benefit from a smaller number of students, but overall good!",
    "Yes, especially if they are interested in entering the humanitarian field.",
    "I would recommend this course wholeheartedly to any student interested in public or volunteer service of any sort. This class is not necessarily for the typical global affairs student who may be more interested in development."
