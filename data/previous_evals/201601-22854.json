    "PSYC 611 is a discussion-based course, similar to a journal club, in which students will delve deep into the neuro literature and read many of the most famous papers in the field. The course covers a diverse array of topics in neuroscience, and being based on readings and discussion, students really get out of it what they put into it. I would highly recommend the course to any student who is interested in neuroscience.",
    "Highly recommend. Prior neuroscience knowledge essential.",

    "I learned more about topics outside of my specific interest area. Most importantly, I've become much better at interpreting complicated neural figures.",
    "It was particularly helpful because of the large number of papers we read and critiqued in class and a particularly helpful overview of the neuroscience field."
