    "A very worthwhile introduction to various approaches of doing history. Even those methods that don't seem particularly applicable to one's own interests are discussed in such a way that there is always something to be gleaned from them. I would definitely recommend this class.",

    "I feel like I now have a much more solid grasp of the different possible ways for me to approach my area of interest, and the varied subject matter we were exposed to has broadened my view of the discipline of history.",
    "Prof. Snyder and some of the visiting faculty were really eager to have us think about our dissertation and discuss how we personally want to approach historical writing. Alas, some instructors did not, and too many students in the class were not history PhD students, which somewhat watered down the debate."
