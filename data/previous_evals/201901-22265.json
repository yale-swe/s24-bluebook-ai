   "comments": [
    "Great organization. Great material. Every book was interconnected. Wonderful discussion of cultural theory.",
    "The syllabus was very well-constructed, with texts interrelating and building upon each other. The professor's focus on methodology made the course extremely interesting and applicable to a wide range of interests. Most significantly, the professor was extremely rigorous in examining the assigned texts and ensuring all students grappled with the material. I found it to be one of the most useful courses I have taken in this regard. Every text we read, we read carefully and closely.",
    "Strength was that every single person had incredible level of engagement with the material, leading to robust discussion. Professor is an absolute legend and the best seminar leader Ive had at Yale by far. Incredibly interesting readings. No weaknesses."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, this course is one of the most difficult classes I've ever taken at Yale, but Professor Dean made it very accessible. This is a class where you also learn to understand how cultural theory is applied to history, which is fascinating. Most history courses should be like this because I don't understand how one can study history without theory.",
    "I would certainly recommend this course to anyone interested in the subject matter or the period. I found it immensely useful both in its particular historical insights, and also in terms of developing analytical skills and learning to examine historical methodology.",
    "Absolutely. You learn how to think critically as a historian. I have grown so so much intellectually. Also, the readings were stellar and Prof Dean is amazing."
