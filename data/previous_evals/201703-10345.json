   "comments": [
    "Knowledge: So much about Southeast Asia - its cultures, kinship structures, politics, history, arts, literature, religion whatever angle through which one can view a region, this class deals with. In particular, I learned about how modernity affects Southeast Asia, such as the darker spectres of genocide in Cambodia and currently in Myanmar, or the evolution of familial relationships in the face of a globalized world. Skills: Professor Harms gives a lot of good advice on writing style, and I think my writing has definitely improved as a result.",
    "This was undoubtedly one of the most rewarding classes I have taken at Yale. It gave me a new perspective on not only Southeast Asia, but also for lack of better phrasing, how people work. It's a great class where you get to \"sample\" different aspects of Southeast Asia that contribute to the richness of its culture and history that people typically gloss over. In the class, a few of the topics we studied were the arts, language, cultural expressions, religion, political developments, and abstract yet also concretely present ideas of kinship and moral economy.",
    "I loved this course. Not only did I learn a lot about a region that I have spent a lot of time in throughout my life, but each class was engaging and I loved all of the readings.",
    "Very interesting new ways to look at Southeast Asia in an anthropological perspective. How to be a better writer."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: This course engages with Southeast Asia in the most kaleidoscopic way. Every week was a different topic, and contained readings from a wide range of countries. Not only is the subject matter varied, so too is the pedagogy. Blogs, articles, movies, documentaries, closeup interaction with Indonesian shadow puppets, invited performers from Vietnam, Vietnamese tea, a visit to the YUAG, etc. Few classes engage with all 5 senses as this. Weaknesses: The nature of the course means its a whistlestop tour of the region, hence you won't explore a particular region or subject in a good amount of depth. Another improvement might be to spend a little more time looking at the countries often neglected in Southeast Asia - namely, Brunei and in particular East Timor.",
    "Strengths- Fascinating discussions, manageable workload, grading was very reasonable, flexible\/easy-going class, really just amazing students, professor, and TA Weaknesses- sometimes readings were too heavy and difficult to finish",
    "The course is structured very nicely, the readings always played into one another, and the assignments were very engaging. There were no weaknesses.",
    "This course is completely amazing! Very well structured, interesting content, and amazing professor and TA. I can't really think of a weakness!"

    "Absolutely. I came in with zero experience with anthropology, but I did not at all feel like I was studying an alien subject, as logic and argumentation still factored into a good essay like in all other subjects. The fact that it was a survey-like anthro course also meant the course didn't demand a thorough knowledge of anthro theories. Southeast Asia is a region making its claim on world affairs, and is certainly worth learning about, even if you don't have a prior connection to the region.",
    "Absolutely! I highly encourage anyone at all interested in anthropology to take this course. Southeast Asia is a fascinating region to study in the field of anthropology. It completely shaped the way I view people and politics and was a gem that I almost glossed over myself!",
    "For anyone looking to learn about Southeast Asia, this class is the perfect one to take. Professor Harms is great, and the readings are fantastic. I am a STEM major and I really enjoyed this class.",
    "This is by far one of the best courses I have taken at Yale. The course content is super interesting (especially since I am already interested in this region), the course is well structured, and workload is nicely balanced. It is usually the highlight of my week! I think the best part about the course is the people. Since we only had seven students enrolled and two auditors, we really got to know each other and bond as a class. Our TA, Tram, is super friendly and helpful. Finally, professor Erik Harms is one of the best professors I've had at Yale. It is very clear that he is very dedicated to the course and the students. He constantly motivates (and manipulates :P) us to become better learners and writers. 10 out of 10 would recommend."
