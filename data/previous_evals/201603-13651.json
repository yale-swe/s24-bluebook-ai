   "comments": [
    "To think outside the box. To see things from a different perspective. To learn about a subject area with an open mind, suppressing biases.",
    "I learned SO much about the history of policing. The best class I have ever taken at Yale.",
    "This this tense political climate, especially when it comes to police practices, this course gives you a great inside peek into the perspective of a former police chief. Take it to expand your thinking. The CompStat and ride-along requirements are extremely eye-opening and really enhance the curriculum.",
    "I went into this class with a COMPLETELY negative, one-sided view of the police. This class has added a great deal of insight and nuance to that view.",
    "Good writing skills",
    "I gained a more profound understanding as to how our policing system works. Without this class I don't think I would have been able to see not only the policies and methods of policing over time, but also the social and personal aspects of being a cop and the adversity they face.",
    "I learned about how policing works as an institution and how it is affected by external factors.",
    "Policing in America exposes students to simple questions about policing that are often overlooked in today's political atmosphere. Through totally open discourse with New Haven's former police chief and fantastic course requirements (going on a ride-along with a police officer), I gained a much deeper knowledge of the complexities of being a police officer. We learned about policing methodology, how it has evolved, what it should accomplish, and how to move forward. The class seemed disjointed all the time, but when I got out of it I realized how much I really did learn. It's pretty get in what you put in to it I think.",
    "I learned lots of history of policing in America, how to compare those foundations to current realities, some lingo, and I learned how to care about every person in the room",
    "The course opened my eyes to facets of policing I did not know and thought I already understood."

   "comments": [
    "Very easy to follow. Very detailed and well-structured. The course provides valuable insight and does so in an objective manner. You learn a lot.",
    "ALL STRENGTHS. Really interesting material; great professor; great assignments.",
    "Keep up the CompStat and ride-along requirements. Those are the best parts. If there is a way to get more students engaged in the class discussion, that would be amazing. You're lucky if you get a talkative class. The paper prompts were a little receptive and vague; it would have been nice if there was a bigger difference between the midterm and final paper prompts.",
    "This was a great class - Dean Esserman was very kind, understood our concerns about the police, and discussed them while never becoming defensive even when we (myself included) initially did not want to see another point of view. We went on ride-alongs and to NHPD meetings. Very interesting class which genuinely changed my worldview - not sure if he will teach it again as he is leaving New Haven, but if he is, would 100% recommend.",
    "An amazing instructor",
    "A definite strength is how open this class is. Honesty, candor, and discussion are requirements in this class. This facilitated the learning process and really cemented the topics covered in class.",
    "This course was terrific, it shouldn't change at all.",
    "The primary weakness is Professor Esserman's flexibility on students doing readings and submitting assignments on time. Of course, many students will appreciate that in the future, but I've always been deadline-oriented and felt that the number of students who would come in without their work or readings done was pulling the class back. The strength of the course is Professor Esserman's creative course requirements. Giving a peak into the real world of an officer is the best way to teach us about policing's complexities, in my opinion. Oh, and the guest speakers he brings in are fire.",
    "Strength: caring professor; class size; workload; we start every class with \"what's on your mind and just talk;\" interesting readings Weaknesses: easy to get behind if you let yourself bc the professor is so nice; some of the guests seemed a bit insensitive to race realities",
    "The class is very non-traditional. The readings are light, but very useful to the class. The environment is low-pressure and everyone can speak their mind freely. I really enjoyed the way the class was taught."

    "Amazing course for any polisci student. A must-take at Yale.",
    "10000000% yes. If you can get into this class, it is a must. I am so happy I got the chance to take it.",
    "Take this course!!!",
    "This is the best course I have taken at Yale. Chief Esserman is an excellent professor and even better person and anyone who is lucky enough to get into the course should absolutely take it.",
    "Yes, absolutely! This this tense political climate, especially when it comes to police practices, this course gives you a great inside peek into the perspective of a former police chief. Take it to expand your thinking. The CompStat and ride-along requirements are extremely eye-opening and really enhance the curriculum.",
    "Yes, definitely.",
    "Great course. very different from other political science seminars. way more chill, but I learned a great deal.",
    "Low workload class but have zero clue how the grading is because you receive nothing back during the term. Esserman is very knowledgeable and tells great stories. The course is not particularly eye-opening but definitely was a good class.",
    "A great class. Esserman is a wonderful facilitator who is able to shed light easily and fairly onto complex issues. You'll learn a lot, especially if you do the readings and pay attention in lectures. The assignments, especially the ride-along, are really illuminating. However, be prepared to never receive any grades back on your assignments.",
    "The class is insightful and a great 5th class",
    "Absolutely! Particularly at a time when police-citizen relations are so often questioned, I think this is an essential course in understanding the history and role of the police.",
    "I would 100% recommend this course to other students. It's a safe space with a very accepting teacher who adeptly introduces you to his world.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone who can get in. Chief Esserman cares about his students more than any other professor I've ever had. He is accepting of everyone's opinion and fosters great discussion. The ride along and compstat are also very interesting components of the course.",
    "I would definitely recommend the course. It's low commitment, low workload, but at the same time very interesting and engaging. It's also very hard to get into, so if you can get into it, I'd say it's a great class to take if you're interested in modern social issues\/the police brutality complex.",
    "Super informative and interesting course!! Lots of reward with not TOO much work. You can be yourself",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who is looking for a low-stress, but fun and interactive way of learning about the city of New Haven and policing."
