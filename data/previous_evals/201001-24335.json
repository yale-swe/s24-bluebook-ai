    "We had 2 problem sets, a midterm, and a final project.If you want to learn hands-on how to build a robot, this class is NOT for you. If you think you can magically figure how to build a robot after watching powerpoint slides, this class IS for you.I came in with high hopes and expectations from this class. Alas, like all compsci \/ engineering classes, it ended up being painfully theoretical.It was also extremely disorganized, and this really affected the final project.Not recommended.",
    "Yes. This is an interesting course, but beware it ends up being less about designing robots and more about the history of robotics and the emergence of social robotics. Also, unless you're an advanced (I mean actually advanced, not just 201, more like 323\/365 and a summer internship completed) coder you'll have a hard time doing any final project other than an HRI study.",
    "i would definitely recommend it. it's an interesting class, you get to learn basic concepts of robotics, and you get to play with the robots they have in the lab at the end of the year. It's not a lot of work, but most of it is during reading week so be careful how you allocate your time.",
    "This class is boring unless you're into social robotics. In fact, this class should just be renamed SOCIAL ROBOTICS. You don't build robots. You don't really learn that much about robots. Its basically Applied Psychology. Or something. zzz.Oh yea and the final project is A LLOOOOOT of work.",
    "I would recommend it; it is an excellent course, and a good introduction to robotics.",
    "should be called human robot interaction. nothing about how to make robots intelegent is discussed. no work until the final project. only take if you want a physic class.",
    "Highly recommended - great intro to AI and field of robotics!",
    "Yes. Not much programming is necessary and this class can be more of a psych class at times. Still, you should have some idea of what you're doign with computers, especially for the final project. Although you definitely don't NEED CS223, it will help for the project.",
    "not too much work, problem sets are few and far between, so make sure you do them thoroughly. get a head start on your final project, and make sure to discuss it often with the TA.",
    "Take it if you want to learn the systems and theory behind robotics. There is no actual mechanical work in this course, it is mostly theory. You might do some hardware for the final group project (the bulk of the homework), but most people do not. An interesting course."
