   "comments": [
    "This class doesn't have a heavy workload, but you will have no idea what is going on in the class about 95% of the time. I hardly knew what I was doing for the problem sets.",
    "This is a survey course, which may not be as fulfilling\/satisfying as a course that delves deeply into one area. In the end, I felt like I didn't really learn anything in particular, but I guess I could speak generally intelligently on the visual system.",
    "Terrible class, material was really boring, definitely not worth my time. Lectures are super disorganized, material from lecture X has nothing to do with material from lecture X+1. Waste of time& credits.Do not take it!",
    "This course is a blend of many disciplines as they apply to the topic of vision and perception. This is NOT a pure computer science course; in fact, I got the sense that computer science was the least applicable background among its cross-listed departments (and minimal skill in MATLAB was the only bit of computer science that could help for the homework assignments). I don't quite understand why the course did not have a math department course number--it was very, very math-heavy.The topics were all interesting, though very hard to understand in lecture (since they were presented to make sense to about a quarter of the room at a time, by major). The homework assignments were easy enough to complete even without understanding the lectures (office hours helped immensely). The exams were merciful, but it was difficult to know how to prepare for them well (even in retrospect I couldn't offer advice there). The project that was traditionally a part of this course was taken off the syllabus for Fall '13 because there were too many students enrolled; instead, we wrote a five-page project proposal for what we would have liked to do. I would recommend this course to anyone with more background in math than me, or more generally anyone willing to go to lecture and not understand what they hear, and would like to add that the \"40-hour project during the last two weeks\" mentioned in older terms' reviews may or may not happen in future terms (it didn't this term).",
    "It's very technical and mathy, but in terms of how cool a class it is, I'd rate it along side another slightly mathy, awesome class - Game Theory with Ben Polak. I think the way that the more technical concepts are presented enabled me to better understand the concepts than if I had learned them in a vacuum. This was my favorite course this semester and I would highly recommend it.",
    "It was a very interesting course and you learn a lot of things you would not otherwise.",
    "Not really\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 The class was a bit disorganized. It wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t clear what we were meant to know.Though, it does make you appreciate how difficult the problem of computational vision is. Probably I was dissatisfied because after we looked at all of these methods (edge detection, parallax, color gradients, shape from shading, constraint satisfaction) there was still no satisfactory solutions. But that is just the reality of the state of the research at present. Zucker is an expert in the field and is summarizing some of the latest work in the field, and some of the results he is ableto achieve are pretty impressive, but there is still a lot of work left to do in the field.",
    "If you're looking for a computer science or neuro class that's very broad in content and relevant to most things in life, I highly recommend CPSC 475. Professor Zucker's also a great lecturer.",
    "If you're at all on the fence about this course, take it. Zucker is an amazing professor and the material is exactly what you want neuroscience to be: right on the edge between testing algorithms for solving problems and research on their biological implementation. You don't need much of a math background(a little MATLAB experience and very basic matrix operations would help but again, not necessary), and in fact the class isn't even particularly stressful or work-intensive, but you get a real foundation in many topics in computational vision and neuroscience.",
    "This class was extraordinary, surprising, completely baffling, and ultimately quite satisfying. Professor Zucker uses a vast array of disciplines to approach computer vision& biological perception problems, and, in doing so, demonstrates a way to approach problems in general. I ended up loving this class, but, at times, the lectures were quite hard to follow. I came into this course not having taken Math 120, but the teaching fellows did an awesome job of helping me understand the crucial mathematical ideas in the course. The homeworks and tests felt like very fair assessments of the course, especially considering the fact that there was some material that went way past my understanding.",
    "This is a class with interesting& complicated material, comprehensive online notes, very easy exams and an otherwise manageable workload.",
    "This was very interesting class - I did not miss a single lecture, and if you choose to take this class, neither should you. The lectures were often mind-blowing, and I often left the class smiling widely. The math was kind of advanced, but that should stop you from taking this class - Professor Zucker and the TF's do a good job of making the material accessible even if you don't havean advanced math background.More than anything, this class helped me think about computation and neuroscience, which was what I was going for. This class might be for you, but it might not be. If you are remotely interested in the topics at hand, I'd say go for it. If you decide to go for it, stick with it.",
    "A solid class. It's all over the place. You don't learn about implementing computational vision, but by the end you know about all the math and theory behind a hypothetical one.",
    "This was a fantastic course, with a very thoughtful and effective balance between neurobiology, computational modeling and mathematics. It is undoubtedly the best interdisciplinary course I've taken at Yale, and the material was fascinating. Zucker does a great job of tying all the pieces together, and engaging students to see Computational Vision ideas in the real world. The Bi-weekly psets were a fun mix of relatively simple Matlab coding and more complex Comp Vision applications and the tests were completely fair.",
    "Cool material. If you're interested in the topics, you'll enjoy the course. The lectures aren't that great, so you'll probably have to study a lot on your own, but it's not too bad. Workload isn't terrible: psets every two weeks, midterm, final, and a project proposal. If you have Dan as a TA, make sure to ask him if you need any help with anything!",
    "Boo. Took this course cause it looked interesting and yolo. Big mistake.",
    "Don't take the course; it's really not worth it.",
    "Unless you are comp sci major who desperately needs a science credit and can't afford to take a CS elective AND a science class. Otherwise, avoid this class by all means.",
    "I found this class to be much more math than I expected. I entered the semester with only Math 118 my freshman fall, and I was not too familiar with multivariable calculus, and the class is heavily centered on understanding of multivariable calc. The tests are fair, although they do seem to test math comprehension and memory at times instead of the actual material. If you are ok with math, then I would take it if vision interests you as a topic. Prof Zucker is very passionate about the topics covered, and as the semester progresses you will definitely have a better understanding of what vision actually entails.",
    "Strengths: problem sets weren't too hard but were still interesting and I feel like I learned something from almost all of them--at the very least a basic understanding of commands on MatLabWeaknesses: The lectures are very, very hard to follow. The lecture notes contain at least 33% material that we aren't expected to master and that is just quickly brushed over in class which makes it impossible to understand. However. it is sometimes not clear what we're supposed to know and what we aren't which makes the class feel overwhelmingTake this class if you want a very low workload CS course. Just be wary that the material will feel absurdly hard at first but you just need to go to office hours in order to get a sense of what you actually have to know",
    "I would not recommend the course to another student. I found it very frustrating how confusing the material was.",
    "I wouldn't recommend the class. You don't get a lot out of lectures.",
    "Great overview of concepts in computer vision and their biological equivalents. Covers and draws connections between many fields of study. Fun class, take it!"
