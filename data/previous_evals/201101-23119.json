    "If you could take this class, you should take this class.",
    "Yes",
    "Yes, it is an easy A (so we are reassured) as long as we don't mess anything up. You get what you make of it in this class. If you aren't interested and don't pay attention and just surf the web all class, then you won't get anything out of it. However, Kissisk and his friends have interesting things to say and I think it is worth listening to.",
    "An awesome opportunity. Not to be missed.",
    "Yes, you will learn everything about the healthcare system while hearing from experts every other week.",
    "I would recommend this class, as there are a lot of perspectives given by guest speakers that I wouldn't have ever really been exposed to. Really changed my perspective on the healthcare system and what health means. Definitely not a history class though, which was kind of what I was expecting.",
    "Class is very interesting, one of a kind at Yale, and the professor provides guest lecturers that bring real world experience in an otherwise difficult course subject.",
    "Take it if you can get in. Wish discussions evolved more of the class than they did, but none the less were fascinating."
