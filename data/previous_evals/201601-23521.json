    "Amazing policy class that provides a real foundation for the program Assignment prompts are incredibly challenging to understand",
    "one of the best classes I've taken. No room for improvement.",
    "very helpful",
    "I really enjoyed this course. I think the only thing I could suggest was a weekly reading response. I know that students might object, but I personally found that as things started to get more hectic as the semester progressed, I was less and less likely to do the weekly readings. I think the reading assignments are reasonable and interesting. A short reading summary\/reflection (1\/2-1page in any format and covering what students found interesting) would help ensure that students do at least some reading. I think this would help add to the complexity of the discussions as well.",
    "If the purpose of this class is to give an overview of topics in health politics and health governance, then I'm not sure it accomplished much. I don't feel like I'm coming out of this class with much hard knowledge about the subject. This class felt more like a discussion of how various philosophical political science concepts applied to the health policy space than actual learning about the state of health policy in the U.S. However, I feel like I did get to delve deep into health policy issues via the assignments, and that, though they were very difficult (!), I really learned a lot by doing them. Also, Mark is super sweet and very brilliant.",
    "I loved this class. The readings are complex but are explained well through the course discussions. There are two policy briefs that are pretty difficult but rewarding. One thing I would suggest is that the second policy brief is a group paper. Since this paper was at the end of the semester, it was extremely comlplicated to coordinate with people when everyone had finals and other papers. In my group there were extremely varying levels of effort as a result. Also, I don't think it's a good idea to pair undergraduates and graduate students in a group because undergrads are taking the class for a grade and graudate students are taking this class pass fail, so at least in my group there was a uneven effort. I think that the group paper should be in the middle of the semester instead of the end and groups should be paired based on undergrads\/grads (e.g. All the five years in a group).",
    "perhaps use slides can improve",
    "A nice class to understand political background of US health system",
    "I thought this course was a great introduction to policy-making in the US context. Though the material was grounded in the literature, I wish there had been a little bit more clarity in terms of the \"core\" policy tools we were supposed to gain from the course -- though we discussed policy diffusion, types of federalism, advocacy and patient autonomy among other topics, I felt that the assignments we were given did not let us engage with these topics in a way that facilitated their use. If we had to do more briefs (short ones) throughout the semester and been given more leeway with the focus, I felt I could have gained more from the course.",
    "This course was very interesting; going to class was a pleasure most weeks. The readings outside of the classroom were so-so; some weeks were more relevant than others--it is a lot of reading, but Mark explains it all during class. The first project (individual) was fun, but the second (final, group) project was so extremely complicated and difficult to organize logistically with a group, it was very tough.",
    "Mark's great. Very knowledgeable and really sweet. The final project was kind of tough. 3 page prompt with 12-15 questions to answer. We had to write the paper as a group and make it seem somewhat coherent.",
    "This course builds the basic structure of health political system. It's a course for those who are interested in policy work.",
    "I think that the course is perfectly planned, I have no comments on how to improve it.",
    "The number of readings are ideal and the amount + timeliness of the assignments are perfect. 10\/10 would take course again.",
    "An excellent course! Really teaches you to think critically about US governance and to develop evidence based arguments.",
    "Very informative and thoughtful. I have never thought about policy in the way Mark tells it. Every little subtlety is explored, which can be a little too roundabout and superfluous sometimes. But overall, very comprehensive and academic to the fullest extent.",
    "It's a great course. In addition to learning more about the healthcare system, you learn exactly how it works. That's important."

    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0Mark is very intelligent and helpful.",
    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0Dr. Schlesigner was incredibly knowledgeable about this topic area and helped us engage with the readings in a way that was much more substantial than we could have on our own. He was very open to hearing from students in class, and I enjoyed gaining student's perspectives on the readings. I thought his assignments could be a little over-explained at times, and I wish he made more room for student creativity in the policy briefs or given us more opportunities to propose policy solutions to issues we addressed in the course.",
    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0He's terrific. Very knowledgable, very interesting, and very responsive to students' thoughts. No answer is incorrect to him. He also gives very detailed, individual feedback to everyone on projects which is very helpful, insightful, and something you don't get a lot at Yale.",

    "A core class that you'll enjoy taking! Anticipate spending a LOT of time on the assignments!",

    "It could be renamed House of Cards: Health Policy Season and I wish it would be :) I appreciated everything I learned in this course.",
    "Great course!! really pushes you to think critically about the policy making process and challenges you with policy brief writing.",
    "recommend. useful and informative",
    "There is a reason this class is a required course for health care policy students. You'll learn fundamentals of government \/ congress \/legal system to back up your health policy.",
    "A good introduction to policy-making; a little unstructured, to make the most of course, try to focus on key tools you would like to gain from the course, and make note of them in the assignments.",
    "Definitely take this course--great focus on events actually happening, great insights from the instructor and not a huge focus on grades\/testing you, but a very heavy focus on you learning and thinking independently.",
    "It's a good course for people in the policy track. My only complaint is that it is a little too political science-y. We spent a lot of time on federalism. That being said, I think there were others in my program that enjoyed the more poli sci nature of the course.",
    "A very good class that builds on the core policy course and gave us a broad understanding of the political and governance system in the U.S.",
    "An ideal encapsulation of public psyche\/opinion, how it has shaped American politics and the implications on all facets of health and healthcare. I would recommend to a peer for every reason - the material, Dr. Schlesinger and Erika.",
    "Mark will make sure you learn. He really cares. And if you do the assignments carefully, you will develop your research, writing, and critical thinking skills. This is one of the few courses I've taken at YSPH that have made me feel like I am actually in a Masters program. It's also my favorite course so far!",
    "Take it. You will learn so many important and relevant things about health politics and how health ties into every aspect of governance.",
    "Yes, recommend",
    "Yes, this is a good class for everyone. You learn how the government works and the intricacies of how change happens. You realize it's something more than just rhetoric."
