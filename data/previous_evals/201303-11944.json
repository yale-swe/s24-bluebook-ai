    "If you want to learn Portuguese, this is the course for you!",
    "Yes. Marta really wants you to learn and she tries really hard to make sure you do. She sometimes expects very different extra activities from you and that can be a little bit overwhelming, specially close to the end of the term. She can be biased, but she will always be fair. The topics of discussion are very interesting and you learn a lot if you want to do so. If you are good with languages it is a very easy class.",
    "Definitely take this course! You get so much better at reading and writing in Portuguese, and Marta is super knowledgable and fun to get to know.",
    "If you're comfortable in conversation and want to work on more complicated written work in Portuguese, 130 is for you.",
    "Workload is very very light. Small amounts of reading (2-3 pages) or a half a page of grammar exercises, if any homework on any given day.Grading-wise, the tests aren't hard at all, but Marta grades the essays extremely harshly, especially if you're a non-native Spanish speaker. (As in I'm L5, but I lack the instincts of a native speaker.) I've heard, though, that no one gets a bad grade, but I've yet to get a grade myself.Overall, you don't technically learn that much new stuff, but if you took L1-L2 over the summer, I'd DEFINITELY TAKE this class. It really solidifies your mastery of Portuguese.",
    "Take it with Marta",
    "This course is very much a transition course into more advanced Portuguese. Students are expected to speak and write more fluently in order to facilitate mastery of the language.",
    "Decent course, hard if you aren't good at languages.",
    "If you want to learn the language then absolutely take it."
