    "I like the alternative research design very much, which encourage us to critically assess the empirical strategies in the readings. And the response papers definitely train our writing skills well. The feedback on the final research design has been very helpful.",
    "I thought the homework workload was fair. Kate chose interesting books and was very good at leading interesting class discussions. However, I think we could have read and discussed two books per week. The discussions were in depth to the point of being exhaustive, and I would have liked the opportunity to make more of a dent in the required reading list for the comp exam. That being said, Kate led a great class.",

    "Yes, definitely. Participants in this course can gain much in terms of knowledge, writing, and critical assessment with research designs. And the peer discussions in the class are also wonderful.",
    "Yes, it was an interesting course and Kate is a great instructor.",
    "Absolutely. The material is really interesting and the class sessions very participatory with a great lecturer. This course helps students to think about their current or future research interests and provides the instruction to help clarify and disentangle the questions and work needed at the pre-research phase."
