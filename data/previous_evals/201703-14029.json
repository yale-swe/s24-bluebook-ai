   "comments": [
    "I gained strong insights into American diplomacy in the Middle East and the decision-making process at the highest levels of the State Department. Through weekly memo assignments, a mock Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing, and a crisis simulation I also developed practical skills of diplomacy and foreign service.",
    "Great having international students. Instuctor gave relevant readings and created a free wheeling discussion atmosphere. Topics and ideas in current global context were existentially challenging. Modified assignmentsthx! Would have liked to hear more instructors thoughts on the readings. Overall great, encore!",
    "Lots of practical knowledge about how decisions are made in government (and also in general, how people make decisions, based on what restrictions or cultural limitations or needs). Also plenty of specific knowledge about world affairs, and a good understanding of what a diplomat's work is.",
    "Amb. Patterson's course was a great opportunity for anyone preparing for or are interested in learning more about U.S. diplomacy and policymaking. Specifically, it gives you insight into how diplomats interact with various interlocutors within the foreign policy realm -- state and non-state actors, NGOs, Congress, etc.",
    "I gained a solid understanding of diplomacy and how it operates in areas of conflict, particularly the Middle East.",
    "This class is awesome at showing what real life politics and diplomacy is like. When talking about world affairs, Ambassador Patterson kept us fair and in check which was a welcomed and huge change from other classes. The assignments were great as well. Ambassador Patterson is a great teacher and makes time for her students and definitely should come back to Jackson.",
    "I learnt a lot about the American Diplomacy especially in the Middle East. It was a good course to develop the professional writing on diplomacy. Also, lots of simulations."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Everything was perfect as Ambassador Patterson adjusted the course in response to our feedback.",
    "See answer one.",
    "Strengths - interesting and smart classmates, the opportunity to learn from each other, with great guiding lessons from a knowledgeable teacher. Weaknesses - I'm not sure there were many weaknesses. I think we did not always treat the questions we were supposed to treat... the questions for each session that are written on the syllabus. The class could have been improved by pointedly making sure that these questions were answered by the end of class.",
    "It was a very strong and interesting course overall. Although this was her first time teaching, Amb. Patterson was a great professor -- incredibly knowledgable, quite funny and engaging, offered very detailed and helpful feedback on assignments, and seemed genuinely interested in hearing our opinions and helping us understand U.S. foreign policymaking. There were a few bumps at the outset, mostly in figuring out the best format for the seminar. Sometimes I felt that the conversations were far too free-flowing, allowing for anyone to jump in and opine on anything about the topic at hand. I would appreciate a few focused, guiding questions at the outset to help direct conversation. While Amb. Patterson would always offer her opinions at the outset of the class, I would have appreciated having the chance to hear even more about her personal experiences\/views as it's a very rare opportunity to be taught by someone with such a distinguished diplomatic career! As a side note, I think the level of coursework might need some reevaluation. Initially, an assignment was due every week, in addition to several hundred pages of reading, but that was pared down slightly. I still thought it was quite a heavier workload compared to other courses. Lastly, the seminar does focus heavily on the Middle East (understandably, given Amb. Patterson's expertise), but I thought it could have benefited from one or two more case studies outside that realm. In such an instance, I might suggest bringing in a guest lecturer to discuss a case study on China or Russia, for example.",
    "Ambassador Patterson is one of the best professors I have had at Yale. Extremely experienced, talented, and knowledgable. The course could have expanded and focused on diplomacy in other countries such as Russia and China that have complicated relationships with the United States."

    "THE MOST AMAZING CLASS I HAVE EVER TAKEN AT YALE. Period. If Ambassador Patterson ever returns to Yale, I absolutely recommend this course to every Yale student. It was the most difficult experience of my Yale career but I learned so much and honed practical skills necessary for the Foreign Service. Ambassador Patterson is an absolute delight (and not to mention super overqualified- I still can't believe I learned about foreign policy from the former Ambassador to Egypt, Pakistan, Colombia, El Salvador, and to the UN as well as Assistant Secretary of State for Near East Affairs) and cared deeply for each and every student in her class. I can't recommend this course enough. If it is offered again, take it. You will not regret it!",
    "Yes",
    "Yes indeed",
    "Yes",
    "Absolutely! Anyone who might be interested in a career in foreign policy, specifically the Foreign Service, would fine this to be a particularly useful course in terms of professional development (lots of memo writing\/briefings). But also generally those who might be interested in learning more about U.S. foreign policy will certainly find it of interest as well.",
    "Yes! A must-take for anybody with an interest in working for the foreign service or in international relations.",
    "Ambassador Patterson really cares about her students and if you can take this course I definitely would.",
    "Yes. Especially those who want to enter the foreign service and diplomacy."
