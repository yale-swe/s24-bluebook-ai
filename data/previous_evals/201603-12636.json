   "comments": [
    "I learned a lot about the UN system, writing policy papers, and how to conduct yourself in negotiations with the Chinese.",
    "I learned how to listen with an open mind, even to people who clearly had very different views than mine.",
    "Thanks to an amazing practitioner, I was able to strengthen my comprehension of international diplomacy and the workings of multilateral institutions. I augmented my understanding of how diplomacy works in different global issues and the role of strategic thinking in achieving global objectives. In terms of core skills, I was able to strengthen my abilities in critical thinking, policy writing, interpersonal communication and diplomacy.",
    "Gained knowledge of the way the Security Council operates",
    "I developed a greater understanding of the history and inner-workings of the United Nations and other multilateral institutions.",
    "Gained a refined understanding of the capabilities and limitations of the UN and the shaping of US foreign policy through multilateral institutions.",
    "Dr. DiCarlo's Multilateral Institutions in 21st Century course allowed gaining first-hand knowledge and deeper insight into the complex system of this important global institution, its code of conducts, and its working methods. The amount and variety of assigned weekly reading served as an excellent source of covering a certain policy outline, history of creation and practicing of these policies as well as analyze current development in the international arena connected to policies in question.",
    "Overall general idea about the UN"

   "comments": [
    "The trip to New York was excellent, and I enjoyed the prompts for the midterm paper. I learned a lot about the UN, but it would have been nice to learn about other multilateral organizations as well. I think one weakness might be the student presentations. Some people clearly thought of their presentation as a chance to make everyone listen to them talk, and some people droned on and on and nobody listened. If we had a more clear rubric for what the presentations were supposed to be like, perhaps we could have solved that problem and then learned some \"briefing\" skills too.",
    "Strengths - Rosemary is a great resource and so interesting. The readings were often very interesting and informative, particularly when people would steer the conversation away from the topic - at least I often got something from the class. Rosemary was always available for office hours and was very helpful in that regard. Weaknesses - Rosemary did not always facilitate the discussion well and as a result, certain people dominated the conversation - it was frustrating when the same people would dominate the conversation AWAY from the topic at hand and turn it back to their pet project. The readings are a little out of date at this point, especially given everything that has gone on in the last year. The class was likely a little too large to facilitate a good discussion - I would say that much of the reason it was so crowded was because there weren't a ton of other classes that Jackson students could take. It meant that many people weren't overly interested in the class but took it because there was nothing",
    "Strengths: The professor was outstanding! It is rare to have a practitioner who can captivate students the way Rosemary did. For the type of class that she taught, it is extremely important for us to have someone who could share their practical experiences with us on issues confronting multilateral institutions today. She was great at managing the diverse, and often conflicting, opinions of students in the class, and ensured that we were able to come up with concrete solutions to global issues. Our meetings with the UN missions of Russia, China and India also helped us better comprehend the realities of international diplomacy from the perspectives of these countries. I am certain that most students had an amazing experience in the class. Weakness: I don't think this course really had any major weaknesses per se.",
    "Strengths: The students in the course came from diverse backgrounds and allowed for a better understanding of the unique perspectives that make up the UN system Weaknesses: The course did not cover a broad range of issues related to the UN and other multilaterals. A better title for the course would be 'The Security Council: to Reform or Not to Reform'. Important issues such as women, peace and security, global health, and climate change and the UN's role in dealing with these topics seemed to be an afterthought.",
    "Strengths: - First-hand insights into a largely misunderstood organization - Comprehensive and interesting reading assignments - Thought-provoking seminar discussions Weaknesses: - I would have liked to hear more from Ambassador DiCarlo. She came to class prepared with in-depth notes on each topic, but sometimes student discussions tended to monopolize the time.",
    "The curriculum is well structured and cogently navigates a complicated topic through relevant readings and guided discussions facilitated by an extremely knowledgeable practitioner. One very minor annoyance was that many of the links provided in the syllabus were broken, requiring some investigative digging (i.e. Googling).",
    "I see no weaknesses of the course whatsoever. Dr. DiCarlo's course was a beautiful combination of challenging assignments that allowed for honing of analytical skills. One of the multiple strengths of the course was the trip to the United Nations in NYC, where we got to meet the representative of Russian, Indian, and Chinese missions and elicit their opinion on the topics we covered in the course.",
    "I would appreciate more theoretical grounding even though the practical approach was useful."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend the class, depending on who else was taking the class. I've heard from other students that the class was a lot different last year, and I think that is largely because of the students who were enrolled. Some people in the class this year were there to try to push their beliefs on others and were not particularly interested in learning themselves, and that was really frustrating to students who were hoping to learn. Also, I appreciate the instructor trying to let as many people take the class as possible, but there were probably just too many people in the classroom to facilitate a good seminar. I would tell other students that Ambassador DiCarlo is a great person to get to know, and that she makes time for her students, and for that reason I would recommend her class.",
    "I would recommend it, but would hope that no more than 18 would be allowed in - that would make for a better discussion.",
    "Absolutely! This course is highly recommended for anyone interested in gaining a stronger understanding of international diplomacy from an amazing practitioner as Rosemary.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to any fellow student who is interested in how multilateral institutions function in the modern world.",
    "I would recommend this course if the student is interested in learning more about the Security Council and the history of the UN (not including UN agencies). If the student has broader interests, such as how the UN contributes to development, gender equality, education etc. I would not recommend this course. Relevant issues to today such as the Sustainable Development Goals were not discussed.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone interested in the complex world of multilateral institutions. Ambassador DiCarlo is a priceless resource for first-hand knowledge and an overall fantastic professor.",
    "Great course and very enjoyable discussions. The course title alludes to multinational institutions but the focus is on the UN.",
    "I absolutely recommend Dr. DiCarlo's course to anyone who is interested in pursuing a career in diplomacy and wants to gain a deeper insight into the working methods of the multilateral institutions."
