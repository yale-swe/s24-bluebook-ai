   "comments": [
    "Good introduction to kinetics and reactions.",
    "The course teaches the fundamentals of reactor design and chemical kinetics. I would recommend this course to other students. The topics covered in the course apply to a wide variety of research topics.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone having had taken undergrad reaction engineering prior to this course. Without familiarity of PFR, CSTR and Batch reactors, the first class lecture could be overwhelming. Overall, it was a good course with fair PSets.",
    "This course is well organized and the material is easy enough to understand throughout the semester. I would recommend this to another student as it is interesting information and an understanding of kinetics is very useful in many chemistry-related areas of study.",
    "Very thorough review of CRE, quite challenging,.",
    "A good overview of reactor engineering and kinetics very appropriate for the graduate level. If your research is related to reaction engineering, I imagine the class would be very helpful. Otherwise, still good information for a chemical engineer to know.",
    "I would recommend the course. It is a detailed course covering every aspect of chemical reaction engineering like reactors, kinetics and others."

    "My dissertation\/research is not focused on kinetics\/reactor design. As such, the applicability of this course to my work is limited.",
    "Yes, this course was helpful is solidifying a foundation for understanding chemical reaction engineering. While my grad research goals might deviate from kinetics or reactors, this was a well organized and taught class.",
    "The knowledge on kinetics will be very helpful for my research. I am not sure how helpful the reactor design topics will be, but it is possible they will be helpful as well.",
    "Very deep review and study of Chemical reaction engineering.",
    "The kinetics part was new, so that expanded my knowledge. but overall done very quickly without going thoroughly over details.",
    "My research is mostly unrelated to kinetics and reactor engineering, so the class wasn't very helpful in that regard."
