   "comments": [
    "I learned more about topics that I had never been introduced to while in high school. It broadened my possibilities for study and I feel enlightened and more informed.",
    "I learned a lot about the history of racism in the US, and why\/how that system was created and implemented in the first place. The course also has an emphasis on writing based on interpretation of primary sources.",
    "I developed a new understanding historic event through a social view point. It humanized history.",
    "I didn't develop many insights, but I certainly wasn't the target for this course--I had a fairly progressive history course and have regularly thought about theory of history\/racial formation. This class is primarily a history-based one, and I've come to realize I am not a big fan of history.",
    "This course introduced me to a wide range of familiar yet new topics concerning the formation of racial categories and the history of interracial contact around the world. It also brought up issues relating to migration, diaspora identity, and the historical background of various racial, national and ethnic conflicts.",
    "I think, more than anything, I learned to really find the important takeaways from dense readings. Further, my ability to engage texts in a larger social context also improved - as the class was focused a lot on real-world happenings and what those real-world happenings showed about the formation of race and ethnicity, and how migration played into those things.",
    "Drew information from so many different parts of the world! Very diverse learning.",
    "I was able to get a good amount of general knowledge about a range of topics. I have taken lots of specific ER&M classes, and have covered much of it in more detail, but it was a good survey course and reminded me how everything can be tied together comparatively.",
    "I learned so much about the history of America, and in particular the history of Native Americans, that I had not known before.",
    "This course is a great overview of ethnic studies and the topics covered in the ER&M major. I highly recommend it for incoming freshmen. I took this course as an upperclassman in the major, and at times found the pace difficult since I have taken classes on several of its most-discussed topics in the past. For students of all years outside the major, it is an excellent overview of a wide variety of topics.",
    "The course allowed me to look at many historical events with a new lens and a new perspective. The course also gave me insights into various historical themes regarding ethnicity, race, and migration.",
    "Before coming to this class I had known about the history of race to some extent, but I definitely learned things I had never thought of, like the real reason behind ghettos and neighborhoods like Chinatown. I also feel as though I improved on my writing a bit!",
    "This was a great intro course. I learned a lot about different ethnicity and races and I now have a greater understanding of world social dynamics.",
    "This course reexamined historical texts and events that we as students had previously learned in the Western educational model of our high schools, and showed the inclusive version of the tales of imperialism from the perspective of the colonized and oppressed peoples throughout the world. This provided a wonderful breadth of refreshing new thoughts, experiences, and angles to look at the world and apply to other works I study in the future.",
    "I became more aware of different ethnic\/race\/migratory struggles that have taken place in America, and how different groups of people involved in such situations impact each other.",
    "I learned how to think about topics in ER&M, as examined in a range of different global contexts. It is insight that I will be able to apply in all future social sciences\/humanities courses at Yale, and throughout my life.",
    "how to think about the world in terms of racialization and how to piece apart society in this manner for current purposes",
    "I learned first that there are so many students like me that are bothered at the \"Tale Intellectual's\" view on say, third-world countries and the systems of government in the U.S. This class gav me a community in which I felt completely comfortable to say what I felt. I could confide in any of them about the racism I see daily in other classes among other problems, and know that they wouldn't just call me \"too PC\" and shrug me off. I gained knowledge about other cultures and how they reate to the U.S, and was better able to draw connections between inernational problems and problems inside America.",
    "I learned about immigration, race, and ethnicity through a wide range of scholarly readings and from primary sources. I learned beyond the generic perception of ethnicity race and migration. I learned about he orgins of these forces and how it affects people today.",
    "This class was a huge survey course and I learned about so many different class\/race\/gender\/etc conflicts all over the world. Really broadened my horizons",
    "I gained a broad understanding of ethnicity, race, and migration around the world. I was able to tie together different cultural experiences to improve my understanding of these topics. Although this course is HU, Humanities are seamlessly tied into SO parts of the course. I gained a more nuanced understanding of racial formations with similarly interested peers.",
    "I deepened my knowledge of specific histories of certain peoples, especially within the United States. I also gained a greater global perspective on the development of racism. My academic writing greatly improved, as did my discussion participation.",
    "I learned a new framework through which to view history. I also learned lots of narratives to history that aren't normally included in the field of history. I also learned the processes of things like racial formation and racial difference.",
    "Since this class was an intro to Ethnicity Race and Migration, it was useful that we spent the beginning of class going back to the inventions of race, ethnicity, and borders and how it affected history going forward and the world we live in today, especially because race and nationality are concepts we often take as given.",
    "I practiced critical thinking, perspective, and analyses through the readings we engaged with.",
    "I developed an entirely new lens through which to view American history and race relations today.",
    "I learned about marginalized groups in America that have been excluded in regular history",
    "I learned to think critically about things relating to ethnicity and race that I had previously learned and taken as fact.",
    "General overview of major migration trends within the U.S. and the way in which race and ethnicity has evolved on its varying impact on the U.S.",
    "I learned how to examine history critically, and to notice parallels and divergences between different experiences across time, place, race, and ethnicity.",
    "I learned how to think about systems of racialization -- thinking about race and other processes as VERBS not NOUNS, and found new language to articulate various oppressive processes.",
    "How to think and speak! I also feel like I learned how to listen a lot better.",
    "I think I learned some basic things about writing history papers (such as format, correct way to cite, how to refer to things) and some general, broad themes about race. I think I also learned how to better talk about these issues and what kind of vocabulary to use when discussing racial issues, which is important in today's age.",
    "I learned a lot in this course, about race and formation of race in america and about historical trials faced by people of color in the U.S. the texts we read were helpful for getting a baseline understanding of ER&M. I also gained skills in examining documents and primary sources critically.",
    "This course helped me to gain new perspectives on the dynamics of ethnicity and race, making me more aware of how they have interplayed with one another through history and how this still affects us today. It has helped me to look at the bigger picture of immigration, the movement of peoples, as well as how and why we define differences.",
    "I developed my ability to write clear and concise essays using historical evidence. I gained insight into the contantly contested nature of racialization and the resistance present in racialized power structures.",
    "Dr. Schmidt Camacho's scholarship is unlike anything else I've seen in academia-- she mixes the traditional academic techniques dates and statistics and scholastic writing with people's stories and experiences, and she makes you feel the impact of those stories. The result is a richer, more impactful argument. Learning how to make and understand that kind of argument and the revolutionary work that comes from it is a must.",
    "This course managed to fit so much history into one semester. I learned about a number of different racial and ethnic groups throughout history. This class exposed me to new ways of thinking when it came to events I either new a lot about or had never heard of.",
    "I learned the histories I should have learned many years ago. I learned how to critically analyze writing and current events to take into account power dynamics and histories of oppression. I learned about my own privilege and concrete ways in which I can begin to help make the world a more just place.",
    "Good introduction to the study of ethnicity, race and migration. Touches on a vast variety of topics, from the slave trade to U.S. immigration laws to the Rwandan genocide. Does not dive deeply into any of these.",
    "I learned about the various instances of historical oppression of people of color that my standard history classes in high school often overlooked or glazed over. This course was incredibly eye-opening, and the core concept of resilience and livelihood as resistance to oppression are valuable insights that I will keep with me forever. I think this is a class all students should take, and I wish we could make an ER&M distributional requirement so all Yale students can develop these insights.",
    "I learned about the parallels between methods of oppression over the course of history.",
    "I gained insights into developmentst of ethnicity and race within both the United States and the world.",
    "This course provided an essential toolkit of both knowledge and insight, which we used to explore the histories of oppressed and indigenous peoples - almost all of which, much to my disappointment, I had never studied up until this point. This class, however, was so well-taught, so thoughtfully designed, on material that is so essential, that I believe strongly that it (or a course just like it) should be a requirement for all students.",
    "I honestly didn't feel like I learned very much about ethnicity, race, or migration beyond how it applies to the United States and what I already had a conception of. I wish we had looked at other parts of the world besides the US, and other relationships besides white vs. non-white. The academic standards were low and therefore I don't think students felt a need to engage with the material.",
    "Such a good class. Developed skills in thinking deeply and critically about historical and cultural texts. Also had to write concisely and well for the midterm and finals.",
    "This course provides a good introduction to ethnicity, race, and migration in the United States.",
    "This course offered many social and intellectual histories that were completely new to me, and it helped me understand beter the processes of research and recording history.",
    "A survey of historical events which are affected by and affect issues of race, ethnicity, and migration with heavy focuses on people of color in the United States. As a junior ER&M major taking the course, it is a great introduction to the major. Good for building a vocabulary to talk about race, and a good introduction to histories of American slavery, American Indian resistance, and migrant contributions to the modern US."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This course was amazing! It was very interesting and did not have too heavy of a course load. The only change that could be made is to spread out the due dates of assignments. Many projects and writings were due at the end of the class which just created a lot of stress. If the assignments were spread evenly between the first half of the course and the last half it could be less hectic come November and December.",
    "The course covers a lot of in-depth history, and clearly connects this history to the present day. I also appreciated the fact that our readings were usually primary sources created by affected groups, and that we had guest lectures to talk about specific topics that Professor Camacho had less experience with. The main drawbacks are that the course is very US-centric, though we do briefly discuss some genocides in Africa and Europe, and the disjointedness of the lecture schedule. Consecutive lectures often covered topics regarding separate time periods, events, and groups, which made it difficult for me to connect the course into a greater whole.",
    "Strengths: it introduces you to different historic global events and their effects to",
    "I think the guest lectures were phenomenal and provided really cool, meaningful ways to engage with other professors at Yale. The typical lectures, however, were rather difficult to follow--and the visual aids were almost entirely useless.",
    "The course provides wide-ranging yet relatively detailed insight into a variety of national, racial, and ethnic identities and how these are formed. It also looks at issues of marginalization and oppression and suggests ways to move forward from where we are today. It gives a good historical arc, especially of racial identity in the US. Some parts of the course feel slightly disorganized which can make it hard to follow.",
    "I think the course had a lot of important content, and we did cover a lot of bases. It was very broad, and attempted to have a very global view of things. There was definitely the effort for inclusion of areas that I, before coming to this class, had never had the opportunity to study before. I think overall the class was rich in content. On the other hand, I did feel as though some of the readings were exceptionally dry. Some were incredibly long and did not feel all too relevant except for maybe a paragraph or so.",
    "The class presents very interesting material, however in a manner that is often disorganized and hard to follow. I wish the class presentations were a bit easier to follow. The lecture may benefit from as few slides (maybe 5 each) with a rough outline as Professor Camacho-Schmidt speaks, because it was very easy to get lost in the details.",
    "Lectures sometimes are hard to follow because they take on the format of stories...but very engaging because everything is tied together to the preset. Guest lecturers were awesome.",
    "The course is very US centric and there are lots of American Studies classes that cover these topics, so perhaps a little more focus on migration outside the US could be added. That being said the course does a good job of including a lot of information in just a few weeks. I liked that there were guest lectures on specific topics where they had expertise.",
    "The class doesn't always feel coherent, especially towards the end when there are a lot of guest lecturers but it is always interesting.",
    "At times lectures were hard to follow simply for the sheer amount of information they contained. The themes of the course are so broad that covering them all in one semester is a challenge to begin with, but Professor Schmidt Camacho and guest lecturers do accomplish this. I think in the future it might be helpful to have certain sections of the course taught by professors that teach introductory classes on the topic, simply to ease the burdens of covering so much material, but this is certainly not a necessary change.",
    "Strengths: The material and reading selections were extremely interesting and insightful. The discussion sections allowed me to view the content in new ways and allowed me to understand the content a lot better. Weaknesses: Sometimes it was a little hard to stay focused on the lectures (there was a lot of information packed into each lecture), but I think I got better at this over time.",
    "Strengths: wonderful, inspiring lectures Weaknesses: the topic is so broad that it doesn't feel like you really learn all that much about anything you're studying",
    "What's great about this course is that it brings in a lot of information about the history of different races and how colonialism has touched so many parts of the world. I had not known much about the US's involvement in the Philippines and that region of the Pacific, and I was glad to learn about it now. I could say the class needs more material on how LGBTQ factors into all this, especially since Prof. Camacho had put it in the syllabus.",
    "Course was conducted very well. I loved how there were so many guest lecturers, it kept the class very engaging.",
    "I think it's a great course that everyone should take at Yale, but feel that some parts of the course skimmed too quickly over groups like Japanese Americans (and internment camps), Vietnamese-American relations, and multiethnic groups.",
    "While I think it is good that this course is a lecture (making it accessible to freshmen), I think that sometimes it was organized too much as though it were a seminar (ie. looking for students to raise hands, which was intimidating in such a large class). Having more slides would have helped me stay engaged in each class. In general, I really loved the lectures (as well as the guest lectures by Professor Lui and Professor Ahmed). The midterm and final essay questions were frustrating in that sources were limited to course readings, but our various lectures were about such different and specific things that trying to link two different readings often produced weak arguments. It would have been better if each essay dealt with one topic (in that case, there could be more essays to cover more material!)",
    "great survey, but towards the end a little all over the place, but thats what contributes to the breadth of knowledge",
    "I would have liked to have more of the outlines they gave out at the beginning of the year. Those outlines helped me better focus and understand the lecture, but then after midterms they really petered out.",
    "The strengths are the sources the information is pulled from. The weakness was the spectrum of knowledge learned. It is too comprehensive and wide to have a deep understanding.",
    "Strengths: good class to learn about a little of everything and get us interested in race, ethnicity, and migration Weaknesses: not many. Sometimes section felt extra",
    "I believe that the sheer amount of course material\/different topics is both its biggest strength and weakness. While you are able to learn a lot throughout history, case studies are very focused on one particular aspect. Some texts were clearly very important like Said's Orientalism while others were harder to get through or apply. I think the class assignments were engaging nevertheless. Overall, I enjoyed this class a lot.",
    "The course covers a lot, but that can mean a loss in depth. I think that the sections should be smaller to better dive into materials covered in lecture.",
    "The course material is very interesting and the readings are all interesting and relevant to the course's narratives. At times, lectures were hard to follow as they tended to skip around temporally and these skips could be hard to track.",
    "The strength and weakness of the course are the same, in a way: we covered a lot of material in once semester (studying the beginnings of defining and categorizing people until today's racial and ethnic groups, and then doing that for a multitude of diasporas) but that also meant we spent a very short time on each group\/issue. We didn't really talk about Pacific Islanders and studies of the African diaspora and Latin America ended up being somewhat US centered. This class is for my major so I don't mind as much because I'll take other classes and seminars of each unit but if I was just taking this class for the sake of it, I'd just say keep in mind that one semester isn't going to make you an expert on every racialized group (and it's not supposed to, because people devote decades to even studying ONE).",
    "I think that the section discussions were rich and engaging, appropriate for diving deep into course material as the material that we are engaging with deserves critical thinking. I think however that I was not sure as to why the lectures were structured the way they were, and I think lectures can be made more interesting.",
    "Although I loved attending lecture, I feel that Professor Camacho's lecture-style can be improved. It was easy to feel completely lost if you dozed off or missed a couple of sentences that she said. Often, it seems like she was reading from a script. I did, however, really enjoyed the diversity in the kinds of assignments we had to complete and the course readings.",
    "This course covered a lot of topics but it seemed overwhelming at first. TAs and the Profwssor where gray about transitioning that",
    "The way lecture had discussion components and prof Camacho wanted to hear from us was so amazing and made me feel like my voice mattered in the classroom",
    "Strength: Surprisingly sufficient global perspective for a survey course; flexibility to write essays on specific topics of interest for the students Weaknesses: Lectures a bit hard to focus on at time",
    "I thought this was a great intro course into ER&M. Some of the information I had already learned in other classes, but it was definitely important for those who had not already learned. Lectures sometimes lacked focus\/direction, but were generally engaging. Professor Camacho is a wonderful lecturer, but it would be helpful if she put more information on her slides. Some topics seemed to be thrown in somewhat randomly, but there was always some link to be made, though sometimes the links could be made more explicitly. Assignments were reasonable, and varied in style, sometimes even fun!",
    "I wish the course had been a little more historically specific. When we learned about the immigration act of 1924, professor Camacho discussed lots of abstract ideas that I had nothing to attach to, because all we actually learned about the immigration act itself was that it happened in 1924. Some more specific historical background would have really served the course, so that we could better contextualize some of the more abstract ideas. Otherwise, though, I felt really supported and welcomed in the course, and learned a great great deal. I now feel much better equipped to talk about issues of ethnicity, race, and migration, and feel as though my perspective has really been broadened.",
    "The course starts off a bit slow and feels like we cover the same thing over and over again. Looking back, I realize that wasn't the case, but I think the thematic rather than chronological approach can sometimes make keeping track a little difficult.",
    "I would've appreciated a more chronological approach to this class. I was really confused often times about how one lecture connected to the next. I understand this isn't a \"history\" class, but I don't understand why not, since it seemed like we mainly learned history, and therefore I was confused when we jumped around different topics so much. I did learn about a lot of different topics, but it was pretty general information that I felt like I already knew somewhat about and was delving just a little deeper into.",
    "Amazing material, but the intro course is a little too ambitious. It tries to cover a lot of ground by having many different units, but course organization could be greatly improved seeing as order of units was random, not chronological or even topical. Keeping a timeline can be confusing, but it's not too big of a deal as all exam essays are take-home. Camacho is an amazing person but make sure you're well-rested, as her soothing voice can lull many to sleep.",
    "The strengths of this course include the breadth of topics covered, the passion of the instructor, and the format. some weaknesses were that topics did not feel clearly organized into any sort of timeline, and that we just barely scratched the surface of so many topics near the end of the course.",
    "Sometimes it was difficult when the lectures skipped around from topic topic each day. It may have been easier to group things chronologically or kept similar topics together in the syllabus. (sometimes this was the case but not always so it made it more difficult to historically situate everything)",
    "The course prides itself in breadth for an intro course and provide a myriad of histories, critical frameworks, and perspectives that necessarily contradict each other due to the nature of the field. This is a definite strength, however I noticed that a lot more nuance and care was afforded for the latter half of the semester, making the first half seem like it was purely historical when a lot of contemporary analysis could have been applied to these parts of the semester.",
    "The lectures in the course are usually quite interesting and sometimes fascinating and very powerful. Readings are cool and discussions well lead and interesting. The lectures sometimes seem a bit formulaic in that they present a list of oppressions and a -but wait, there's resistance - section. The class could be improved by uncorporating a little more theoretical and action based frameworks.",
    "Only weaknesses I can think of were that the class tries to pack a whole lot into a semester, which can sometimes make lectures feel disjointed from one another. And some of the guest lectures felt out of place in the flow of things.",
    "The class content itself was very interesting. It took me a while to get used to the lecture style - although Professor Camacho spoke about how she was going to lecture, it was hard to figure out what to write down and what not to. Also, although I grew to understand why certain topics were placed together in the same week, I think that a quick explanation of the connections between the two (sometimes very different) topics would've made the class flow better.",
    "Almost everything was a strength: the organization, the content, the engagement, the assignments, the wonderful TFs. The only suggestion I would make would be to have slightly more information on the lecture slides and to post those online; sometimes I got wrapped up in Professor Schmidt Camacho's lecturing (which was more like storytelling) and didn't write down all the important information.",
    "The only weaknesses I would point out are the readings, which are excellent in content but often just too long to accomplish, and the essay length requirements. The archival paper, in particular, felt really limiting because we had to fit all of our analysis to three pages. It might be better to change page limits to a range, like 3-5 pages or something. Everything else about the course is a strength, especially the guest lecturers.",
    "The course material is incredibly interesting and engaging but it can also be overwhelming as it covers various topics and time periods.",
    "Many many strengths - all thanks to our outstanding TAs and to Professor Camacho's expertise and passion - the only weaknesses lie in the inability to cover more material due to time constraints.",
    "This course is taught almost exclusively through the lens of the United States and European colonialism, and all relationships we studied fell into the white vs. non-white category. We learned about slavery, Native American genocide, etc. but very little about other parts of the world. For example, Asia was vastly underrepresented, and we 'studied it' through the lens of American Chinatowns and migrant workers to the US. This class basically never deviates from focusing on the role played by colonialism and white settlers in the oppression of other non-white groups - hence this class often felt like it had a very narrow lens. I think the academic standards of this class were pretty low (part of your grade is just showing up to lecture, come on), and therefore students didn't really engage with the readings, which were actually very interesting and well chosen. This class could be improved by looking at a broader range of groups and relationships, not just those in the United States.",
    "strengths: caring and engaged professor and amazing TAs. important and interesting subject material, taught with thoughtfulness and care. weaknesses: a lot to cover, and the course still did not cover much in the way of certain topics, such as indigenous resistance, or Central and South America.",
    "Strengths: Form of the lecture Guest Lecturers Selection of reading material Global Playlist component Weaknesses: not enough office hours",
    "Strengths: I gained a lot from the readings; they were definitely worthwhile. I loved the multimedia aspect of the course: we learned not just through reading and writing but also music and film, and equal legitimacy was given to each. Also I enjoyed the guest lectures by experts in the field, it added texture to the course and kept me engaged. Weaknesses: The course felt a little scattered, both in the structure and the content. I imagine it's a challenge to pack so much information in one semester, but I think there's some way that the topics we covered could have weaved together in a way that made more sense. Perhaps if we went chronologically, or by region, it would have felt more organized.",
    "I was very disappointed that this class, which is called Introduction to Ethnicity, Race, and Migration, only focused on the United States. This course should be called Ethnicity, Race, and Migration in the United States or should be drastically changed. There are trends of ER&M that are not included in the history of migrant experience in the United States, and this course, and this major, should not ignore them. There is an American Studies department that focuses on the United States. This course should speak to every continent. This would not be easy. It's already hard to include so much in one course. But I'm sure that there is some way to do this better, and I hope this will be done.",
    "This course's main strengths were its diverse textual, visual, and filmic materials and the guest lectures. I'm not sure I would change much about it at all.",
    "Good for building a vocabulary to talk about race, and a good introduction to histories of American slavery, American Indian resistance, and migrant contributions to the modern US. Sometimes the lectures are a lot of information in a short amount of time, and Professor Camacho uses slides sparingly and exclusively for images (not at all for organizational help).",
    "It is very broad and tends to jump around all over the place. While it is good for an introductory class, it can at times be confusing."

There was a strong emphasis on using first-hand accounts of events, both through historical documents and guest lectures. We also used some more unorthodox methods, such as analyzing music of disenfranchised groups.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class, it gives you a new perspective and information about events that may have been breathed through in history classes. It also introduces you to a a different part of the world. It is incredibly engaging, the readings and lectures are all interesting, and the purpose of this class is to learn and gain a perspective on theses issues. Also, Alicia Camacho is incredible! Cant stress this enough, take it. These are the courses Yale needs more of, and the courses all students should take.",
    "You have to take this course for the major. I wouldn't necessarily recommend it if someone was trying to decide on the major--I think a more specific introductory course in the department would be a better way to investigate the possibility of an ER&M degree.",
    "I think everyone should take this because it's more important now than ever to learn about the formation of race and the experiences of people who are different than you. The topics pertain to some of the issues we face today such as racial violence at home and globally, as well as the huge spike in international migration.",
    "I think I would, because the content is so broad and touches on so much. I think it's very accessible to people who were not exposed to deep humanities or a deep study of race and ethnicity beforehand. The discussion of migration is interesting in a way I can't quite describe, but I think overall it's a course I would recommend.",
    "This is a great course. Be ready to think more critically about processes in the world around you and be open to changes in mindset or ways of thinking. The topics presented in lecture are really interesting.",
    "Yes! Low workload and you learn a lot.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who is considering the ER&M major, but encourage them to take other more specific ER&M classes about the individual topics that interest them, because obviously it is a survey and not representative of all the ER&M classes.",
    "A good fifth class. I didn't like it at first because I think I expected it to be organized chronologically like a history class. It's not a history class but if you don't expect it to be, it's great. It is also very US-centric which is sort of annoying, especially since when it does look at international situations it doesn't provide enough background context.",
    "Yes, the course allowed me to look at many historical events with a new lens and a new perspective. The course also gave me insights into various historical themes regarding ethnicity, race, and migration.",
    "Yes!",
    "Yes, I'd recommend this course if you're looking to understand more about race relations and the history of colonialism which has shaped what the world is like today. The workload is not bad; there are weekly readings, and just a few papers, plus the Global Playlist project at the end of the semester which is fun. Professor Camacho is also so great!",
    "Definitely recommend this course to others. I took it as a freshman and it was a great intro to Yale classes! You have to turn in a few written assignments, and I think those served as a great intro to what college writing is like.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to a student regardless of their major. It presents a new dialogue on history and our world free from nationalistic\/patriotic propaganda and rhetoric, and also develops a sense of critical thinking and challenging the status quo that I feel is important to build in any student.",
    "I would recommend the course to another student, but would also remind them that some of the general thesis arguments of each section are very similar and can feel boring at times.",
    "Absolutely! This was a really good course as an introduction to ER&M-- though it could be frustrating if you already know in depth about the topics of the course. Professor Camacho is so smart, inspiring, and friendly. I loved this class and would recommend it to everyone!",
    "The course is extremely fascinating and each lecture covers an entirely new topic. Though there a lot of readings, most of them are quite interesting. I would definitely recommend this course to other students.",
    "YES",
    "I love this course and I think it's important not only for the community you gain but also for the discussion you have in section. The readings are exciting (I looooove Aime Cesaire's Discourse on Colonialism) and the TFs are incredible. Professor Camacho is earnest and tries her best.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone whom is interested in social problems. If you want to be more \"woke\" or aware of important social and political processes involving race and ethnicity you should take this class.",
    "Yes, it was good for learning about a wide variety of things, will get you fired up and want to change the world",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. You learn a lot and easily make friends with other students even though it is a lecture. Professor Camacho is an incredible person who is clearly moved by what she teaches. It will rub off on you too.",
    "I definitely would. The course has really shifted my global frame and I will continue to use it in upcoming classes and papers. The readings were fantastic.",
    "I would recommend this course. It is a good survey course which introduces you to several topics upon which you might be interested in studying further. The material in the course is extremely helpful in devising frameworks to understand how we have arrived at this moment in history.",
    "Yes! Because we are all either part of a racialized group or are implicated by racialization of other groups (or both!) it's important to know how this all happened and how ideas we take as given have in fact been created and continue to be constructed as we navigate our lives. As I said in another question, it won't make you an expert because a whole semester can't equate to a subject multiple people spend their lives on, but it's a great class as a starting point of thinking about ER&M.",
    "I recommend that all students take an ER&M course, because it contains relevant information and skills that would serve useful to other students in other majors be it political science, biology,or english. All students should learn about the processes that shape the way our world works, we should learn about other people. It would make the Yale student a true global leader.",
    "Yes! Definitely take this class if you want to learn about history through a bottom-up approach. Often, we learn about the past by looking at accounts of the elite as opposed to the people who were most impacted by the decisions of those at the top. This is an excellent course for students of color to learn about their history and how that connects to race relations today. The lecture style was not the best, but the course readings were amazing. The TFs also really cared about the course work and were always willing to help us.",
    "YES. If you are a person of color at Yale take this class and learn about yourself, use your experiences as primary sources, read important works! If you're white take this class and learn about why you have the privilege that you do and how to use that privilege for good! Everyone needs to take this class",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to other students. However, if students are not interested in pursuing the ER&M major, I would suggest that if they have an area of study they already know they are interested in, they should simply try to take higher level course in that area.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. It's a great intro to ER&M, but even if you're not a major it will give you important foundational knowledge.",
    "Absolutely take this course. Regardless of what your major is, it is such an important subject. The TFs are great and Prof. Camacho is one of the smartest lecturers I've had at Yale.",
    "Hmm. Unfortunately, I'd have to say no. I'm not really sorry I took it, I just don't think I learned THAT much. Most of what we learned I felt like I kind of already knew from general knowledge from high school. Discussion section was interesting. But I'd just say if you want to learn about race, maybe it would be better to do so in a more specific class in a seminar setting. That said, Alicia Camacho is so nice and has some really beautiful things to say and really cares about her students.",
    "Mandatory for ERM majors, a great intro course for non-majors unfamiliar with theory. A true intro into ERM theory.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course as a great introduction to ER&M. However I would mostly recommend it to students interested or potentially interested in ER&M, because outside the major it might be more beneficial to take a course that is less broad but delves deeper into a few issues.",
    "I would recommend this course because though many of the things learned correlate with history, there are clear connections made to the present that really change ones outlook on life and present day situations regarding ethnicity race and migration. As an intro course it is a great way to be introduced to these topics.",
    "If you do not take this class as a gut class you may end up feeling frustrated by how little you are allowed to research and explore but I feel that the breadth of the material covered means that there is always something to learn and take away from an important field.",
    "Yes, it's a great way to learn about histories of racial oppression in an intersectional way with attention to inspiring resistance. It covers diverse historical and political locations in the history of racism.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. Camacho's lectures are almost sermon-like sometimes in their rhetorical impact and call to action feel, but her arguments are also very academically compelling. If you can get Yami Rodriguez as a TF, do, though I've heard good things about others as well.",
    "Yes.",
    "Yes. For an intro course, a lot is learned in this class. Also section was a very key aspect to this course. These are topics that need to be discussed, and section provides a space for that learning.",
    "YES! Everybody at Yale should take Intro to ER&M. It should be a requirement. This course gives you a necessary and engaging introduction to the history of the oppression and resilience of different people of color. The readings are fantastic and the assignments are broad enough to let you reflect on the course material and synthesize it in your own way. Professor Schmidt-Camacho and all the TFs are INCREDIBLE and you will learn so much from them. Overall, super important and inspiring course.",
    "Yes! Even if you are not considering the major, I think this course is helpful in broadening your horizons in general. It's important for any student to be aware of the problems in the world based on these topics. 5he course load is very manageable as well.",
    "Absolutely recommend!!! Every student at Yale should take an ER&M course to find out what they've been missing from their standard high school educations and to gain insights about their own privilege. Even if you're not a very social justice-inclined person, I think you'll find this class eye-opening and interesting, and you'll learn to understand the historical oppression that informs the actions and viewpoints of those around you. The class itself isn't too much work, and there aren't many written assignments, so it's a relatively easy HU\/SO credit, too.",
    "Yes because it explains why many of the problems in our society and the world related to race and ethnicity exist.",
    "Yes, it is engaging and challenges your prior experiences and thoughts with different topics in history relating to ethnicity and race.",
    "My only regret in leaving this course is that I cannot take it again and again. YES YES a hundred times - take this course, especially if Professor Camacho is teaching it.",
    "I would not recommend this course to another student. Because it focuses on the United States almost exclusively, most students were familiar with the material presented.",
    "Please take this course. Everybody should.",
    "I would recommend this course to students who are really looking for an introduction in thinking about how colonialism has shaped the world and how race has operated differently around the world in different points in time. Just be aware that this class is not meant to go in depth on any one issue, but is meant to expose you to different topics that might inspire you to take a more in depth course later.",
    "I would recommend this class because I would recommend the ER&M major and this is the gateway course. I would recommend this class because the professor is absolutely fantastic and one of my idols. But I would be wary about this course because I don't think it will be all that you think it will be.",
    "Yes, definitely. Especially because so much of the content is so relevant to current issues.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student. It truly is an introductory course, so for students interested in ER&M or issues of race and ethnicity in general, it's a good way to explore what specifically you're interested in. It also works well on its own.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student interested in pursuing the major or a student who is not sure what area of the major he\/she is interested in and wishes to pursue."
