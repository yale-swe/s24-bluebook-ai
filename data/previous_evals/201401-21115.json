   "comments": [
    "Definitely recommend this, provided you have a close working relationship with the faculty advisor.",
    "I can't really recommend or not recommend ENGL 488 per se, given that every student's experience will differ depending on their subject, their circumstance, their advisor, etc. I guess I'd just say that I greatly enjoyed having the opportunity essentially to shape and follow a syllabus on my own, or with the aid only my accommodating advisor (Paul Grimstad). I enjoyed it for the reading, study, and intimate colloquy as much as for the opportunity to write a substantial paper. In other words, I think this is a gratifying mode of scholarly engagement that is usefully, qualitatively different from the senior essay project. But it only really works if you have a precisely and thoughtfully conceived project; if you're organized and diligent; and if you and your advisor are mutually excited about the project and each other. I'd imagine it also might work well with two or three students who could both excite one another and hold one another accountable.",
    "Obviously it completely depends on the professor and the material, but if you can get a good professor and interesting subject material I HIGHLY recommend it. I took an amazing study of Tennessee Williams' plays with Professor Roach this term, and it was the quintessential Yale academic experience."
