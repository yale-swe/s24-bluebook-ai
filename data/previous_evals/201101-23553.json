    "highly recommend this course for anyone taking hebrew at yale.",
    "It is a great introduction to some major themes and authors in Israeli literature. I would definitely recommend it, although also note that it is an introduction and there is a lot that isn't covered.",
    "great class- you get a wonderful sampling of israeli literature, and ayala is amazing as always--so sweet, so invested in and knowledgeable about the topic. she really shapes the class to both the level and interests of the people in it which is great. highly recommend! the only hard thing is that there's not a detailed syllabus and the workload varies a TON from class to class (sometimes you have 10 minutes or homework, sometimes 3 or 4 hours or even more) so that's a bit frustrating especially since you can't plan ahead, but ayala is so understanding that if you tell her the homework took you 5 hours one night, she'll alter what she was going to assign the next night",
    "Whether you're coming to Yale with an extensive Hebrew background or started from L1 this course is great. Ayala makes it accessible to everyone. You get to explore a couple themes in Israeli literature with a lot of depth and get to read fantastic authors in the original language.",
    "highly recommend for anyone who has taken up to L4",
    "This is a great class. If you want to improve your Hebrew naturally while learning really interesting things about Israeli litterature and Israeli society, take this class."
