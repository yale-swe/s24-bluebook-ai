   "comments": [
    "I highly recommend this class! It greatly expanded my thinking on what \"emotion\" means for art or literature, and the difficulty as well as the importance of thinking through where and how feelings, thoughts, and sentiments operate in these works.",
    "A good introduction to medieval art that will delve far beyond the surface. It's suitable for students who are new to this topic, but will also engage students with previous background in this field. It's a great opportunity to make connections from your own field of study to the medieval era and to learn about the history of emotions.",
    "The seminar explored the cultural, philosophical, religious, and biological underpinnings to emotions as understood in the West in the Middle Ages. Some weeks the readings were largely overviews of various theories of emotion, while others focused on individual emotions, including case studies of particular works of art. I would definitely recommend this course to both medievalists and nonmedievalists. As a nonmedievalist, I found that the course provided some helpful frameworks for approaching my own area of interest. However, I don't feel like I left with a solid foundation in medieval art--which I realize is not at all what the course claimed to offer. I think I would have benefited from more background reading prior to the semester.",
    "HSAR 590 is a great class for becoming more passionate about medieval art. I would absolutely recommend it to another student.",
    "I think I would recommend it. I certainly learned a lot and thought about emotion as a category more than I had before I took the course."

   "comments": [
    "I can tell this course will be helpful to me in the future. I was introduced to objects that I haven't encountered before, and I now have a sense of the secondary literature in the field.",
    "The course was instrumental in helping me to conceive of emotion as a category of historical research and reinvigorated my interest in High Medieval art.",
    "I found it really helpful to spend a semester thinking about a moment in the history of art from a very particular (yet expansive) framework. It gave me a lot to think about in terms of how I approach the time period I usually research. I also think Jackie's interest in learning about the subject as a group was invigorating in terms of considering the possibilities of our own professional and intellectual growth as we move forward in the field.",
    "I knew very little about medieval art or culture before beginning this class, and now feel like I have a good grounding for future work.",
    "It was very helpful for me. I would certainly describe myself as interested in emotion in a way that I was not before taking it."
