    "TAKE THIS CLASS! It is a very interesting subject that isn't really touched upon in other classes, so the only way to truly get all the substance is to take this class specifically devoted to it. It is organized very nicely, touching upon different subject almost like units over the course of the semester. The professor is one of the highest authorities in the field, and (this is hardly ever the case with any class) the readings are actually interesting.",
    "pragmatics with larry horn is interesting because you are presented with tons of ideas about the way that context operates in conversation, but you do not have to memorize any of them. instead, you have three very interesting problem sets and one final paper. the assignments allowed me to engage, but the greatest weakness of the class is that it does not force you to engage at all. still, if you like language, it is fun.",
    "This course is a small seminar that tries to explain why and how what we mean is different from what we say, and why we say things the way we say them. It's incredibly interesting, and you will probably find yourself thinking a lot harder about the way you speak. I would definitely recommend this class, but you probably want to have taken some linguistics before."
