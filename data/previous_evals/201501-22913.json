   "comments": [
    "This course is the hardest one in the math major. A strong background in Abstract Algebra doesn't guarantee a strong performance in this course.",
    "Definitely take it after MATH 350. It's a great class.",
    "Math 370 is a very very difficult yet interesting and rewarding class in Galois Theory. A good follow up for 350.",
    "Definitely take this class. The material itself is pretty exciting and Miki does an excellent job teaching it. Exams are challenging, but fair, and homework is pretty reasonable.",
    "Prof. Havlickova is a great lecturer. She is, however, a very strict and her grading of the tests was a little bit too harsh for my taste. Make sure you write absolutely everything on your tests, even if a statement seems trivial.",
    "Galois theory is among some of the prettiest math there is and is at the core of a lot of contemporary mathematics. This class was a fantastic way to solidify what you learned in Math 350. If you're a math major with intentions of going to grad school, this class is a must. Fair warning, though, the material is not easy, and Miki sets pretty high expectations in the class. The class is far from easy, but is very rewarding if you put in the time. Miki can be a little intimidating at times, but she is in fact genuinely invested in effective teaching. Don't be afraid to go to office hours!",
    "Micky is just the best, and Galois theory is insanely powerful\/interesting. Definitely take the course!",
    "I would recommend Galois Theory to all pure math majors. These are incredible results from a legendary mathematician who had died by the age I took this class. Miki is one of the best math professors I have had at Yale: she is very clear in lectures, has a lot of office hours and is very rigorous. Coming from Prof. Koberdas Abstract Algebra, I did not feel that the class is that much work although it is a lot objectively speaking. There are weekly problem sets, two midterms and a final. From this course you will truly understand famous results such as the insolvability of the quantic by radicals, how to construct a regular 17-gon, how to derive formulas for the discriminant of a polynomial and so on. It is a greatly rewarding class that should not be missed.",
    "At first, Galois theory is a lot of thinking about fields and polynomial and factoring, but after you build up these basics and start using finite group theory as a tool, it gets really cool! Miki is an excellent teacher, does a great job of building intuition during lecture, and really good at office hours. Homework is manageable, though don't try to do it all in one day. In the process of doing some cool math problems (proving no quintic formula exists!), you'll also get a taste of some mathematical history."
