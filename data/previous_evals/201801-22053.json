   "comments": [
    "This was the best, most intellectually engaging, well-structured, well-taught course I have ever taken at Yale. I was challenged on numerous levels, and forced to engage seriously and intellectually with a vast array of interesting, challenging content. I learned how to synthesize difficult content into a critical, academic argument; how to separate the personal from the political from the intellectual; how to have thoughtful conversations with my peers and so much more. I could go on forever about the new realizations I had about feminist theory, consent, sex, culture, and politics in this class every week felt like something totally new popped up, and my world view was fundamentally altered.",
    "This course provided an incredibly holistic view of the debates surrounding consent and rape in the United States. Best course I've taken at Yale!",
    "Learned about sexual consent as a metric for evaluating sex, the limitations in scope and sufficiency of consent",
    "This class gave me knowledge about consent as a paradigm, critiques of it, its power and insufficiency. It grounded this in feminist theory and had units with many interesting examples such as consent across the spectrum of ability. It also helped me clarify my writing significantly.",
    "I developed my critical mind and re-evaluated my own biases.",
    "This course was an extremely instructive introduction to the theory of consent."

   "comments": [
    "The course is exceptionally well organized. Its workload is enough that it keeps you engaged, but not so much that it feels overwhelming. The seminars are lively and engaging, and the twice-a-week-for-1.25-hours set up works so well (much better than having it once a week). The readings are superb. This is a pretty high level intellectual challenge, and there were times when I felt like I needed more introduction to certain philosophical schools of thought and lines of thinking.",
    "This course basically just has strengths! Professor Fischel put together a fantastic syllabus, which forced us to read, understand, and grapple with a wide variety of complex sources. He's a fantastic interlocutor, and he brings in many different types of materials.",
    "Strengths: Professor Fischel is a really engaging professor, leads good discussions, the 1 hour 15 minutes always flies by and is packed full of discussion",
    "Strengths: interesting material, brilliant professor, well-organized course, use of social media to incorporate news, mini lectures Weaknesses\/areas for improvement: more fluid student discussion",
    "Prof. Fischel is great. It's a bit dense on the theory but doable.",
    "The greatest strength of this corse would probably be a combination of the great reading list and professor fischels impressive command of the material."

   "comments": [
    "ABSOLUTELY. I would highly recommend this to any student at Yale College (I already have)! I think it fundamentally develops life skills and intellectual frameworks well beyond sex and consent, but frameworks through which to think through life, self, identity, violence, history, relationships, and more.",
    "If you don't take this course, you are missing out on one of the best courses to ever exist! This course, unlike so many others at Yale, confronts issues that are incredibly meaningful and present in a student's day-to-day life. TPSC will make you rethink everything you know! The readings are amazing! Professor Fischel is amazing! Take it take it take it!",
    "one of the best classes I've taken at Yale, Professor Fischel is one of the best instructors I've had, fascinating subject and readings, highly recommend",
    "Absolutely. Joe is brilliant, readings were full of compelling and fresh ideas, discussions often feel consequential",
    "Yes! You will learn so much.",
    "Yesthis is a crucial subject."
