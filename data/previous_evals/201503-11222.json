    "I would definitely recommend the class. You look at the humanities in a different way and it makes you think about the material you learn in other classes and how you can take it and craft or shape narratives. The final project was such an invaluable opportunity to actually get to create something out of nothing and be the ones executing that narrative and bringing it to people - it's a lot of work but it's so worth it to have that as a finished product when all is said and done.",
    "An engaging course that first explores what is public humanities--basically all the ways in which humanist knowledge can be successfully disseminated to the public--and goes on to accomplish a singular public humanities project.",
    "Such a cool class. Be prepared to self-motivate, and to look for something beyond an academic grade if you're take this class the right way. It's a hands-on learning experience that offers you the adrenaline-inducing sense of real-world work while still providing you with institutional support and an academic safety net. You learn to see culture different, to be more aware. And you get to make something that you think is important for the world - no busy work here. It's also a great way to learn humanity, and to get comfortable with people. Like all kinds of people. That's hard.",
    "Take this class. It looks at fun cultural intuitions through an academic lens, not for a theoretical understanding--as is the case with most courses--but for a practical understanding, applicable to the final project."
