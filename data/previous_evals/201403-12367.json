   "comments": [
    "I would recommend it to another pre-med; however, Phys 180 is most likely help you do much better on the MCAT, seeing as in Phys 170 I don't believe you learn the basics of physics like you would in Phys 180.",
    "Just take physics 180.",
    "Psets are hard, quizzes vary, but the midterms are quite doable if you study the psets. Try to pay attention in class, even though the classroom isn't very practical for that. Honestly, if you have a strong math background, I'd suggest 180. If you hate math, then maybe this class is worth it. I don't think it's a very useful class for biology majors who are not premed... and yet we still need to take it.",
    "The class is straightforward, covering basic physics concepts. It is also not so bad in terms of workload, but beware the length of the problem sets. Examinations are fair.",
    "Only if you're Pre-Med and need physics. It's not going to prepare you for lots of Newtonian physics, but you learn a good deal about the role of physics in biology",
    "Not your typical high school physics course. This is catered for premeds in the sense that the material covered will tie into biological concepts; however, don't expect to get out of this course what you will need for mcat physics (if that is the only reason you are taking physics).",
    "I would not recommend taking this course. It's extremely difficult and requires way too much time to manage the work load that I did not have. There is also no text book to help understand concepts.",
    "A good alternative to calculus-based physics with interesting applied physical science.",
    "If you're really into biology, physics 170 is a good class, but be prepared to struggle through extremely difficult problem sets that ask about material that isn't always covered. The exams, however, are fair and Professor Mochrie is incredibly helpful, so definitely take advantage of that.",
    "I recommend! Keep in mind that the class is not purely physics; I expected just learning about mechanics and Newton's law but we ended up learning about probability and diffusion rates and mathematical modeling too. It is hard, but the material is interesting and office hours\/peer tutors are really helpful.",
    "I really didn't like this class at first, but it grew on me and I think that overall it's a decent class. Mochrie is very fair -- he learns everyone's names, is transparent about grading, and seems genuinely interested in getting feedback from us about how the course is going. The weekly quizzes sucked and could be kind of hard but the exams generally weren't bad. If you have to take physics, this is a good choice.",
    "PHYS170 will start off kind of rough, but I think its that initial shock that pushes you into gear and makes you realize the time and effort the course will take. You will learn so much and look back to the beginning of the semester and think, wow... how did I learn all of this. I would recommend this course, but keep in mind that it is very time consuming, it requires a lot of group work, and you need to use the resources they make available to you (i.e. study halls, sections, office hours, peer tutors, help sessions, review sessions, etc.)",
    "Better than 180",
    "It's a premed approach to physics, which is interesting and different from a normal university physics course. I really recommend it over PHYS 180 for budding premeds, because you get a lot of biological insight as well.",
    "I dont think i've hated a class as much as this (not even orgo 2). It's not hard, per say, but is just so frustratingly painful to sit through and spend time on. Didn't know what we were learning, why it was important, how it would help me on MCAT physics. I do not recommend this course.",
    "Yes, it's definitely good for premed students, blending biology and physics together.",
    "I would recommend it. You end up learning a lot - and its not as intimidating as people say it is. Also, if you are pre-med, you have no choice!",
    "If you're interested in biology and have to take physics, take this course. The problem sets are challenging but the exams are fair and the TFs are extremely helpful (especially Raphael!). You'll learn a lot of the physics underlying various biological processes. I came out of the course with a deeper appreciation for the physical laws that govern life.",
    "It's a slog of a class, and will require a lot of work even though it's an introductory course. I'd only take it if you're required to or really enjoy solving physics problems with a biological focus!",
    "-Section is crucial, not just for your understanding but for the completion of problem sets. -The problem sets are way harder than the either the midterms or quizzes. -Both the midterms and quizzes are fair; however if you are a frenzied quiz taker like me, you may feel a time crunch. -Seating within Teal may be a bit awkward at times because it gets hard to see the board; however, it is nice to be able to sit and talk with your friends. -You will be taught a lot of interesting concepts that are extremely hard to understand; yet, you will not be evaluated on those concepts. Rather you will be evaluated on concepts that are easier to understand. -This class will take up most of your time. THIS CLASS IS BEST TAKEN WITH A NETWORK OF FRIENDS (OR AT LEAST ALLIES) TO ALLEVIATE THE PAIN AND MAXIMIZE UNDERSTANDING!",
    "This course does a particularly great gob at incorporating the life sciences into the physics. As a premed I found this course to be very interesting and more relevant because of that. The instructors really put in a lot of thought into the course material. I am also so very impressed by how helpful the instructors and TAs are in helping us with quizzes and homework problems. Although the problem sets were difficult, they were do-able and not too bad. The many help sessions guided us through them and I ended up getting 100% for all of my psets so the grading is pretty lenient. The quizzes I found to be more challenging than I thought. Within the limited time it was difficult for me to think fast. The midterms were also really fair although the final was pretty difficult. Overall I did enjoy this class DEFINITELY TAKE IT OVER 180 if you're premed and don't have too much physics background.",
    "No. Honestly this class is cause to skip med school, it is miserable.",
    "Compared to what I've heard from my friends in PHYS 180, I think this class is the better bet. While you may be scratching your head wondering why you are learning certain things sometimes, once you really understand the material, it is really easy to deal with and tests and exams are never really a huge worry. There is some work required but if you do it, the class will go by fine.",
    "Phys 170 is physics applied to model biological systems. You start off with a few modules of classical mechanics, but quickly move into things like diffusion as a random walk, fluid dynamics, and Brownian ratchets. The practical implications of the math you do are actually really interesting, although the class often drags (especially during lecture, when you mostly just do derivations even though you're ultimately just going to use the mathematical result). This is probably the best intro physics options if you're not mathematically inclined and need to fill a physics requirement. 180 sounded pretty awful and a lot like high school with nightly homework, 200 met at a different time (why?????), and 260 is probably too much for anyone who's not a physics major.",
    "Basically take 180 if you wanna learn MCAT style physics but risk not getting as good of a grade. If you wanna get a better grade and learn some of MCAT physics and some statistical mechanics, take 170.",
    "Only take this is you need to or really, really like physics.",
    "If you have to take physics, then it's not an awful choice. The psets are very difficult. I couldn't do them on my own and went to every homework session and worked in a group. Sections were always helpful. I usually went to 2 a week because eachTA goes over different problems and materials. You have to put in effort, but overall it's not too terrible.",
    "A course with lots of connections and applications to interesting biological and natural phenomena, but not really inspiring or engaging. Might be better than 180 if you are interested in bio applications and don't want a class really reminiscent of AP physics, but don't expect too much.",
    "Physics 170 is a challenging but fair course. If you do the work, really hash out the problems, and study your best for the quizzes and midterms, I think it's possible to do well. Just make sure you do lots of practice problems so you're able to become acquainted with the difference nuances each kind of question can present and make sure you work hard on the psets because they're great practice and are worth a lot as well as your quizzes, which also serve as guidance to keeping yourself on track. Also: Contact someone from last year to get Tonima's Review Sheets! They're soooo helpful!",
    "This class is not enjoyable in the slightest. The psets are long, but if you do them with a group of people they are manageable. The midterms are fairly straightforward. If you have to take it, I'm sorry, but if you don't have to take this class then don't.",
    "Physics 170 is an alternate approach to comprehensive introductory physics. The first month is what you expect (Newton's Laws, Energy), but then the course diverges wildly, covering random walks and statistical mechanics and the like. I thought it was a refreshing change of pace, and certainly applicable to biological systems (though the models we use are pretty rudimentary). The instructors were fine, not amazing but not troubling either. I hope they move the course out of the TEAL room, which simply does not work as a teaching space for this course. If you want AP physics, go to Physics 180, but if you want a little of normal physics and lot of weird but kinda cool stuff, go to Physics 170.",
    "Physics 170 is an introduction to physics and its relationship to medicine. It's not intro physics in the traditional sense in that we learn the same concepts but in the context of medicine and biological science things. Professor Moicherie is a wonderful, helpful, and engaging professor.",
    "Take this class over 180. It is very well taught.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student. It was a bit fast paced at first, but it integrated classic physics and biological sciences very well",
    "PHYS 170....will take up your entire life. You will literally be doing physics everyday so prepare yourself! It's tedious, it's brutal at times, but you struggle it out with your friends. Also does not resemble regular asap physics at all after the first month so take 180 if you're taking the MCAT or GRE.",
    "only if you have to. good course, but why would anyone take physics unless they had to?",
    "ABSOLUTELY YES. At first it may seem overwhelming, especially with the first few modules, since the problem sets are quite difficult and the quizzes a little strange. I struggled a lot (bombed my fair share of quizzes, didn't know how to approach psets, etc) but soon learned how to do well in this course: painstakingly go through the module notes, do all the problems, really try to understand the physical and biological concepts to them, practice practice practice and yes it'll be hard, but doing well in this course is definitely do able. There are so many opportunities for you to be challenged and master the material. Go to your section. Go to sunday help sessions. Go the monday study sessions. While they take up a lot of time, they are so so helpful. Also, Prof. Mochrie is a hilarious, brilliant and great professor - get to know him. Definitely take this course!!!!",
    "Save yourself. Take 180.",
    "I took this course because I liked physics in high school and wanted a chance to learn more. I was very disappointed with this course. The material, although interesting, was too difficult to fully grasp: as a result, I found myself learning just to perform well on tests. If you are just looking to do more physics, this really isn't the course. If you are interested in probability and physics but don't want to take statistics, I suppose this might be right for you. Some of the TAs are wonderful, and the professor is clear. The material is just very convoluted.",
    "Physics 170 is a course I would recommend to students interested in biology. It was very interesting to learn.",
    "PHYS 170 is an interesting class that demonstrates some of the intersections of physics and biology. As someone who has done more traditional physics in the past, it was a refreshing course that built upon common physics concepts. The course is pretty lenient in terms of grading, so there is less pressure to perform well and more space to just focus on learning cool new stuff. The problem sets are more challenging than assessments, but they are very interesting if you take the time to understand everything and work through it. This is a good class to take if you are interested in seeing how these different sciences are interrelated. But if you are looking for a more traditional physics class, you should probably look at PHYS 180.",
    "This class has difficult material. It is hard to follow sometimes and you are given modules instead of a book, so it's hard to teach yourself. There are constant assessments, so nothing counts too much but then again, you could easily fail a few quizzes if you didn't understand the module in the 2 days it was taught. I wouldn't take this if you don't have to, but it isn't the worst premed\/bio prereq. Professor Mochrie is a fair grader in the end because he gives generous curves and wants everyone to understand as much as they can while still not feeling like it's a miserable class. He is also a very understanding person.",
    "At first I wasn't too sure it was the right choice, but eventually it turned out to be a pretty solid class with quite a few applications to real world phenomena.",
    "I wager this is a great course for pre-meds who've already taken biology and chemistry. For my part, as a philosophy major who, on the one hand, wanted to take a real physics class but, on the other, didn't have the mathematical background for PHYS 180, I spent as much time wading through the set-up of problems imported from those subjects as I did trying to solve them as physics.",
    "I think phys 170 is a decent physics course. I didn't have a lot of preparation coming into the course, and I found the material completely possible to manage. Though it required a lot of time (problem sets are challenging but fine if you do them with a group and take advantage of the TAs time), I found that the midterms and final were actually quite fine. I would encourage people to shop 180 as well. Simon Mochrie tries really hard and is a great teacher!!! Go to extra time with him.",
    "PHYS 170 is the way to go: it's a good class, and the topics are quite relevant to health and medicine. Lots of cool overlap with biochem and physio if you take them concurrently. Plus, lecture is really laid back and you get to talk\/problem solve with your friends every day. One potential downside is that this class is actually pretty tough, even if you come in with a good background in math and\/or physics. I had taken physics C in high school as well as some multivariable calculus, and I didn't find it that helpful for PHYS 170 because a lot of the material covered is pretty unconventional for a physics course: statistical mechanics, probability, some linear algebra, etc. Workload: the weekly quizzes in this class are ridiculously easythey'll lure you into a false sense of security. Problem sets, on the other hand, are ridiculously hard, but you get to work on them in groups. Midterms are pretty fair. Final exam is difficultdon't expect to be able to skate by if you don't go to lecture\/keep up with the material.",
    "Physics 170 is hard to describe. It attempts to be an introductory physics course with a focus on biological principles, but instead ends up explaining basic mechanics and kinematics in the first 1\/5 of the class, then spends the rest of the class trying to do a survey of random biological principles somehow related to physics. It attempts to teach statistics, but leaves students more confused and gives a description of many biological principles that are tough to ever relate to another class at Yale. Overall, the class has long problem sets that are more difficult than the material on the midterm, very fair midterms, a difficult final, and pretty fair grading throughout. Professor Mochrie is a very good professor, however the material of the course is not the best. If you do decide to take the course, make sure to go to sections as they are often the most helpful aspect of the class.",
    "Overall a manageable course. The first half of the course matches fairly well with standard physics topics and the latter half delves more into the biological applications of physics. As a non-premed, these applications weren't always interesting to me, but they were not too difficult to understand. The review sessions are often helpful. It helps to hear the material from different perspectives, especially for the second half of the course. The problem sets can be cumbersome, but TAs are pretty good about helping students and Professor Mochrie is very approachable. The midterms and the final are not nearly as difficult as the problem sets so don't be discouraged.",
    "PHYS 170 turned out to be a much better experience than I expected. I took AP Physics C in high school, so I was not too keen to revisit physics- but Prof. Mochrie and the TA's sincerely try to make the course a good experience, and physics an intriguing topic. They are genuinely interested in seeing you succeed (Prof. Mochrie especially) and offer an enormous array of support (Sunday quiz help sessions, Monday night study hall, office hours, section, etc.), which I found far surpassed the offerings of help from my other science courses. Also, they really listen to the mid -term feedback you give them and adjusted the course according to student preferences and dislikes. The applications to biology at first seem stretched, but then you realize that they are REAL, ESTABLISHED concepts in biology (statistical mechanics, Brownian walks, Michaelis-Menten enzyme kinetics) that will keep appearing in your other coursework - so really, you'll leave the course thankful that you had the exposure you did to these concepts, even if the math was a bit simplified. TEAL is not the most ideal classroom, but really - I chose this course over 180 because of the support and the biological applications and do not regret it.",
    "...shop both 170 and 180 and see which one you like more.",
    "I would recommend this class for students who don't really like physics and who are forced to learn it (ie. premeds) or for people who are generally interested in biology and would like to understand biological mechanisms on a physical level. I am really happy I took this class: I was debating between this and 180 (I am pre-med), and I think that I made a great choice.",
    "You probably have to take some sort of physics if you're looking at this class, so pick one that fits your career path best. This was definitely bio focused (ideal for pre-meds and bio majors) and involved a lot of topics that aren't traditional physics (i.e. stats, epidemiology, ecology, probability, differential calculus).",
    "PHYS 170 was an interesting class. It's main focus on probability-driven phenomena was atypical and eye opening. I learned a lot, and Professor Mochrie was helpful, humorous, and an overall good teacher. I would recommend 170 over 180. The curve and grading were not too bad. The psets were a bit difficult and could have been easier.",
    "If you want a formulaic class then Physic 170 is your bet. But the material is not traditional physics and likely will not be incredibly helpful in a setting outside of the class.",
    "The class is not the classical Newtonian mechanics you would expect and the teacher is erratic in his teaching methods and testing strategy, wouldn't recommend.",
    "This course is fairly time-intensive (the problem sets each week are quite long), but I definitely had a more enjoyable experience with it than I did with high school physics. I would recommend it.",
    "Overall PHYS 170 is a very well-taught class. It is an excellent choice if you are pre-med and need to fulfill the physics requirement. It is very easy to do well in this course, and the instructors are very transparent about the grading policy (in terms of providing averages and cut-off scores). The weekly quizzes, two midterms, and final exam are all very straight-forward. Some of the PSET questions were on the challenging side, but there was so much support available (Monday evening homework help sessions, Sunday evening quiz review sessions, weekly discussion sessions, and office hours) that this really wasn't a problem. The 'textbook' (a set of ten modules written by Professor Mochrie) was very clear and easy to understand. It also contained many biologically\/medically-relevant examples, which were themselves incredibly interesting and made me appreciate how relevant physics is to the field of medicine. The curriculum is a bit unusual, so don't expect to learn much 'traditional' physics. The first four units covered kinematics, newton's laws, and conservation of momentum and energy. However, after that we delved into probability, brownian motion, fluid mechanics, and rates of change. Professor Mochrie is an absolutely wonderful instructor. He was very kind and patient when when working with students, clear when answering student questions, has a fantastic sense of humor. My one word of caution is that if you have a previous background in Physics, this course will probably be too easy for you. I came in to this class having taken AP Physics C (Mechanics) in high school, and was bored out of my mind for most of the semester. I don't feel as though I learned a lot of 'traditional' Physics, and really regret not shopping PHYS 180 or PHYS 200.",
    "If you are interested in learning about the physical basis of membrane diffusion, statistical mechanics of protein conformations and SOME basic physics concepts (i.e momentum, forces), this is the class for you. If you want an in depth look at basic physics concepts, go to 180. The grading for this class is incredibly transparent (i.e he tells you your numerical score and whether or not it is an A\/A- etc). There's a lot of random procedural stuff you'll have to learn, but it all makes sense in the end!",
    "If you want to learn more about physical aspects of biology (i.e. actin polymerization, T-cell infection) definitely shop this course. Be warned that the problem sets are especially challenging, however there are many peer tutors and TA's available to help.",
    "It's the best PHYS class for students also interested in biology or premed. Its taught pretty poorly, but there's a lot of support outside of class that makes it worth your while. Ultimately not an impossible class.",
    "I think you should probably take it over 180 if you're pre-med or a biology major because the curve is nice and there is some interesting material. However, beware that the problem sets are hard and time consuming. Quizzes are okay - depends on the week. Exams 1 was tough, exam 2 was okay, final was tough...but the curve helps.",
    "PHYS 170 had a great deal of interesting material that was covered. It was difficult and required a lot of work. I recommend this class if it is one of your requirements, or if you want a less intensive introductory physics course than PHYS 180.",
    "Physics 170 is drastically different from high school AP physics. I was helped very little by my high school background. This disappointment notwithstanding, it is a really good course. I came to think of it as quantitative biology. It's very geared towards pre-meds.",
    "This course was good. Go to the monday night Pset sessions!! I couldn't do a single problem set on my own, even though I did fine in the course.",
    "PHYS 170 was a well-taught course with interesting material.",
    "This class is pre-med physics, meaning physics in biological applications. Not recommended to non premeds unless you are interested in biology.",
    "If you dislike physics, but love biology, take this course! The first few weeks were probably the most difficult (traditional physics), but if you survived, the rest was worth it. The biological aspects of this class really opened my eyes and changed my perspective of the world! You'll def learn some really fascinating and awesome stuff if you genuinely like biology or chemistry, and it was incredibly cool to approach chemical\/biological processes from the different perspective of this class. Prof Mochrie is excellent. He's dedicated to his students and very fair. Some of the TAs are also great - I recommend you shop around for one that you like. How to succeed: do the practice problems as much as you can and use the resources offered (there are a lot). Rest assured that the exams will be fair for you if you put effort into learning the material.",
    "I decided to take PHYS 170 because I wanted to learn something different than I had in high school and I was not disappointed. After covering the basic laws of motion that are a staple in any introductory physics class, we put physics in context with biological mechanisms, like diffusion. I feel like this is something I should have learned before, but I'm glad to go over it now.",
    "Take it if you're premed. Not a bad class, not really Physics-y though if that's what you're looking for. One quiz and one pset a week. Two exams. Pretty easy. Can get pset answers from section, so go to section."
