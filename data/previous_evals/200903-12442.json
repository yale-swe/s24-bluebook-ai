   "comments": [
    "A decent class that gives an overview of a few semi-mathematical ways to look at music without getting very in-depth with any of them. Frustratingly basic at times, unnecessarily cryptic at others, this class confirmed my suspicion that music is, at best, only vaguely mathematical. Not life-changing, but it did open my eyes to a few ways of thinking about music theory and composition that I hadn't ever experienced before.Also, it was a QR AND a theory requirement, which is why I took it in the first place. That was the best part.",
    "Music 309 was very interesting at times but a little unfocused. If it is taught again, Prof. Cohn will probably make some adjustments, as this was the first time it was taught. The math is not too hard but it is easy to lose lots of points on exams and not really know why.",
    "Yes, especially if they're into music. it was soooo interesting and fascinating. It's the first class where music theory really became something interesting and engaging and new.",
    "Really crazy. Music \/ math \/ what?",
    "It is genuinely challenging at times, not in a mathematical or musical sense, just in wrapping your head around the concepts and the way they're employed in music analysis. I enjoyed it for the most part and would recommend it."
