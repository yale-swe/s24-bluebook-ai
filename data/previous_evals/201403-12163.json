    "It's exactly what it says on the box: a bunch of cognitive science speakers deliver lectures to you on their various subject areas. The quality of the class varied hugely by lecturer. Basically zero work though. Very average class for me.",
    "Guest lectures once a week from professors in the core areas of Cog Sci, submit an abstract by the end of the semester detailing your senior thesis to be written in the spring. Required for cog sci seniors.",
    "Senior Colloquium was a superb course. It was great hearing from individual researchers about their respective fields. Kate is awesome. I cannot sing her praises enough. Cognitive Science at Yale is fortunate to have someone as exceptional as Kate.",
    "The cognitive science colloquium is like a series of weekly TED talks by members of the Yale faculty associated with the cognitive science program. For juniors, it can be a valuable exposure to the range of subjects available for research in the coming semesters. The workload is very low.",
    "You have to take it. Hopefully they will change the format by the time you do. It's a pretty terrible class as it is.",
    "The Junior\/Senior Colloquium was a really interesting course! Each week, a different professor who works in the area of cognitive science gives a high-level talk about his or her work. The workload is really light; only a journal article to read each week and thesis proposal at the end. You learn a lot and it's a really relaxed class!",
    "This is a required course as of now. So you have to take. That being said I would not have recommended it if it was optional. Simply too basic."
