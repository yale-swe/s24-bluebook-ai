    "Very interesting topics, but think there needs to be less emphasis on cancer to allow for the introduction of other nutrition topics. Discussion section was too big to really allow a good discussion. Overall, very good, informative, and interesting class.",
    "Course was engaging, interesting and extremely applicable to a broad range of interests: cancer, diabetes, obesity, CHD, etc. However, homeworks were more or less pointless, when the exact questions are discussed in discussion. I found the HW\/discussion overlap way too repetitive. There needs to be a distinction, or get rid of the HW and base the grading all on discussion.",
    "It is a very good course linking nutrition, diet and disease. The emphasis of biochemistry is a highlight.",
    "It was a nice introductory class for nutrition.",
    "Excellent review of contemporary nutrition topics and review of pertinent literature. Dr. Mayne does a wonderful job.",
    "Very good course. Dr. Mayne knows her stuff and is very receptive.",
    "I really enjoyed this course- it provided me with a great background for studying chronic diseases and supplemented knowledge gained in other courses, such as Principles of Epidemiology. Throughout the semester, we learned of various chronic diseases and nutritional risk factors which will undoubtedly help me in a future in public health\/epidemiology.",
    "This was a fantastic course. It was an in depth look a the state of the science on the most common chronic diseases and nutrition. It gave both the biological and epidemiological perspective of the nutrition-chronic disease relationship. It was also a nice balance of lecture and discussion, with a weekly discussion section. I enjoyed the discussion sections that included smaller group discussions as it gave more opportunity to dig deeper at the issues instead of just scratching the surface.",
    "The course gave a great overview of the current knowledge regarding the complex relationship between nutrition and CD. Dr. Mayne did a great job of presenting the complexities, inconsistencies and limitations of research\/studies in this area. Overall I felt the course offered a comprehensive picture of the current landscape in nutritional and chronic disease epidemiology.",
    "The course was really interesting. I didn't find that the reading added much to the course, however. The homework assignments also seemed like busy work, but they did force us to think more deeply about what was going on.",
    "Overall, I enjoyed this class and would recommend it for students interested in the nutrional aspects of chronic diseases. The lectures covered a wide variety of disease and nutrional assessments methods that I found to be useful in understanding research articles. The lectures also provided a basic understanding of disease etiology that was valuable.",
    "Lectures were engaging and the nutrition topics covered were timely and relevant. Sections would have been more engaging if they were smaller but this was not possible due to scheduling constraints. I think that curving the midterm exam downward due to the high average deters collaboration between students and makes it difficult for individual students to accurately gauge their performance in the class (because a 90% does not necessarily translate into a top mark).",
    "This course was excellent. The topics covered were very relevant and interesting to anyone wanting to know more about nutrition and chronic disease. I liked the basic science approach that broadened into the public health ramifications as the semester progressed. The last two lectures on food policy and supplements were particularly interesting. I enjoyed doing the self-nutritional analysis.",
    "The course load is reasonable. The lectures are fascinating and the instructor is an excellent lecturer. The class section allows students to engage and interact with one another.",
    "Excellent introduction to public health nutrition. I felt as though I attained a sound introductory-level exposure to the ways in which nutrients affect health and disease, as well as some of the policy-level implications of these mechanisms.",
    "Lectures were interesting and relevant to all that we do.",
    "Most interesting\/practical course I have taken in school.Susan Mayne was a wonderful instructor",
    "Very informative"

    "Hannah was wonderful! Extremely helpful, knowledgeable, and it is apparent that she cares about this topic deeply. Also her solid knowledge of epidemiology was very helpful as a resource.",
    "Hannah-- Was great! Dr. Mayne gave her the responsibility of conducting discussions almost solo, and she did a really nice job.",
    "Hannah Arem was a great TA. She was very knowledgeable and helpful to the class. She was helpful and available to meet outside of class. Her background in nutrition also helped us in understanding the course material.",
    "Hannah Artem is good TA. Youcan tell she is very interested in the topics discussed in class and is building her knowledge base for the state of the science for these various topics. She could improve her ability to lead a discussion section a little bit, though in all honesty, it is really hard to lead a discussion with 20-30 people. She was sensitive to the needs of the students and was very responsive.",
    "Very good. Approachable and knowledgeable in subject matter.",
    "Hannah did a good job teaching weekly sections. Although, I would have liked discussion sections to be smaller scheduling at the beginning of the semester was a problem. I particularly enjoyed the weekly assignments that compared study designs. I found this exercise informative, and it reinforced the importance of study design and other topics covered in Epi I and bio statistics.",
    "Hannah was great. Very responsive to emails, helpful, and knowledgeable.",
    "The TA was Hannah. She taught our discussions. I thought that she did a good job in holding discussion classes. She also had additional explanations of the subject matter to add from her research experience as well as slides that went over key points in our hw discussions. I would recommend smaller group discussions for next time because it was hard to discuss topics in large groups.",
    "The TA organized sections well, despite their large size.",
    "Hannah was a good discussion leader and a thorough grader. I always appreciated her comments on homework as well as her quick responses to questions via email. A great TA.",

    "Definitely would recommend it! Very useful and pertinent class for anyone interested in nutrition!",
    "This is a perfect nutrition course at the level between beginners and medium. Certainly I would recommend it to any student interested in nutrition biomedical sciences.",
    "It is recommendable to students who are interested in nutrition.",
    "Great course for someone interested in nutrition, particularly in relation to cancer. Dr. Mayne knows her stuff.",
    "I think this is a great course, especially for CDE students. I would recommend it to anyone interested in learning more about nutrition in the role of chronic disease.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student! If you have any interests in nutrition - take this course! I learned so much throughout the semester and gained a great base for understanding current issues in nutrition research and policy developments (in regards to dietary guidelines and soda tax alike). Great course!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone who is interested in pursuing research in nutrition and\/or chronic disease epidemiology.",
    "This class is definitely worth taking. The homework assignments can be tedious, but it's all worth it in the end.",
    "This course was an introduction to the various chronic diseases that are of public health importance today with an emphasis on nutrition and moderation of nutritional components. I would recommend this course to students who have an interest in nutritional influences on chronic diseases.",
    "This course was sointeresting! I would say it is a look into the biology of chronic disease development through nutrition and the public health implications of these trends. I would highly recommend it to students because it is relevant to everyone- it will make you rethink your eating habits as well as question what you read about in the media regarding nutrition!",
    "This is a fantastic course to take especially for those who are interested in nutrition and chronic disease epidemiology.",
    "I would highly recommend this class for anyone who is interested in nutrition. If you're interested in a policy-oriented class, Brownell's is probably better; however, this course provides an important understanding of hownutrients act in the body, a general overview of current scientific evidence, and an introduction to the complex world of food and obesity policy. It definitely has been one of my favorite courses at YSPH thus far!",
    "Must take! the best course that is offered in my opinion"
