    "This was a phenomenal course. We explored the development of black identity in the Americas over centuries of literature that in various ways captured black American lives. Professor Ramirez encourages great dialogue in her seminars, so I learned how to participate constructively in that setting. I also improved my writing skills.",
    "I learned a lot about how complicated the Black identity is throughout Latin America (including the US).",
    "A better ability to connect historical phenomena with cultural products\/artifacts",
    "I learned how to better understand the impact that slavery has had on my current understanding of blackness in my family. The skill I would say I grew most in is this reflexivity, an ability to be able to look at my own positionality and understand how it fits into a larger narrative.",
    "I was able to more critically engage with the history and place of blackness in influencing and creating certain aspects of Latin American culture society politics and economy.",
    "This class pushed me beyond my familiarity with race. Thinking about the different nuances of Latin American culture and gender and performance allowed me to break past my already preconceived notions of race and ethnicity.",
    "In this course, I learned how to look for forgotten, misremembered, and suppressed histories, into the present. I learned how Blackness is refracted in Latin American and Latinx culture; how race is simultaneously everywhere, and forced to the margins, of cultural, political, social, and economic life in the American continents--including the U.S., in a big way. For example, I learned how Atlantic slavery became the (unspoken) framework by which whites in the post\/colonial Americas imagined their own freedom. We began the class by making a list of all the things that blackness has signified--foreignness, overdetermined physicality, servility etc--and spent the rest of the course taking a deep dive into what exactly each phrase means. On another level, I learned a great deal about historiography, too: how narratives about the past are constructed; how textual neutrality gets built out of omission, etc. As a senior in an interdisciplinary major, I could not have asked for a more helpful class in teaching me how to do cross-genre academic work that never loses sight of a rigorous politics."

   "comments": [
    "It's an excellent course. I'm thinking through the semester and there's nothing I would change.",
    "The course felt a bit too concentrated on the DR at times, which made sense because it is the subject of research for the professor. I would've liked a more branched out view of the concepts. Additionally, the way class discussions were run sometimes made me feel less motivated to participate. There were a lot of people for a seminar style class and some people would speak for 3-4 minutes at a time without stopping, which made my 1 or 2 sentence responses seem useless. It felt catered to ER&M majors despite advertising openness to a diversity of academic interests.",
    "Great syllabus, great teaching. Just needs to be taught again!",
    "As this course felt highly personal and required much emotional\/academic labor on my part, I would have like to have had more time for our personal narratives to be shared as a class.",
    "The course was well designed and led by the professor. I think that the only thing is that there were too many people.",
    "I enjoyed the readings. They were very insightful and entertaining. With that being said, it was hard to devote the necessary time to the readings administered during class. The discussions were fruitful, which meant often times they had to be cut short in order to make sure we addressed the other topics.",
    "Yale needs more courses like this: Its not that it should have them, but that the school as an institution needs them. The material we read and watched were a jumping-off point for far-ranging and far-reaching discussions: I cannot stress enough how important I find it to be, to have an international scope such as that offered in this course. One of the many things that I realized over the course of this class, was my own vast ignorance of political and racial idioms that are not centered around the United Statesand how crippling this can be when trying to countenance a world that, well, is situated on a global scale. This class also teaches how utterly necessary it is to have courses on Latin America and other places on the (neo\/post)colonial periphery: places that are too often ignored, or at best added at the end of classes, as if there is no philosophy or art or political practice that comes from the Latin American margins but only ever serves as a second-hand example of what happens in Europe and the United States. Students at an institution that sees itself as part of the fabric of the globe, need to engage with that globe; with the underbelly of that globe; with the frayed edges of that globeedges that have been made frayed by the powers at the center. Especially as an American Studies major, I think that courses that treat the U.S. with its neighboring countries--and continents--is so important. Prof. Ramrez made the course into a community of friends, too: it was a joy to come to seminar. I would not change a thing about it."

   "comments": [
    "Absolutely. If you are interested in the history of black people in the Americas, black identity and experience in general, Latin America, engaging readings, and generally a great class take this course!",
    "Absolutely! The class helped shatter my fallacious beliefs about history instilled in me by Western education and helped me engage and appreciate silenced narratives of freedom, power, violence, and resilience. exceptional class. must take.",
    "I would recommend this course with warnings. You'll learn a lot but it takes a significant amount of work. Readings are heavy, both because they are long and emotionally taxing at times. Class discussions were dominated by a few ER&M majors in the class and the professor didn't seem to care much for this occurrence. You'll learn a lot of unique and interesting things, and your view of Blackness and Latin America will be challenged, whether or not you identify as Black and\/or Latinx. It's worth the work but can be frustrating at times when balancing the work and trying to figure out how to navigate the class discussions.",
    "Great class, interesting subject. Accessible for all and challenging for those familiar.",
    "I absolutely recommend this class- It's a wonderfully informative and multifaceted course that helps you break out of US-centric frameworks of analyzing Blackness. The material was challenging but the workload was very manageable. Classes like this one are extremely important for the time we are living in.",
    "Absolutely, I would recommend this class to anyone, especially people who are trying to make sense of their own narrative.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. The readings were very engaging and the class was structured in such a way that we actually discussed most of them.",
    "Yes, definitely. We all should learn about the histories that have been kept form us, erased and silenced. This is an essential course in developing the critical eye that a liberal arts education attempts give students.",
    "I absolutely would! It was fun and entertaining while simultaneously mentally stimulating and challenging. The culture of the class allowed people to express themselves freely, which made space for proper debates that opened the opportunity for people to experience completely different perspectives.",
    "Yes. This is an important course with a great reading list.",
    "A mind blowing course. The title of the course really says it all. If any of the words in the course title interest you, take this course. The readings are interesting. The essay prompts are engaging, and the essays were fun to write. Professor Ramirez is amazing, and she is so knowledge and passionate about the subject, it made every class session a pleasure.",
    "Yes, yes, yes: take the course. You learn how Blackness is refracted in Latin American and Latinx culture; how race is simultaneously everywhere, and forced to the margins, of cultural, political, social, and economic life in the American continents--including the U.S., in a big way. It is an extremely important course, and it is a shame that there are not more like it. Prof. Ramrez makes the classroom into a community of friends: this is a rare seminar in which you don't have to pretend to be someone you're not."
