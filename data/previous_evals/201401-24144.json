    "I loved this course. It provided enough theory and structure to not feel intimidated by the project assignments but enough free-range to problem solve and learn from real-world challenges.",
    "Strengths: real world training, group work, chance to give feedback during our last class, final presentation, interaction with communities(weakness: textbook)",
    "Very good, practical, hands on experience.",
    "The course is very interesting and well-structured, and also allows students to pursue independent interests.",
    "Good course. There was too much class time for a practicum. There should be less class time. That time would be better spent allowing students to work on their project. Professor and TA were committed and very kind.",
    "more engaging reading material",
    "so great! love the hands-on experience.",
    "This is a great opportunity to do a project with a community organization. I was truly lucky to have the opportunity to use the skills I learned in biostats and applied analytic methods in epidemiology (aamie) in order to help a real organization. You get the opportunity to network with the community and gain experience working in a group project.Ways to improve: Make the class 1 hour instead of 2 hours. The first hour can be for teaching and the second hour should be for group work. Many of the things that were taught in class could have been condensed into one hour.",
    "Much workload as a team.",
    "Great opportunity to connect students to outside organizations; nice having a class that is practice-based rather than homework and exam based; the work load was heavy in the beginning and again at the end which is understandable due to the structure of the course and limited time to get the projects done; a different book is recommended and shorter reading assignments; the lectures with the TAs about how to treat each other and to deal with snooty emails from group members made me feel like I was in elementary school- I think this time could have been better utilized just by giving the groups more classroom time to work on our projects",
    "It's a great course but with a lot of workload",
    "We learned a lot of good methods and skills for working with community organizations, however, a lot of what we learned was not relevant to each of our projects."

Regardless of this, Debbie did all she could in order to be receptive to the class's feedback.",
    "Instructor: Debbie Lee Humphries \u00a0Really nice and kind.",
    "Instructor: Debbie Lee Humphries \u00a0Incredibly knowledgeable and always available for meeting one-on-one; not that great at coming up with engaging class lectures- I think this could be improved with a different book and better material to work with; did a good job trying to centralize the lectures given that every group was doing something different",

If you are not interested in your project of your team doesn't get along well..then your experience won't be the best. Debbie does a great job at teaching, over sometimes the lectures can feel way too long. This is why I recommend Debbie teach less and have more groupwork time. In all. I only recommend this course if you are truly interested in the projects.",
