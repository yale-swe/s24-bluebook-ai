   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in addiction-related processes or to anyone who plans to do clinical work.",
    "This course is notable in that it is very engaging and requires very little pointless work. Certainly for someone interested in this topic, it is a good course for obtaining an overview of the literature, with many opportunities to critically engage in the current debates in the field, both during class discussions and more formally in debates. Virtually everyone seems to find the instructor super cool and interesting, and she is certainly both knowledgeable and available throughout. It's a very dynamic course and likely to improve over time as the professor works out the kinks of presenting an entire field in one semester.",
    "I would note that it is a helpful overview for a field that many students might not otherwise have an opportunity to study. The information is highly relevant for training in clinical psychology as well as being an informed member of society. The classes are engaging and informative and the projects are helpful for professional development and personal insight.",
    "Yes, I would recommend the course."

   "comments": [
    "This course was extremely useful and contributed to my thinking about my research as well as my clinical work.",
    "It's fair to say that understanding substance use disorders is relevant to anyone studying any aspect of psychiatry since they are often prevalent in other clinical populations. I wouldn't say that it directly contributed to my dissertation or research, but it is always useful to understand a similar field and draw insight from comparison.",
    "This course gave me background in a field of research with which I previously had very little contact. It was very useful for me to deepen my familiarity with addictions as they are so highly comorbid with other mental illnesses. This course therefore filled in a gap in my training that could have potentially gone unfilled."
