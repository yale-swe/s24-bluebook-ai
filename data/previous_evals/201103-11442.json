   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this class! It is one of those classes you take and then want to be a HSHM major. Don't let this class intimidate you. It's not easy, but it is really eye-opening.",
    "If the class were to narrow its focus somewhat, particularly if it just focused on climate change-related catastrophes, then yes. Otherwise, you'll find it interesting at times and confusing at others.",
    "Take it. Awesome historical perspective on the earth sciences that you wouldn't be exposed to otherwise. Super chill format (but there's a lot of reading). One small paper, one midterm, and the final, in addition to weekly section.",
    "No I wouldn't recommend it - there are fifty thousand other HSHM courses that are way more interesting. If you're interested in current catastrophes, we only get to real issues today in the last 2-3 weeks of the course. I've heard that Natural Disasters is a better course. Also, the grading is not lenient so beware. Oh, and the readings are boring (except for like 2 of them).",
    "This course was very interesting. Although it started off kind of slowly, it definitely picked up. The professor is an engaging lecturer and the material is presented very well.",
    "Honestly, I took this course because the title sounded intriguing. But from the day after shopping period ended, I agonized over what a mistake I made. Each week just got progressively more boring and obscure. We studied the most random things just fisheries and the peak oil crisis. If this interests you, then take it. But don't go in thinking like I did that you're going to delve deeply into the highly exciting debate over global warming or eugenics. That literally all occurs within a week, and then it's back to debating about convection currents. The midterm and final were just okay, honestly probably pretty fair, but the questions are pretty random, just like the eclectic mix of people this class attracted. Just be careful you know what you're getting yourself into by taking this course. One fact: the first day about 70 kids showed, by the third class, there were only 20 kids, and I bet about 10 of them just needed the credit.",
    "The course is essentially the history of a group of scientific ideas. The specific theories and events discussed are less important than the dialogues surrounding them. It is a very useful course for understanding the evolution of scientific ideas, placing modern debates in perspective, and understanding how past debates have been settled. I highly recommend it for HSHM majors.",
    "Great class. Very interesting survey of conflict in the earth sciences from the 18th century up until now. I really enjoyed it.",
    "An intro to history of the earth sciences -- make no mistake, this is a history of science class. That was a very new subject for me and at times could be a confusing one. The readings were sometimes fascinating and at times seemed very advanced \/ too high-level (history of science journal articles). But make sure to keep on top of the reading as there is a fair amount of it. Prof. Rankin is a very nice fellow as was our TA Rachel. This was the course's first year and I think it will likely improve in future years. The connection to climate change at times felt a bit uncertain, and there is a whole unit on ecology -- though interesting, it seemed to deviate a bit from the theme of the course as awhole (\"catastrophes\"). If you're interested in trying out history of sci., this seems like a good way. If you're interested in the global warming angle, approach this class with the understanding that (as it was taught this yr) it takes a while to get there, and if you already know a lot about it, the relevant unit may not be earth-shattering. But overall, an interesting, at times thought-provoking course with a young professor that has all the makings of a great professor!",
    "This course is less of a survey history of the Earth sciences and more of an investigation of the social context of the Earth sciences, and of science in general. The course is broken into four units, each focusing on a specific debate or issue in Earth science and the relationship of that issue to other aspects of society, such as religion, capitalism, or politics. The reading for this course is pretty standard for a history course: some readings can be skimmed while others should be read and understood fully. There's no large writing assignment in this course, but the midterm and final both cover substantial material, so be prepared to study quite a bit for those.",
    "This class had really fresh and interesting themes. The lectures were clear and informative. Overall, it was a fascinating course."
