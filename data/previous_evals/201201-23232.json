   "comments": [
    "This class is compulsory, as it should be. The reading matches well with that of the graduate (and undergraduate) reading list. The workload was very heavy: as much as 1000 lines a week, at times.",
    "It's a good way to force yourself to read a lot of Latin. The pace of the class and reading load can get a little taxing.",
    "I would certainly recommend it simply for the amount of reading it forces you to do - you'll get in touch with texts you certainly wouldn't otherwise, and it allows you to gain a wide perspective over the development of Latin literature that is invaluable for tracing patterns and trends in genre, style etc. It is, however, hard to cope with conceptually, as well as a significant amount of work (translating around 200 lines a day was the average for me) - so it is not to be undertaken lightly!",
    "Yes, I would recommend this class to another student. I would let him or her know that it is challenging and requires a great deal of work, but that the payoff is fully worth the time and effort required.I would summarize it as a course in which one reads a good deal of material from the Latin canonical authors. Coming out of this class, one will have a much broader perspective on Latin authorship, Latin style and syntax, and Latin themes and genres. Also, through the reading of secondary literature, one will also gain insight into scholarly debates and questions surrounding these various texts and writers."

   "comments": [
    "It gave me an excellent outline of the scope of Latin literature and, I believe, this will provide an invaluable foundation for my future career in Classics. It will, however, have to be supplemented significantly by my own work in addition - it should be said that the course does not stand alone, but provides an excellent jumping off point for further personal study.",
    "I now feel as though I have a much broader range of primary source material with which to think about, frame, and answer the various questions that drive my research.Similarly, I have knowledge of where to turn (commentaries, articles) for initial questions that come up when reading particular authors.In the long run, I suspect that this class, through the broad foundations it has set, will pay tremendous dividends as I continue my studies of Latin literature."
