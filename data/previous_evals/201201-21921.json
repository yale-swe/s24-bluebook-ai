    "This is a cool class for playwrights. It's not a huge amount of work, and it allows you to fine tune dialogue in very short batches, while allowing you to try new things every week.I would recommend really trying to attend rehearsals for your scenes if you can. It's very helpful.",
    "This has been one of, if not my favorite class at Yale this year. Taking the class as a director, I was pushed every other week to bring in a complete, rehearsed scene. In that regard, it is excellent training. Also, because the class is so small you get to form a very strong bond with your classmates, which is bolstered by the group assignment. This class is certainly time consuming for a theater class, but lots of fun. The more work you put into it, the more you will get out.",
    "Theater Studies 324 is invaluable if you're a director and want the chance to direct lots of short scenes, or if you're a playwright and want to see your work staged. It's sometimes stressful, because there's a scene due every week, but it teaches you an abusrd amount about theater, and Toni Dorfman is incredible. If you're serious about directing or playwriting...take it. No question.",
    "This course is one of the most practical courses offered at Yale\u0097the practice and critique opportunities are invaluable, and you get to learn a lot from others in the class. As a director, you'll direct nine two-page scenes over the course of the semester. Finding actors can be difficult, so I don't recommend taking it in conjunction with another directing course.",
    "There is a lot of work\/creative thinking that has to be done outside the classroom. For directors and playwrights a lot of this class is outside the classroom, and it's a big commitment. However it's completely worth the work, you learn a lot and bond with the other students in the class, and everyone's work gets much stronger and more daring over the course of the semester."
