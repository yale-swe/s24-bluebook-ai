    "I would recommend this class to a fellow student. Not too bad work load- 1 midterm, and 1 final paper. Midterm requires a lot of studying but is doable, and the final paper is on any UN-related topic of our choice. Krasno is truly an expert on the subject matter and you'll learn a lot.",
    "I would definitely recommend it if you re interested in the subject",
    "A good class if you want to learn about the basics of the United Nations. The material isn't 100% fascinating and can sometimes be dry, but it's good knowledge to have!",
    "Yes, it's a good 5th class to take.",
    "No. Not interesting and you're never going to remember everything. No one does the reading since it's so dull. The simulation was horrible even though Krasno thought it'd be fun...don't take it. Better IR classes out there.",
    "Take it! Prof. Krasno is amazing.",
    "Definitely, take it. But it can be slow at times.",
    "I enjoyed it, a lot can be learned if you commit to doing the reading and paying attention in class. However, sometimes it can be frustrating when Prof. Krasno spends a lot of time in class summarizing the readings, as IF you HAVE done the reading, it would be preferable to discuss it rather than summarize it.",
    "Summary: A good introduction to the UN and collective security. I would recommend it."
