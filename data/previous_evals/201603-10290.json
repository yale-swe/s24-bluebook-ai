   "comments": [
    "I learned to analyze art critically, and to write persuasive essays by explaining my thinking in a nuanced and complex way.",
    "I had never taken anything close to an art history class before, so I definitely learned critical skills about art through this course. But I think what I have appreciated more about this course is the exposure to African cultures that I have received and the critical eye I take towards Western representations or commentary on Africa.",
    "I gained a better understanding of the complexities of African art. I learned how to identify and comprehend art from different people groups.",
    "By taking this course, I gained a lot of insight into the foul play involved in Western exhibition practices as well as the breadth of art production on the African continent.",
    "I learned many things about art and Africa.",
    "In this class, I learned to approach art as a representation of culture. Professor James provided a comprehensive introduction to african Art, about which I had learned nearly nothing prior to this class. She highlighted distinct cultures, practices, and peoples, and provided thorough yet rapid introduction to each. My writing improved significantly; Professor James gave substantial feedback and constructive criticism on both content and mechanics. In addition, my speaking skills improved in both class participation and formal presentation.",
    "From this class I gained the ability to approach art critically, learn to assess the aesthetic qualities of art with a level eye, and acknowledge the tangible impacts of the creative on everyday life",
    "The seminar covered many topics of interest, giving us an extensive background on African art throughout history as well as posing weekly philosophical questions to keep in mind as we traverse through the dense and politicized territory that is necessary to dissect.",
    "I developed a basic knowledge of the African arts. Though we did not delve too deeply into one specific idea or concept in the course, it was very comprehensive and I was able to learn about many different types of cultures and art forms.",
    "I gained an understanding of the field of Art History in general. I also developed my ability to contextualize art and artifacts in relation to their historical situations.",
    "I learned an immense amount from this course that I would have never anticipated. This class not only taught me about African Art and culture but so many larger ideas as well. From discussions about appropriation, to the consequences of separating Egyptian art form African art to the atrocities of the Belgian Congo to FGM, this class taught me how to look at and think about larger ideas and how they fit into our lives today. It has made me aware of the western sense that we so often look through and taught me how to step away from it in order to gain a deeper understanding and appreciation of what I was looking at and both the meaning and the baggage that that object or idea carried."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I think the best part of this class was the debate and conversation set-up that it held half of our meetings. The level of participation and student drive is high in this class, and that is clearly displayed in these debates. Additionally I really loved the presentations each student had to do on one African artwork. I think that the textbook reading was in a large part unnecessary. The blog post aspect of this course seemed to fall by the wayside, but this was because we would discuss the African Studies events in class, face to face.",
    "The strengths of this course were the lecture style (they were not boring), students were able to participate a lot, and the critical eye that we were taught to use when we looked at African art that was set in a western narrative. I also enjoyed going to YUAG, the British Arts Center, and the MET to see traditional and modern African art. One of the weakness is that there was not enough time to really cover a lot of different spaces in Africa, which is a given because the continent is so huge and dense with cultures. For example we focused mostly on west and central Africa, Ethiopia, and Northern Africa.",
    "The course material was very engaging although one issue I had was that the material in the readings did not always align with the class lectures, especially near the end of the term. I felt as though it was harder to grasp the material because we often read about one culture in the textbook and then addressed completely different cultures in class, which made it really hard to keep all of the information straight.",
    "This course was very informative however as the semester came to an end many of the assignments piled up.",
    "While I believe the quantity of material covered was a strength of the class, this may also have been a weakness. We studied many different subjects, and Professor James spoke about each very well, but we didn't do much beyond textbook reading to familiarize ourselves with these cultures. More detailed reading may have been more beneficial. The strengths of the class included student participation and group exercises, like debates and presentations. These provided an in depth and collaborative experience for all members of the class.",
    "My strengths came through the research papers. I enjoyed writing the papers because they allowed me to research further into an area of my choice. My weakness in the class was that I did not participate as much as I should have.",
    "This class was great because of the diversity of assignments. We had papers, presentations, and debates which all help with my learning in different ways.",
    "It was amazing I would not change a thing."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, this is the best class to receive for information on both art and african american studies.",
    "Absolutely, I think it is an amazing way to learn more about African cultures. It is also an awesome way to critique the Western art world. Both sides to this course have been eye opening and I would recommend the experience to anyone I meet.",
    "This course has an amazing professor and if you are African, of the African diaspora, or are interested in African and its arts, you should really take this class. It will not only open your eyes to how incorrectly \"traditional\" African art has been framed in the west, but it will connect you to very alive and dynamic modern African artists. You will learn to see African art, and I feel like it's helped me with seeing broader African issues, in a new way.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to any students who are interested in learning about African Arts and Cultures, although I would warn the student that the course really is limited to focusing on African culture through art forms. The course is a lot of work, and I think if students are willing to dedicate a lot of time to the class, they will get a lot out of it.",
    "I would eagerly recommend this class to another student.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to anyfrueshman interested in African-American Studies of Art History.",
    "I would absolutely recommend it. It provided insight into a different culture and any course that manages to do that is one worth taking. In addition, the class atmosphere was very supportive and conducive to positive learning.",
    "I would recommend this course without hesitation. I throughly enjoyed this course and have learned so much. African Art and Culture is not simply about being able to identify a Yoruba mask or a Nisiki figure, but rather it is about the larger ideas and topics covered that are not only applicable in the art world but in your own life the more you look. Once your eyes have been opened, it is impossibly not to see the impact that this class has on the way one looks at the world. From the beginning you are challenged to step out of your comfort zone of looking at things through one lens and rather, see that there are many other ways to interpret and value art and culture."
