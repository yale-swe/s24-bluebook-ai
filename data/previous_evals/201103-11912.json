    "Excellent class. Interesting readings (1 book\/2 class sessions + maybe a few shorter articles each week) and great discussion. 250-word precis due each week before class provides an opportunity to engage with texts, which enhances classroom discussion, and never felt like a burden. Professor Brotherton is very articulate and helpful.",
    "Great class. take it with Brotherton. One of my most organized\/engaging professors.",
    "This class is fantastic. Prof. Brotherton is very good at balancing his own contributions with class discussion. It was a bit frustrating to have the number of graduate students we did in the class, as they tended to dominate conversation, but Prof. Brotherton was very aware of this and will probably not allow such a large proportion in the future. Take it! Assignments in term: weekly reading response, presentation, final paper.",
    "This class was very interesting, mainly because of the readings. The presence of the grad students was detrimental, however, for they tended to dominate class discussion with theory-based speeches above the undergrads' level of understanding. Brotherton has mentioned that he will be separating the grad and undergrads when he holds this class again. I'd recommend this seminar. Topics covered: China's one child policy, plastic surgery in Brazil, the role of race in modern genetic research, sex tourism in Cuba and the Dominican Republic. Grading: weekly short reading responses, one class presentation, one long final research paper (14 pages). The work load was very manageable. Again, the readings were the highlight of the course for me.",
    "Sure. You read books and write quick responses for each week, in addition to a presentation and a paper. Sean's great -- smart, accessible, really cares about his students, but, one caveat, beware a lot of very theoretical material.",
    "I liked the content of this course for the most part, although I was disappointed in the voyeuristic nature of it. We seemed to sort of flit from country to country, touching on vastly different issues surrounding the body. This made it feel like a bit of a weird survey-ish course, though the issues we studied certainly weren't treated like they would be in such a course.This class would be far better were it just an undergrad class, which I think is the plan in the future, so I recommend it.",
    "If you are interested in key concept is anthropology, then go for it!"
