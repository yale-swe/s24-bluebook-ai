    "Would recommend",
    "Yes, I would recommend it.",
    "Directed Studies is definitely not for those on the fence about taking it, mainly because it's a lot of work to do if you feel only lukewarm about it. However, I loved my time in this program, and at the end of the semester I feel like I have a genuine grasp on everything we've covered, which is an incredible feeling.",
    "I would certainly recommend DS, especially H&P. I would warn though, that this is just an introduction. It is a brief glimpse at the amazing thinkers and things that have moved western civilization from its ancient roots to where it stands today.",
    "This is an incredible class. The DS program itself is challenging, yet structured, a large amount of reading, yet manageable. The fall H&P course follows some of the greatest historians and fundametal political thinkers of the Western tradition. If you find yourself in Professor Renaud's section, do not switch out! He understands his students- structuring discussions that revolve around small group work that present their thoughts to the wider audience of the class. This style of discussion allows for everyone to be involved- including those ready and willing to participate and those who might find the small group work conducive to a better understanding of the discussion posed. Professor Renaud is a fair grader and always gave helpful feedback at office hours and on papers. Overall, Directed Studies is an excellent program in that it does not pretend to be something it is not. It is very clear that this is an introduction to the western tradition, which to some can seem to be very disclusive. Yet I feel better prepared now to approach the great traditions of so many other unique cultures. Professor Renaud also suggested outside reading and courses to go beyond the tradition that DS explores. Take DS and if you can Professor Renaud's section! Highly recommended.",
    "This class is a fast look through some of the most influential historical and political works of the Western Cannon, from the ancient world to the Middle Ages. More than making me an expert in one specific text, I feel like this class has helped me develop the skills of analyzing history and has made me think about overarching historical and political trends. For someone seeking that kind of experience, I would recommend the class. I would not recommend the class to anyone looking to go super in depth on any one author.",
    "Directed Studies: Historical and Political thought is an intensive immersion into some of the foundations of history and politics from the Western world. I would recommend it to others student, however, only those that are capable and interested.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student who is very interested in ancient history and politics as recorded by the historians of the time.",
    "I would indeed recommend this course to another student, particularly any student with an interest in how historical and political thought has affected the Western world and its traditional perspectives.",
    "Professor Renaud was absolutely wonderful - he was always available during office hours or after class to discuss ideas, provided a very balanced view of the often subjective humanities, and facilitated discussions without taking them over. He is very knowledgeable and insightful. H&P is a very broad, sometimes slightly disjointed course, but at certain points (i.e. Machiavelli responding to Livy) it all comes together.",
    "If you have the chance, take it! You won't have any regrets.",
    "Yes! DS Fall H&P is awesome! I feel like I can take over the world now, given that I know how all of the ancient rulers did so. A truly foundational way to begin studies in the humanities and Global Affairs.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. I really enjoyed the class because it gave me a look at history I knew from a largely first-person account. These authors are foundational in creating the world's history as we know it today, and reading them is important to understand how our perceptions of the past have formed over time."
