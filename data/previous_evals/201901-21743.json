And Krystyna is the most joyful person I've met in my life, and that joy spreads to others.",

    "Strengths: Collaborative classroom environment, clever and thoughtful homework assignments, emphasis on learning from rather than punishing mistakes, occasional polish-speaking guests invited to class, exposure to Polish history, culture, and media. Weaknesses: None, in my opinion. A perfectly taught and structured Polish class."
