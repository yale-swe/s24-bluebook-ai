   "comments": [
    "Take it if you enjoy working with kids. You really become a part of the preschool environment, tying shoes, putting on jackets, and helping out in every way. It's a lot of fun.",
    "Try to take it! Best class ever. The reading is manageable, you get to see a lot of videos about kids or babies in lecture, and in the 30 min section after lecture you talk about your experiences with the kids (you spend 3 hours a week observing kids at a daycare center). I had a blast with the kids. Also, it fulfills a WR cred!",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. It's hard to get into, and is basically limited to seniors (in any major, not just psychology). You don't need a strong psychology background to understand the different lectures and topics, so I would really recommend it to any senior. This was unlike any class I have ever taken, and I felt that I learned so much about child development. The daycare visits were my favorite aspect of the class, and I loved going each week even though it was a pretty big time commitment. Also, the work load is a lot, but it's definitely manageable. This class it not a gut, so don't take it if you just want an easy class as a senior. There are weekly journals on your daycare visits (3-4 pages) and then a 10 page final paper - a lot of writing.",
    "if you like babies, observe at EBJ with the Ones. i loved my experience there.",
    "I would definitely recommend taking this course if you are interested in learning about child development, or would enjoy the field placement",
    "Loved it!! The practicum was a great learning experience and an eye-opener. The professors are great as well!!",
    "This course has a weekly 3 hour practicum at a day care center to observe classrooms consisting of infants, 2-3 year olds, or 4-5 year olds (your choice). Four journal entries of 3-5 pages long each is required, along with a 10-15 paper integrating reading materials and practicum observations. Lectures are given by different people every week (guest lecturers) and are people who are very close to the specific area of child development that they discuss. It is not an intellectually challenging class per se, but there is a lot of practical and interesting information to learn that\u0092ll give you a greater appreciation of how important early childhood education is, and what constitutes effective parenting\/teaching versus ineffective parenting\/teaching.",
    "Meh, not really. I was frustrated by this class. The readings were mediocre, and the class time itself was generally just dry powerpoints delivered by mediocre presenters summarizing the material, and then during the final 20 minutes of class, you meet with other people at your practicum site to discuss a couple of questions.. Pretty much every student was on her laptop (I include myself in this trend).On the other hand, there really isn't much work, it requires almost no thinking, and you get to play with little kids once a week (though it's a bit of a ride to most of the placement sites). However, because you don't generally get to talk with the teachers much (which is totally understandable - the teachers are incredibly busy), you don't actually have a great sense for the intentionality behind what happens in the classroom. So it just looks like a bunch of kids playing in an orderly, educational manner, when I'm sure there's actually a lot of planning and structure that goes into determining which activities are available, how children develop the habits of cooperation and obedience to routine, etc.",
    "If you are interested in children at all then you have to take this course. At first the observations may seem like a lot of time commitment but that is really what makes this course wonderful. I looked forward to seeing these kids every week. The journal entries (about your observations) make up the bulk of the writing. Unlike many other papers, I found them enjoyable to write.This is an excellent writing credit especially for people interested in working with children.",
    "HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS COURSE. (ESPECIALLY IF YOU LIKE CHILDREN, YOU MUST TAKE THIS COURSE). The course load is light, the topics are so interesting, and the opportunity to observe at the Day Care is greatttt. Overall, wonderful course."
