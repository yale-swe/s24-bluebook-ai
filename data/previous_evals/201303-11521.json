   "comments": [
    "A class with a lot of reading about the theories of nuclear politics. Very interesting, but the lecture is not particularly engaging. Very non-biased, i.e. the professor leaves the students to make their own moral judgements. I would recommend this for anyone interested in nuclear politics.",
    "Good class discussing politics of nuclear warfare and development. You get what you want out of this class through debate papers and responses but not too heavy of a workload. Yes I would recommend this class because Professor Debs is a great teacher and engaging",
    "Good class, pretty interesting",
    "I don't recommend it unless you're really really interested in learning about the way nuclear weapons have affected policy in the world.",
    "Interesting course if analytical IR theories are your thing. Professor is kind and helpful, but the TAs do the grading and they aren't even involved with the class. I liked it, but there are probably other courses just as good if not better.",
    "So much material, very hard and very hard graders - the overall content is interesting but there is just too many authors, too many thinkers and too much going on",
    "If you have an interest in the topic, this is a very well-taught and structured class. It's not too difficult either.",
    "only if you're interested in learning about the men who formed these theories about politics",
    "Take it! Interesting and not difficult.",
    "I would recommend this class if you are looking to learn a lot of theories about nuclear weapons and their use, non-use, proliferation, and control. The bulk of the class was learning about these theories, and really at the same time learning a bit about international relations theory and Cold War history through the lens of nuclear weapons. There is quite a lot of reading, if you decide to do all of it. Most are pretty interesting. Watch out for the debate statements, but the midterm and final are pretty fair in my opinion. Professor Debs is a great professor, though you do have to make an effort to get to know him if you would like to, as he doesn't do much to reach out, which is understandable give its a lecture class. His lectures can get kind of tedious sometimes, but the material is for the most part genuinely interesting.",
    "You will learn a lot about theories involving nuclear proliferation, the use and non-use of nuclear weapons, etc. Coming in with no previous knowledge on the field, I feel like I can knowledgeably form opinions on nuclear weapons and delineate various theories. We didn't talk, however, about current events, which I felt was an area that could've been improved.Professor Debs is passionate about the material, but his lecture style was not the most engaging for me personally. Overall, I would recommend this course if you have a strong interest in IR\/global affairs; this class was a \"branch out and try something new\" course for me, and while I learned a lot, it was definitely not one of my favorites.",
    "Worst class I have taken at Yale. I would not recommend it under any circumstance",
    "I would recommend it. Professor Debs is very engaging, and I really liked how this course looked at some important historical events from a policy perspective. I learned a lot in this course, and the material is so interesting. The workload is not bad at all.",
    "This was a really great class. I learned a lot about nuclear weapons and their use\/non-use, lots of interesting material and I liked the lectures. Also no section which is nice.",
    "After taking a few nuclear based history\/poli sci courses at Yale, I can hands down recommend this as the most up to date and interesting to be a part of. Reading responses were great and Professor Debs was brilliant. 15 person memos in teams of three was a bit of a curve ball...especially when people put in differing amounts of time and effort!",
    "Be ready to do a lot of reading if you want to take, and understand this class. Still interesting and I learned a lot, but it was a lot of reading. Also there were 2 group papers. Group projects in college is a dumb idea.",
    "Great course, but start it as Credit\/D. The material is interesting, but the grading is actually very harsh!There are two 15-page papers (that you write in a group) and four reading responses over the course of the semester. These actually took quite a bit of time. Other than that, the midterm and final were straight-forward.",
    "Decent class. Lectures were solid, Debs is very kind, and the material is cool. But the lecture created an awkward dynamic for discussion, and the class focused more on academic theory (and less on policy) than I would have liked.",
    "Take this class Debs is a fantastic lecturer. He makes the material interesting and you leave this class with a better knowledge of the perils of using nuclear weapons in addition to a better understanding of the current nuclear state of the world.",
    "Professor Debs is incredible! He learned the names of the 70 students in our lecture by day 5, and invested in his class and lectures. If you're looking for a class that focuses only on nuclear weapons, this may not be the one for you. Some game theory thrown in throughout the semester, as well as many of Debs' own papers. Not much work, and if you do a portion of the readings you'll be fine. Definitely a thumbs up!",
    "Yes.",
    "Absolutely recommended. It's a lot of reading but it's worth it.",
    "A great course in that it will likely lead you to a new and more informed perspective on how nuclear weapons have changed the world and continue to shape international relations. Professor is good and the information is very relevant.",
    "NOT A GUT",
    "I would generally recommend this classto any student with an interest in nuclear weapons, 20th century history, and the effects of science on human progress. Specifically, students with an interested in military history and\/or international relations should definitely take this class.",
    "Make sure you are really interested in the subject first. I took it because I thought it seemed intriguing and wanted to check it out, but I probably could have merited from taking a less specific political science class first. I was sometimes a bit bored as a consequence, even though it is definitely an interesting topic, but luckily Debs is awesome. There is a lot of reading, but he emphasizes what is important and goes over the key points, so it's not totally necessary to do a lot\/most of the readings, unless it's your week to do a short reading response (you'll do it 4x, and on your off-weeks, you can read other people's posts). Debs seems like a really nice man, and very invested in his work. Lecture slides were always very well organized and generally streamlined key information, and he posts all the slides online.",
    "Nuclear politics is the study of political implications, thought, and theory behind using and acquiring nuclear weapons. The class varies from studies of real world events, such as Hiroshima, conflicts between India and Pakistan, the Swedish nuclear program, and political theory. Exams will ask you to assess real world situations and shed insight on them from the works of the authors you study and read in class. The class is great. Although sometimes I feel it can be very difficult to participate in class because its large size (Seminar), I really enjoyed taking it.",
    "Only take nuclear politics if you're interested in the material. Lectures can be boring, and definitely more so if you're not very interested in hearing about nuclear weapons. Otherwise, fine class to take",
    "interesting",
    "Cool class on a cool subject- take it.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone interested in international relations. It definitely gave me a better perspective on the general theories of the causes and resolutions of conflicts, as well as new knowledge about several countries. Professor Debs is a great guy, and it was prettycool to read his academic papers and be able to get his in-person explanations of their content. There's a good amount of assigned reading, so if you take the course I'd recommend finding a way to work with large amounts of text (i.e. skimming, etc.). Most of the material in the reading is covered in class, so don't stress if you don't get to everything.",
    "This class has great lectures and covers fascinating material but I really wish it had sections because we were given a grade on class participation but it's rather hard to participate in a lecture format.",
    "If interested in security, this is an interesting course to learn about how game theory is applied in this area without actually studying game theory.",
    "On one hand, Debs is good and knowledgeable and wants his students to learn. You definitely learn a lot of nuclear weapon theory and some history about them. The material is very relevant and you gain a lot of knowledge. On the other hand, there are some things to be weary of. There were two graders- one was good and helpful, but the other seemed to not have really read our writings, plus was harsh. Two group papers are never good things in a class, but in a class like this you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re at a massive disadvantage if you do not have two other people you can trust. You do learn from writing them, but it can be a very painful process depending on your partners. Then there were reading responses in which it was difficult to do better than just average. Maybe class participation makes up for that though, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not sure. But the grade distribution does not seem as good as most first thought. In sum, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d say it is possible to do well, but it is certainly not an easy path towards doing so. You do, however, definitely learn a lot about relevant material and it is not a rather stressful workload.",
    "An interesting class for people who enjoy the topic, otherwise it can be a boring class that just has material for you to learn.",
    "Yes. Manageable workload and interesting material.",
    "If you're interested in the topic definitely take the class, but if you're unsure I would be wary deciding to take it because if you find out halfway through the class you don't find the topic very exciting it is very hard to concentrate in lecture"
