    "MCDB 570 01 is a class about some of the current techniques and topics that are exploited by biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies. Along with the techniques and topics are the though process in how to apply these techniques in order to solve a problem and think about the pros and cons of one technique over another. I would recommend this course to another student because if you are interested in biotechnology this course gives students what techniques and topics are currently being researched in the biotechnology field."
