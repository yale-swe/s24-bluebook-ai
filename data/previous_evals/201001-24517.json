    "I would only recommend a yearlong essay to another student if they are pretty serious about a big undertaking - it is big. I think that EP&E should probably have a more flexible page minimum; there's very little that you can say in 80 pages that you can't in 65 (what many other yearlong essays have as a maximum, not a minimum), especially if a large part of your research is data analysis.Having said that, it's obviously fun for all the right reasons - getting to have an extended academic experience, pursuing a single topic in depth - if you're into that sort of thing.Also, pick a topic that you really like, not just one that you can have a good adviser for. You have to want to sit down and write dozens of pages on it multiple times.",
