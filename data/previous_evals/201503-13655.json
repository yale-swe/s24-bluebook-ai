    "You're taking it b\/c you need it, b\/c if you actually wanted to learn QM you should be taking the graduate level QM. So take it, if you have a strong math background. Otherwise you'll do just fine too, but the math background makes it super easy.",
    "This is my least favorite class that I have taken at Yale. Things started off pretty well, with generally interesting quantum weirdness being discussed for a week or two. Once we got past the midterm, things went sharply downhill. Schoelkopf is personable enough, but the latter 2\/3 of the course was endlessly doing derivations for which we weren't given any motivation until reaching the result. We had no idea why Schoelkopf was doing anything that he was on the board, because he wouldn't make it clear what we were heading towards, and it was tremendously easy to zone out for a few seconds in the middle of it, and have absolutely no chance of catching back up in time for the result (and the reason we were doing the derivation in the first place). I'm not sure if this was because of Schoelkopf, or if it's the nature of quantum classes themselves, as I have heard similar reviews from a friend who took 440. I have heard that this is the \"good\" quantum class. If that's the case, I really don't want to imagine what 440 is like. I don't think I've felt half as much animosity towards any other class at Yale. Perhaps it would be bearable if you have the mental fortitude to pay attention during the entirety of each derivation (which is extremely hard, since they often take 20 minutes or so). Otherwise, I would really recommend a different class if you have the option. If you need to take this class. I'm sorry, and I hope it is a better experience for you than it was for me.",
    "A challenging but rewarding course on quantum mechanics. It helps a lot to have a thorough understanding of linear algebra, but it is doable with a basic knowledge of linear algebra.",
    "Great course. It provides a superb introduction to several topics in QM without overburdening you. Rob is a great lecturer: he does a great job interlinking different sections of the course and always explaining the physical meaning of the math. He's also got a fantastic sense of humour. Course load is very manageable: 8 P Sets (4-6 hrs on average) a midterm and a cumulative final. I'm majoring in Applied Math, not Physics, but still really enjoyed the course. You definitely need intro physics (261 ideally); Diff Eq and Linear Algebra help, but aren't strictly necessary.",
    "I really liked this class. Prof. Schoelkopf is outstanding, even though he had to cancel a lot of classes because his time is in pretty high demand. Psets were totally manageable, all 10 hours , I think, though some were kind of tedious. Having a very good grasp of Linear Algebra is a must. The students that had taken Math 225 were at a huge advantage over those who had taken (and forgotten) 222. Fair exams and about on-par difficulty-wise with other core classes in the non-intensive major-- in other words, expect to study a lot, especially during reading week.",
    "Quantum is hard, but if you're passionate about the subject, you'll enjoy this class. Professor Schoelkopf is very passionate about the subject, which is great. His lectures are good- however, he missed so many lectures towards the end of the semester, it really hindered my learning. He'd only offer one make up lecture, and he actually didn't offer a make up for 2 or 3 lectures that he missed. So, if you're good at learning hard material on your own, and you're not afraid of really staying on top of the material towards the end of the semester (when everything is insane, in my opinion), then you'll do well. But you've been warned. While passionate, Schoelkopf is not exactly committed.",
    "A good introduction to quantum mechanics, although the material is not very easy to digest for the first time. Also, I felt like we sped through a ton of material post-midterm, which was overwhelming when it came time to study for the final. Like, the midterm covered the Townsend material\/spin and particle in a box, and then the final covered that + like 5 million other topics. Not bad compared to other physics classes, but definitely not easy. Schoelkopf is a decent lecturer, but he missed class a lot and follows very closely to Griffiths.",
    "This is a fun but challenging course. Some of the problem sets got long (15-20 hours), but Prof. Schoelkopf responded well to our feedback about that and made things more reasonable again. The midterm and final were straight-forward: I appreciated that. The most important advice I can give is to read the book, thoroughly, in order to help understand what's going on because class time will not be enough to wrap your head around the unintuitive concepts, and Professor Schoelkopf especially seemed to kind of enjoy our confusion. Other than that, you're probably taking this course because you need to, so just keep on top of the workload and good luck!",
    "Definitely recommend the class. Schoelkopf is a great professor and covers a lot of quantum."
