   "comments": [
    "The course was very enjoyable, it took interesting phenomena from various fields and explained the mathematical theory behind them. The course is relatively self-contained. It would be useful to be comfortable with basic probability theory and maybe to have had some exposure to simple graph theory, but everything is explained from the fundamentals. The course is math-based and proof-based, but it should accessible to most science and applied science students. The workload is very fair (we only had two take-home exams and one assignment where we had to type up one lecture's worth of notes). The emphasis is on understanding the material. I would definitely recommend the course to anybody interested in network science.",
    "Learning about network science phenomena and proving them. If you like math and graph theory, you'll love this. It was a small class, with about 4 undergrads, 4 grad students, and 4 auditors. The professor really emphasized learning over grades, which was refreshing as an undergrad.",
    "I am an undergrad, so I hope that this actually appears, but it may not. I thought this was a great course to take. It is an overview of a bunch of fun concepts in graph theory and statistics. \"Theoretical\" is definitely a true statement, but the proofs teach you a lot, and the exams are designed to make you use what you learned. The one drawback is that I have not received any feedback whatsoever on how I am doing at this point. The only grades were one homework, a midterm, and a final, none of which have been returned. I like Professor Karbasi, and he tried very hard to make sure that the entire class understood what was going on at all times. This course made me think that I would enjoy grad school.",
    "A great class to introduce some of the fundamentals of graphs and networks. Be prepared for the professor to cold-call students during lecture (it's for your own good, though). The exams will sneak up on you and be much harder than you expected, but the lectures are really excellent and there's not much work outside of the exams.",
    "This class is a great introductions to some mathematical tools and techniques used in network science. I think math 222 \/ stat 241\/242 would be useful prerequisites."
