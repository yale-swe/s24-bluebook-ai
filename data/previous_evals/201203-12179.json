    "I'd recommend it, but know that it isn't easy.",
    "I would definitely reccommend this class. It's not too hard for a science credit, as long as you put in the work and go to lecture. The readings are unnecessary, and the tests are fill in the blank which is great.",
    "Take this course. Amy Arnsten is a gift to Yale and to the world. Out of all the courses I have taken here, this is the one in which I felt I had learned the most, and felt that what I had learned would stick. Study for the tests because you really want to learn this stuff. You won't regret this course.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone. You don't have to be a science person to appreciate the subject. The class is well taught and the material is presented at a level that everyone can understand. This was probably the most interesting course I took this semester,and I highly recommend it.",
    "I would recommend it. Its an easy science credit, and the lecture information is really interesting.",
    "If you are interested in a comprehensive overview of the inner working of the human mind, this is a wonderful introductory course. \"Introductory\" is perhaps not the right word here. You will get out of this class what you put in: do the readings and you will learn an incredible amount of biological information about the human brain. The lectures are excellent, the professor is really interesting.",
    "I would recommend it to a student who is looking for a fifth class. It's not in depth enough to constitute a core class, but the information is quintessential. If anyone is looking to get a taste of psychology then take it. I would not reccomend it to someone who is trying to see what Cognitive Science. Having taken Brian Scholl's Intro to Cog Sci, I can say that Intro to Human Brain does not make any mention of cog sci. Take Intro to Cog Sci over this class any day.",
    "I would recommend Cog Sci in a second. There is a lot of memorization for this class. I don't think that this class should be taken for and easy A because it is a lot of work, but if the brain is really interesting to you, then it is hard to regret if you don't get the best grade possible. I shopped other science classes, and they were much less interesting, but in the long run probably easier.",
    "Take this class, even if you don't need it for a major requirement! It is very interesting and you will learn a lot about the brain and why we behave the way we do.",
    "This was a very good course. Probably one of the best science-related courses I've taken so far. It was well-organized and had interesting lectures structured in an understandable order, with occasional guest lectures who were experts in their field of research. Granted, the structure and complexity of Powerpoints varied among such individuals, and there seemed to be more work than other courses (3 midterms, a final term paper and exam), but other than that, a great course.",
    "If you need a science credit or a list B core class for the psych major, then yes. Otherwise, no.",
    "Take the course!! It is very interesting, especially if you do not know much about the brain and how it works, you will be amazed. The Professor is also amazing! You will be fascinated by the material and by the way she integrates neuroscience and art. Believe me, you'll love it! An the exams are very easy. No need to worry about that. You will know the essay themes from before hand, and the final paper can be written in a creative manner so you will have fun with that too.",
    "Psych 120 is basically a course about the mechanisms that underlie the functions of the human brain",
    "YES, absolutely, positively a must-take Yale course, especially for non-science majors looking for a Science credit. Every lecture is absolutely mind-blowing. Extremely rewarding. To top it all off, the grading breakdown is exceedingly fair. If you need a Science credit, take this course. You will not be disappointed.",
    "If you are sufficiently interested in the material, then I would recommend taking PSYC 120. The exams are straightforward, but be prepared to do a lot of work (3 midterms, a final paper, and a final exam). Professor Arnsten is wonderful, but the guest lecturers less so. Overall, pretty good course, but not a \"must take.\"",
    "If you are interested in neuroscience, but don't want to take a full on Neuro course, this is a great way to dabble in the field. You will get a great overview of how the brain works without being bored out of your mind. This class is great for Psych majors that want to learn a bit more technical knowledge in neuroscience.",
    "Brain and Thought is a good course--but not as great as I thought it would be. The guest lectures really vary in quality--and for the most part detract from the course (except for Pasko Rakic's lecture). Arnsten is a great professor, and should just do all the lectures herself.",
    "Hard course, but really interesting. The second unit kinda blows. It's a pretty easy B+\/A- but a tough A. if you want to learn about the brain\/psychology\/mental illness\/disease then it's a great fit for you. Professor Arnsten is really nice!",
    "CGSC 201 is an introduction to the basics of neuroscience, covered in 3 parts. The first part covers basic neuroscience at the cell level, and knowing your way around the brain. The second unit covers the sensory cortices and systems. The third brings it all together in lectures about information pathways and processing in the brain. The course culminates with a few well-anticipated lectures on language, memory, mental illness, etc.",
    "Absolutely! SC credit that is not too hard and very interesting. Learn a lot about the brain and the body.",
    "This class is great. It used to be called brain and thought. I'm pre-med so this was my gut for the semester. I even started off credit-D so I could blow it off and wound up switching because I was getting such a high grade. That being said it might be a bit much for very anti-science people. It's really cool material, very well taught. Take it if you can get in (it is capped at 150 or so). The tests are fill in the blank with a word bank and one essay- and she usually tells you the prompt before. I went to every lecture, didn't buy (or read) anything except the papers my TA needed a response for (maybe five of these the whole semester- each took about 45 min to read and write a one page response to). There is one paper, ten pages, and no outside research necessary. I don't know my grade yet but I wrote it in one afternoon, had fun doing it, and think it'll be ok. Section is mandatory so factor that in. My TA Carol was great, she did the \"science\" section- there are neuroeconomics and mental illness sections too. ProfArnsten does go a bit quickly and there is a delay in posting the slides. I recommend recording the lecture and listening to them again before the tests. I did this while running, between classes, and at work- it was my only studying. That being said, she's awesome. Even if you can only go to the classes during shopping period because you don't get in, GO! She waxes poetic about the brain and it's awesome.",
    "Take it! It is an easily accesible class for even non-science majors. Professor Arnsten is a great lecturer, and I was always engaged in class. The material we cover is actually very highly relevant to our everyday lives so it was very interesting.The exam material will come from lecture so go to class and take diligent notes. The textbook is not always needed, but it's good if you want a more scientific explanation of what we discuss in class. Although the exams cover a lot of material, if you keep on top of going over lecture notes\/studying throughout the semester, the 3 midterms and the final are not hard. The final paper is also fun and creative if you want it to be since you can choose form a variety of topics ranging from a very scientific paper to a creative story.",
    "This course is an introduction to the Human brain that not only teaches you about the underlying cellular structure and functionalities of the brain, but also teaches you lasting lessons about how our body interacts with the outside world. We also learn a fair amount about how disease and disorder works in the body, and you really do open up your mind to the unfortunate circumstance of others who have these problems, including institutionalized individuals, veterans, bums, and even normal ass people.",
    "A great course. A lot of people really like Professor Arnsten. She's sweet and helpful - not your normal science professor. I found the material fascinating. If you find the brain fascinating at all, this will only increase your appreciation. There are three midterms, a final paper and a final - none of them particularly scary.",
    "I would highly recommend this course, especially if one is interested in an overview of cognitive mechanisms and functions. It was always information-packed and I left lecture everyday feeling as if I had grasped the material. The tests were not too difficult - essay topics were presented to us inadvance - and the grade weighting was very fair. The final essay allowed us to utilize what we learned all semester and compile the material in a creative way to convey our mastery of the material. Every aspect of the course felt carefully planned - I was definitely a fan!",
    "It's awesome but a lot of work.",
    "A really interesting course! You learn so much about the brain and it's all really interesting. Not too much work, I would definitely recommend!",
    "No, this was a sad sad sad class. I had heard that this was a \"must-take\" course but I was not impressed at all. Professor Arnsten has been my greatest disappointment at Yale. I came in expecting to be blown away with amazing facts about neuroscience but was unable to focus during lecture as I had difficulty keeping up with the challenging material, which she never simplified. The guest lectures were the WORST lectures I've ever sat through. We were told that the lecturers were leaders in their fields but I honestly think that each of them could do with a public speaking class at a community college, at the very least. They raced through all the mind-boggling technical jargon and some of them had unfathomable accents. Additionally, section ended up being a total waste of time as our TA had difficulty communicating in English. I mean, really? This happens at Yale? #trollcourse",
    "On the first day of lecture, we're told that ''this class is not a gut.'' This is definitely the easiest class I've taken at Yale. The workload was practically nonexistent, and the material was (while interesting) not at all hard to grasp. The problem is that the class is too easy - the median for tests was consistently in the 90-range. All of that said, the class is very interesting and is worth taking.",
    "The class was a great introduction to the human brain and it's biological processes. It's a good introduction particularly for people who are considering the psych-neuro course or cog sci major, because it allows them to get a look at what studying the field of neuroscience could look like. Professor Arnsten makes the class great.I found the course to be tough at times because the textbook doesn't follow the class--in fact many of my friends never bought a textbook and did better than some others that did own the textbook.Also, I wouldn't exactly call the course a science class for non-science majors, there are quite a few psych-neuroscience and cog sci majors in the class which might as well be science majors. But it is certainly manageable (I'd say 3-4 hours a week outside of class, excluding test time)",
    "Great science for non science majors. The final paper is a little strange, but the tests aren't hard and the material is very applicable to life.",
    "Take this class!! The material is sometimes difficult, but especially compared to other neuroscience classes it is a breeze. But really Amy Arnsten is what sets this class apart - she is such a wonderful, intelligent, and eloquent woman who has so much love for neuroscience and her students. I have not yet taken a class with someone so brilliant. If you are interested in learning more about the brain, really try to get into this class.",
    "Definitely worth taking - be prepared for some tough material and lots of memorization, but in the long run it's a lot of interesting stuff. As a humanities major I was especially pleased that the course was engaging and accessible while also still getting into real scientific concepts.",
    "I would summarize it as a good intro to neuroscience and I would recommend it to another student but I would suggest that he \/ she takes Intro to Psychology first.",
    "To Hu people looking for a Sc: this class is not a gut, but it's not Organic Chemistry. On non-test weeks, you'll have to put in an hour of work reading a scholarly paper and writing a response to it. For tests you'll have to study for several hours, though they are not difficult because you have a word bank and Prof. Arnsten tells you the essay topic in advance. For the paper (10 pages) you get to choose your own topic, and there are so many interesting topics in neuroscience to write about.",
    "Great if you need a science credit or are genuinely interested in the material. If you already have a strong bio or neuro background, it'll probably be slow\/redundant.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS! Brain and Thought was by far the best class I have taken at Yale. I absolutely hate Biology, but I found this class so interesting. Professor Arnsten is a fantastic professor and makes the material clear and accessible. Although there is a lot of work (3 tests, a final paper, and a final), it is very manageable and the tests are super easy. My only advice is to study the material as you learn it as opposed to cramming for the final. Many people wait until the last night, but you will get so much more out of the class if you review the material after each lecture. Nevertheless, don't miss your opportunity to take one of the most exciting classes at Yale!",
    "Intro to the Human Brain (also called Brain& Thought) is a comprehensive overview of major brain structures and how they govern everyday behavior. We started with the basics of anatomy and neuronal signaling and then covered sensory systems, memory, the prefrontal cortex, the amygdala\/emotion, movement, and other topics. The lectures cover the physiology of these processes in a good amount of detail - it's definitely a neuroscience course, not really psych-y, and perfect for people who are interested in learning the details of how the brain works (rather than just behavior) or who are interested in neuroscience research. There are three tests (fill in the blank vocab and one essay), a 10-page term paper, and a final (vocab and three essays). It's not a ton of constant work to keep up with during the semester, but towards the end it gets pretty heavy with the third test, term paper, and final all after Thanksgiving break. I definitely recommend it if you're at all interested in neuroscience, or even if you just want a good understanding of the brain that will be applicable to your daily life. Also, learning about mental illness, especially in the last lecture, is really fascinating and gratifying because the rest of the course has given you the tools to understand it on a pretty meaningful level. Amy Arnsten is a wonderful lecturer, and she's also an amazing person to talk to one-on-one if you're interested in anything brain or mental health or medicine-related. I made an appointment with her, and we talked for an hour about my interests and the relevant research being done at Yale.",
    "Not a gut or easy science credit by any measure. Come to lecture, take good notes, go to section, ask your TF about anything that's unclear. You learn a LOT about the brain and the miraculous things it does over the course of the semester.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone who wants a basic introduction to the human brain. The course isn't solely focused on anatomy so it's useful for psychology and cognitive science majors as well. Even with very little background in the sciences, I was able to keep up with the material taught in class.The lectures are more important than book. Make sure you go to all the lectures; some of the guest lectures might not be uploaded online or covered in the book! Also, Amy gives hand outs at the end of each lecture and these review sheets are very helpful in studying for the exams.",
    "Well the lectures are boring, the guest speakers are slightly more engaging, but generally fail to express things at an introductory level. That being said, the tests are VERY easy and the class really didn't require that much work. You'll learn a solid amount about the brain, but don't expect to be entertained.",
    "Brain& Thought is a wonderful class that every student should take. After the course, you will come away with a deep understanding of the brain on multiple levels, from the cellular mechanisms themselves to the role neurons and circuits play in producing global behavior like consciousness and Parkinson's disease. Professor Arnsten is a leading active researcher on the prefrontal cortex, and her love of the material is readily apparent - when she lectures. I would say that one of the downsides of the course is that about a third of the lectures are guest lecturers. While Professor Arnsten brings in specialists in particular fields to introduce us, to, say, hearing, we don't need to hear from the world-specialist to understand the basics, and I think that Professor Arnsten could teach the material better than the guests. Surprisingly, a strength of the course are the discussion sections. Each one has a theme - neuroeconomics, mental illness, etc - and you read journal articles relevant to the theme. The workload is manageable but decently heavy. You must write up a summary and critique of section papers each week, study for three tests and final throughout the semester (if you memorize well, they are very easy), write a 10 page term paper. The brain is amazing, and this class is a great way to learn about it. And it's a science credit, for those searching for the rare beasts.",
    "Definitely take this courseif you are a non-science major looking for a science credit, or even if you are a science major. You do not necessarily have to be interested in neuroscience to take it. Professor Arnsten does a really nice job of breaking down the material so that it is very understandable for everyone. Even though I started off as a non-science major not quite sure I would be interested in the subject of the course, I thought it was really interesting by the end. It's not necessarily a gut-- you have to put in the work to do well-- but the tests are fair. The TAs are also amazing and really help you understand the material. Take it!",
    "Brain and Thought is a survey of the brain structure and functions. I would definitely recommend it for people like me who don't know anything about the brain but find it extremely fascinating! (Although I'm sure people who know about the brain have plenty they could learn from the class).",
    "This class is a mixed bag. On the one hand, Amy is phenomenal lecturer and very knowledgeable researcher. Some of the topics are particularly interesting, like the ones on mental illness, sleep\/consciousness, and emotion\/PTSD. On the other hand, there are a ton of guest lectures that are all over the place, and you're forced to read the very dense book to understand. Really wish Amy had stuck to teaching the course herself. The tests are pretty easy and the paper is a change of pace because it involves creative thinking as well as scientific analysis. But the final is cumulative and a ton of material to memorize--kind of an awful studying experience.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. Really interesting material, and not much work (three tests, a paper, and a final).",
    "I totally recommend this class. For students interested in psychology or cognitive science, this class is a must. For students looking for a Sc credit that is accessible, but not a worthless gut, this class is a must. For students who are even remotely interested in the brain, this class is a must. Take this class. Do it.",
    "This course is structured really well. The exams help instill the material, and the final is a nice culmination. With the shortened reading period, however, the paper can spring up on you. Learned a lot. Definitely recommend this course.",
    "If you're looking for a Science credit that will engage you but that has no prerequisites, have at it. The lectures are entertaining and the unit on the sensory systems is incredible -- you should leave the class amazed at how our body and our consciousness works. The class does get confusing at some points, especially when you get into topics that are not as researched and that are still being explored, but the fact that Prof Arnsten is willing to tackle them head on is great. Don't letthe number of exams scare you off -- making sure you're on track throughout the semester will prevent you from having to cram all the information in during Reading Period, when you'll already be stressed with whatever else you have to do.",
    "Brain and Thought was a great class overall. The content of the second half of the course was definitely more interesting than that of the first half, but you need the first half so that the second half makes sense. Make sure you like guest lecturers, since there are many. Professor Arnsten is a great teacher, so it's great when she gives the lecture. This class is not a gut. You have to be prepared to study really hard to get a lot out of it. But if you're willing to work, you learn a ton!",
    "One of the better classes I've taken. Lots of work but totally worth it. I've taken a ton of psych classes and this is the first in a long time that's not totally overlapping with the standard psych curriculum.",
    "IF YOU GET IN, ABSOLUTELY TAKE THIS CLASS.Amy Arnsten is an amazing lecturer, the TAs she chooses are some of the sweetest members of the Yale community. They truly want you to succeed. While this class is by no means a gut, it is much more rewarding and satisfying than any gut you could take here. What is the point of taking Issues Approach, for example, if you forget all of that information a week after the final? Amy's lectures were absolutely amazing not only because she taught in a way that non-science majors like me could understand, but also because she turns the study of the brain into something beautiful. I learned so much from this class, and I know I won't forget it easily. This was easily my favorite class this semester, hands down.The grading scheme is also very manageable: there are three tests, each worth 10% of your grade, while a term paper is worth 20%, participation is worth 20%, and the final exam is 30%. I found this completely fair, and I found that what they tested us on was completely fair, too.",
    "Yes",
    "YES. You learn things about the brain that amazes you. Prof Arnsten is an amazingly poetic and knowledgeable professor. She genuinely cares. Although be wary of the other reviews that say you will go into exam day with a newfound appreciation of life - I still had a lot of test anxiety and although some things I learned were amazing, it's the moments sitting in lecture realizing how incredible the brain was that trumped over a life-changing perspective.",
    "A good introductory course. Not too hard. You don't have to do the readings, but you do need to go to class. You can study what you need for the exams on the same day, usually. It's a bit stressful during the end of year. There's a 10-page paper, and an exam (despite having had one just a couple weeks earlier).",
    "This class was phenomenal. It's marketed as \"highly accessible but challenging\" which I think was a very fair description. Professor Arnsten is a wonderful lecturer (as are the majority of the guest lecturers), and you will honestly leave this class knowing how your brain works. The TAs are all excellent and very helpful, and the workload is extremely fair--since there are 3 tests, a paper, and a final, no one segment is too stressful. You won't regret this class. Take it!",
    "Anyone interested in how the brain works should take this. It is an extremely interesting class, and it gives a basic foundation for cognitive science.",
    "Takes work but worth it. Great science credit.",
    "The class entails little work and could serve as an almost non-existent fifth or sixth class. It can also, at times, be vaguely interesting.",
    "Definitely recommended if you're majoring in some related area. If you're not, be sure you're very interested in the science behind the brain, as mechanisms are gone into in a lot of detail. Also be prepared to put in a lot of the work yourself, as lectures are often confusing rather than clarifying. On the plus side, the reading is never necessary.",
    "Definitely recommend it. Consider starting it credit d as it isn't easy and there are a Lott of assessments.",
    "I don't understand why a lot of these other reviews of this class are so positive. You're cramming some real info about the brain, some of which is interesting, for exams. Arnsten isn't actually that great a lecturer, and there's basically no textbook at the level of this class (she out and out says the recommended textbook \"sucks\" on day 1), so much of the preparation for this class is spent flipping through lecture slides. It's a decent way to get a science credit if this material interests you on its own terms, but if it doesn't and all you want is 100 minutes of gut science per week, Arnsten won't help you enjoy it or learn it and you should probably go find something easier.Arnsten is often quick to tie in some brain material with throwaway humanities examples in her lectures - quotes from literature or philosophy, paintings, etc. As a clear \"humanities person\", I found a lot of the throwaway humanities tie-ins (e.g. \"impressionist paintings are vague-looking because DORSAL STREAM VISUAL PATHWAY!\") to be lame\/uninspired at best.",
    "I would definitely take this class again.",
    "This class is a lot harder than it is made out to be. It's actually really sciencey - definitely manageable for non-science majors but not at all a gut. I really enjoyed it though. It gave me a very good overview of neuroscience, and covers a lot of material. Take it if you're interested in the topic!",
    "Take this class. I now feel so much more knowledgeable and conversant about the mechanisms of human thought and the brain. It *is* a neuroscience class, so (obviously) it's heavier on the \"brain\" than on the \"thought.\" But even just knowing what part of the brain deals with what aspect of cognition is immensely illuminating for everyday life.Aside from the subject matter, Arnsten is a great lecturer, and the lecture slides are posted online so you can review easily. The three tests and the final were all the same format (wordbank for MC, plus essay(s)), and we knew the essay topics for the tests ahead of time; all in all, not difficult, assuming you studied and knew the material. Okay, I wouldn't call it a \"gut,\" but if you're at least decent at science or at memorizing information, it's not a hard class either. And even if it were really difficult, for me the extra effort would have been worth it for the subject matter.",
    "As an introductory neuro class, for sure!",
    "Broad overview of the latest research in neuroscience. Topics ranged from neuroanatomy, to our senses and how they allow us to perceive the world, to mental disorders. Fantastic class, absolutely take it, Amy Arnsten is a great lecturer, and the workload, though not light, was highly manageable even for non-science folks. Great science credit for non-science people but who still want to learn something new, interesting.",
    "This is one of those courses you come home on Christmas break and end up talking to your parents about the consolidation of memories within Association Cortices, rather than the hippocampus. It's great. Put the effort in and you'll learn a ton. Things that are both directly and indirectly relevant to your life are constantly cropping up. Professor Arnsten is the perfect lecturer for this course.",
    "This is a great course to take if you have any interest in psychology or neuroscience. The nice thing about this class is that you get out what you put in, so as long as you're willing to spend a fair amount of time studying you'll do well.",
    "Really great course, not too challenging, and a fascinating subject matter.",
    "It's a really interesting class, but it's not a gut. I would recommend it if you're interested in learning more about the how the brain works. Be prepared to attend most classes, since the exams are based almost entirely on what's covered in lecture. Professor Arnsten is great and is amazing and breaking down complicated concepts.",
    "YES! BEST SC CREDIT AT YALE. Professor Arnsten is great, the subject matter is interesting, and it's challenging enough that you can't skip class and turn it into a joke. It won't be the hardest class you take all semester, but you'll still have to go - and you'll be glad you did.",
    "I would recommend Brain and Though to another student because it allows you to start to discover the beauty and complexity of neuroscience. But I would also warn them that it can be a very frustrating course, given that it tries to cover a ridiculous amount of material in one semester, and you often don't know exactly what you should be taking away from a lecture. But I still enjoyed it very much, and felt like I learned a lot.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone, as it is really interesting and can change your understanding of the brain. However, I would caution you about the workload, as the tests take a lot of studying.",
    "I would recommend this class. I took it to fulfill my science credit, and I'm glad I did. I learned a lot of things about how my brain works. However, this class does have a lot of graded assignments (3 midterms, a paper, and a final) so be prepared. Also, this class requires a lot of memorization.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to other students. Take it if you're not a science major. Take it if you're a psychology major.",
    "This is a great,not too challenging introductory neuroscience course. It covers a lot of basics, and the assessments were really straightforward (fill in the blanks, essay question that we were given beforehand for the midterms and had choices for in the final). Be ready to do a lot of studying during the term before 3 separate exams that are only worth 10% each of your grade (but that's 30% you can get nearly perfect if you try), but studying for the final (30%) is super easy afterwards. There's also a 10 page term paper at the end of the course, which is creative and basically synthesizing material you've learned... Section is great for reviewing material, though it is annoying sometimes that you have to go.... Reading neuroscience papers and discussing them in section later in the course is really interesting though. You get to use the information you learned to understand stuff that's actually relevant and important. There are also a lot of interesting guest lecturers that come in to teach basics and share new research from their fields. Overall, good course... It really is a mix of psych and neuro...Will get you thinking about what you think and how you think!",
    "Great class, a lot of details and facts, but essential to know in real life.",
    "Take it if you're interested in neuroscience. Know that this is a survey course, and focuses mostly on concepts, not specifics. If you want more biology and depth take 170.",
    "Awesome class, definitely take it. It is super easy, but still really interesting, if you already have knowledge of biology.",
    "Best class I've taken at Yale, completely changed my career path. TAKE IT!",
    "Cognitive Science 201, Brain and Thought, is a wonderful introduction into the realm of the human brain taught by a very knowledgable, thoughtful professor, Amy Arnsten. Though sometimes guest lecturers faltered (almost always I preferred Amy's lectures to those of the guest lecturers!) almost without fail I felt as if I left each lecture in this class with a new (and better understanding) of myself and the way that my body and brain function. Work was manageable, though material was sometimes challenging and a lot of studying was necessary before the 3 major tests during the course of the semester. I would highly recommend it to any student interested in neuroscience, the cognitive science major, or just interested in the concepts discussed in the class.",
    "TAKE IT. Chances are, if you're a psych\/neuro major, you're going to take it anyway. It's also really good.This is NOT A GUT, so if you're a non-major looking for an easy Sc, look elsewhere.",
    "TAKE THIS. Engaging material and wonderful lectures.",
    "Yes! Sure, it isn't as gutty as people may believe, but if you have any interest in the subject matter at all, it will be a fascinating, and fairly low-stress course. Some lectures are easier to follow than others, sure, but Arnsten and the TAs do a great job of preparing you for each exam, and Arnsten's passion is palpable enough to make you feel impassioned about at least some of the lectures. Another note: I loved this class equally for its sections as well as its lecture; they're split into three types: general overview, neuroeconomics, and mental illness sections, and I really enjoyed the specificity and depth I could acheive reading the scientific articles for my neuroeconomics section. This class is a great way to get introduced not only to the subject matter, but to many of the movers and shakers in the fields as well. Take it!",
    "This class is a great introduction to neuroscience. You learn a lot about the workings of the human brain, and this revelation will change the way you think about how humans interact with the world around them. Be warned though that this class is not a gut. While the actual content is not very difficult to grasp per se, the sheer volume and workload of this class makes up for it. Don't take it for a grade if you're not prepared to do the work: three midterms, 10 page final paper, final exam, and weekly readings of scientific papers.",
    "Take it if you are seriously interested in neuroscience and can devote time to studying.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone! The brain is incredibly interesting!",
    "I would strongly recommend this course to other students. The material is fascinating and eye opening. The course provides a great insight into the functions of the brain. The workload is very manageable.",
    "I would recommend this class. Professor Arnsten is a great lecturer. If you have never had any neuro experience, you will love this class. As a non-science major, I found this class challenging but manageable. Grading consists of three midterms, a final exam, a term paper, and discussion section (mandatory). Its a lot of work, but ultimately its rewarding.",
    "STAY AWAY FROM THIS CLASS. I was fooled by the hoards of excellent reviews -- but something must have changed between last year and this. Brain and Thought was the most painfully awful class I've ever taken at Yale. Professor Arnsten should think about actually teaching in her lectures, rather than delegating her job to various \"specialists\" who know nothing about the pacing of the class, the students' prior knowledge, or the particular kind of language we have access to. Whatever I gained from this class, I credit to dogged and constant teamwork with my equally frustrated classmates and more knowledgable suitemates who had the good sense to enroll in other, better classes. The situation might have been helped if my TA had been better -- so if you're dead-set on taking the class, do what you can to get a good one (though Arnsten was a monster about keeping people where they'd been assigned, and you shouldn't expect to be able to switch if your TA is a nightmare).",
    "This course is probably good if you're majoring in Psych or Cog Sci, and have a background in the material already. Otherwise, though, it's confusing and overwhelming. There's a lot of information, and it's not presented in a very organized way. Take it if you're one of those majors, or if you are prepared to spend a lot of time teaching yourself the material. Do not take it for an easy science credit, because that's not what it is at all.",
    "Yes as a science credit - not sure for someone who is a science major.",
    "Simple, straightforward approach to a SC credit. Easy for a non-science major.",
    "Absolutely. Put in th effort and you won't regret it.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS!!! I came into this class knowing just about nothing about the human brain but now I feel almost qualified to conduct research in the neuroscience department. Arnsten is an extremely dedicated and helpful teacher who clearly cares for her students. She makes herself available outside of class, replies promptly to emails and gives constructive feedback. My TA, Zhihao Zhang, was also excellent and helped reinforce some of the difficult concepts covered in lecture. Therefore, this class had a great instructor, helpful TAs and covers interesting material. It is also assessed fairly so if you work hard you'll get a good grade. THERE IS EVERY REASON TO TAKE THIS CLASS.",
    "Yes! I absolutely would because the material is interesting and not too difficult. It is also interesting to take whether or not it is a point of interest for a major.",
    "This class is wonderful. For non-science majors, it presents intriguing concepts about how the brain works in an accessible manner, something that made the class more manageable and rewarding. The workload is very fair, and Prof. Arnsten makes the lectures enjoyable to attend. I would highly recommend this course to anyone interested in how the brain works - it is truly a fantastic course.",
    "This course is deceptively more work than it would seem. The course was overall very well-structured, though it seemed like the workload (especially the final paper) was intended as more of a weeding-out process than being conducive to learning. Likewise, while the guest lecturer format was rewarding in that the class heard from the experts in the field, it was not always clear what content would be expected on the assessments.",
    "As a psych major, I took this class expecting it to be easy due to curve (most people in the class are non-science and non-psych\/cogsci majors). It ended up being moderate. The first test was super easy. The second test was ok. I still have no idea how I did in the class because 50% of my grade was tied up in end of term stuff (participation, final paper, final exam). The final exam was harder than anticipated. There is a lot of material, as you would expect from a brain class. If you go to every lecture and keep on top of the material, it shouldn't be too bad. Get a good TA who will explain things to you that went over your head in lecture. The guest lectures were pretty cool usually, although some were duds. It was the first class where I actually went to every lecture (except one when I was sick).",
    "Take this class!! Amy Arnsten is a great lecturer, and almost all of the guest lecturers (though they might change from year to year) are really great as well. It is a great science class for non science majors because the amount of info you need to know for the exams is very manageable, but the lectures also go into greater detail for those who are able to grasp more specific scientific concepts. Also, sections are themed, so you can pick a section that suits your specific interests. Not at all a gut class, though.",
    "This is not a gut class. There are three midterms, an 8-10 page term paper, a final exam, and mandatory discussion sections. That said, each of these is fair and manageable. The exams are fair (fill-in-the-blank and an essay question whose topic you are usually given in advance), and there are numerous prompts you can choose from for the term paper, ranging from basic to personal to creative to open-ended. You don't have to do the textbook reading, but you do have to come to every lecture. Amy Arnsten is a phenomenal lecturer, and you will never be bored in her lectures. The guest lectures range in quality from mediocre to highly engaging and entertaining. Discussion group is mandatory but, if you get a good TA, can be extremely helpful. The content of the course blends a bit of molecular and cellular biology (action potentials, etc.), a bit of neuroanatomy (learning all the major parts of the brain), a bit of neuroimaging, a bit of research methods and design (you read some papers for discussion in section), a bit of pharmacology, a bit of clinical psychiatry, a lecture on each of the sensory systems, and a lot of information about the major processes and circuits that allow us to see, feel, think, move, and remember. Amy Arnsten combines all this with a touch of humanity, as you read about and hear about patients with neurodegenerative disorders or lesions to various areas you talk about and study in class. This class is wonderful for pre-meds without any background in neurobiology, and perfect for anyone who wants to go into cognitive science or psychology.",
    "Though the lectures are dense, the textbook is ineffective, and I often found myself lost in the material, at the end of the day, Introduction to the Human Brain is a very, very good introduction to the human brain.Professor Arnsten and her colleagues (often leading neuroscientists in their respective fields) give thorough lectures on the pathways on the brain, and the course is packaged to give an overview of the way the brain works to tickle students' interests in neuroscience. Those who have an inclination towards the empirical study of the brain will surely find this course a worthwhile one. Those who are looking for a science credit may not.Lectures pack a lot of information into 50 minutes, and the textbook is a med school edition that does almost nothing to help you understanding of the course material. As a result, you spend quite some time going through all the material in section, and even more trying to break everything down on your own before each of the 3 mid terms and final.That said, when you finally understand action potentials, inhibition and the basal ganglia loops, you might fall into fascinating discussions about the brain over dinner, you'll find the final lectures more interesting, and you might even decide to pursue neuroscience during your career at Yale, like I.",
    "This class will give you a relatively in-depth introduction to the human brain. You will learn a lot of information that is not readily accessible on the internet and you will be able to better understand dialogue related to the brain in the news or other sectors. It is a very enjoyable class.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone who wants to get a science credit from a non-gut class. You can tell that Professor Arnsten wants you to care about what is discussed in class and that she wants you to do well, and she provides lots of resources to help you prepare for the tests-- especially if you attend lecture. If you don't have a very strong science background, you may want to shop for a TF; Cali Calarco was really great. I left the class having learned a lot and gained confidence in my skills as a scientific thinker!",
    "Cognitive Science 201 01 is an incredible first introduction to neuroscience. I had never been exposed to the human brain prior to the course and I feel I have a great overall understanding now. It teaches you to view the world through another lens and the section on mental illness taught me to look at the people around me with greater empathy. Take this class. You won't regret it.",
    "You can do well in this course without too much effort. If you put in the effort, however, you will come out with at least a rudimentary understanding of how people think, which is well worth it. Professor Arnsten is a natural and intuitive teacher with a great talent for explaining even difficult concepts.",
    "Yes. Take this class. It is excellent!",
    "TAKE IT! You won't regret it. It piqued my interest in the field and made me want to take more science classes.",
    "If you are looking for a way to fulfill the science requirement, you'd be hard-pressed to find a more interesting and relevant course to take. The course requires a fair amount of work-3 midterms, term paper, and a cumulativefinal-but it's very straightforward and the TA's are a great resource. The guest speakers are all very interesting, and it is a great gateway into getting involved in research.",
    "Oh my goodness, just take this course. If you need a science credit, it's one of the most painless ways--and you feel like you've actually learnt something. You will also have the opportunity to hold a human brain and you ain't gonna do that in NattyD.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class! You will learn so much about the way in which your brain works (a fascinating topic) and hear from people who are actually doing research on the different functions of the brain you study. There are a number of assessments throughout the semester, but don't let that deter you from taking the class.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. Besides being intrinsically interesting, it is important to learn how the organ that we most closely identify with, our brain, works and the implications it has for our lives."
