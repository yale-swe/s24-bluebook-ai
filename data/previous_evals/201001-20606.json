    "If the student has a strong interest and knowledge of fine arts and theatre and is interested in using the course to further her thinking, I would recommend it.",
    "This class would have been better as either a real lecture or a real seminar course. As it was, it provided valuable insights into each film, quite separate from progressive notions of theatricality or what constitutes it. Professor Peucker is knowledgeable, kind, and organized -- qualities that were most definitely appreciated by her students. I would recommend this class with a change in its size and structure.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in film, theater, and\/or literature. The variety of films and critical articles covered in class allows for a great opportunity to enrich one's perspective.",
    "Very good course-- great syllabus and viewing list. Would recommend."

   "comments": [
    "This course promised much to my dissertation\/research, but in the end, I think, could only deliver to those students with a personal investment in the directors and\/or films at hand, and not to those with a deep interest in the notion of \"theatricality,\" aside from those films -- though the readings were well-chosen, and have been ultimately helpful to my own research.",
    "Although I take this course to fulfil the literature minor required in my department, it has been incredibly helpful to my research since I would like to develop an interdisciplinar topic, covering both literature and film criticism."
