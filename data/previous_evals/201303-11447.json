    "If you are a senior, you will have to take this class. It is a great class that really helps you in the process of finding a topic and developing a game plan for your senior essay. It really makes the process of writing the essay less stressful than it seems to be in other departments.",
    "This is part 1 of the Senior Essay, and you'll only take it as a senior Linguistics major.",
    "This is essentially a semester of preparation for the senior essay. Some of my friends in other majors were jealous that we had this sort of step-by-step guidance. Raffaella is wonderful, but you probably already know that by now."
