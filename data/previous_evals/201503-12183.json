    "Professor Dubcovsky is an incredible instructor who cares deeply about the development of her students, both academically and non-academically. I would recommend this course to first-year history students who are looking for a broad overview of American history yet wanting to have a seminar-style class.",
    "HIST 103 provides students with an understanding of American sociopolitics before the 1776 revolution. Rather than focusing solely on the European\/colonial perspective, Professor Dubcovsky makes sure to outline Native history and to delineate its importance. This class was not a mere college-version of AP US History, rather, it provides students with a framework by which to examine not only American culture, but other cultures as well. The quintessential Yale course, students explore early American history and get to take advantage of Yale's resources through trips to the Peabody, YUAG, among other experiences. Would definitely recommend this course to anybody whose interested in learning about colonial America from a unique perspective.",
    "This is an amazing course, so long as you take it with professor Dubcovsky. She is truly passionate about the material and gives captivating lectures while still allowing students a voice and perspective in their work. Also the midterm and final are extremely stress free.",
    "This class will open your eyes to an area of American history you are unlikely to have really explored before. Covering all aspects of the New World, this course gives insight into the origins of America and sheds light on less frequently studied areas of colonial history. I highly recommend this class.",
    "It's American History for the critical thinker. We work from primary sources, this isn't just a lecture class. YOU read the sources and YOU analyze them. And that's what history is about. There are so many more perspectives than just the white colonists that you read about in AP US and in this class you will learn about different native groups and slavery. You will be forced to think about native americans as nuanced groups instead of as a monolith. You will have to see that slavery was horrible. And then you will read Venture Smith and see that Africans participated in the process. And then you will have to think about American History in an entirely new way. (That's a good thing!) For everyone looking for a more inclusive look into the different groups that shaped early america, this is for you.",
    "Definitely take this class if you're interested in a holistic and cultural view of colonial America.",
    "HIST 103 covers pre-Revolutionary America and tells the story of all its inhabitants - native and European alike. I would absolutely recommend this course to another student, regardless of whether he or she was a History major or not. The class was the highlight of my semester.",
    "I would, but only if you're interested in colonial-era America. I liked History 103, but I was interested in the subject even before I started the course, and I suspect that someone who wasn't enthusiastic about the topics would not enjoy the class. However, if you are eager to study the subject, this is an excellent introduction and Professor Dubcovsky consistently makes it enjoyable and informative."
