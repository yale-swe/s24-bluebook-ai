   "comments": [
    "I was a little bit underwhelmed by this class. Stearns is brilliant and knows a lot about everything, but he does have a sort of idiosyncratic way of doing things. I think that the seminar set up is nice and you have some good discussions in class, but I would recommend not taking the 7-9pm time slot because that gets brutal after a couple weeks. Also the 7-9 slot has med students which, I mean no offense to the two who came to class they seemed like very nice people but they also bring a much different agenda & knowledge base and it can get a bit annoying after a while. My other main gripe is just that the workload is very high. The readings and responses for each seminar take quite a few hours, and then you have a term paper on top of that with assignments for that every other week or so. And on top of it all, you have a section, which is very unusual for a seminar. The section was pointless, too I liked the TAs but they very rarely had a curriculum for section that was clearly necessary from my perspective. But all that being said, Stearns is a fascinating and funny guy once you get past his initial intimidating facade. Id recommend this if you have a true interest in the subject matter, but dont expect an easy A and try to get away from the 7-9pm time slot. Id give this class a B+ only because the workload seemed unnecessary at times.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. The material was extremely interesting!",
    "This course is incredibly challenging but totally worth it. The work is hard because Professor Stearns expects quality so even though the amount of work isn't too bad, it takes a lot of time because you must put in the effort. The work is highly front loaded which you will appreciate come finals time.",
    "Evolution and Medicine was by far my favorite course this semester, and arguably in my entire time at Yale so far. Take this course if you are willing to work hard, keep an open mind, and learn a great deal. The seminar-style and structure of the class was wonderful. You watch several brief lectures, read a Chapter or two of the textbook, and answer some difficult questions that require you to really synthesize the material. You then come to a ~2 hour class once a week where you have the opportunity to ask any questions you had on either the papers or lecture or textbook material and this leads to truly insightful discussions. There is a final paper that is 15-20 pages and you are able to choose which topic (related to evolution and medicine) you would like to write it on. I learned an enormous amount about a burgeoning field doing research for this paper. Although there are grad students and medical students in this class don't be afraid to take it as an underclassman. Work hard, be sincere about learning the material and you will appreciate this class.",
    "This is a great class to gain a new perspective on scientific topics previously covered in any biology major's undergraduate studies. Evolutionary medicine does a fantastic job at making students question medical practices and propose improvements thanks to research conducted through an evolutionary perspective. Course structure overview: 1)Course readings 2)Scientific Literature 3)Weekly reading responses (500-600 words total) Note that items 1-3 must be completed at least 12 hours before class-time or else participation in class is not permitted. Mind you this helps to keep everyone engaged during the class period. 4) Term paper - it's basically your grade for the class. 20+ page scientific review of a topic of your choice (concerning evolutionary medicine). The course has its demands, but all the effort necessary to do well is very worth it.",
    "Relatively low work class with interesting ideas and papers and good discussion--mind that the grade is based almost entirely on the final paper, so it won't be clear what you get though.",
    "If you really liked BIOL 104, you should take this class. It is thought provoking, and the structure of the class allows for in-depth discussion of topics if you wish. It's unique in that the class also often has medical students and graduate students enrolled, so it's nice to learn from those students as well."
