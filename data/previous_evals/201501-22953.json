    "Advanced photo is a pretty free form class. The group is divided in two, and you have a crit every 2 weeks based on work you make outside of class. You can work in analog or digital, and it's a great chance to see the work of your upper level classmates, as well as get feedback from Gregory Crewdson.",
    "Take it with Lisa Kereszi.",
    "I would only recommend it to people who are serious about photography. It's a lot of work.",
    "If you want to have the room to really explore photographic ideas that you haven't had a chance to, take this class",
    "Take it if you want Gregory Crewdson to see your work and a semester of lassie style crits.",
    "This class will push you to make better art at a faster pace. Our class with Greg was very open so you could explore whatever you wanted to artistically. Greg has good comments and is very supportive. However, it wasn't as intense as I thought it would be and wished it was.",
    "Yes I will highly recommend the class to all the other students who are passionate about photography.",
    "Advanced Photography is an opportunity to work on your photography with complete freedom and get feedback on your work. This class requires a lot of self motivation, but attracts a great group of people and, with a good professor, can be a very good experience."
