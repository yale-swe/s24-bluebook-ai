   "comments": [
    "Do it! THB is so nice and really wants everyone to learn and succeed. This class changed my understanding of the world and my place in it.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. It is an incredibly interesting topic and studying this subject has made me think differently about a lot of things.",
    "an interesting class for someone interested in how neuroscience informs concepts like free will, morality, and the law",
    "Really cool subject matter and very manageable workload. This course will really change the way that you think about decision-making and will power. I'd highly recommend the class if you're interested in free will. But keep in mind that the discussions might get repetitive by the end of the semester, and there are probably better organized psych seminars out there.",
    "Great course that genuinely gets you thinking and talking about the topic (beyond the classroom and library and with your roommates and friends); healthy selection of sometimes obtuse but always interesting reading (not necessarily amounting to a \"balanced\" debate on free will, but probably an objective one); perhaps the inclusion of some additional philosophical material would be helpful; a good bit of reading and writing, but never on dull subject matters; fair tests but know some of the details provided by the slides (including names and neuroanatomy); Professor Brown is a knowledgeable facilitator of this course who definitely has his own opinions but is always keen on listening to (and sometimes debating) new ones; was always a pleasure to go to this seminar every week",
    "Great!! You should take it even if you're nervous about it being out of your comfort zone. This was a topic I hadn't thought about much before, and my perspective was greatly broadened. People of faith - don't be scared!",
    "If you are interested in topics like free will and morality, I really suggest this seminar. The one caveat is that this isn't a philosophy class.",
    "Great class, definitely worth taking. Not the most work, but probably one of the classes whose content I talked about the most with friends and family outside of the classroom. I really pushed me to think about my own life and big picture social issues and to draw on scientific thought and evidence when considering social and philosophical questions.",
    "Interesting topic but gets a bit repetitive. Because we are only arguing one side, there's only so many arguments to be made. Books were interesting to read, though they got repetitive too. Take this class if you want a chill senior class and interesting things to think about.",
    "Thomas Brown is awesome. If you like him you'd like the class. If you don't you might not. You read three books in the course. You don't need much neuroscience background to do well, but it doesn't hurt, and makes some of the ideas you learn about a bit more interesting.",
    "This course addresses, from a primarily scientific perspective the question of the existence of free will. Though this question cannot really be separated from philosophy and other disciplines entirely, it is NOT a philosophy course. You will not be discussing whether or not free will should or should not exist, or what we should or should not do in a given situation. You will simply learn that x causes y, which means z. And dry as I just made that sound, believe me, it is absolutely fascinating. Highly recommend. You will either look at the world in a whole new way, or learn how to defend the way you already look at the world. Plus you'll get to have really incredible conversations with classmates, friends, and family as you grapple with the topics discussed."
