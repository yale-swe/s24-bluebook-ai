   "comments": [
    "A brief and superficial survey of world history, IR theory, and current events. I would not recommend this course, but it was mandatory.",
    "yes",
    "This class attempts to give an introduction to international relations, but it is a big, unwieldy mess. I would not recommend it to anyone, but unfortunately, all Jackson master's students have to take it.",
    "I think it is useful but not especially so. Good for a broad coverage but not interesting especially if the topic for the week is not your cup of tea.",
    "I would recommend IR700 to another student who wanted an overview of international relations topics. The combinationof lectures, discussions, and case studies kept the course interesting and ensured that students learned something during each class session. Not every topic was covered in depth, but that wasn't the purpose of this foundational course. It did a good job of bringing together students with an undergraduate background in IR\/political science and those without.",
    "Yes I would, because it is a great opportunity to be in a class with the rest of the cohort and meet people and make connections and bond as a class. Plus, the course invites great speakers and the group presentations by students are very exciting.",
    "I would recommend it due to its strengths, as stated in my previous answers.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. Every aspect of the course (the Professor, the readings, and the assignments) contributed to my learning. It truly offers insight into the foundations of international relations. You get so much out of the course because of its in-depth analysis on such a wide range of topics covered (there is something for everyone.)",
    "IR 700 provides students with a broad overview of the major topics dealt with in International Relations, and provides the opportunity to discussion issues covered in readings and lectures in a group setting.",
    "A good foundation course, plenty of scope to lean to an interest and challenge you to areas you would not think about.Yes I would recommend the course, a great bonding experience.",
    "We all have to take the course, so a recommendation is somewhat moot.",
    "I highly recommend it.",
    "A different topic each week. Don't expect to gain much understanding about topics you've had minimal prior exposure too.I would not recommend this course as it was taught this semester. The structure really needs to be changed.A less combative teaching fellow would help as well.",
    "This class is a waste and an embarrassment to the Jackson Institute program. If it weren't a requirement, I would tell any student to avoid it.The professor does nothing to challenge his students and the memos, presentation and final paper just feel like busy work with no clear goal.",
    "Advice to a fellow student: you don't really have a choice on this one. Think of it as a rite of passage with your cohort. Deep breath -- it's just one semester, and you might even learn a thing or two..."

   "question_text": "How did this course deepen your knowledge of your discipline\/profession? To what extent did this course contribute to your dissertation\/research?",
   "comments": [
    "The case study presentations gave me an interesting perspective of my colleagues outlook on their specialties. This was the best part of the course.",
    "This class could have deepened my knowledge of international relations, but because it moved so quickly and covered so much ground, it felt like a whirlwind.",
    "I think it helped me entrench my perspectives on the efficacy of various themes and perspectives within IR, i.e. international law, humanitarian intervention,etc.",
    "This course broadened my knowledge of IR by covering a broad array of topics, both historical and contemporary. The readings, case studies, and lectures caused me to ponder questions I hadn't thought of before and exposed me to new ways of thinking about issues.",
    "I appreciate the look at a cross-section of international issues, but I feel that the short seminar does not give students enough incentive to prepare as they should. If there's 8 readings for a 40 min seminar with 20 students, each student really has to engage with each reading on the topic of interest to the class for a mereone-fourth of a min- probably less if we consider the time taken by the instructor and the TF. It'll be better to tighten up the course, combine the two seminars into a class and to shift to different priorities for this course. I think the dominant question should be: what should a course that brings together the entire cohort for the only time in their two-year program focus on? Developing cross-cutting skills or lightly reviewing academic readings on a range of issues?",
    "The course deepened my knowledge of international relations because it sparked my interest in issue areas that I previously did not pay very much attention to. It provided me with the theoretical background that helps explain so many aspects of international relations and not just the area that I hope to focus on in my future research. The course also raised very important questions that gives new insight into current affairs in international relations.",
    "IR 700 gave me a basic working knowledge of International Relations theory, and introduced me to the major topics in the field of study, such that I have a solid understanding of what the some of the major questions to be asked in each area are.",
    "I focused on China -and was able to write a paper exploring the Africa-China relationship.It was a great opportunity for me to gain a breadth on issues related to IR, areas that I wouldn't usually touch on and writers I wouldn't consider.I was able to put the role of international treaties and organisations in context and assess the relevance of them to my focus area.",
    "This course is really helpful. As a non-IR major for my undergraduate studies, I found this course very comprehensive and interesting.",
    "The course did very little to deepen my knowledge of my discipline\/profession."
