    "Great content. Some changes to the assignments\/ course layout would make this a must take course at FES.",
    "I'm a little conflicted what to write here. On the one hand, this class and lectures could be incomprehensible. Professor Fenichel, worked hard to adjust his expectations for this class, but it is clearly a work in progress. As a lecturer, Prof F. has a long way to go. He would often talk into the board, won't give us enough time to write down equations (and correct his errors) and process what we wrote before going off, and would often use different notations and symbols than the book would use (but this got better as the semester wore on).He would try really hard to break material down for us and would either over simplify it (Do people like fishing?) but more often enough it would be way over our heads.The book is tough, but if you combine it with the knowledge learned in other courses and I think with a good professor, it could be ok. It's pretty math intensive.Problem sets were soul crushing and left many of us feeling helpless. I would often spend 20 hours on one set with the TA helping me along and still turn it in incomplete. I understand that learning happens when students are pushed to take the knowledge they learn and take it to the next level, but that jump needs to be manageable.On the other hand, Professor F is so SO eager to help you learn this stuff and is really accessible. He always responded to emails quickly and tried to help during office hours. And I think he did end up adjusting expectations of students towards the end.I think ultimately this could be a useful course. But Professor F needs to understand that we're not here to get our PhD's in economics. This should either be a course cross taught in the econ department, or some of the math (either in the text or in class) needs to be water down.",
    "I found the pace of the class to sometimes be too slow and other times too fast, depending on the material. I believe this was done mostly to accommodate the broad range of skills of the students.I think the course load was very heavy relative to other classes. While the problem sets definitely helped with learning the material, I think they could have been slightly shorter or the questions made more clear. In some cases, a difficult to understand question made the entire process much lengthier than it should have been.The class project was certainly a creative way to take an existing study and apply it to another study site(s), which is a very useful skill in the field of economics. However, trying to coordinate the whole class to contribute their part of the project in a timely manner was very challenging. I also think some of the data was harder to find than initially believed, making the project more time consuming than originally believed.I personally would have appreciated more time to work on my final project, which taught me a lot about synthesizing course lessons and applying it to a specific study site. In fact, I think I learned the most from this project and it was exactly the type of knowledge and experience I hoped to gain from the class. I just wish I had had more time to work on it.One recommendation could be for students to focus on a term-long project, rather than a group project and a end of term project. Students could be required to have initial research and a rough idea of the model completed by spring break (or right after spring break). Students could receive initial feedback on the status of the project and some insight for improvement, which they can then work on until it becomes time to present. The presentation serves as another \"check point\", which gives the student sufficient time to finalize the project by the final due date.",
    "Because of his relatively short teaching experience, Professor Fenichel is still adapting to F&ES teaching style. However, he makes it in ases in double\/triple explaining the content in his office hours. He was really open to improve the course, even during the semester, and this is admirable. I feel Professor Fenichel has a great future as a professor, he just needs some time to adapt and gain more experience."

    "Gave a great introduction to ecological economics and a throughout use of mathematics to ground those concepts.",
    "Professor Fenichel working so hard outside of the class to help students with their own projects. He's still really awkward and hates being cornered unexpectedly, but once he calms down, he's a decent guy.",
    "The concept of the class (bioeconomic models) is very worthy of study.",
    "Gaining a broader understanding of bioeconomics and the types of models\/research used to value nature. Tackling the subject from many different perspectives, reviewing many different types of models\/research, was helpful.",
    "The applied nature of the problem sets, class project, and independent project. The professor's willingness to help during office hours and even other days of the week was incredibly useful and I think a really valuable asset to students who were struggling with the material.",
    "the ability to pick our own project topic to explore our interests",
    "Instructor's office hours were the most helpful aspect of the course! The assignments helped to fix the content, but too time demanding."

   "comments": [
    "The assignments are very heavy, and given the work load at the end of the course could be lightened. The overall content is strong, but the section on Social Welfare Functions could be re-worked to make the concept easier to grasp.",
    "Problem sets shouldn't leave students so helpless. Consider splitting the three problem sets into six, and make sure the problems actually have answers in the end.The group project did not work out. It's really hard to coordinate with 14 people and will inevitably leave many feeling like they did most of the work.",
    "The course needs better organization, with a more consistent progression through material. The course seemed to jump across varied topics and readings weren't planned in advance.",
    "Roughly 3\/4 of the class had absolutely no idea what the professor was talking about 3\/4 of the time. Very few people had the math background to keep up, and really one would need a solid economics, population dynamics, and math background to truly make the class worthwhile. The class needs to either be open ONLY to students with that background, or they need to be given materials to study over break so that they're prepared on the first day. That goes for the population dynamics and the economics - the math is not something that can be learned over a couple of weeks. I highly recommend that the course gets taught in such a way that keeps the equations to an absolute minimum, and ALL equations explained more clearly, provided in lecture notes ahead of time, with all variables explained. OR require that everyone has had two semesters of calculus in the past 2-3 years. In general, much closer attention needs to be paid to where the students are at with the material. When one or two people (the same people) answer\/ask questions, it doesn't mean the whole class understands. When the professor asks, is that clear, and no one responds, it means that no one understands. So much class time should not be spent on math that most of the class can't grasp, and we'll never be tested on. Reviewing how to solve problems such as those in the problem sets would have been much more useful than abstractly walking through equations. It would also be appreciated if Professor Fenichel would be more careful with how he speaks to students - it's clear that he really wants us to understand and definitely made himself available to answer questions, which is great. But his tone\/mannerisms\/word choice often came across as thinly veiled condescension. Finally, the material for the course should be described in full in the syllabus at the beginning of the semester, with suggested reading material for all topics and concepts.",
    "The class project was a waste of time. It mostly involved collecting and formatting data, and was hardly relevant to the vast majority of what we'd been learning about over the semester. At the end, the professor said that his incoming PhD student would be following up on the project, which made me feel like he assigned it just to use us as data-collecting minions.",
    "The pacing of the course and workload could be improved. I think the student should require that students have a basic math \/ calculus background so that less time is spent addressing these basic mathematical foundations and more time can be spent on actual modeling specifications and discussion.The workload, as mentioned in Question 14, could also be readjusted to make the lessons learned from these assignments clearer.",
    "the problem sets, i think that if we had shorter problem sets and maybe one or two more it would have been better. the problem set were way too long and hampered my understanding of the materials. It was too overwhelming.The group project was awful. It was time consuming and I took very little away from it. Data collection is something that we are familiar with. There were way too many people involved to have meaningful and equitable jobs.",
    "The fast pace, very demanding assignments, and attempt to cover all the content in detail are some aspects that could be improved."
