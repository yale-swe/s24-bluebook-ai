    "I gained a better understanding of the various, and numerous, periods of costume that I definitely needed to strengthen upon coming here. Jane is a great instructor with such profound knowledge of the class's content...clearly. I enjoyed doing classical plays, and eventhough the Schubert project was very emotional it was a refreshing assignment (Jane was also a lot more supportive of our emotional state compared to the Saturday class with he same project) The slideshows are also extremely helpful in understand a time period and giving a starting point for the research."
