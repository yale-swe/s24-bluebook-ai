    "STRONGLY recommend. One of the most interesting courses I've ever taken. Who knew Canada was so fascinating? As an American with no background in French, Canada, French Canada, or anything Canada-related, I learned a great great deal in this class. Probably one of the most educational courses I've ever taken, at Yale or anywhere.",
    "This is a great fifth class, i.e. it's fun and barely any work is required.",
    "For the love of everything holy, you MUST take this class. Professor Gitlin is one of the best instructors at Yale, and he absolutely shines in this course. In \"Quebec & Canada,\" you can expect to not only debate fascinating questions like Quebecois sovereignty, but you'll also have a chance to eat some poutine. POUTINE! Where else at Yale do you get to consume french fries dipped in gravy and cheese curds? Let alone for credit? Please, please, please, I am begging you to at least shop this course. Canada is fascinating. It is so much more than America's hat. You will not regret it. And if you do, at least you got to enjoy some poutine.",
    "Take it!!!",
    "Take it. It's super interesting and you will learn a lot about something you had no idea existed.",
    "Absolutely take this class.",
    "Take this course to understand what an exciting and unique country Canada really is. This seminar handles an incredible expanse of history by selecting pivotal moments in the nation's history to explore in depth. This meant the reading of primary materials and sometimes class debates on their contents. The meetings were partially devoted to review of contextual information in a quasi-lecture format that was successful in communicating broader concepts too!"
