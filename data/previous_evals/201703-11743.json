    "Students focus on the history of European written music from 1600-1900 (Baroque, Classical, Romantic, Modernism), and also learn about American music in the 1900s (blues, jazz, musicals, Indie Classical, etc.) at the end of the course. Students gain insight into the process of composing music in each of these styles and periods, and gain valuable knowledge of how to thoroughly analyze music while listening.",
    "I learned music history and gained the ability to listen to a piece and identify (with great accuracy) the era it was composed in, the genre, the form of the piece, style features, and who might have composed it.",
    "My biggest takeaway is that what we refer to as \"classical music\" actually includes hundreds of years and several musical periods & styles. I learned a bit about how to listen to music from these different periods and identify them by style elements.",
    "I now have a understanding of Bach, Mozart, Beethoven, etc. and classical music from 1600s to today.",
    "Learned valuable music history and listening skills",
    "History of music and composers since the Baroque Period, basic music theory"

   "comments": [
    "Strengths: engaging lecture with discussion between the students and the professor gain thorough knowledge of all topics covered very interesting assignments (e.g., concert and album reviews, analyzing listening charts of assigned pieces, etc.)",
    "Overall a really good class, not many weaknesses. My main complaint is that the quizzes required more studying than quizzes normally do, although the workload for the rest of the class was pretty average. I wonder if it would be better if the class only had quizzes and no exams, and the quizzes were more frequent (maybe once every 2 weeks or one quiz per era of music).",
    "This class was interesting, not too difficult if you put in a decent amount of work. I feel more informed about historical music trends, and like I would know what was going on if I went to a classical music concert.",
    "Really amazing course. Would have loved more written assignments. But otherwise it was taught very well, definitely learned a lot."

   "comments": [
    "If you've been remotely interested in music of the past, whether it be classical, jazz, or electronic music, you should certainly take this class. You will learn a lot about extremely interesting topics in a welcoming environment that's a blend of a seminar and a lecture.",
    "This class is really solid. Even if youre not that interested in music, you will be by the end of it. You leave the class both with the ability to identify the era, genre, form and style of pretty much any (Western) composition after 1700. Would recommend!",
    "This class was not at all what I expected. It was almost entirely focused on music before ~1920 or so, and you mostly learn the \"cultivated tradition\" as opposed to pop or folk music, so if you're expecting to learn about modern music trends, you may be disappointed. There's also not much music theory introduction, so if you're not a musician, you may struggle with some of the deeper levels of material. Moral of the story - go if you want to understand \"classical\" music, not if you're interested in the theory behind rock\/pop\/etc.",
    "This is a good class to learn about music if you have minimal or no music experience. You will have to put in work, but you will be very knowledgeable. A solid humanities credit.",
    "Definitely take this course if you want a good humanities credit, or even just to learn more about music history."
