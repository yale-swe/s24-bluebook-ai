   "comments": [
    "NO.Why is this course a mandatory first year subject?Why are we pushed to submit to one persons view of formal analysis so early on in our academic careers???There are many ways of analyzing form, but we are made to parrot one mans highly personal, idiosyncratic approach. Eisenman is an asset to Yale, but unless the school is oriented to produce facsimiles of Eisenman, then this class is completely inappropriate as a first year core subject.This should be an elective.A wide-ranging overview of formal analysis in our first year would have been infinitely more useful.",
    "Yes, I feel that the placement of the class in the first semester is very beneficial as students can immediately begin to apply its approach to architecture to all other classes.",
    "yes",
    "This class is right where it should be.",
    "It should occur 2cd year, as students begin to explore particular interests throughelectives. The course is far too narrow minded for first year.",
    "This was an excellent course to take in my first semester because it engaged a different way of working with theory at a time when learning about the school and Yale in general was a big question and therefore helped shape an understanding of what this school has to provide that others don't, early on. Additionally, the coursework followed a predictable pace with regular or weekly assignments which was very valuable in a first semester class because it made time management much easier. This quality is in contrast to Visualization where assignments weren't known until that week and took varying amounts of time to complete.",
    "This was an excellent and challenging course to have in the first semester sequence.",
    "I think that this is an important course to have first sememster. It is in the proper sequence.",
    "Yes. It taught a way of thinking that every student should explore for at least a semester.",
    "I think this class fits at the beginning of first year. The subject matter taught in the course complements the Modern Architecture course nicely.",
    "It occurs in the proper sequence.",
    "Great course to have in first year of the program.Very interesting material and great to have first hand look at an architects (Eisenman's) personal approach to architectural analysis.Stimulates thought.",
    "It should not occur the same day as studio. Other than that it was fine.",
    "I believe this course occurred in proper sequence. It is important to understand abuilding in terms of its basic ideas early in an architectural education.",
    "I think this is the best class we had this semester, and it is definitely essentialin the first-year.",
    "The course happens at the right time, it should be taken at the very beginning, otherwise, students may confuse the Professor'sagenda.",
    "This course is sequenced correctly. In combination with Kurt Forster's history class, I feel like I have both a substantially improved understanding of architectural history but also a new set of lenses of which to look and analyze architecture.",
    "Yes, this course was excellent for the first semester at Yale. I think that it wasthe most valuable course.",
    "Yes.",
    "Yes, formal analysis should remain a first semester course. It reinforces the process of technical\/skill learning in other classes (visualization and studio), is a good pre-cursor\/companion to modern architecture, and exposes us to a method of working unique from that taught in Studio.",
    "Yes, this is the best period in graduate school to have this course.",
    "Yes, it was an interesting counterpoint to our design studio.",
    "Yes.",
    "yes",
    "I consider this course to be of questionable value as a first semester requirement.The workload distracts from studio too much.",
    "This class would probably fit better during the spring semester of first year. This class would be a great follow-up to Visualization II and Modern Architecture History.",
    "Yes.",
    "I think that having the course in the first semester is good as it provides an interesting perspective on architectural history and theory.",
    "Yes",
    "Yes. The course sequence is appropriate."

   "comments": [
    "All good",
    "The body of information was presented well, but I do feel that the transition from classical architecture to modern was somewhat abrupt. Piranesi to Loos was a big transition. The syllabus was excellent and very clearly.",
    "The work was fine, but the class is really too big to get the best of peter. I look forward to taking his second yr seminar instead.",
    "I very much look forward to seeing what the next dialectic of the course is.",
    "The material covered many eras of architecture which allowed us to critically analyze many different approaches to architecture. The assignments were exactly what they should have been.",
    "Overall, strong. The assignments became redundant, since they were always more or less the same assignment, executed in the same medium, except looking at a different building. The same goes for the syllabus. I think most of the class got the gist of \"grammar and rhetoric\" in the first month, and the following examples were merely driving it home and beyond.",
    "It was an intriguing way to study theory. The structure fit in well with other course work because it was predictable and paced in a regular or weekly interval. I feel studying theory in a way that engages not only through writing but through drawing as well is an invaluable contribution to my education.",
    "The content of the course was well-organized and engaging. The weekly drawing assignments were a stimulating challenge, while the readings, though often extensive, were relevant and fascinating. The in-class lectures were always great, and it sometimes felt that they were short-changed in favor of the drawing reviews. The drawing reviews were helpful in general. The sessions where Professor Eisenman and the TA\u0092s discussed the drawings were great, but the session where only the students discussed the drawings was also helpful. It would have been good to have more of a balance between these two styles. The classes devoted to discussing every single person\u0092s drawings were totally unnecessary and should not be repeated in the future.",
    "I found the body of material and sequence to be entirely appropriate to the course.",
    "I felt covering both Renaissance churches and modern buildings was more helpful than just concentrating on the former. Material could not have been taught nearly as well without weekly drawings-- I thought the amount and type of work was great. I was disappointed that the semester seemed to be abbreviated by a week, and that we didn't get to cover more material. Classes where we went over 'forgotten' drawings were not helpful to me, nor was the student-run drawing discussion in the second to last class.",
    "I enjoyed the assignments immensely. I believe that they provide you with a good body of diagrams upon exiting the course.Perhaps it would have been better if the paper were due a little earlier in the semester, before the sing-a-long.",
    "Overall - I thought the material presented to be appropriate and in good order\/sequence. The length of the assignments was appropriate though the TAs should have visited the studios earlier in the week or perhaps over the weekend to allow for more thought to the subject matter - perhaps resulting in better drawings overall.",
    "Clear and cohesive course content (i.e. architectural grammar and rhetoric through the Renaissance, Baroque, Modern). Weekly drawing assignments were extremely valuable in terms of sharpening analytical and graphic sensibilities.",
    "Extremely well planned. Great progression through architects and buildings. Very interesting subject matter. I learned more about these buildings this semester than when I actually visited them in Europe.",
    "The readings and lectures provided an adequate background for the drawing assignments. Some of the more difficult assignments (e.g. Nolli, Loos) were placed in the middle of the sequence, rather than at the end.",
    "Peter's class made me think about architecture is ways I never have, and I have learned a great deal. The subject matter, the lectures, the drawings were all very good.",
    "The content was fair, but partially limited. There should be more encouragement for individual exploration.",
    "I found the subject material, lectures, and readings incredibly interesting and useful. This course seems unique to me and I'm grateful that I had the opportunity to participate in it.",
    "The course was well\u0096organized, the lectures corresponded with the content of the assignments, and the readings supported and helped the drawing assignments, so overall it was a very well\u0096prepared course. It covered a lot of information which was mostly organized chronologically, so one could easily follow the development and appearance of new ideas over time.",
    "the chronological sequence of buildings\/architects makes perfect sense (it could be interesting in reverse order as well?).the off-weeks with no drawings were oddly placed though very much appreciated.the assigned drawings were always challenging and rewarding.",
    "I know that the syllabus has been set in stone for many years and will not likely change in the future. I think that's ok, because it represents Peter's personal ideology, and it's his course.",
    "Assigning the first few assignments to be hand-drafted was not helpful. Most people trace them anyway, and the value of hand-drafting is questionable at best.",
    "The sequence of the course was worked well. We were able to cover a large range of topics with a pretty logical flow. There was a large jump in the middle of the course that could be smoother. Also the final paper is too much work to handle in the short amount of time following studio reviews. If the paper length and amount of drawings were reduced, the quality of the work would be vastly improved.",
    "The sequence, syllabus and assignments are good.",
    "I think that this course was very interesting. I think that Peter Eisenman is an interesting figure in architectural discourse and, while I did not agree with everything he said, hearing his perspectives first hand was very stimulating.",
    "I think it works very well and works nicely beside studio.",
    "Please refer to answer 8."

   "comments": [
    "I had high expectations for this class given Mr. Eisenman\u0092s reputation in the profession, and I feel that they were met.",
    "I expected to do formal analysis.Instead, this course is more like 'critical composition' - with the focus being more of graphics than actual analytic ability.This was not meant to be a course on graphics, but people were rewarded for 'nice-looking' drawings.",
    "Way exceeded my expectations. Was actually the class I was looking forward to least and ended up being the class I enjoyed the most and felt like I learned the most from.",
    "This course imparted a way of thinking that is entertaining and provocative for a short time. The lesson became stale as soon as I realized that it does not apply to anything beyond what Eisenman considers \"architecture\"- very little.I was impressed by the TA's involvement. It was fantastic to have peer reviewers, who we could also discuss our work with in a less formal setting.",
    "I had no firm expectations coming into this course. Overall, the course was excellent in all its aspects and blew away any expectations I had.",
    "I think the only expectation that I had for this course was that it would be rigorous, and that expectation was met. Other than that I did not know what to expect.",
    "Expectations: see architecture through a new frame-- understand better what the hell PE means by grammar and rhetoric, practice drawing an idea.Met: Yes, definitely. Before the class started, I was hesitant that PE would be enigmatic or otherwise difficult to understand, but he was extremely clear. I surely saw things through his frame.",
    "I didn't really come in to the class with many expectations. However, I was surprised at how much I enjoyed learning about the buildings each week and coming up with ways to represent my ideas.",
    "No idea what to expect so this makes the question difficult to answer - but I think I absorbed quite a bit over the course of the semester. In conjunction with History-Theory with Forster I would say the combination seems very appropriate and useful in terms of understanding different architectural ideas from different architects not simply over the modern era.",
    "All I knew to expect was to be drawing in black and red a lot, and that was fulfilled.I didn't expect to learn as much as I did about these specific buildings. That was great.",
    "I wish there were more lectures, those were the most interesting part of the course.",
    "I expected to learn how to analyze and draw the formal composition of buildings at various scales. I felt the course helped me to do this.",
    "I expected to learn a great deal about architecture as a discipline, and this class delivered.",
    "My expectations for the course were met, since the majority of my drawings caught the attention I desired. It was only sad to see that the Professor emphasized his attention in the student's previous schools and respective recommendations.",
    "I was expecting more lectures. Throughout the semester Prof. Eisenman canceled or rushed through several lectures. The lectures were by far the highlight of the course and were a crucial part of the process of learning this brand of analysis.I was also expecting that the drawing reviews would be far more rigorous. Peter started the class explaining that a drawing was only going to be discussed if it looked interesting and asked to be spoken about (i.e. graphically appealing) but would be abandoned if it lacked an interesting ideas. However, it seemed that throughout the semester we never got beyond useless conversations about graphics.",
    "I did not have a clear expectation for this course; in fact, I did not really know what to expect. But at the end, I was very pleased with what I have learned, with the information that was covered during the semester, and the work that was produced.",
    "I had no idea what to expect for this course. Mainly I was intimidated by the idea of creating analytical drawings, but I learned that they are easier to make than I thought, once you learn the \"grammar.\"",
    "I expected Peter Eisenman to be a character and there was no disappointment there.",
    "This being Peter\u0092s class, the expectations were high. The class met them for the fact that we could spend a semester learning\/experimenting the analytical methods in Peter's fashion.",
    "I was expecting the lectures to play a more important role in the course. Coming into the course, I also thought that the drawings would be more diagrammatic than they were."

   "comments": [
    "Very low value. This course grooms people to be part of Eisenman's adoring circle. In my opinion, Eisenman is irrelevant to all but his followers. I do not wish to be one of his followers, so this course gave me very little.",
    "Through this class I gained a new appreciation of classical architecture and, without exaggeration, a new, deeper, way of looking at architecture in general. I can easily say that other than my studio, this was the most important and mentally stimulating class of the semester.",
    "I did learn a lot about:1. history2. grammar (and rhetoric)and in this sense the course was educational in many ways.In many ways I do feel that the course opened my eyes to the ideas behind architecture, and to the possibility of drawing not the architecture, but those abstract ideas.This was a breakthrough that I am thankful for.",
    "This course more than any other this semester taught me how to analyze in a way in which I was not familiar. Studio moves so quickly that we often fall back into ideas and methods we know work, but this course is so completely different and demands so much intense observation that we are all forced to do things a new way. Though often extremely frustrating, I felt that I am taking something away from this course that I can apply to other courses and a way of thinking I can apply to my work after Yale.",
    "This was an absolutely amazing course, the best I've ever taken. This is the kind of course which Yale's reputation is founded on. Without Peter (as well as the high level student body) the first year could be in Anywhere, USA. Yale needs more people like Peter with an actual idea and a deeply personal investment in his students.",
    "This class was invaluable. I believe I have learned more about architecture from this class than any other class I have ever taken. It was history, theory, and studio all in one. I can't truly express in words how much this class has done for me.",
    "I am not sure.",
    "On a scale of 1 to 5 where 1 is the most valuable, I rate this class a 1. As stated earlier, engaging theory not only through writing but also through drawing made for a very rich learning experience that I found invaluable as a first semester student.",
    "This course was extremely valuable in presenting a highly specific way of looking at and analyzing architecture that I found useful and instructive. I wish there had been time to study some of the subjects more in-depth, but in looking at the history of the discipline from the Renaissance to Modernism was an excellent way of structuring the course. Introducing the lens of grammar and rhetoric was also very valuable. Overall, the course introduced me to many theoretical ideas that I had not been exposed to before. The weekly assignments were also a great way to develop methods of conveying complex ideas through drawing. This was by far the most valuable course I took all semester.",
    "I think the value of this course to me was the ability to really look at a building and understand what was happening. I also think that my ability to convey an idea through drawing was greatly improved.",
    "I liked learning the things I did in this course. I am unsure if I am better at doing what Peter wants from us.",
    "Particularly useful when thinking of studio projects and my own designs-- how to analyze them and not illustrate them.",
    "We learned a particular approach to analyzing architecture as well as honed our graphical representation skills.",
    "Very valuable.",
    "For me, this was the most valuable course of the semester. It taught me how to read closely into architecture, and greatly sharpened my critical aptitude. It was a treat to study with Professor Eisenman.",
    "It was very interesting. I'm not sure how relevant it is in today's discourse of architecture, but it did a great job of opening the door to a very specific way of looking at architecture and forced us to explore it at a very deep level.",
    "I take an interest in using diagrams as a way of converting ideas into architectural form. The course helped me develop a more critical approach, which I find invaluable.",
    "I feel this class is essential and has given me a great foundation of knowledge.",
    "I cannot comment on the value of this course until I know my grade, which hopefully will reflect the Professor's view on my performance.",
    "This course presented a new technique for analysis that I find very compelling. It has also taught me the value of graphic representation and has helped me present arguments, that I would previously have considered to be solely verbal, in a visual context (which, needless to say, is a pretty fascinating exercise).",
    "The class had tremendous potential to be extremely valuable. But it seems that the course lost all if its hard critical attitude towards the architecture we were looking at and the work we produced.",
    "This course was extremely valuable to me. It taught me to have a more critical approach to viewing and analyzing architecture that I didn't have before.",
    "I found this course to be more than valuable. Unlike a \u0093traditional\u0094 history class, this course allowed and encouraged me to look at architecture through a different lens. I knew most of the buildings that were part of the drawing assignments, but I had never looked at them closely, with a critical eye. Also, the readings that accompanied the assignments were absolutely critical in understanding the buildings we were analyzing, and I found them very valuable, not just for this class, but for my whole architectural education.",
    "Peter's course is absolutely essential for the M.Arch program. It demands simultaneous application of all the tools and intellect being stimulated in the other courses, while serving as a weekly change-of-pace in the mode of working. Though not apparent at first, the lectures were truly interesting and engaging. I really enjoyed hearing Peter evaluate, explain, and judge the litany of buildings as projects with ideas and goals - and failures.Whether he is \"right\" or not does not matter, he makes it clear that he is presenting his own opinion - and I believe the opportunity to hear it was one of the most valuable parts of my first semester.",
    "It's was a great experience to take a critical view of history from an architectural proof understanding. Learned more about form and systems of tectonics than I did in the standard history course.",
    "This course was eye-opening to me, because it represents not only a traditional method of teaching architecture but also a traditional system of mentorship that a select few can benefit from. The course felt like a training program that was more for the TAs\u0092 benefit than for the students\u0092. It seemed like the entire semester was a way for Peter to identify and encourage like-minded students, and everyone else got the peripheral benefits of learning about grammar and rhetoric.",
    "The course to some degree purported an ideology that is no longer very relevant. Considering the amount of time the work for the class takes up, that energy might be better spent elsewhere.",
    "I learned how to read buildings in a more in-depth way. Furthermore, I learned a particular school of diagramming and analysis. The only problem was that there was little room for exploration beyond what Peter Eisenman finds palatable.",
    "This course was valuable to me, but I have a vested interest in the material. The class was certainly divided in its value. Some opined that it was a waste.",
    "I thought that the course was interesting and that looking at architecture through formal analysis was very helpful.",
    "I found the course very valuable; the weekly assignments, culminating in the final paper\/drawings were very effective in learning how to read and analyse architecture. Each drawing was a struggle with a fruitful outcome."

   "question_text": "Comment on the effectiveness of the teaching by the courses's instructor",
   "comments": [
    "Eisenman is closed minded, arrogant, bigoted and nepotistic. He shamelessly favors students according to their undergraduate colleges or their status at Yale.He loves to speak about the inane, esoteric and irrelevant world of American sports, despite the fact that most of the class wishes that he would not.I look forward to the day when Yale's vanguard of political correctness becomes aware of the racially charged comments he makes, and the YSOA is compelled to discard him as a liability.His TAs are starstruck sycophants. They openly promote the production of work that does not challenge, but only reinforces Eisenman's ideas. I was shocked and dismayed at how powerless they wereto assist me and others who were not completely convinced that Eisenman's analytical methodology was the only way.",
    "Peter was a great teacher and very personable. I do wish, however, that he was a bit more sensitive to issues of racial and gender equality. Some of his comments, which I know he meant as jest, were in the grey area of political correctness. (I chalked this up to generational differences.) In the future, if he could just keep personal asides within the realm of college sports, that would be fine by me. All of the TA\u0092s were extremely helpful, but Palmyra was especially supportive and encouraging.",
    "The TAs are GREAT!The system Eisenman has in place (TAs presenting work is great)",
    "The TAs were fabulous in this course! They met with us for 5+ hours each week and were constantly available for consultation. They worked their tails off and we are all extremely grateful! Peter picked wisely.",
    "Peter is an amazing instructor and the TA(s) were instrumental in the success of the course. Kate Thatcher, my TA, spent so much time helping me with the drawings and went above and beyond to be there for me. Between the material presented by Peter and Kate being there to help with the drawings I was able to absorb so much and push my critical thinking skills to the max. I am so appreciative of Peter, Kate, and the other TAs for the creating a course that was invaluable to my education.",
    "Again, I though Eisenman's point were reductive and redundant, and that he has no interest in learning himself. He discourages individual thinking, which is demonstrated in the way he runs his class, which is a major detriment to his teaching ability.The TAs had a difficult job and were excellent at spending the time with us to develop our thoughts the night before pin ups. Again, having peer reviewers was invaluable. I did not like that they spoke for us, explaining our drawings to Eisenman in his language, for us. This makes the students passive bystanders even regarding the work they've done,and does not teach students how to speak.",
    "Peter created a vibrant learning atmosphere that fostered engagement with the material as well as a desire to produce excellent work. However, on several occasions he made either sexist or racist remarks that made many students feel uncomfortable. Additionally, the TA's including mine, Daniel Markewicz, were extremely helpful and dedicated to the class. They made insightful comments in and out of class that contributed to a great learning experience.",
    "Professor Eisenman was a great instructor. In particular, his willingness to answer questions on any topic was both refreshing and illuminating. His viewpoint on architecture is very specific, but it isn\u0092t necessary to agree with everything he says in order to appreciate the course and his teaching methods. He presented the content of the course extremely well, and his drawing critiques were always on-point.The TA\u0092s were all excellent and went above and beyond to help us with the drawing assignments.",
    "I thought Peter was very effective. I don\u0092t think any more could have been asked of the TA\u0092s. They spent hours with us on every Wednesday night talking through our ideas and critiquing our drawings.",
    "This class was just a little bit to absurd for me to provide an opinion on any of the people that made it possible. I think my review would tend towards the cynically positive.",
    "I think PE teaches best when he's not trying to be friends with the students. Here he gets himself into trouble occasionally. As I have stated, the lectures and drawing discussion were extremely clear. One got the impression that we were always evaluating work, not the students themselves, which made the discussions much more constructive and effective.The TAs were fantastic-- Kate, Palmyra, and Daniel were particularly insightful and helpful. They probably get more than we do out of the class in the end. It is a great follow-up to actually taking the class.",
    "The TAs were invaluable to our development, and I appreciate all the time and effort that they spent on helping us every week.",
    "The culture of the course is detrimental to the invaluable subject matter that it covers. I think that by the end of the semester, many students found themselves believing in the importance of architectural analysis, but disillusioned by the manipulative way in which it is presented.The relationship between the TAs and the Professor was unprofessional and left most of the class feeling disenfranchised. While the reading, looking, and drawing assignments are valuable, they were typically only discussed by the TAs and Professor. Input from students was rarely solicited, and the \"student-run\" days were even less helpful. During discussion, there should be a less clear divide between those enrolled in the class and those teaching. Those discussions that featured many different students' voices, along with those of the professor and TAs, were by far the most useful and engaging.While there should clearly be a distinction drawn between successful and unsuccessful work, this class encouraged an unhealthy competition between students which I believe hindered the quality of the work.",
    "TAs - see Q4.Instructor (Eisenman): I would say that Eisenman has his own views and they are difficult to change. This means that if he has seen a drawing before which he likes - he keeps that bias in mind for future years. Thus making it difficult to challenge his preconceptions. This can be somewhat discouraging and a deterrent to attempting to creatively analyze through a new or different lens.",
    "The TA's were instrumental to the success of the course. There was generally little interaction between the students and Professor Eisenman, and the TA's were key in communicating the agenda and culture of the course to the students. Without fail, the TA's met with us individually every Wednesday evening to work through our drawing ideas.",
    "The class is a circus. I learned a lot, but the way the actual class is conducted is pretty embarrassing and unnecessary. I don't even know how to explain it, it's a spectacle. In a bad way.",
    "Prof. Eisenman presented the historical and philosophical background extremely clearly in lectures. The TAs provided good advice during the drawing critiques. The weekly discussion sections were less useful. We sometimes spent half the time talking about things that had nothing to do with the course.",
    "All the TA's were helpful and very knowledgeable.",
    "The Professor was very effective during his lecture session. The second component of the class seemed to be more like training to the TAs than for the students. I wish I had paid fully for my own training and not for others. Overall, my views on them ended up being all fair yet not fully satisfactory.",
    "Peter is clearly a master of his subject and I found his methodology to be largely effective. I wish he would allow current students to act as critics during weekly pin-ups rather than calling repeatedly on the TAs. I think we would have learned more if we had been more actively engaged in the conversation. At very least we should have been allowed to defend and discuss our own drawings.",
    "I appreciate the time and commitment of the TAs for the course. It was extremely helpful to get to discuss ideas and get advice about execution. However, I often times felt that the TAs tried hard to guide me in a particular direction or a particular execution because they knew that is what fit into the narrow spectrum of 'what Peter likes', instead of helping me develop my own ideas of how to analyze the buildings at hand.",
    "Peter was a great instructor and all of the TAs were excellent.",
    "The structure of the class and the teaching method (through lectures, class discussions, and drawing assignments and their evaluations) were very effective. The instructor and the teaching assistants encouraged individual exploration while providing a basic structure and support, so I cannot think of a better way to teach this kind of material in class.",
    "I am only responding to one question, because I understand that Mr. Eisenman has limited patience for such things, and I don't want to risk repeating myself.This course was fascinating, but generally for unintended reasons.The structure of evaluating drawings for their effectiveness in conveying an idea about a building was futile. While each of the TA's had strongly held opinions, the work was ultimately subject to the fancy of the professor, and the discussion was typically consumed with disputes over graphic choices.The lecture component was interesting, but could easily have been condensed into a single, cohesive presentation, rather than spread across each class period.The value of the material, I feel, is predicated upon ones acceptance of a particular 'ontology' of architecture. That is to say, \"Formal Analysis\" is only valuable 'as such' if one accepts Mr. Eisenman's hypothesis that one should only consider architecture on these terms. That is, if it is believed that a line can exist as only a connection between two points - an abstraction - rather than a thing which possesses thickness and material existence.What I find truly valuable, though, was the chance to be exposed to and interact with a successful, accomplished, and unabashed architect. While I won't go into any great detail, I'm grateful for the opportunity to study Mr. Eisenman's personality and opportunistic behaviors which have served him so well. His straightforward teaching style, while sometimes appalling, was ultimately the most enjoyable aspect of the class, and I'm very glad for his presence.",
    "I initially loved Peter's tendency to provide \"entertainment\" at the start of class, but as the course progressed and I realized how exciting the meat of the lectures was, I began to wish for more seriousness.The TA's were excellent and vitally important for understanding the class, the projects and the assignments. Kate Thatcher, Brian Spring, and Daniel Markiewicz were great.",
    "TA's did an awesome job at building drawings with the students and understanding problems presented in each exercise. So very helpful.",
    "I enjoyed Peter\u0092s lectures, for the most part, but I found the drawing reviews extremely frustrating because everyone in the class worked all night to produce a drawing that usually did not get discussed, and we were not encouraged until the very end of the semester to speak up and defend ourselves and our ideas against the very sharp criticism coming from the TAs and Peter, so there was very little motivation to keep working hard all semester. I suspect this is why many students stopped pinning up drawings part way through the semester, because it did not seem worthwhile to give up another night of sleep for a drawing that would go unnoticed or be harshly criticized. I don\u0092t necessarily agree with that attitude, and I always did the work, but I can understand why participation dropped during the semester.",
    "discussions and critique of work were very helpful. Did not think we needed to spend 2 days tediously reviewing and discussing each student's drawing. Class discussions reviewing work from each section in general as opposed to individually were far more insightful and interesting. I believe individual discussions of work should occur w\/ TAs, who are more than capable of this.",
    "The TAs were of varied quality, though overall good.",
    "Peter Eisenman was very effective in the small group discussions and drawings reviews. However, his lectures were often lackluster. The TAs were incredible and did twice the work of any other TA I had. I appreciated their dedication and knowledge throughout the semester.",
    "Peter is an effective professor and so were the TAs.",
    "I thought that Peter Eisenman was a good professor and that the TA\u0092s were also good. I think that it would have been better had we had more class discussions.",
    "The class time could be better spent with less sports talk and chatting with individual students on the entire class's time.",
    "Please refer to answer 8."

    "1. Make this class an elective. Give first year students some variety in their learning on this subject.2. Make all pin-ups anonymous. That this is not already the case reinforces the fact that nepotism, favoritism and prejudice are accepted and in some quarters, promoted at this school.3. Site Peter Eisenman down and explain to him that even though he was famous once, he cannot treat his students with contempt and expect to remain employed.",
    "The final paper seemed a little tacked-on to the end of the semester. Also seven drawings seemed superfluous Three or four would have been much more manageable and meaningful as we could focus more energy on them.",
    "More focus on analysis!Less focus on graphics!Save the graphics for visualization, please!",
    "None. It is perfect.",
    "At a later point in the curriculum, or not at all.",
    "To improve the course, more time should be given to the lecture portion. The drawing reviews could include a greater balance of student participation with TA\/instructor input. However, having classes devoted to reviewing every person\u0092s drawings is not necessary.",
    "I think because all of the drawings were pinned up at once, then a few were picked out, the course became more of a graphic exercise than the real formal analysis that was intended. If one had a good idea but it wasn\u0092t drawn in a compelling way, it would never get talked about, but if one drew something that had no idea behind it, but looked good, it would get talked about. I am not sure what system would work better to reinforce drawings about ideas, but I think that is something that needs to be considered.",
    "I found my best drawings were the ones I discussed the least with the TAs and spent the least amount of time on because they were the loosest. Therefore, some sort of quick sketch assignment-- sketch the idea of the buildings in class, say, or draw the modern buildings by hand without a straight edge-- I think would be helpful. Also, some sort of public speaking seminar outside of this class for the first years is badly needed.",
    "I believe the quality of the final paper would be higher if there were fewer than 7 drawings or fewer than 7 pages.",
    "If possible - spread the class hours out over two days in the week.Its a very long class and with our scientifically proven - 30 minute attention spans - it gets to be difficult to listen to one person for too long or cover all of the drawings.",
    "Have the TA's and Peter relax a little bit. It sounds trite, but it would help the atmosphere of the class greatly and make it much more enjoyable.",
    "More time spent on lectures and maybe followed by discussions about the lectured material.",
    "Prof. Eisenman should allow us to take notes in lectures. There were some important ideas that I wanted to write down, but could not, because he forbade us from writing in notebooks. Also, it would be helpful if the TAs would have drawing critiques several days before the deadline, not the night before. Also, I felt exploration into different ways of representation was discouraged.",
    "Although I feel this class is excellent, the one turn-off I have is Peter's obsession with determining who is better than who, and who \"gets it.\" This is neither important or representative of a student's design capabilities. Peter alluded multiple times that the best students in the school performed the best in Formal Analysis. This is simply untrue, as some of the greatest designers in the class were unmotivated in this class, and the students who didn't necessarily stand out in studio performed superbly in Formal Analysis. However, I ignored these tendencies and enjoyed the class immensely.",
    "There should be more emphasis on the readings. The day in which the students replaced the TAs was sad. Many student have no idea of what they're speaking of. They cannot even give a strong presentation of their own work. They used terms imitating the professor and TAs without having the sightless idea. Considering this was close to the end, this is something to worry about.As the professor said may time, reading and writing is crucial to the education of the architect. There should have been more papers to write.The selection of the TAs should be stronger too, especially considering that they are the ones available to the students. Although I had no problems with my TA (who was great by the way), some of the other TAs had no place in the class, as they lacked the knowledge necessary to guide students or give consistent verbal presentations and critiques.",
    "My one complaint with this course has less to do with Peter's teaching style than with his personal conduct. He made several offensive comments (about women and minorities) during class sessions, which I think he should be called to task for. He has also established an obvious and extremely bizarre personal hierarchy involving the TAs and the first year students he prefers. His open acknowledgment of this preferential system is inappropriate, not to mention irrelevant, within the context of an academic institution.",
    "My only suggestion would be to encourage and allow for student interaction during the drawing reviews. I realize that it was never discouraged, but there were many times where the conversation was strictly between the instructor and the TAs, and any student interruption or comment was nearly impossible. That is not to say that it was not informative, quite the contrary. And I understand that with fifty students in class, it is difficult to engage everyone. But perhaps the students whose drawings were being talked about could be more encouraged to explain their ideas to the class.",
    "I would have liked to not have lost any lectures, while still keeping the few off-weeks with respect to drawing assignments.The two classes in which we talked only about our drawings were a waste of time. I know many of us would have preferred a lecture from Peter.",
    "Don't let the TAs micromanage the class so much. They talked too much and discouraged participation in the drawing reviews. They also had very specific visions for what our drawings should look like, and even though they knew (correctly) what kind of drawings Peter likes best, they didn't allow for any trial and error, and it is hard to truly learn that way.",
    "would like class discussions and review of work to include students. Only TA's were engaged in most discussions of drawings. These were very interesting to listen too and provoked much thought, and I believe are critical in the success of the course and what we learn, however, I think there could be a better balance between student and TA discussion. Students are capable of more than just listening.",
    "One of the main deliverables for the course was the final analytical paper with accompanying diagrams. According to the TFs the final paper and portfolio had a very strict deadline of 5 PM on Friday the 18th. However, it has come to my attention that the TFs allowed some students to hand in their paper and portfolio at 9:30 AM the next morning.Clearly, being a TF for this class is one of the more desirable TF positions for some people. The paper and portfolio will be one of the deciding factors for who gets those positions. Thus, allowing some students an additional 16 hours to finish their work simply because they otherwise would not finish the paper to their satisfaction is not fair to other students who rushed to meet the deadline or sacrificed the quality of other work.",
    "This class would benefit from being during the second semester of first year. The class could be more open and embracing of other ideologies other than Peter Eisenman\u0092s. Also the finalpaper needs to be rethought to fit with the amount of time allotted.",
    "A rambling few thoughts.For one, the beginning was filled with tangential lectures and question and answers. This happened a few times throughout the year. As a result we lost a couple of lectures. I would wish the TAs could be more forceful and keep the class and Peter on track.There\u0092s a sense, the way Peter speaks to the class, that there\u0092s an anything goes conversational attitude. This environment does not occur in other classes. There were times when this attitude become overwhelmingly uncomfortable and overshadowed the work. The class needs more discipline in the relationship between prof and student body. I feel the TA\u0092s could step into this role.The class however is a fascinating, and necessary one. Almost like an advanced studio, the students get to solve problems through the lens of an important architectural thinker. There will be those who deem it BS, but this diverse view, is so integral at Yale. As a defender of the class, I would turn those who think the class is unimportant to Peter\u0092s Ten Canonical Buildings book. The book is a lucid and important indicator of what this class and Peter has to offer. All the fuss that comes about makes it harder to realize.Also the class is a critical look into important buildings since the renaissance, something not offered in other classes. What is unfortunate is that the general consensus says that the drawings we do each week become thoughtful drawings when we have the time to do them \u0096 we don\u0092t. Most of us do the drawings the night before and consequently BS a drawing that visually looks appealing and appeals to Peter\u0092s aesthetic. Those few classes where we had more than a night, where we could do the readings and develop a synthetic drawing to explain our ideas, showed the classes value. It didn\u0092t happen enough and as such, the drawings became a farcical representation of what it could be.Also, this class on the same day as studio equates to a very late night, sometimes even all nighters, every Wednesday. It this way, it was not beneficial to both classes.",
    "I think that the course could be improved with more theory based lectures and more opportunities for discussion.",
    "I would prefer to have the lecture on each building\/architect before we spent hours drawing. This would have enabled the students to generate more insightful readings of the subject.It was much better when the students led the discussion of the drawings. Although this change came late during the semester, I appreciate it very much.I welcome more crossovers in thinking between the formal analysis class and the studio design work."
