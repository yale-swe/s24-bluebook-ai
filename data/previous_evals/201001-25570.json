   "comments": [
    "yes, french courses are fantastic, one of the best langauge courses at yale. but choose instructor wisely!the teaching material is great, the instructor is not very knowledgeable, but he is a nice fella",
    "The French program Yale uses (French in Action) is a tad sexist. Okay, really sexist. And some of the vocab is silly. To be honest, the videos were just confusing to me. I read the text in the textbook and it helped me a lot more to SEE the words. Hearing French does not help me unless I already know whats going on.But, I enjoy the language and I think the program is effective at teaching grammar (if not vocabulary).",
    "i would recommend it but would like the class to be based more on french and less on some story in the book",
    "French is a beautiful language and 120 is a great class to learn it in. Do the workbook and you'll be fine.",
    "well.. you're probably not gonna read this cause you need to take it if you took level 1 and you can't take this without level 1. but nothing wrong with the course, wouldn't say not to take it.just decide based on whether you like the language.",
    "French 120 is just like 110: weekly tests based on the video material. I would recommend French 120 to a fellow student because it not only is the logical progression in the French courses from 110, but I believe it is also much more interesting and straight forward. The focus of tenses and moods made it simpler to study for the final.",
    "Do not take it unless you have to!! It is significantly less organized than the other Languages.",
    "Great class, you learn a lot. The weekly tests are a bit annoying, especially because they are in the evening, so it takes up the whole afternoon to study for them. But you learn a lot so it's worth it. And the stories in French in Action (the french program used) are ridiculous but really interesting. Strongly recommend.",
    "By the spring semester, you're committed to French, so this comment isn't going to guide you in one way or the other. The second semester of Intro French is the same as the first semester. The Capretz method is just as frustrating, absurd, and tedious as you remember, and the additional materials just as incapable of rendering it interesting. Take it only if you have to. If you can teach yourself enough French to test out of L2, do that in a heartbeat.Takethe class with Aaron Schlosser, if you can, as he makes it bearable."
