    "Graduate level introductory aquatic chemistry which deals with precipitation, coordination chemistry, and gas solution chemistry.",
    "I would recommend the course to fellow students. By taking this course I think the student can significantly improve the basic understanding in water chemistry",
    "I think it's a great water chemistry course where you get to actually understand techniques, and not just learn how to do mindlessly do them. It is certainly a lot of work, as homeworks are time-consuming, and tests are very difficult, but fair. But, you will definitely learn a lot."

   "comments": [
    "Not having done chemistry since high school, I appreciated the pace and being brought into the environmental engineering field. Actually, the course has done quite a lot for me for my research; I just usedthe principles to understand a complicated precipitation and titration procedure which I otherwise would have had no clue how to perform.",
    "Understanding the basics of water chemistry is very important for my research. Water quality control and water quality evaluation are mostly based on the general water chemistry, so have the deep understanding in water chemistry would be very helpful for mu future research.",
    "I think it's a necessary course for all environmental engineers, and it's really helpful for any lab work that even just remotely involves chemistry."
