   "comments": [
    "Highly recommended.",
    "I absolutely recommend this course, but only if you have a relatively strong background in Economics, as it can be quite a technical class. Although an interest in the environment is not a pre-requisite, you will get so much more out of the course if you are actually passionate about climate change and energy issues. The opportunity to work with Nordhaus, a notable in his field, is pretty cool, but don't expect him to offer you research positions or senior essay advising. He is not accessible at all that way. Also, this class is quite a bit of work. The fifteen page research paper followed a week later by a final is ROUGH, and the problem sets (you build your own climate model on Excel) can be difficult, confusing and time-consuming. His tests are very fair, though, and often have choice (which is the best). All the material really came together for me during the final, and I realized how much I really learned in this class.",
    "The best environmental economics and climate change economics class at Yale! I will recommend other student.",
    "Great take it",
    "Yes! I really enjoyed learning how to apply an economic framework to broader issues. I also like taking a smaller econ class, and being able to get to know Nordhaus a bit.",
    "Tries to do too much in this class in one semester. The math is often jam-packed during lectures and you have to figure it out yourself. If I didn't have Lint as a TA, I definitely would have flunked the course.That being said, this class is conceptually really interesting, and an extremely rewarding class once you're done. The final and paper really brought things together; you can talk confidently and know more about economics of climate change than even most other economists.",
    "Nordhaus is clearly one of the preeminent authorities in this field, but he doesn't quite convey his knowledge effectively. There's no textbook, so compensating for the lack of direction in class is difficult without help. Problem sets, a midterm, a 15-page paper and a final: more work than any other class I had this semester, by far.",
    "Awesome class. Do it. You learn really interesting stuff and you learn it in a really cool manner. Professor Nordhaus is a GREAT lecturer. He's very self-aware which is really important for an economics professor. The material is fun to learn, and the readings are interesting (if you do them, which you don't really have to). The exams and problem sets were REALLY easy, and there's really not much work at all for this class. The final essay is kind of annoying, but you get a lot of leeway so it can be fun. Take it.",
    "I would definitely recommend it. It is an intermediate economics class on energy and climate change taught by the leader of this field. The application of climate models is a great value that is hard to get any other place. Students will get more from this class if they had intermediate level macro, micro, and econometrics.",
    "One of the most challenging econ classes I've ever taken, but also one of the most rewarding. We really learned a lot of exciting and real technical stuffs that make me feel like I'm a much more informed as an econ major. The problem sets are tricky and time-consuming though. Nordhaus is awesome, just like everyone said. We had a few discussion sessions with him throughout the semester, which are very thought provoking and fun. Lint, the TA, is one of the nicest TAs I've ever had. So in short, yes take this class but be prepared about the workload. In the end it's all worth it.",
    "The class is a great overview of the most important economic theories of energy and climate change. The material is very broad, and you will not delve into any particular topic in great detail, but you get a useful overall feel for economics of energy. It is fast-paced and involves a lot of work: 6 challenging problem sets, a 15-page paper, and a surprisingly straightforward midterm and final.",
    "I'd recommend this course for its economic treatment of energy and climate issues. Professor Nordhaus has economically-motivated ideas about these issues that will probably change your conventional thinking. Assignments are often challenging but fair.",
    "Take it if you want to run really cool models that allow you to see how people come up with climate change \"numbers.\" It was a great application of Economics!",
    "Econ 331 changes the way you think about energy policies, climate change, and energy consumption. It's a great class, but be prepared to work hard.",
    "Yes, I would most certainly recommend it. The course gives you a clear understanding of the complexity and difficulty in regards to making a clear-cut political or economic decision when it comes to climate change. If you can, take Econ 330 before, in order to get a thorough grasp of the subject matter.",
    "Absolutely take this class. The material is incredibly interesting, and Professor Nordhaus is one of the best economics professors at Yale. He's clear, he explains thinks in understandable terms, and he's committed to helping students learn the material. On top of that, he's also a very friendly person to get to know. He makes it a point to meet individually with everyone in the class. I guess the only problem I had was I left the class wanting to know more about many of the things we discussed. Sometimes it felt like we jumped around from topic to topic. But as a general overview of issues in environmental economics, it's a really great course.",
    "Yes! It is very informative!",
    "I would recommend this course simply because I felt like I learned a lot and was pushed to try new things (i.e., writing an econ paper that isn't just a literature review, but incorporates some original analysis). The work load is above average--problem sets every other week, 15 page term paper that wasn't easy, midterm and exam. You'll be fine, though--the exams are super fair, I think.",
    "Students should take this class if they plan to work on climate change or energy after graduation. Excellent overview of an economists' perspective. Class is challenging for non-Econ majors, but if you are willing to put in the time, you can learn quite a bit from it."
