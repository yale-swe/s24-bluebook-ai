   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of the course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I think one of the greatest strengths of this class was the pace. We only had a half a semester to cover deep and difficult topics, but Professor Gibson did a good job of making sure we were taking our time and really fully understanding everything. I really appreciated how he took the time in class to answer student's questions and make sure that everyone was on the same page. On the other hand, I don't feel like the problem sets aligned very well with what we learning in class and the grading for them was very confusing.",
    "This course was taught by a visiting professor, Matthew Gibson, who was great! I really enjoyed his teaching style. He was very down-to-earth and did a great job bringing in examples from actual economics research that connected with the principles we learned. It could've been improved by getting actual instruction on how to do the types of problems on our homework.",
    "There was a clear disparity between the material taught in class and problem sets. The final was fair.",
    "The greatest weakness with this course was that the homework assignments were designed by a different professor than the professor teaching the course. In class, we did not receive the necessary information to complete the assignments, which made the process more frustrating than educational. The grading I received on my assignments did not provide clarity even when compared to the answer key. On my exam one question was given full points by a grader and zero points by another and when compared to the key it looked correct. I was more frustrated that I did not understand if I was understanding the material. The greatest strength of the class was the professors commitment to trying to make the material applicable to environmental management and being more aware than any other professor I have had before of using inclusive pronouns.",
    "Strengths- The course followed a systematic order of concepts and were fairly well-organized. Weaknesses- Sometimes the topics covered were a little hard to understand without more context.",
    "Matt is very knowledgeable, at times funny and more importantly, very patient and polite in answering questions. Highly recommend making use of in-person hours with him. Overall, highly recommend this course. Weakness- Some topics such as pareto efficiency and game theory are not really covered in text and understanding their explicit role in supply and demand was difficult to comprehend.",
    "The professor was intelligent and knowledgeable However, he spent a lot of time answering in-class questions that did not advance the objectives of the course.",
    "Strengths: -I liked that this course was half a semester at the beginning of the semester -Professor Gibson gave a very welcoming approach to economics to us Weaknesses: -There was a critical disconnect between what we were taught and the hw assignments (which were created and graded using an answer key from the previous professor). This made it very difficult to complete and do well on the homework assignments based on what we had learned in class. -Homework assignments took a long time to complete",
    "The course was a half-semester class, so given the shortness of the class, we covered a series of essential topics effectively.",
    "strength- content was good and class interaction very good. assignments also",
    "The course lectures and readings did not prepare me, in any way, to complete the homework assignments. The timing of the homework assignments was often difficult as they were assigned less than 1 week before the due date, with the topics not covered until the day before the homework was due. Neither the professor nor TF's were able to assist with the homework. The size of the class was too large, as time was spent answering questions so the instructor was often unable to finish the class content. This should be a longer class, i.e. once per week for the full semester.",
    "Weekly assignments were too long",
    "There are really only weaknesses. The pace of the course is much too fast for anyone to really get a good grasp of the material. The expectations for a 1.5 credit course were also wildly out of proportion. I spent way too much time on the work for the class compared to my other classes for a class that was a basic knowledge class of only 1.5 credits.",
    "Strengths: - supportive professor - well organized lectures Weaknesses: - assignments were much harder than material covered in lecture - assignments took significantly more time than expected for a 1.5 credit class",
    "I found that the lectures, textbook, and homework did not align all the time (ie in terms of terminology), which made it confusing to follow\/link concepts inside and outside of class.",
    "More on explaining theories and less on unnecessary discussion; all are graduate students.",
    "Strengths -- I thought lecture was engaging (appreciated the humor), problem sets were appropriate level of difficulty (but took a good amount of time to complete), exam was managable. Weaknesses -- at times there were inconsistencies between the lecture slides, the verbal lecture, and the readings. This occurred with notations, terminology etc. I didn't really engage with the case studies. They were interested bc they incorporated the environmental applications of what we were learning, but I was worried about getting confused.",
    "Strengths - well structured, from basics to more difficult concepts Weaknesses - doubts were not addressed clearly, rushed through some of the more difficult concepts",
    "Strengths: - Microecon is a very useful topic for our field and it is good to have a basic understanding of the topic - There were real-life examples provided about systems that behaved in a way that is consistent with microecon theory - The textbook was useful - I learned a lot from other students in the class Weaknesses: - The instruction was not well-suited to my learning style - There were inconsistencies between what was being taught in class, what was available in the book, and what was on the homework assignments. Sometimes the material was only offered in class and, at times, right at the end after the class had technically ended. This made the course more difficult than it needed to be. This class might be appropriate for a \"flipped classroom\" where students read the chapter at home and then everyone works on problem sets together in class with the support of the instructors and each other. - Even though there were no mathematics requirements for this class I found that I was getting hung up on basic math skills because mine are very rusty. I found more support on re-learning these techniques from other students than from my instructors. - The big class size lead to lots of questions that slowed down the pace of instruction and this seems to be why some of the most important material was crammed in at the end - I was not allowed to bring my computer to take notes in class or reference the textbook and so I was not able to research my questions along the way as I often do in other classes - We did not receive useful feedback on our homework and sometimes the homework was not returned in time to know what we needed to work on in time for the test",
    "A weakness of this course was that what was taught in lectures did not align with the homework or exam material. This left me feeling very frustrated and confused. I spent up to 10 hours on the homework a week. This time could have been reduced if the lectures were clearer. The final exam questions seemed very different from what was taught in class.",
    "Strengths - Matthew was committed in ensuring that everyone understood the material and took pains to explain it in as many different ways necessary to facilitate understanding - Material and pace was sufficiently challenging given the nature of the subject and lack of familiarity of the class - Matthew was committed in understanding where all students were coming from, and offered generous office hour slots for discussions and questions. Weakness - Some students were allowed to take up too much in-class time with questions, disrupting the flow and timing of the classes. I would be useful for the instructor to exercise more discipline over how much in-class time is allowed for questions especially from certain students. Some questions should've been taken offline.",
    "The course was very easy and slow-moving in the beginning but when the concepts became increasingly complex, there was not enough time to cover them in the lectures. The content asked in the homework did go beyond what was covered in the lectures",
    "Disconnect between homework and what was covered in class. Made the workload much larger to seek outside resources to complete the homework, which was difficult to navigate for a class that is only 1.5 units. Also bad timeline expectations for homework - was given a week to complete but could not complete it until both lectures of the week it was due since the material was not covered until then, so had 24 hours to complete the assignment. So, better alignment between materials, homework, and time expectations are needed. Also, seemed to be quite a bit of disconnect between TAs and professor which made seeking help in office hours feel disjointed.",
    "I think I learned a lot in the course, I liked that the professor used real world examples and would reference recent studies to show us how to apply our knowledge going forward. I also liked that the course was half a semester, it was a lot of material at times but I preferred the shortened time frame. The only thing I would improve is the level of help provided for the PSETs. Some of them were quite difficult which was okay, I just felt like we weren't given much help from the TAs to actually complete them. In a few cases, we hadn't been taught the material in class, and it wasn't in the text books but when we went to the TAs for help with a problem after trying to solve on our own, they told us they weren't allowed to help or give us clues or hints as to how to begin solving a tricky problem. I understood where they were coming from, they didn't want to give away the answers but I did feel their insistence that they weren't allowed to help was a bit extreme. It got to the point where me and friends had to find lesson plans on the internet ourselves because we hadn't been taught the material in class, it wasn't in the text book, we hadn't been provided any supplementary material to learn it, and the TAs wouldn't help explain. Though I did feel this was odd, I don't want to make it seem like I didn't learn anything, I really learned a lot from the professor and generally liked how the class was taught and structured. I just think we could have used a bit more help at times which was not always provided.",
    "strengths: good introductory course",
    "The assignments are well designed to expand on the course content and to foster deeper thoughts and learning about economic theories. The pace of the teaching is appropriate for an introductory yet graduate level course. It could be better if more advanced math were used, or maybe divide the class in two sections: one more quantitative (for those with quant background) and one more qualitative.",
    "The course often felt like a firehose of information, though I do think that Matthew tried his best to strike a balance between student comprehension and speed of covering the material! The course was a classic \"weeder\" course- working as a group was completely vital to doing well on the problem sets.",
    "Grading of assignments was extremely harsh. Many points were taken off for very minor mistakes that were not conceptual errors. Much of the material covered in class did not align with the information in the textbook for the course or were not in the textbook at all, causing much confusion. Examples given in class were hard to follow at times."

    "Allow yourself a lot of time to work on assignments",
    "Good to take this class as it gives first glimpse of microeconomics that is applicable in other courses.",
    "Start problem sets early, pick a good buddy to work with and avoid working in a large group, do the readings before lecture.",
    "Get feedback on the problem sets from the instructor\/TA",
    "Buy the textbook because you can't bring the electronic copy to class. Form study groups and learn from the other students rather than spending time in office hours. In this class the students were much more willing to show you how to do something so that you could learn the right way while the instructors seemed more inclined to give you only partial support in the hopes that you would figure the rest out on your own. Spend the time to get the homework done right (eg: study groups, compare your answers to others'). The homework is worth a lot of points and if you do well on them you will be less stressed for the final. Budget a lot of time to do the homework and find another student who has taken some econ before - some of the techniques we were using were not demonstrated in class or offered in the textbook but they are easy enough for someone with experience to show you.",
    "Excellent, basic introduction to microeconomic theories that are relevant to environmental management. Good for someone looking for a basic foundation necessary to understand how economic systems work but not planning to take more economics classes or work on economic issues in the future.",
    "Be prepared to spend a lot of time completing homework sets.",
    "Work in groups to get through the homework.",
    "There are a lot of people in the class so make sure you introduce yourself to the professor after class or during office hours and ask questions, be willing to answer questions. I think I learned more because I was more engaged.",
    "definitely take it, will provide a sound understanding of the basics that you can build up on later",
    "It is a good introduction to the microeconomics used in the environmental field. However if you are looking to use interesting math in economics, this course is too basic. Also, make sure to take it with the main instructor (Kotchen).",
    "Work in groups, or your homework scores will be low!",
