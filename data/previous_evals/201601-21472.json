    "The course was a comprehensive overview of Security issues in the Asia-Pacific and focused both on theory and current events. This approach was very balanced and focused, and covered a wide range of topics that are incredibly pertinent to this area of study. Moreover, the assigned readings for the course were very thematic and well-developedthe workload and grading was straightforward and standard. The course filled a much-needed void in international security studies at Yale, particularly with regard to East Asia.",
    "Enjoyed the class and the people made it work. It was a broad overview of the issues in the Asia-Pacific, so it wasnt too in-depth. The workload was manageable.",
    "While the topic for this seminar was really interesting, I felt that I did not come away with much because there was little instruction during the course. While discussion is great, it felt as if students were just saying what they knew, and we could have learned a lot more had the professor lectured a little bit during the seminar."
