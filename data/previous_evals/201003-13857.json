    "Yes, materials were always available.",

    "The professor promptly added the necessary readings to the server.",
    "This was a disappoint within the course, there was a small amount of required reading, which is generally a good deal considering our usual workload, here, however, there was a considerably small amount of readings or resources composed for the class.",
    "The resources were fine.",
    "yes.",
    "yes, all the sources were made available on the V2Classes.However, I would like to express a complaint about the sources themselves. In fact, most of the readings were authored by prof. Carpo himself. And most of the readings, in the forms of book abstracts and articles, were curiously expanded versions of the material presented in class.Hence I would recommend the instructor to augment and diversify the readings, so to better represent the authors involved in a particular discourse or field. Some students do not read all the readings, but others do and want to discuss about them."
