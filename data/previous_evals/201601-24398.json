    "The workload for this course was fine. Lots of movies which was nice and the cases were manageable.",
    "I rarely questioned the reason for the amount of work we had to do in advance. I find a 20-page reading plus a 1-page response totally reasonable, and just enough to both prepare us for the class discussion and help the material stick afterward. The one assignment that felt unnecessarily long was the Naval Ship reading - very long, very dry, and included a lot of extraneous details."

    "The only minor inconvenience was the video library that was only accessible at Haas. In a world where we're enabled with instant access to class materials, scheduling time to view videos at Haas is tougher, but hardly a frustration. If this is something you're able to re-evaluate, I'm sure it would be appreciated by future classes. If not, understood. The framework for the class was consistently repeated by Ed, which made it very easy to see how the three functions of leadership were interconnected. I appreciated the occasional repetition of the concepts to contextualize the examples put forth in the case studies.",
    "Getting to the Arts Library during its hours can be extremely difficult for people on active - anything you can do to make those materials accessible some other way would be fantastic."

    "This class is appropriately challenging, and Ed is the type of highly intellectual professor I came to Yale to encounter. In EVERY class, he blew our minds with the new perspective he presented for the cases at hand. While it can be difficult to never quite get the right answer, the challenge is welcome."

    "Though the examples were not always about theater, the application to Theater Management was always evident. Above all, I now recognize how to be purposeful about applying leadership tools to decision-making and culture-making in an organization - tools that I had previously taken for granted, which I now realize are the results of careful planning and specific plotting on behalf of the leader. I may not always have the right answers, but at least I will be able to recognize the forces at play much more easily with the vocabulary I learned in this class."

    "My only suggestions to have a clearer focus on leaders who are women and people of color. Most of the leaders we studied were white men. I love the course, but wished I was able to see myself more in the leaders we studied.",
    "We are constantly asked to evaluate ourselves as though we were the protagonists in the case, but a lot of us caught on this semester that nearly all of the cases we were given concerned middle-aged straight white men (and the few women were often portrayed in the writing as weak leaders) - somewhat discouraging to a group of young diverse emerging leaders. And a detriment to the class, as we rarely got to examine a leader's social identity as a determinant of their chosen actions or successes. While many of the lessons we learned were certainly universal, some specificity in this regard would be welcome, particularly as we stand as a generation on the verge of some revolutions in EDI. Ed was responsive when challenged on this front, so all I'm offering is some consideration about how to proactively present material like this in the course."
