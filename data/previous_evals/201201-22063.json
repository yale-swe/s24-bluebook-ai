    "A course in medium format photography. You are rented out a Yashica dual lens reflex camera to be able to use for the whole semester, though most people prefer using other formats (6x7, 6x9, etc.). You also explore color film, inkjet printing, lighting, and so on. I recommend the class if you are into photography enough that you are willing to work hard!",
    "In Intermediate photo, you'll get the chance to try out and explore a wider array of cameras, formats, and ways of making photos, and you'll hopefully end the course with a sense of what kind of practice you'd like to use in your photography."
