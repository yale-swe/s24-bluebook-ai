   "comments": [
    "Great course to take if you are interested in STS. Good for historians who want to broaden their array of analytical tools. Great discussions, great environment, reading can be too theoretical but that is the field not the professor's choice.",
    "This is an excellent introduction to the scope and themes of science studies. I would recommend it to any student who wants to think more critically about issues of categorization, expertise, information asymmetry, data ... and many more areas that science studies can help clarify.",
    "This course hits on fundamental texts and authors who have shaped science studies, STS, and the sociology of science. The course also functions more broadly as a knowledge course. It helps you understand where and how knowledge is produced. I would recommend this class to everyone and think scientists, especially, should take this course as it'll give them a new lens to understand their own work.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course. Far from being a theory course just for historians and sociologists of science, this course would benefit anyone interested in the social and cultural dimensions of knowledge production (so, basically, anyone attaining an advanced degree in the humanities or social sciences.)",
    "Extremely thought-provoking, refreshing, and engaging. I would definitely recommend it, and have.",
    "This class provides a very helpful overview of the field of science studies. I would highly recommend it to anyone who has interests in this field, whether or not they have a background in science or history.",
    "Highly recommend--a potpourri introduction to field of STS, and an open discussion space to think through new ideas about science and justice.",
    "This course offers a great overview to any student interested in surveying the literature related to science and technology studies. I would heartily recommend this course to any student interested in becoming more familiar with theory or experimenting with new approaches to historical cases.",
    "A general survey of different topics within critical studies of science \/ Science and Technology Studies.You will read and think all over the map, from questions of objectivity and subjectivity, to users of digital technology, to scientific racism, to experiences of the body, and so on. Joanna Radin does a wonderful job of leading the course, and is an absolute delight to learn with. The class usually contains students from all different backgrounds and departments, which makes for a stimulating environment. This course does a very good job of letting you \"customize\" your experience based on your personal interests as well, which makes it a valuable use of time.",
    "I would highly recommend the course. The readings inspired lively discussions.",
    "I would recommend HSHM 710 to another student who seeks an introduction to the discipline of science studies. The course highlights a different key \"problem\" or issue each week and is accompanied by about six different essays or chapters that address it. Students are introduced to several different methodologies or writing."

   "question_text": "How did this course deepen your knowledge of your discipline\/profession? To what extent did this course contribute to your dissertation\/research?",
   "comments": [
    "I think this course will be very important for my field, and in fact t is a required course. I will use the contributions of STS scholars and anthropologists in framing my dissertation. The theoretical tools are important, however I would not pursue a career in this field because I find it too dry .",
    "This course inspired me to do an orals field in STS, so I would say it both deepened my knowledge and whetted my intellectual appetite. I look forward to continuing work in this area!",
    "Yes!! Joanna is a great mentor and the readings are spot on.",
    "I'm not sure it deepened my knowledge so much as showed me an entire new world of things to think about.",
    "This course helped me figure out where the interesting connections are between science studies and my own field. I now feel capable of drawing from these literatures as I pursue my own dissertation research. I also plan to continue working on the paper I started for this course, and to try to make it a publishable piece.",
    "Excellent introduction to STS, though with a stronger emphasis on the where the field is today than its development or methods over time.",
    "This course greatly facilitated my understanding of the discipline both in history and in science and technology studies. It will contribute to the theoretical insights that I bring to my primary sources.",
    "This class provided me with sources, authors, and ways of thinking that have already proven very useful for my thesis work. I can see how my interests are deeply entangled with a whole host of other subjects\/disciplines, and I feel incredibly prepared to explore such entanglements in the future.",
    "It was a great introduction to science studies and is great preparation as a put together my orals lists.",
    "The course was very beneficial for me because it introduced a number of new \"problems\" that I had not encountered. Although I was left with a better understanding of science studies as a whole, I also found that these problems and issues could be readily applied to my own discipline and research. The problems outlined in the course extend well beyond the history of science discipline. Overall the course is very appealing to those from different fields."
