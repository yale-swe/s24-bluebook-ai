   "comments": [
    "This is a tough course to enjoy but one that will be worth it. You will read some great plays during this course but the extent to which the contextual history of the plays is focussed on will dampen that enjoyment somewhat. The sections and the studios at the end of term definitely saved this course for me though. Unfortunately this is just a necessary evil to get to all of the amazing theatre studies courses.",
    "If you're interested in theater in any way shape or form, I recommend this class. It is inspiring to get a rounded knowledge of theater, and lectures and readings are usually fun and interesting.",
    "I would recommend Theater Studies 110 to a prospective Theater Studies major. I enjoyed the class very much, but non-theater majors tend to avoid it--as a prereq to acting classes, etc, it's seen as the \"necessary evil\" of the Theater Studies department. However, the subject matter is very interesting and Prof. McGinley is a good lecturer. Plus, section was my favorite (academic) part of the week. THST110 is a great environment--but it is generally a community of \"theater people.\" If you are a prospective Theater Studies major, you will love to be in this environment, but you might not enjoy it if you have no interest in studying\/participating in theater at Yale.",
    "I think it's great to take if you love theatre but otherwise no. I love it because I get to read great plays but if that's not your interest you will definitely not enjoy your experience because the class itself is uninspiring",
    "Theater Studies is a very good overview of theater history, whether you want to take more advanced theater classes or whether you just want a break from science. Prof. McGinley is an interesting and engaging lecturer, although be prepared to be called out in class to answer he questions. It's a pretty small lecture, and it's usually in large part the theater community.",
    "If you're an actor\/writer\/dramaturg to be, a solid foundation course. Otherwise, don't bother.",
    "Take it if you ever want to take performance classes for credit.",
    "Take this class only if you are dead-set on being a Theater Studies major, and nothing will change your mind. Because this course changed my mind. It is dull and dry, the material fails to engage no matter what seemingly interesting topic it covers. Lectures are always the same, and it quickly became a hard class to not fall asleep in.",
    "THST 110 is a course I would not wish on anyone - unless they are VERY interested in pursuing theatre studies as a major.It is a lot of work (readings for each class invariably include a new play, several pages from the textbook, and usually a supplemental reading of some sort). The only reason I think I got through it was because I'm genuinely interested in the material. For people who are interested in Theatre Studies, this may not be your favorite class but lectures were generally very informative and the knowledge that you gain is incredible. It's an interesting mix between a history class, performance class, and a literature class so the class never becomes mundane. Overall I had a great time in the class, but it was not easy (however, very doable).",
    "Take it if you need to for the THST major. At times, it is a grind, and it could be better if it was reworked. Might be worth it to wait until someone else teaches it.",
    "I would recommend this course. If you are at all interested in Theater Studies, this is a good class to take to figure out if you may be interested in the major.",
    "Theatre Studies 110 covers a lot of ground, for better or for worse. It is a broad, and shallow, overview of different performance styles\/theatrical eras in world history. It is definitely a worthwhile course for anyone pursuing theatre, if only to have read the assigned texts.",
    "Don't take it unless you REALLY want to take acting classes. Take a class with Murray Biggs if you want a good class ON the plays and on theater.",
    "This is a history of theatre class that uses plays as supplementary material to the understanding of the class. The workload can be heavy at times but the tests are reasonable and the final paper is not bad.I would recommend this class to a fellow student but make sure they realize that its intended to be a full year course so they have to be willing to spend a whole year on this kind of material and learning. The plays that we read are the best part of the class and the lectures are fine but not outstanding. I took this course in order to take acting classes so you really have to decide whether or not spending a year of your time on this class is worth it.",
    "It's interesting background in theater history; also a pre-req for other classes. Take it; even if you don't like it sometimes while you're in the class, you'll be happy you did after it. Also, sign up for Jacob's section! He is literally the best human being in the world.",
    "I would not recommend it for anyone who doesn't have to take it for the theatre studies pre-req. The best part about this course is that it is now over.",
    "Good introduction to how theatre has changed throughout history. Lots of reading that we never even discuss, but its fun to read and get a totally new perspective on what the plays and theatre mean.",
    "Obviously, one has to take Theater Studies 110 before taking any sort of upper-level theater class, but as a pure humanities course, the Theater Studies class is a very rewarding introductory survey to influential theater movements. This has been my favorite class this semester, and I recommend it not only to aspiring thespians, but to those wishing to expand their own personal knowledge of the theater as well.",
    "I took the course because I do lots of theater and wanted to be more knowledgeable about the plays that many people would ask me to work on, and become better acquainted with the classics that weren't Greek or Shakespearean. This course really succeeded in doing that for me. I enjoyed the performance projects and reading the plays, and lecture was usually pretty interesting. (The midterm and final are great if you at least put some effort into studying, but they really give you everything you need to know.)A fascinating course and not a hugeamount of work. I think it's essential for people who want to be involved in doing theater often.",
    "If you want to take acting classes, you're required to take this class. Otherwise, only take it if you love history and are interested in drama. The lectures are dry, but the class can be rewarding.",
    "only if you have to, period.",
    "I would recommend it, particularly to those interested in the practice of theater",
    "It's a great course for freshmen interested in theater to take, because most of the freshmen thespians are in it, along with quite a few upperclassmen. You get to know the people you'll be in shows with over the next four years, and you get the prerequisite for the other theater courses out of the way. The things you learn in this course are extremely interesting, if you can survive the textbook and the lectures.",
    "yes, I would recommend it because i think it provides a great foundation in theater history.",
    "Although a lot of people complain about this class, I have no idea why they do. It's light, it's fun, you get to read interesting plays and if you don't you're not really penalized for it.",
    "THST 110 is a good survey course, forming the basis for further studies in theatre. If you keep up with the reading (about two plays per week, plus some supplementary readings), you'll be totally fine for the midterm and final which make up about half of your grade.",
    "Not for the faint of heart; essential for those headed for a career in the performing arts.",
    "Theater Studies 110, like most survey courses, is more about teaching you what you could learn than gaining any truly meaty knowledge, especially as the larger picture of the course, and any kind of historical sweep, is (perhaps rightly) obscured by the sheer amount and diversity of the material covered. That said, the plays covered represent a wide and interesting selection of global theatrical literature, and for that alone I would recommend the course to anyone interested in theater and wishing to gain a secure knowledge base in the subject.",
    "There is a good amount of reading. But the studio performances are pretty fun, but you don't get as much grade point distribution towards your final grade in the course.",
    "Not for the pure fun of it. But it's a decent theater class and worth it if you want to continue with the study of drama."
