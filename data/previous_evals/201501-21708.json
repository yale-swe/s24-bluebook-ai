   "comments": [
    "Much easier than CHEM222L! All labs are with partners and you get out early.",
    "I recommend this class to students who are taking the CHEM 221 lecture. In the lab you have the opportunity to solidify the information given to you in the lecture course by taking a hands on approach. Seeing the reactions at work makes organic chemistry more interesting. I can't help but contrast this course against the general chemistry lab in which we performed experiments that were clearly just to teach us how to use the equipment and had no real purpose. Organic chemistry is a worthwhile lab course.",
    "very manageable",
    "Better than first semester lab for sure. The final's a lot harder than final in semester 1 though, so heads up.",
    "I would definitely recommend Chem 223L to another student, although it is a long time commitment to take it if you're not planning on using it to fulfill some requirement. It's a really nice course.",
    "Basically a continuation of orgo 1 lab. Wonderful experience, I knew what I was doing, and I felt like it really reinforced so much practical knowledge - I barely had to study for the final because so much of it was basically built in by then.",
    "I would tell them to take if they need it for or don't need it for credit that they should still take it. The workload is less in comparison to other lab courses.",
    "Best science lab I've ever taken. Orgo Lab 2 is almost all syntheses, and even though some of the motions are the same, you always end up with something different, with a different lesson. Takes things you've learned in Orgo Lab 1 and applies them!",
    "Painless lab that furthers your understanding of organic chemistry. Weekly prelab assignment plus occasional post-lab writeups -- take time but much less than many other labs, so don't worry about it. I actually enjoyed the writeups because the problems\/questions were well designed to make sure you understand what you're doing in the lab, and in turn prep you for the check-out final.",
    "Great course, great teachers, better than first semester (because it's more fun! You can do the labs with a partner, so it's a lot faster and entertaining to divide up the work and be able to interact with someone else. Also less frustrating when experiments don't occur as they should).",
    "A really great chemistry lab - more laid-back than general chemistry lab and organic chemistry 1 lab, with interesting experiments that don't consume the entire lab period.",
    "The most chill lab ever. Even more than first semester IMO. Experiments are really cool and well-designed, and hardly takes up the full 3 hours of lab. Dr DiMeglio is awesome, as always, and the course gives lots of practice with your basic orgo lab techniques. Minimal work - I only started on the (three) reports the night before they were due and did pretty well on all of them but YMMV. Just stay on top of things and know what's going on and you'll be fine.",
    "I would recommend this lab for students who need it. It's probably easier than the general chemistry labs.",
    "Take it not a bad class at all, doesn't take too much time (labs usually last 2 hours, 3 hours max), and the labs are fun.",
    "Necessary if you're premed, but not difficult in any capacity.",
    "223L is a pretty standard lab class that essentially picks up where 222L left off. The experiments assume most or all of the prior knowledge from 222L, though they rarely if ever go past 4:00 and let you relearn whatever techniques that you have to due to all of the extra time. Very few techniques are learned, but you do go over some interesting experimental mechanisms, though many of the procedures become very rote by the end of the course. All in all, it was a fine course that does an excellent job of teaching you the methods, but I never really felt super excited to spend my friday afternoons in SCL despite the good company of my lab TA and fellow students.",
    "Chem 223L is second-semester orgo lab. It builds on the skills from first-semester orgo lab and is basically the same format, but you're running complete reactions and product purifications basically every week instead of learning individual techniques and then putting them together. (Like, it's assumed you know the techniques already). Lots of lab reports and a test at the end. Take it if you need it for a major; it's too much tedious writing and paper-formatting to take for half a science credit just for fun.",
    "Standard lab course, better than 1st semester, especially if you have Shin Hee as your TA.",
    "CHEM 223L is a great laboratory course to take with organic chemistry. I definitely recommend this course to other students. It's a lot easier than CHEM 222L, so stick through 222L to get to 223L, because 223L is even more fun!",
    "Much easier than gen chem labs. Overall, much more enjoyable. If you're taking it you're either pre-med or a science major. Don't be afraid to ask questions, you're doing some pretty cool science in the lab...synthesized an anti-epileptic drug...",
    "Yes, especially if you take it with Tyler",
    "I highly recommend this lab course. The experiments are a really good supplement to the lecture for second semester organic chemistry.",
    "Orgo II lab is a good lab class. There are 3 lab reports over the course of the semester, and you have to prepare an EP before each class. Dr. DiMeglio is great and most of the TAs are good too.",
    "If you're considering taking this course, it's probably because you have no choice. Relatively enjoyable compared to other labs at Yale.",
    "In summary, Orgo lab 2 is fun and cool if you let it be by listening to Dr. DiMeglio when you run into issues. If you worry about getting an A, you won't enjoy yourself. The lab reports asks for a multitude of essential information on the lab reports, which can be a drag if you're rather get a broad understanding of the organic chemistry at play. When you get graded on mechanics like formatting, putting dates around, you arrive at a dissonance between true learning and rote memorization of \"how-to-format-a-lab-report\". Professor DiMeglio recognizes that and tries to make the learning process fun instead of confusing. I would recommend the class solely because of Professor DiMeglio's attitude toward learning. I recommend it to anyone interested in working in a lab in the future.",
    "I would recommend it, pretty fun!",
    "This was a pretty cool course, especially if you're interested in chemistry. I think it was really valuable to learn organic lab skills and see the real world applications of what I learned in Orgo class",
    "The experiments in Orgo Lab 2 correlate well with the material being taught in lecture, so as a whole the real-world significance of each reaction is a lot clearer and this makes the reactions more fun! Also, by the time you're in Orgo Lab 2, you've pretty much already learned all of the essential techniques for the experiments, so you get to focus on the reactions themselves rather than learning how to perform the reactions. Solid course!",
    "Good complement to orgo II, and not too much work.",
    "It's a good lab--you watch great reactions in action and learn some good techniques. The workload isn't very heavy, and by the time of Che 223 most people should have enough experience from Chem 222 to navigate the particulars of grading and do well.",
    "If you took Orgo Lab 1, this lab is a breeze. You know the drill on lab notes and reports at this point. The final is fair, just study the post lab questions in the course manual.",
    "Better than gen chem labs and 1st semester orgo lab",
    "Second semester Chem lab is way more chill and interesting then first semester (maybe because I mastered the techniques). Overall it is still pretty annoying, but very bearable and I actually learned a lot.",
    "Pretty good. A step up from CHEM222L, but much more interesting because rather than learning a bunch of new techniques you're actually stringing them together to synthesize compounds. There are times when you sit around for a while waiting for something to reflux, but it's worth the wait. Grading was not too harsh either. Definitely not something to stress about. Would recommend.",
    "Overall, this class is a great introduction to laboratory techniques with fun and engaging experiments. In addition, there is a wonderful pairing of comparative literature reading to complement\/supplement the in lab experience. Beautiful cohesion with organic lecture classes. Was a pleasure to take, especially with professor DiMeglio at the helm. Only regret was not being able to do more experiments\/that the semester did not last longer. The description of this class is essentially a continuation of CHEM 222L (see past comments).Grading: easy (TA dependent); Workload: light (consistent weekly experimental plans); Knowledge: broad organic lab basis. HWSNBN",
    "I took CHEM 223L in concordance with the second semester of organic chemistry. It was a great course. In my opinion, it was much better than the first semester version of this lab. Take it!",
    "CHEM 223L is really a rather fun class. If you enjoyed 222L, you have to take this one. The load is slightly higher, but the contents are much more interesting, and you feel more professional as you go through the 223L projects! I enjoyed it very much!",
    "Less time consuming than Gen Chem lab, but I definitely feel like I learned more.",
    "Yes, if it is required. I also just think it goes really well with the actual class, and a lot of the concepts overlap at the same time.",
    "It's a great lab! You'll be applying the techniques that you learned in CHEM 222L to synthesize organic molecules. Typically these experiments involve measuring out reactants, heating them, using vacuum filtration, and then collecting IR, TLC, and melting point. Usually this never took us more than 2 hours! If you are taking this as a pre-med requirement or for your major, you won't mind that you're required to take this class! Professor DiMeglio is such a sweetheart and totally willing to help you if you have questions in lab. This lab is pretty relaxed - just be sure you are formatting your EPs and Post-Labs correctly. Very few people actually got the Mohrig textbook, so you don't need to worry about it. Just use the Course Packet and Google anything else you're not totally sure about.",
    "This lab goes along with Orgo II (Chem 221), and isn't too difficult - the chemistry is very understandable (and you have learned most if not all of it in orgo class before you do the lab) and the procedures themselves don't take too long - they are very repetitious, and you do a lot of heating at refluxing, filtering, then recrystallizing (to get a solid), then analysis by MP, IR and TLC. Just spend time making sure your labs (3 total) are good, study hard for the final (which, I'm not gonna lie, was a unexpectedly tricky compared to how the rest of the class is), and you'll be golden.",
    "Chem 223L is a great course. The post lab assignments are sometimes a little long but the course itself is fun and laid back.",
    "Take it if you have to take it.",
    "Take it if you have to. The workload is slightly higher than the previous semester.",
    "Good lab course",
    "It's the light at the end of the tunnel after gen chem labs. This lab is fun, and a breath of fresh air after the nightmarish hellscape of gen chem lab, but don't forget to still take it seriously when writing the post labs, as they are worth a signifiant portion of your grade.",
    "A good class. You're not taking it unless you need to. Disappointed with the grading rationale, as I performed at A, A- range all semester, then performed slightly below average on the final and dropped a couple grades.",
    "A great introduction to chemistry lab work since it seems to be easier than most labs.",
    "Definitely the more enjoyable of the labs at Yale, although the work is sometimes a little tedious (preparing EPs and Post-Labs). Requirement for pre-med and several STEM majors, so make the best of the situation.",
    "I guess I would recommend it, although you're probably taking this class because you have to, so my recommendation is useless. It is still a good class; definitely less painful than first semester, and you can do well if you put in the work.",
    "I wouldn't take it if I didn't have to.",
    "Great introductory orgo lab course covering topics of synthesis and characterization techniques. I would absolutely recommend this course to a friend.",
    "Great class! Infinitely better than genchem labs and actually fun! Orgo Lab II feels like an almost stress-free environment in which you can actually just get down to the chemistry and not worry about your GPA. In other words, if you put the time in, you'll do extremely well.",
    "Lab course, just like Orgo I but less work.",
    "much better than the initial lab. Christine is amazing, but make sure you like your TA.",
    "I thought this course was better than Chem 222L. Same amount of work, labs are a little shorter which is nice.",
