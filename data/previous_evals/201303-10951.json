    "Yes, yes, yes! My favorite class of the semester by far. This class will teach you to view writing from a whole different perspective: at least in my section, we learned by modeling ourselves after a few examples by authors ranging from Orwell to Atwood. There was a lot of diversity and freedom in our essays. The workshop format of the class was incredibly helpful, as was the small size. And Professor Ehrgood is incredible; he will always make time to meet with you about an essay, however many times you want. His feedback is detailed and insightful. Even over the course of one semester, I feel like I can see a drastic difference in my essays. He's not an easy grader, but he'll definitely make you better.",
    "EHRGOOD IS AMAZING. I was pretty comfortable with my writing ability before taking 120, but I can feel a considerable difference now that the course is over. The five essays are split up in a way that doesn't make you want to tear your hair out. Professor Ehrgood's teaching personality is unlike any I have encountered before (in the best way possible). He will make you laugh, think, and challenge your writing self in ways that you have never known before. Beware the lipogram, but do not be too afraid. Take this course to be a better writer.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. I took this first semester of freshman year, and I am glad because besides being a really enjoyable class, I have become a much more careful and thoughtful writer. If you want to improve your argument-crafting skills, don't expect that from this course (for the most part, your essays are not directly arguing anything like academic papers do), but if you want to develop your overall writing, this is an excellent class to take. Professor Ehrgood was absolutely fantastic. He really cares about all his students. If you can get into his section, definitely stay in it!",
    "Take it, and take it with Professor Ehrgood. I've learned so much about myself as a student and a writer through this class, and thoroughly enjoyed every minute of class time (even at 9am on Friday morning). And Professor Ehrgood is the sweetest, goofiest, most charming professor\u00e2\u0080\u0094tell him any story, name for him any predicament, and he'll spout a quote off the top of his head that fits it perfectly. He plays jazz to wake us up in the morning, often speaks his punctuation aloud (comma) and brings in sweets on workshop days. Note that it's certainly a lot of work\u00e2\u0080\u0094it's a good class to take if you know going into it that writing is something you enjoy, something that you want to put a good number of hours into for the semester, and something you want to work hard to become better at (because you absolutely will).",
    "You've probably heard that 120 is a 'must take' course at Yale -- a classic course at what is perhaps the best English department in the country. And it certainly can be, depending on your instructor. I've heard some not-so-positive things about 120 from friends with different instructors, but I had a fantastic experience with Professor Ehrgood: funny, immensely knowledgable and just the right amount of eccentric, he made the class a real pleasure to attend (and I took the course at 9am, so that's saying something...). I left the class not only feeling much more confident in my writing, but with much improved skills of textual analysis. Indeed, the reading texts are one of the best elements in this class -- you'll be exposed to a great variety of writers and styles, which are useful not only for developing your own writing style, but also simply for personal enjoyment. This was one class where the readings never became a chore. Overall, a great course, and be sure to take it with Ehrgood if you can.",
    "Terrific. Andrew will help you value the artful use even of commas in the way you have never thought about them before.",
    "It's an amazing class-- take it if you can! Ehrgood is an outstanding professor. In my section, he met with all of us at least once for each of five essays, which helped tremendously. Class discussions are interesting, and everyone had one essay workshopped by the class. The workshops didn't always produce a clear direction for a revision, but they did give me a chance to read what my classmates had been working on, which was pretty cool.This class is plenty of work. My section wrote five essays and four revisions, so I was almost always thinking about one or two essays that I needed to work on. But, no other class I'vetaken has improved my writing so much. Take the class if you can, and take it with Ehrgood if you can!",
    "English 120 is technically about creative nonfiction, but Ehrgood's course is less about nonfiction than it is about creative writing. Every instructor has their own version of the course, and I really liked Ehrgood's: personal essay (my least favorite), essay about someone that you know, cultural critique, using one anecdote to shed light on another, and the fifth is about anything, but you can't use the letter e. It sounds hard, but I found it a lot of fun to write, and you practice doing this throughout the semester.DEFINITELY take it with Ehrgood, if youcan. If you can't, you might even take it with him in a different semester. While I don't have any other 120 professors to compare him to, Ehrgood has been one of my kindest and most dedicated professors at Yale. He meets with everyone after each draft to discuss changes, but be warned, he is a tough grader. Consider starting the class off credit\/d because you probably can find another writing credit in your Yale career. My writing did improve, as I learned what to pay attention to, how to stay in a register, and how to write for an audience. He is also very flexible with timing. You won't ever get a syllabus with due dates, and many due dates changed during the semester. I liked it because it allowed me to wait until I had enough time for an essay to submit it.Be prepared to spend a lot of time workshopping your classmates, like A LOT of time. There is little lecutred discussion from Ehrgood, but rather time spent talking about other writers.",
    "ENGL 120 is a great class and Irecommend it to everyone, especially those who usually do not take a lot of english\/humanities courses. Professor Ehrgood is great - he really cares about the material and each of his students. He is eccentric, but he is also passionate about the course. He does tend to keep a very flexible schedule though (he will push back paper deadlines in order to spend more time on certain topics, or he might change a homework assignment to focus on something else), so his teaching style might not be the best for those who like a very strict and pre-planned schedule. However, he is definitely a great professor. The one thing I would consider is that ENGL 120 is about writing essays in similar styles to the essays you read in class (at least in Ehrgood's class). Thus, you are honing your skills to write in a SPECIFIC style or manner, not just writing creatively. So if you are looking for more creative freedom in your writing assignments, I would take a different english class.",
    "Definitely! If a student wants to improve his writing skills, this is the way to go.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS AND TAKE IT WITH EHRGOOD.It's a lot of work, but it is 100% worth it. Your writing skills will see drastic improvement and, more importantly, you will come to love words and the English language. Ehrgood will meet with you one-on-one to discuss every essay, and his comments are incredibly detailed and helpful. Also, the essays and assignments are fun (especially the lipogram!), and I found myself really looking forward to writing them.Seriously, I cannot recommend this class highly enough. If I could, I would retake it every semester.Small caveat: It is true that we tend to get caught up in the beginning of the semester, so a lot of the work gets shunted to the end of the class, but Professor Ehrgood recognizes that this is an issue and is very forgiving with deadlines."
