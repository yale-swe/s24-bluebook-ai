    "Absolutely take this course! As someone who came in with not too much knowledge about environmental movements and activism, this course was life-changing. It gave me an entirely new frame through which to think about bodies and environments and justice projects. The course format is awesome: instead of reading responses, you make 3 posts on tumblr and write a letter to a classmate (your letter partner) about the week's readings. The final project is large (start early!) but really fun to work on and felt like a fitting capstone to our work during the semester. I miss this class already!",
    "GJE is an amazing class, pushing you to consider the permeability of the body, contemporary articulations of environmental toxicity, and the conversations not being had when we talk about personal body pollution. The workload is heavy and I found it hard to stay on top of it while I was writing my thesis but in the end it was so worth it (though I wish I had had more time to commit to the papers--oy, senior spring. Also, Professor A-J is AMAZING.",
    "learn about your body and how chemicals are killing you in a class of granola people who say heteronormative every five seconds and then we all eat vegan food at the end of the year and casually mention fallopian tubes it is dope and i liked tweeting about this class for my twitter fans take this class it was tite",
    "Absolutely would recommend this class to anyone interested in issues of environmental justice, gender and sexuality studies, and critical science studies who is willing to put in the work in order to get as much out of this class as possible. I learned so much and also developed my creativity, sharpened my writing skills, and even learned to make a short documentary video! The actual syllabus might make it seem like this class is about the same amount of work as any other seminar, but some of the projects require you to think in new ways and take significantly more time than expected. For that reason, don't recommend taking this class alongside other very demanding courses, because it is 100% worth putting in the time.",
    "Gender, Justice, and the Environment is the best class I've taken at Yale. The course title is a mouthful, but it also describes the class well: it's all about intersections. If you're looking for a seminar that actually has lively, generative discussions this is it. You do weekly assignments where you write letters about the readings to your thinking partner, so everyone does the readings (or at least portions of them), and it starts discussions in an already productive place. Professor A-J is a goddess, one of the best teachers I've ever had. If you get in, take this course! Just be prepared to engage with the work. You won't regret it.",
    "I would recommend this course to students. The readings are manageable--about four 10-20 page papers per week--and class discussion is always relevant to the readings and current events. Prof AJ is an incredible professor and an absolutely joy to be around.",
    "WGSS 365 will push you to think in ways you would not have fathomed before taking this course. If you are looking for a truly transformative class (as you should be - make the most of that Yale education!) then this is absolutely the class. The classroom environment is immediately constructed to be a safe place for learning and sharing. This class is a lot of work, but if you are willing to do it, you'll learn more than you thought.",
    "YES. Take this course, now. It was the best experience I have had at Yale so far. Prof. A-J is the most generous person you will ever meet, and she makes sure that the emphasis of this course is thinking through how to make this world a better place. Every word in the course title is given its due and more, so that you are able to weave together the intellectual and justice challenges posed by categories of race, gender, sexuality, species, class, ability, and citizenship as they relate to chemical body burdens and toxicity. I have never taken a class that deals so honestly with things that affect all of us: pollution in all of its forms. One of the binaries the class so beautifully broke down was between science and humanities, which is so necessary, especially now. We took a field trip as well to a lab at Yale that was eye-opening. These were also the most kind, humane classmates I have ever had. Everyone around the seminar table is vitally interested in what we are discussingnot just in the classroom, but in life. We even had a class session on student activism on campus. You will never regret this, not for a split second. As one of the authors we read said: Act. Now. Take this class. Now.",
    "This is the best class I've taken at Yale. The syllabus is one that I'll be revisiting throughout my life and Professor Agard-Jones is the most devoted educators I've encountered. Exchanging letters with fellow classmates about the readings made us take these texts personally, take risks with each other in our thinking, and go much further with our critiques. The class was guided so that we could take our discussions wherever they needed to go, but also was structured enough that we got a solid sense of how the readings built on each other, and how our own thinking evolved over the semester. Most importantly, the class was deeply concerned with our own evolving concepts of justice. More than any class I've taken here, this one permeated my life and my activism, challenging my assumptions about ecological and bodily purity and changing how I conceive of my role in the struggle for environmental justice."
