    "Same amount of work as JAPN 110, but even more complicated grammar and vocabulary. The quality of teaching is as good as before.",
    "Japanese 120 is the continuation of Japanese 110. The Sensees jump right into it, so it moves at a breakneck speed. However, the team of Sensees really do make learning Japanese a pleasure. There is a lot of work involved, but I promise you'll learn a lot more than you think you will.",
    "Really enjoyable class. Around 2 hours of homework a day. If you've taken 110 you're stuck anyhow, but it just gets more difficult and more interesting. Sensei are great as always.\u304c\u3093\u3070\u3063\u3066\uff01",
    "An amazing class to take, if you're reading this chances are you have to take it after 110, but most everyone I've talked to would have taken it anyway. Loved this class!",
    "Japanese 120 01 is a time-consuming, yet very enjoyable class. The professors are all awesome in there own respects (this is no exaggeration, they all have some different perk that makes them awesome) and I have enjoyed taking the class (though admittedly, the homework\/quizzes can get to be a bit much)",
    "If you have to take a language, take Japanese! All of the teachers are wonderful in their own ways, and the",
    "So well taught here at Yale. Super time consuming, but you'll get to love all the teachers and fellow students in your classes.",
    "This class is amazing. You learn so much Japanese at the end of a year, it is, quite possibly, the best introductory language class at Yale. It's a lot of work, (2 avg each night) but you learn a lot and you are rewarded after a year of hard work with legitimately useable Japanese. Students going into summer Light programs are usually placed at the 2.5 level. Definitely take this class.",
    "lots of work both in and out of the classroom but an effective method for learning the language, I would, I have enjoyed it greatly despite the rigor",
    "I would recommend it to someone who has enough time to put into the class. It is a great class and worth the time you put into it. You will learn a lot your first year.",
    "Generally a very fast-paced language class where you learn a ton. +++ Strengths: It's still a lot of fun, and the pace is really fast and you get the feeling that you learn a lot (more grammar structures than the first semester for sure). The Japanese-learning enthusiast community is also great, and I've met many great friends through it. +++ --- Weaknesses: Unlike the first semester, the novelty wears off a little and you're less inclined to be amused by everything (or maybe the instruction quality goes down a little?). The workload is really really heavy, much more so than JAPN 110; note that this is both a strength and a weakness. ---",
    "Great Class. Very experienced teachers. They were super encouraging and helpful.",
    "Japanese 120 wasn't disenchanting at all. While it was a continuation of Japanese 110, the joy of the sensees, the engaging classes all remained. If you enjoyed L1, there is no reason at all for you to not enjoy L2.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend. It was a delight to take.",
    "Amazing! Just look at the JAPN 110 evaluations, since if you're shopping this, you've probably come from 110. But overall, I felt it was just as fun but a little harder than the previous semester. You really feel how much you've learned by the end.Also, the students in this class are more interesting than average in my opinion, and especially if you're into Japanese culture, you'll find many like-minded friends.",
    "Japanese is an awesome course for those students interested in learning Japanese. After a single year, I now feel confident in my abilities to navigate around Japan. I would definitely recommend it to all those who are interested in the language. You will not regret it.",
    "Japanese 120 is a great introductory language class, and if you're willing to do the work it will pay off. As long as you're prepared to do the nightly exercises, the class is really rewarding.",
    "I loved this class. Great instruction. Such interesting material. If you put in the work and invest your heart in Japanese, then only good things will come of it. It is a lot of work though!",
    "Highly recommended. Love it.",
    "If you are very serious about studying Japanese for the summer and taking classes for an extended period of time, but really take time to consider how far you want to go with Japanese before starting an introductory class.",
    "I would completely recommend this course. It was an excellent continuation of Japanese 110.",
    "This is a great class and isvery helpful in improving listening and speaking skills. I would recommend it.",
    "I would recommend the course because I felt that it definitely improved my Japanese, but the course was fairly demanding.",
    "This is a great course for introductory Japanese! The workload is heavy, but the amount of material covered is incredible. The professors are all wonderful."
