    "Although this course is cross listed, there seemed to be several assumptions made about certain aspects of business that I did not have. I learned the most from the assignments but because of my lack of background on business in general, my learning was unnecessarily inefficient and stressful. There seemed to get a general relaxed-ness\/carelessness about the class that I think negatively impacted learning in terms of providing clear content and specialized skills.",
    "I am very disappointed with this course... It had a lot of potential to be a great course but at the end of the day, we didn't learn anything. The instructor was friendly and he tried using interesting teaching techniques that would keep us engaged. He also gave us assignments that would have been helpful to do if we would have first learned how to do them but in the end, we really did not learn anything in the course so I feel like this was a waste of my time and money. Having us write a sustainability strategy without first teaching us in detail what a sustainability strategy is, how they are structured, what they include, what has worked or not worked for various companies, etc... is not helpful. I could ask a random person on the street to write one and they would have been able to do the same job as me because I had no resources to help me. This applies to all of our assignments. In terms of why we didn't learn anything, the instructor never gave a big picture \"This is what you are going to learn in this course and how we are going to do it\". He simply would come in each class and start talking about something but did not tell us how it connected with anything else or how it should be applied. Us learning that management systems exist doesn't mean we know how to implement a management system. Us going through a list of standards and certifications, doesn't mean we understand how to pick one versus another or even when it is appropriate to use them. The class felt like a big reading of lists of things that exist in the sustainability world but never actually learning or understanding what this big list of words means.",
    "Todd taught a diversity of concepts and topics, sometimes a little all over the place, but nonetheless compelling and new information for me as an FES student. I found this to be a soft entrance into SOM courses, because it's kind of like SOM-lite. Todd is very chill and non-aggressive -- opposite of many other SOM professors. The workload is heavy some weeks, and non-existent others, which is a great balance. The team assignments were fun and challenging, though sometimes forming teams was stressful and there was no effort to get FES\/SOM students to work together.",
    "Todd was a very engaging professor and I learnt a lot during the oil part of the class. Class always flew by (time-wise) because he was a great lecturer. Additionally, he was always open and willing to help with both class related and non-class related work, which showed his dedication to his students' learning and professional development."

    "The materiality section was very interesting and I learned a lot about how this process works. Also, the guest speaker, Frank Leeds, from Frog's Leap was valuable to learn about some more detailed aspects of agriculture sustainability.",
    "I liked how the prof. split us up into groups to discuss in class, had us play family feud, play the role of different stakeholders, etc. Those teaching techniques were helpful in keeping us engaged Unfortunately, we were engaged but the content we were learning was not very coherent or helpful.",
    "The class is super unique and combines many different teaching methods--greenlight sessions, guest lectures, skype sessions, youtubes, in-class group work, pitches, presenting, field trips, wine tastings....etc...In theory it was an awesome class, even if a bit boring at times (probably because of my disinterest in oil\/gas..",

   "comments": [
    "I was hoping to learn about more specific content about agricultural sustainability practices and how those can relate to sustainable business practices. We covered it in an assignment but I would have liked to learn specific content about it in class. The assignments were on the content I wanted to learn, but I was hoping we would learn more direct skills on how to approach these topics as opposed to just having the assignment and figuring it out myself. I feel like I learned important things but there was an opportunity to learn more and more efficiently that was lost.",
    "The course should focus on fewer things and the prof should more thoroughly and clearly explain each of the topics covered. By diving deeper into less topics, we would have actually learned how to do them. For example, the materiality matrix was super interesting and would have been really helpful to know how to do but all I got from the class was that it is a thing that exists. We never actually sat down and did a materiality matrix together so I don't fully understand how they work or how to do one myself. This is partly because the prof. just rushed through the lecture without stopping to make sure we understood. Taking a wide approach before going into the specifics would also help us place it context.",
    "Could probably be improved by less on the board writing about standards and concepts...instead help FES students understand these in class with more real examples (Like the shell stakeholder engagement session, loved that!) because when it came time to do the assignments we were often clueless.",
    "The wine part could have been better had it been broadened perhaps to sustainable agriculture in general. I think that would have attracted more students, who were actually interested in the subject matter, rather than students who often didn't show up or were on their computers during class. I also hoped to gain tangible skills and tools about corporate social responsibility I could replicate at other types of companies (not just oil and wine). But it felt like the in-class team projects and assignments were too specific to aid in my overall understanding of what it takes to work on corporate social responsibility issues firsthand at a company in the future."

He is approachable, but only if you can catch him. Overall I enjoyed him, and respect his efforts in teaching us about sustainability and social responsibility for dummies. I had no know-how before, and though I don't feel like an expert now, I feel like I would be comfortable trying for a sustainability analyst job, if it entailed on site learning too."

    "Working in larger groups was more advantageous because you had the same work load spread over more people. However, larger groups are obviously harder to all get together to meet. Especially in this class, it is important to all get together to brainstorm ideas and you cannot necessarily just divide the work without all meeting together first. It was great working with people with different background because they provided valuable insights.",
    "I really liked working in groups. Since we didn't learn much in the course, it was hard to complete the assignments without discussing with others and trying to bring in everyone's previous expertise to fill in what we were supposed to have learned. A lot of the assignments are good to brainstorm and bounce off ideas from each other so groups were great for that.",
    "Learning from SOM students, meeting new people, group work with unique skills made projects manageable",
    "The group projects didn't feel very helpful to my learning. I felt they were not structured enough. I wish we had been assigned pre-selected groups that mixed students with different academic and professional backgrounds. I felt with the group of students I ended up working with, I didn't learn anything additional from them because we all were from the same program. Whereas it seemed like the SOM students had a better grasp on the material and could have added to my learning outside of class. But given the class dynamics, cliques formed within the class, which hindered productive team work in the class and branching out to work with different students."

It was a very frustrating course because I felt like there was so much I could have learned and wanted to learn about but I never actually did. We simply mentioned it in class. The amount of work is also not small enough that I would recommend taking it as a joke course. It will just frustrate you that you can't appropriately complete the assignments.",
