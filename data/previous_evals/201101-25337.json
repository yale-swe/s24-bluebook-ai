    "Fun class! I learned a lot and it's always good to have a class in which you get to listen to music on a regular basis",
    "Take it!",
    "Truly an introduction to the most basic components of music theory. I would recommend it, if anything for the fact that this class will feel like a relief from your other classes. The work was never burdensome, and you come to the understanding that music is a universal language that pervades your life. It's important to understand.",
    "This course is very informative and a great course for those who have an interest in music. At the same time, if you are a beginner, the pace of the course can get stressful at times and some of the listening activities can get frustrating. That said, this course gave me a much greater appreciation for music and I would recommend this to another student."
