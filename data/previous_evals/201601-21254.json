   "comments": [
    "A required Econ class, you just have to take it.",
    "I waited several semesters just to take it with Nordhaus. What a waste. It's not a good course, but if you have to take it you have to take it. Yale's economics department should dramatically rethink their intro\/intermediate requirements and how they are taught. Maybe look into 126 instead. Only take this if you have to; if you're just generally interested in economics take a higher level course instead.",
    "Take it if you have to. It's fine. Lots of repeat of intro macro.",
    "All of you are probably required to take this. Definitely take it with Nordhaus if you can. He's an engaging lecturer, he's funny, and he explains things really well. I actually ended up loving this class, which I didn't expect. Watch out for the final, though - it was vicious.",
    "Useful conceptual material, but please do it with Mike Peters - a far far far better lecturer. Or, if you want to take it with Nordhaus, be diligent and keep up with the textbook readings so you actually know what's going on throughout the semester.",
    "A course you have to take if you're an econ major. If you don't have to take it, it's an interesting course but you'd probably be better off taking something else.",
    "Intermediate level macroeconomics course. Like most econ classes lectures suck and midterms\/final is tough but what choice do you have?",
    "At the end of the day you have to take this class because half of the students at Yale are majoring in econ. My only hope is that there is some serious restructuring of the people who run the course because it is unacceptable that I come to Yale and am given a shit show such as econ 122.",
    "Take it if you have to fulfill the requirement, but otherwise maybe public econ is better?",
    "Easily the worst taught, most poorly organized course I have taken at Yale. I am reconsidering my interest in the major because of this class. Point of order, just because you are a great researcher doesn't mean you are a great professor. Absolute joke of a class. Enjoy being forced into it by the econ major for no reason and wasting your valuable time at yale on a poorly organized, poorly taught class like this.",
    "A core econ course. You will most likely not enjoy yourself, but if that's what you're looking for, then you're probably in the wrong place.",
    "Intermediate Macro continues an effective study of macroeconomics and provides a deeper exploration of economic theory and dynamics than was offered in Introductory Macro. Professor Nordhaus is a lively and entertaining lecturer (as well as a legend in the field) and the course is well structured and interesting. After Intermediate Micro, this course and its weekly problem sets shouldn't scare you.",
    "I would not choose to take this class again because the material taught and the material tested on often seemed very different.",
    "Dry dry dry boring lectures and professor would not go over material quick enough or thorough enough for us to do well on psets. Psets grades super harshly and only some randomly selected questions were graded so you had to do every pset and they were fairly hard. Took maybe 6 hours a week? Two midterms - first one harder, second one easier. Curve is super vague so no way of really knowing how you stand in the class. Final was pretty hard and very long (6 blue books). Nordhaus is a very boring professor though a cute, old guy, but really not a good lecturer at all. Very smart, but speaks in a monotone and you just want to sleep or skip class. Overall, you have to take it for econ so... Oh, he also only lets in sophomores or above who have declared Econ so watch out for that, absolutely no freshmen in the course.",
    "Take it with Nordhaus if you have to take it. Don't be like me and just take this for fun. You'll definitely regret it.",
    "I would only ever take it f it's a requirement. Otherwise it's too boring.",
    "didn't like this class. don't take it unless you have to for your econ major. nordhaus is awful and doesn't know how to teach anymore-- he goes on so many random tangents and stares at the ground all class. problem sets and exams are way harder than any material you learn in class.",
    "I would recommend this class, though, I would stress that one should not underestimate this class's material and the time that it requires for proper learning. Take this course, future student, if you truly care to commit solid hours of internalization and comprehension. The material is dense and varied.",
    "ECON 122 was not a course I enjoyed that actually ended up being really hard. I thought Intro Macro was actually pretty easy, and we covered a lot of the same material, but this class got much harder than I was expecting. Lecture was pretty dry, which made it less helpful. Tests were at times pretty ambiguous too. If you don't catch yourself jiving with Nordhaus' teaching style, I would maybe try to take it at a different time.",
    "Mandatory for Econ majors",
    "I would recommend taking ECON 122 with Professor Nordhaus. He kept the course interesting and exciting, and provided a good background of modern macroeconomics.",
    "I thought this was a great class. Nordhaus is hilarious, with a really dry and off-beat sense of humor. I came out of this class understanding the smaller details of macro much more thoroughly. Go to class, I think it's worth it.",
    "Standard intermediate macro course, good professor, get Tatjana as your TA, less math than intermediate macro, 2 exams, finals, and 8 psets",
    "It's basically a more in depth version of Intro to Macro. If you don't need it for the major, I would recommend exploring other econ classes.",
    "Good course! Not too hard if you keep up with the material- fairly straightforward, and reviews a bunch of intro stuff (quickly) but it's good to have in your back pocket.",
    "A class that has the potential to be interesting and useful, however, it is taught in a very disorganized way. It's a shame, because macroeconomics is something that I'd like to recommend to most students at Yale, because the material is relevant to so many majors and interests. As of now, only take this class if you need to.",
    "A lot of students took 122 because it was a required class for their major. In general, I would recommend the class because it was definitely interesting and gave good insight into macroeconomics and fiscal and monetary policy(but that depends on if you like learning about policy(which we spent longer on than we should have, considering how it wasn't really even tested on)). However, greater clarity in some of the specifics and calculations would have been appreciated, as sometimes even the TAs would get confused. The lectures could have gone through the history aspects much more quickly. Psets were do-able, midterms were realistic, final was very difficult!!!",
    "It's a requirement. You're going to take it anyway, and it's definitely a lot better than micro. Nordhaus is really good. I recommend.",
    "Intermediate Macro was a very solid class. Professor Nordhaus is a great professor, and I learned a lot about the macroeconomy. A reasonable amount of work and level of difficulty. Side note: The course is very much defined within the framework of Western capitalism, so don't expect much discussion of alternative views of economic theory.",
    "Take it if you're an economics major!",
    "If you enjoyed micro and the math side of econ, take macro theory. This course is far less math based and the models are less cool. Psets also don't help much.",
    "challenging but useful",
    "Do not take Econ 122 unless you have to",
    "A lot of people say this class is really boring and you should only take it if you have to, but honestly, I thought we learned a lot of really important and relevant economics concepts that would be helpful for anyone interested in economics to know. This course is a survey of topics including monetary policy, fiscal policy, economic growth, business cycles and recessions, inflation, unemployment, trade, and a lot more! This class isn't very math heavy or unnecessarily theoretical, so it might actual be a nice alternative to the more math-intensive version. There are two mid-terms, a final, and 8 problem sets. Overall, I thought it was pretty good and Nordhaus was engaging enough!"
