    "Geographic Information Systems is exactly what it says on the tin. On one hand, it is a great introduction to GIS taught by one of its inventors. Prof. Tomlin is funny, informative, and very responsive to questions. GIS is a valuable and powerful skill to know for students of many majors. However, as Prof. Tomlin will say himself, the course is only about learning a computer program, no more. Your final report can have some greater societal or personal importance, but its only graded on GIS skill (hence why the class carries no distributional or skill credits). Still, a very good course for what it was. Pick your subject area for your final report and find data for it as early as possible. The class has weekly assignments uploaded to a Google Drive folder that everyone in the class can see, and some weeks he separates the best into a new folder. It does allow you to compare and learn best practices, though. Almost all of your grade is based on the final report, so keep that in mind as well.",
    "This is the sort of class where you get out of it what you put into it. Professor Tomlin and Jill are extremely willing to help you, but you need to have a decent amount of motivation to learn the program, as the weekly assignments aren't necessarily structured around a specific order of skills. If you do take this class, you can expect to be pretty frustrated with the program at times, but it is a super cool and useful skill, so you should take it and try to start the assignments early in the week so you have time to ask questions!",
    "Definitely worth it, you learn a lot!",
    "I wouldn't take this class again. You learn how to use GIS for your specific semester long project (that you make up on your own) but the things you learn how to do wouldn't necessarily apply to another project you would be working on. Hardest part of the class was finding good data to use (all from googling).",
    "You get out of this class what you put into it. The homework assignments are not graded and almost the entire grade is based on the final project, which you can make more or less complicated. This class is an introduction to ArcGIS software and I think you could effectively self-teach almost all of the material from online resources, but this is a nice way to force yourself to learn it in a structured way. I definitely learned ArcGIS and could self-teach anything I didn't learn more effectively than if I didn't take the class.",
    "I definitely recommend this course to other students. I got a lot out of it and learned a completely new topic that is applicable to my field of study. It is a lot of work but is worth it.",
    "An interesting class, if you want to learn to use GIS software. The project really directs all of your learning throughout the semester and it is pretty much as much as you want to make of it. Other than the final project, the class is very low stress. The homeworks are more exercises to keep you accountable and direct your exploration of the software. But most of the learning - in terms of how to use GIS - is done on your own, by simply playing around and exploring.",
    "If you want to learn about GIS, this is the course you should take.",
    "This is an okay class, and ArcGIS is a good skill to have. The homework can be frustrating and confusing, but Prof. Tomlin and Jill always help out via email. It can end up being a big time commitment, but probably worth it if you want to learn the application."
