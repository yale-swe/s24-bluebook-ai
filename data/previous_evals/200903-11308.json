    "Hard class. Don't take it just out of interest",
    "Math 350 is a survey of a very beautiful field of mathematics. With focus on groups, rings, and modules, math 350 quickly teaches you the skills to comprehend various algebraic areas of math. Moreover, Andrew Casson is a god--he knew everything about the subject matter and could always give pointed answers to anyone's questions.",
    "Abstract Algebra is not prohibitively difficult, and it is quite an interesting class, as this will likely be your first venture into rigorous algebra, so don't be scared off. With that said, be prepared to be in a class with very smart people, and don't expect everything to come naturally. You WILL have to work, but it is rewarding in the end.",
    "Algebra is beautiful, and Professor Casson is probably the best lecturer I've had at Yale. The material was never easy, but he made it progress in such a linear and logical fashion that this is one of few classes where I never really had to read the book because notes from lectures were entirely self contained. The only negative reaction that Professor Casson may have invoked is that the grading is a little harsh, but there again, if we are learning for the right reasons (i.e. knowledge rather than GPA) then I suppose this is a moot point. Go to office hours - if you are confused with problem sets (and I always was) then you will learn a lot.",
    "It's a good class, but pretty harshly graded. The material is interesting and not too difficult, but if you want to get a good grade in the class, you need to really master the material and pay a lot of attention to detail on the tests.",
    "Absolutely, if you are seriously interested in math. ESPECIALLY WITH ANDREW CASSON.You build up from very basic concepts of Algebra to some quite remarkable results. It can be quite challenging, but Andrew Casson is an incredible professor. His lectures may not be very exciting, but it is wonderful to see him work through the material so carefully and methodically. He is extremely patient with questions in class and in office. I could not envision a better professor for this subject.",
    "Before you take this course make sure you have a good justification for subjecting yourself to a curve centered on B-\/C+ for the midterms.",
    "an introduction to groups, rings, and moduels. interesting material for someone who likes abstract math.",
    "MATH 350 is a solid introduction to groups, rings, and modules. This is an extremely difficult but well-taught class and you will learn a lot about these subjects. It's a huge leap from MATH 230, sophomores - I made A's in 230 but I'm looking at a C or D in 350. The problems on the tests aren't necessarily that hard but the grading is very severe. Prof. Casson is an excellent lecturer but he's very awkward and unhelpful in office hours. Make sure to find a friend who's taking the course as well, because you definitely need someone to do the problem sets with.",
    "Math 350 is a great introduction to Abstract Algebra. The class moves at an extremely rapid pace and is very difficult, so I would only recommend it to extremely able mathematics students. Professor Casson knows the material really well but, in my experience with him, has a hard time helping students outside of class. If you enroll in this course, don't take it lightly. It requires a lot of effort to excel in this class; it's definitely not a joke.",
    "This is essentially an introduction to Group Theory. Other structures (Rings, Fields, Modules, Vector Spaces) are touched on, but on a much more superficial level. In addition, it seems that one of the primary reasons for working with these structures was to build up to the Structure Theorem for Abelian Groups, as this was the culmination of our discussion of Modules. So I suppose you could say these additional structures were discussed (at least partly) as means to further develop Group Theory.I recommend this to anyone with an interest in abstract mathematics. The theorems in this class, though sometimes difficult to grasp, were quite interesting, especially the results concerning symmetry, the Sylow Theorems, and the Structure Theorem.",
    "This class is an introduction to groups, rings and modules, and assumes no prior knowledge. I enjoyed the material very much, which made the class a lot of fun. The problem sets are relatively easy at first, but get more and more time consuming as the course progresses. Nonetheless, they never become unreasonably difficult, and doing well on the problem sets amounts to doing well on the midterms.There are two, short, 50-minute in class midterms. They aren't too difficult but you need to be able to think and write fast.",
    "Considering the difficulty of the class, I would recommend it to math majors and those who have a genuine interest in math. We have covered a lot of interesting materials, such as R-modules, rings and groups, but i guess it would be hard for non-science majors and it requires a lot of abstract thinking.",
    "This is a really great class. It can be difficult at times because Professor Casson is not exactly warm and fuzzy. On the other hand, he gives amazing lectures that are incredibly clear and easy to follow. You will learn a lot and the material is really interesting.",
    "I would recommend Math 350 to another student. The information is absolutely fascinating. There is a considerable amount of work towards the end of the course and you will have to struggle for a good grade, but the information in the class is interesting and the instructor is excellent.",
    "This is an introduction to the field of algebra. You learn about groups, fields, rings, and modules among other things. I recommend this course if you are fairly comfortable with matrix operations, understand how to write proofs, and are interested in taking a traditional lecture based math course. The material is interesting, but abstract (who would have guessed) and professor Casson is clear, approachable, and friendly. Exams aren't too bad, but grading is tough.",
    "This class is not very difficult, and doesn't require much previous background, other than a little bit of matrix math. It might make a good class for interest non-major.However, at least this year, the blue book description didn't really match what the class did. There are a lot of terms in it that were not so much as mentioned in the class. Nevertheless, the class is still a solid introduction to the basic concepts of abstract algebra. It can get a bit repetitive at times, but this is a property of the material and not of the way it is taught.",
    "The content is a bit boring, and the grading system is harsh. But, overall, it's worth taking for the classes that it is a prerequisite for. The professor is very smart, but he doesn't understand his students, so he can't tell how smart they are because he himself is very smart. Thus, he often treats them as though they are very dumb. He is also a very dry lecturer.",
    "Thorough class and fun. Good he sets. Solid amount of work.",
    "I didn't enjoy this class as much as I have other math classes. I felt as though the definitions I was learning were descriptive, but I did not have a conceptual feel for the reason I cared about learning these descriptions. This may have been a failing of me, not of the class."
