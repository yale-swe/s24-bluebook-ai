   "comments": [
    "Yes. This is the class you want to take if you need to do Global Health research and are inexperienced.",
    "Only take it if you are interested in developing a research proposal. I also only strongly recommend that only juniors enter this course.",
    "It's all in the title. You basically spend the first half of the semester learning how to read a global health research paper critically, and working on your own proposal in a group. The second half of the semester, it's your turn to do it for yourself. KTS is the best at really catering to what you're interested in and need to learn, so you get as much out of this as you put in. I would say definitely take it if you're interested.",
    "Yes, if you have any interest in global or public health research this is a class you must take. Your research and writing skills will go up ten fold.",
    "I would recommend the class to any student interesting in completing ethical and feasible research in Global Health",
    "To simply put it, you get what you put in. The class is heavily dependent on independent work. You design your own research proposal and there are numerous directions to guide you in the right direction. Prof. Talbert-Slagle is wonderful and extremely helpful. This is one class where everyone is lost and therefore you never need to be worried about asking a stupid question. But only take this class if you are interested in Global Health Research! It will teach you a lot in one semester, and more importantly it will teach you how to teach yourself.",
    "Definitely would recommend this class. Even if you don't end up using your proposal for the summer, the things you will learn are invaluable. Not to mention, you get a glimpse into the world of global health at Yale from Prof T-S who is always willing to help. Be prepared for a lot of work, though the work pays off. This was the first year Prof T-S taught the class, too, so it will probably be redesigned a bit next Fall.",
    "Good research methods class you have to take it for some majors\/concentrations.",
    "Take it!",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class particularly if you are interested in learning about global health research or getting involved in applying for research funding in the spring. This class teaches you how to read global health research critically, understand the general frameworks in the field, to present your research and design, and to write up a full length proposal. Professor KTS and Alex are simply awesome and the class environment is engaging. You feel like you are learning and your feedback is being heard.",
    "I would thoroughly recommend this class to anyone interested in global health research; it leaves you with a project proposal and the skills for how to put it into practice."
