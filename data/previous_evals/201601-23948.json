    "This is one of the most amazing courses at Yale. Everyone should take this class. If you're reading this evaluation, but thinking about another class at the same time, forget about that other one. Magaziner is a poet; the readings are devastating; and the class is unforgettable. Do yourself a favor and take this.",
    "Yes! 10\/10 would recommend! Best class I took this term!",
    "Whether or not you like history, you will love this course. Definitely take it. 10\/10, would STRONGLY recommend.",
    "OF COURSE! YOU MUST TAKE THIS COURSE!!!!!",
    "One of the best classes you can possibly take on Africa, Professor Magaziner is an extremely engaging and powerful lecturer and the course covers a fascinating history that I had known almost nothing about prior to taking the class beyond the vague facts about apartheid. As someone who isn't studying anything remotely related to the subject matter of this class, I would highly recommend it as a well-taught and incredibly deep course on a country with a unique and powerful history. Magaziner is a professor worth seeking out at least one class with before you graduate, and the sections and readings are also excellent. If Efe is still TFing the class, do yourself a favor and take her section as discussions for this class were quite possibly the best section conversations I have had at Yale.",
    "BEST CLASS AT YALE. DON'T BE FOOLISH, TAKE THIS CLASS.",
    "TAKE THIS COURSE. You will learn about South Africa, but also how history is made, changed. You will also learn about yourself. Take it.",
    "MUST TAKE THIS COURSE. It is truly fantastic. Magaziner is incredibly engaging, passionate, and knowledgeable. The material is fascinating itself, and Magaziner teaches it in a way that applies to our lives and the world around us. There's a lot of work- two 5 page papers and two 10 page papers, and there's a lot of reading (that you should do). Overall, take this course because it will change your life, but make sure you have the time to put into it and make it worthwhile.",
    "absolutely would recommend - every student should take this course.",
    "Take this class. Hands down. But I would also strongly recommend taking it Credit\/D\/Fail. The lectures are incredibly interesting but the grading is very harsh. Even as a history major, these were my lowest grades I have gotten at Yale. I still enjoyed the course, though.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. EDUCATE YOURSELF. BE INSPIRED BY DAN MAGAZINER'S INGENIOUS. CHANGE YOUR LIFE.",
    "One of the BEST history courses at Yale - take it!! Professor Magaziner is an incredible lecturer, and you will learn so much.",
    "This is a beautiful class. You'll learn a lot and you'll enjoy learning it. I took it credit\/D which was perfect because I could enjoy the lectures and material but not have to worry too much about the lengthy and difficult readings and assignments. Definitely would recommend.",
    "Take this course if you are interested in learning about South African history, or if you are just interested in hearing one of Yale's best lecturers do his thing twice a week. You might find section a bit alienating if you don't have any background in South Africa and take a section with many students who do\/are from the region. But that's a minor price to pay to learn from someone like Magaziner.",
    "One of the best courses I have taken at Yale, and one which will constantly keep you engaged with the subject matter, even if you went in with little interest or understanding in South Africa. Magaziner's lectures are wonderful, and the readings will keep you engaged and pose valuable question to you as well.",
    "One of the best history lectures I have taken at Yale! Magaziner is a great lecturer, and does a really good job of covering the history of South Africa over a broad period of time from a broad range of political and social perspectives. The readings were great, though a certainly a lot per week. I like the combination of primary sources, memoirs, and articles. The assignments were sometimes difficult, because it often seemed like the readings we did did not necessarily speak directly to many of the topics, and we weren't able to do outside research, so I often felt that it was really a stretch to use the sources to justify my arguments and ended up relying heavily on lecture. But overall, a really wonderful class. I would definitely recommend it to anyone, regardless of their background on the subject."
