   "comments": [
    "I would not recommend this class if you already know the basics of most international conflicts and news.",
    "Great class! Gut class! Take it! If you're considering this you are probably considering Gateway to Global Affairs as well, and as someone who shopped both and have friends in both, I can definitely say that PLSC 111 is the better choice.",
    "Very good overview. Professor Howorth moves very quickly through lectures, but it's manageable.",
    "This course is a basic intro lecture course. Take it if you want a broad overview and don't want a lot of work. I didn't find it particularly enthralling though.",
    "I would recommend it as a good introduction to international relations. The workload isn't too bad, but you should go to lecture.",
    "I would recommend this class to a fellow student. It's an intro class so it's not like you get too far in depth on anything.It's pretty much what you would expect from an intro class",
    "I would not recommend it unless you need a Social Science credit. Otherwise, it's completely futile in the real scheme of international relations.",
    "Broad overview, grades depend on your TA pretty much...",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to a fellow student because it is a very good introduction to the subject of International Relations and I definitely learned a lot in this class. I would summarize it as a solid introduction to the many relevant terms in IR theory and the events in IR history and global politics that a student who would want to know a bit more about IR would find very interesting. Overall a very helpful, great course.",
    "Pretty easy intro class, simple structure, lectures fairly standard. i would recommend it. Decent amount of reading though, and you'll want to keep up with it for the exams.",
    "Only take this class if you're looking for an easy intro class, otherwise you will be disappointed with what you end up with.",
    "I highly recommend this to students who are looking to learn about the world. You'll be knowledgable about global actors (like Iran and the Middle East, Europe, China, Africa, the Americas) and the conflicts they face. Great class for anyone.Be sure to \"shop\" TFs, which will make the biggest difference in your experience.",
    "If you are all interested in History\/Poli Sci absolutely take this general overview course",
    "The class is a good basic overview of IR if you're interested in getting a solid background of information. It's not too difficult and you don't learn too much but it's useful.",
    "Ok class, good as 5th class if you take it Credit\/D. Zero background in international relations is assumed, and if you pick up a newspaper once in a while and aren't totally ignorant of current affairs, this class will be a breeze.",
    "I left the class knowing a lot more about IR, but at times the basics of a topic were skipped over, making it hard to understand the more-complex aspects of topics.",
    "International Relations discusses and looks at different global affairs and conflicts worldwide. I would recommend it because it is very interesting and covers a wide variety of topics",
    "Good introductory political science course, but take a history instead.",
    "You really shouldn't graduate Yale without taking this course.",
    "Take it if you want a stress-free fifth course, but don't expect to learn anything groundbreaking about world politics.",
    "If you're interested in international relations, definitely take it. At the beginning, it may seem a little tedious because there's a good amount of theory involved but it's necessary. Later on you go in-depth into current issues like Iran, China, Russia, the Arab Spring, UN, EU...i learned a ton!Straight forward tests, manageable workload, interesting readings, no papers.",
    "Definitely take this class as a basic Intro to IR, but also as a class on how the world works.",
    "Definitely recommend this class. It's a fun class, very straightforward, and incredibly important information is being learned.",
    "Best class to credit\/d ever",
    "I think the strengths were the case studies at the end but the weaknesses might have been that there didn't seem to be a clear structure to the course. The lessons seemed some what arbitrary, and maybe it would be better if students had a clearer objective of where the course was going in the beginning. There wasn't that much work weekly as long as you kept up with the readings, and it was really relavant because a lot of the case-studies that we covered were still happening\/in progress when we were learning about them!",
    "This is Intro IR. It does what it needs to do. Shop\/talk to students about TAs. The TA makes your experience. The lectures are interesting and you will learn alot, but make sure you keep up with them so you're not in trouble on the exams. Also, care about this class. It's easy to not to, but if you do, you will learn a lot and also not panic the night before.",
    "good class not a lot of work but lot of info. yes id recommend it to anyone",
    "Don't take this course.",
    "Take it if you need to fulfill the IR field distribution for the Poli Sci major. If not, take it if you're looking for an A with literally no effort beyond attending the (often-boring) lectures.",
    "Definitely take this class! It is not too much work (readings aren't very necessary and all lecture slides are posted) but you get a ton out of it. From taking this class I have a far better understanding of world politics, so much so that I actually try to keep up with world politics. For a class with very little work, you get a ton out of it!",
    "yeah it's a gut",
    "really good intro course to international relations; you get the nice theory bits in the beginning, then case studies of actual countries where you can apply your theory a little. very chill large lecture course. reading is informative but definitely not crucial. take it.",
    "IR has the potential to be a great course. Some people never go to lecture and rarely do the readings, but that is silly because Howorth is brilliant, the TA's are all excellent, and the readings are carefully selected. Like any survey course, sometimes you'll feel teased by an interesting area - we'll have one lecture and then just move on. But it will really expand your knowledge of the world, and perhaps turn you on to a particular region of the world for further studies.",
    "This course helps you understand what is going on in the world, mostly dealing with current events with some recent history.",
    "Yes, if you're interested in the order of the world and the future of the USA within it.",
    "Take it. Great 5th Class. Easy A.",
    "Absolutely. Not too challenging, very interesting, and will make you a much better-informed person.",
    "Good intro class",
    "It's pretty easy and relatively interesting. It's cool to learn an academic framework for thinking about international relations but most of the lectures current concerns in international relations didn't really add anything that you wouldn't know if you read newspapers regularly. That being said, the readings were always super interesting and very worthwhile.",
    "A fairly easy introductory class. You don't have to do all the readings to do well. So long as you follow world news and political happenings you can get by with a decent grade.",
    "It's a gut. Talk to pretty much anyone who has taken this course and they'll give you the lowdown. Your grading is going to be contingent on a series of essays written during three exams, and you could conceivably get by only knowing just the most major elements of IR. If you're more the intellectual type, definitely opt for Global Affairs instead.",
    "There is no paper, which is awesome. Two midterms and a final, all of which are fine. As long as you study, you should do fine on all three. The midterms consisted of IDs and an essay and the final was two essays. The reading outside of class isn't too heavy and you don't have to do all of it as long as you can figure out what will be relevant on the tests.",
    "I think it is a great intro course that a lot of people will find easy and fun. I fully enjoyed it.",
    "Relative material. Definitely a great class to take.",
    "A great class!Although it does go into depth on any particular issue, it gives you a really good overview of the world today. If you do all the readings you can really get a lot out of this class.",
    "Good introduction to international relations. Gives you important tools for considering and discussing our world. Fascinating lectures and a great professor. No huge work load, but do not ignore the readings - they are captivating and help you to develop your own opinion of each subject.",
    "PLSC 111 is a survey class--it covers a broad range of subjects you should know if you are interested in the field of International Relations. But that means it does not go particularly in depth in any one subject for the sake of exposing you to theory and present-day examples. That being said, it is a good survey class. Prof. Howorth is a great professor and respected in the field. I would recommend having Callie as your TA, if you can!",
    "It's very easy and you'll learn a fair amount about how the world works on a politically global scale.",
    "A decent introduction to international relations. I would recommend if you like world news and affairs.",
    "It's a very good intro course to take.",
    "Yeh sure, it's THE political science class",
    "I would recommend this course to a fellow student looking for good introductory into international relations.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student because it did a great job of providing an overview of international politics, I always found the course to be interesting, and it also provided the basis for further curiosity on the subject of international relations.",
    "very good",
    "Yes, great class",
    "I would not recommend it. If the student were really interested in international affairs, I would recommend Gateway to Global Affairs.",
    "I would highly recommend this class.",
    "I would not recommend the course to you unless you don't have time to read the news everyday, which would make this class a nice way to make up for this deficit.",
    "I would definitely recommend Into to IR to another student. You have to take it before you leave Yale. It is not a hard class, just 2 midterms and a final. All are pretty straight forward. The TFs really help the students understand the material. The professor uses modern examples to teach which helps you to understand current events and the history behind them.",
    "I would not recommend this course to another student looking to put together a challenging schedule of courses. Although the material was very interesting and practical, the course was not challenging enough and was filled with many students who clearly did not care.",
    "It is a basic introductory course on international affairs and politics with a background in IR theory. It is a basic course and can be repetitive for anyone who stays up to date on international news or has taken a class on this previously.",
    "interesting",
    "Current events mixed with history.",
    "I would definitely recommend Intro IR if you're interested in analyzing current affairs with a more technical foundation. It was great learning about the systematic level of analysis and the theories behind schools of thought that make up the essays and articles we often read in the media.",
    "Yes, take this course! It's interesting and great for learning about foreign affairs. I had a fantastic TF and really enjoyed Professor Howorth and his guest lecturers.",
    "its a great class if you want to gain a basic understanding of whats going on in the world and the reasons and theories behind current events. the first half of the class is pretty boring and theoretical, but the second half of the class is amazing. Definitely recommend it!",
    "I liked the course. Howorth tends to read off the slides during lecture, but he somehow remains very engaging. And after having taken it, someone like me, woefully uninformed about international goings on, has lots of background as well as a theoretical framework that I can apply to stuff I read in the newspaper. What a great intro course. And I think the TA's are almost universally good people.Try it. It's a good foundation for future courses, and also for being a human being engaged with the world around you - one of those necessary things, like Economics.",
    "This is a solid introductory course to international relations with a completely manageable work load and very interesting material. I would recommend this for everyone because the information taught in this survey course is relevant to all world citizens, regardless of majors.",
    "Chances are, if you're a polisci major you'll take this class. Show up every once in a while and go to section and you'll do fine. If you're interested in IR, this is a good introduction, but also know that the rest of IR isn't all about the theory like this class.",
    "Your experience in this course will be entirely dependent on your TA.",
    "This is a class with a small amount of readings and only two midterms and a final. It is definitely not a mind blowing class, but the second semester is interesting. This should not be the first Political Science class one should take, if you are genuinely interested in this major.",
    "Take the class to learn more about the world and power struggles between nations",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to a fellow student. You'll learn a lot about the world around you and be able to think critically about what consequences, beyond the most immediate, the headlines have for countries, people, and the world in general. Be prepared to put in some work, but it is not unmanageable.",
    "interesting course. Learn about current global relations as they happen.",
    "The class is relatively easy, and not much work. Most of the readings do not need to be done. That being said, the payoff is not great. It's a good introductory PolySci course, but it will not be earth shattering in any way. You could gain as much by reading the wikipedia pages of the respective topics, but hey, if you want a class with not much work that is pretty interesting, take it. Just know your time might better be spend somewhere else.",
    "Intro to IR is a very interesting class if you are interested in the political science field or just curious about global affairs and a basic understanding of current events. Not a life-changing calss and it's essentially a standard lecture course, but if you fit one of those two criteria I'd definitely recommend the class. It's not especially difficult and can be very interesting and fun if you like the subject material.",
    "Nice overview of the topic. The experience of the class really depends on the TF I think. Not a hard class with almost no work if you luck out with an efficient TF.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course. It is a great introduction to IR and Global Affairs as it surveys the prominent IR theories that have held throughout the 20th and 21st centuries. It allows you to approach current events from differently and widens your worldview significantly.",
    "I would recommend this course to a prospective political science or global affairs major because the content is largely separate to Gateway to Global Affairs and there is a lot of content.",
    "I would highly recommend this class to any and every student.",
    "I would recommend this to another student. Its a solid intro class with a great lecturer. It's easy not to go to class, but go anyways; the lectures are fun. Shop TA's. And don't sweat the grades too much. The class is pretty relaxed.",
    "It s a paramount course to someone who wants to understand how the world we're living in works",
    "The best course offered in Fall term for who desires to understand and make sense of the contemporary world in which we live in.Very serious issues and topic treated with knowledge, acumen and passion by a Professor in love with the subject. The Professor captures the audience and keeps his lectures fascinating"
