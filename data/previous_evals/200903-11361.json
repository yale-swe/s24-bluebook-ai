    "You have to take it for the Intensive BS. Quality depends heavily on the instructor.",
    "What you get out of this class really depends on that year's instructor. Except for bad teaching, this class was better than 440 because it had so many real-world applications built into it. That said, I think this is too much work for a non-physics\/astro\/geo major to go through for fun, even though it's pretty cool.",
    "Take it. You've done QM I; do QM II and be legit. You get a real sense of the applications of quantum mechanics that you don't get from QM I. I feel like most physical papers I now can read and interpret on my own. That's a sweet feeling.You may have heard bad things about Professor Lamoreaux. They're true: he's a terrible lecturer. That said, he is the best professor I've encountered. The way he structured the course, the homework, and the exams was the most unstressful way possible, and it still makes you want to learn it. And, it's not easy, so why not make it not stresful, too?",
    "Take it while its easy.",
    "Quantum II covers a variety of topics from the second 2\/3 of Griffiths. It was very different from 440.Prof. Lamoreaux cannot lecture-- he skips a lot of important explanation, and many students had no idea what was going on. However, he wrote good, instructive homework problems and had a very generous grading policy, allowing homework corrections (for full credit) to ensure everyone knew what was going on with the homework problems.Homework is far more important than exams.",
    "totally recommend it! Topics are awesome and the class is not that hard.",
    "Good class. Take it.",
    "You took quantum I, take quantum II. As you can tell from the syllabus, if Lamoreaux teaches it he'll give everyone an A. And I found it pretty interesting.",
    "This is a pretty homework intensive continuation to Quantum Mechanics. Expect to do all the learning from the textbook.",
    "I would recommend this course because the material is really cool; it's much better than Intro to Quantum in terms of material. There's not much pressure to work hard, and the professor is very generous with grades.",
    "It is a wonderful class. It demystify quantum!",
    "yes, although it's not as mind-blowing as 440. the course focuses on perturbation theory, which allows you to find approximate solutions to problems that are less contrived than say, the infinite square well. however, some of the calculations involved are somewhat tedious, so unless you're really interested in things like the fine structure of hydrogen the homework may not be that rewarding",
    "This class deals with some of the most interesting phenomena in physics, including fermi-dirac and bose-einstein distributions, the pauli exclusion principle, etc. Unlike the first semester of this two-class sequence, you'll engage with methodology that actual experimental and theoretical physicists use in current research, like perturbation theory and the variational principle. If you stuck it out through 440 you should definitely take this class."
