   "comments": [
    "Don't take it. Not a gut",
    "Yes it is a good class but I was not interested in the subject",
    "Good writing credit and interesting.",
    "i think it is very interesting class and see how the ancient near eastern civilization had an impact on the west and i would recommend it. And i like seeing how the heroes are depicted throughout the Ancient East.",
    "A very good course that I would certainly recommend taking.",
    "If you're a dedicated student, the frustration of working with so many slackers isn't worth the easy credit. Take something meaningful if you care about your education.",
    "Definitely not the gut it's advertised to be. The work expectations and grading seemed to vary significantly depending on your TA. As an econ major, I did more work for heroes than most of my other classes. Though the material is not difficult, I would only suggest this course if you need a writing credit because it's painfully boring.",
    "Yes because its a good and interesting history\/writing class",
    "Definitely. A great course, not a lot of work, no reason not to take it, especially if you need a Wr credit.",
    "Don't underestimate this class \u0097\u00a0it's easier than most, but you can't just slack and not do work. Take good notes during class, take the essays seriously, and don't slack on the readings. Most of it is pretty interesting too if you try.",
    "Solid Wr credit. The material is pretty interesting and the workload is very manageable.",
    "Unless you really enjoy Mesopotamian history and thinking abstractly, I would not recommend this course.",
    "Definitely take it if you're interesting in the history",
    "I would recommend this course, especially if you need a writing credit. The material is interesting, the professor is really nice, and the workload is manageable, especially relative to other writing courses.",
    "study of ancient mesopotamian culture",
    "Good class, only two papers and a final. There are weekly reading assignments that require substantial writing (a page or two each week), but the material is predominantly from stories easy to follow and easy to write on. I found the material cool, and even though the lecture was not always exciting, the sections were very well done and run.",
    "History and study of Mesopotamian figures. Yes I would reccommend, not a lot of work, you get a writing credit, and the material is pretty cool",
    "Yes - as long as you have a genuine interest in the subject of Ancient Near East history - if not, the course will be pretty boring throughout.",
    "I thought it was an interesting class, and it is a really good writing requirement.",
    "It is an interesting course if you are willing to do all the work but can be a bit boring at times.",
    "A solid course if the topic is of interest to you",
    "Not as much of a gut aseveryone says, but an easy WR for non-english majors. Lectures are boring, and sections are annoying. Material is relatively interesting. 2 museum assignments (one at the Met), 2 papers, and a final.",
    "I would recommend this class. It is not too much work and is very interesting.",
    "I highly recommend this class to another student because it is very educational and taught me alot how to write",
    "depends on his interest in ancient history.",
    "Interesting material. Great writing class for distributional requirements.",
    "Sure.",
    "Take it.",
    "Yes but as long as they are willing to do all the readings, which aren't very extensive",
    "If you're interested in close reading of texts and ancient history, take the class. It's very interesting to see the beginning of the Near East literary tradition, especially the influence on the Bible. Lecture was generally good, although occasionally a bit repetitious, and Professor Slanski is great and extremely helpful. It's not a difficult writing credit if you're interested in the material.",
    "I would definitely recommend Humanities 441 to other students. It's a class that can give you a writing credit for not much writing and if you are willing to do the work, any student can get an A in this class.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student, because i enjoyed it and learned a lot about a subject i would not normally learn about.",
    "Take it b\/c its a good class. It has a decent amount of work, but the work is usually interesting and not too long\/tedious. Go to section, do the small amount of reading, and you will be able to get a high grade and learn some cool stuff.",
    "I would definitely recommend it. A great way to get a writing credit and a solid grade. The material is interesting and the class work is pretty minimal.",
    "You take from Heroes exactly what you want to get, be it a gut class for the credit, a substantial survey of ancient Mesopotamia, or chance to develop your writing. Your experience depends a lot on which TA you get. A friend of mine got KSlanks herself and didn't seem to invested in the course as a result.",
    "If your looking for a writing credit without an overwhelming amount of writing I highly recommend this class",
    "This very diverse course covered the world's first civilisation in an interesting and concise manner. I particularly enjoyed the museum assignments in New York and at Yale. Make sure you leave enough time to do the short weekly assignments as they can take a while.",
    "Humanities 441 01 was not tons of work for a writing credit, however I didn't find the material very interesting. All the stories are from so long ago and the stories were pretty similar and not that interesting. I would take this class if you're looking for a writing credit, or if you are interested in the hero in the Ancient Near East, otherwise I would take something else.",
    "I would not recommend this class. It's good because it counts toward a writing credit, but the amount of busy work involved was just not worth it. Also, don't be fooled by the Blue Book...there is a final exam.",
    "Yes",
    "It was a relatively interesting class, and is worth taking if you need a writing credit.",
    "Yes, the material is interesting.",
    "alot harder than anyone will tell you.",
    "DON'T TAKE IT. Even it is supposed to be a gut it is so boring that the easy work will feel like tons of work. The professor seems to enjoy having athletes who don't turn up in the class and it is directed towards them. Not worth it - take something that you enjoy and are passionate about.If you love ancient near eastern heroes by all means take this class, but if you are taking it for a WR or an easy credit you will go out of your mind with boredom.",
    "This is a good fluffy class about the Ancient Near East. If you want to read the Epic of Gilgamesh and explore Yale's Babylonian Collection (which I highly recommend), this is an excellent course.",
    "you don't really learn about the hero.. and you have to learn a lot of dates and the map of mesopotamia.. two museum assignments which are fairly easy and two papers.. weekly section assignments that took some time to complete.. overall, good class, good way to fulfill writing requirement",
    "The readings and assignments for this class are not bad at all, especially considering that it is a writing credit. There are short weekly assignments and manageable readings, and there is only a final. Don't be fooled into thinking this class is an easy A, work is definitely required, but it is a good introductory class that is interesting and basic. Not the greatest lectures I have ever had, but worth at least shopping theclass.",
    "This course is very dry. Unless you are interested in Mesopotamian society and Gilgamesh...do not take this course.",
    "If you want an easy writing credit take it but don't expect this class to be a life changing experience!",
    "This class is good if you want a clear understanding of Ancient Mesopotamian history.",
    "Watch out if someone tells you this is a gut - it only is if you've taken one or two NELC-type classes before. That being said, it's a really good WR credit for those not WR inclined. Since it's a WR credit, there's an assignment due every section (which is more work than the course had in the past). While lectures can be dry, they are useful for the final exam, which was actually harder than most expected. There were some tricky things, especially the map!"
