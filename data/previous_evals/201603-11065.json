   "comments": [
    "I think I learned a good amount of philosophy and ideological frameworks. I also realized just how political and intentional nearly everything is; a seemingly innocuous museum exhibition actually reflects a ton about society and the people who made it.",
    "I learned so much from this class- particularly concerning history and ways of thinking about history. This class really pushed me to engage deeply with the readings and my classmates' ideas. It was also the first course I've taken here at Yale where I was genuinely eager and excited to answer questions.",
    "I learned a lot about visual culture and China's complex relationship with history in this class. As a political science student really interested in art and museum curation, I enjoyed the syllabus of this course.",
    "Definitely improved my ability to analyze historical evidence and write better historical papers!",
    "To develop in-depth and close reading of required readings by thinking about discussion questions",
    "This class makes me a more critical reader and a more thoughtful writer.This class overall is about the \"place of memory\", which is a critical topic interrelated with the modern Chinese history but has not been fully examined. Throughout the course we had the opportunity to look at different \"place of memory\"using different angles, each one challenging the previous assumption. In the end we conduct our own research that almost feels like a reflection of what we had discussed and examined throughout the course.",
    "I can't say I learned a lot in this classapart from the readings the first couple of weeks, which taught me quite a bit about historical theory and exhibition spaces in China, I can't say I took away much from the course as far as skills or knowledge goes.",
    "An overview of periods of commemoration in China in the 20th century and an overview of case studies in different iterations of memory in China.",
    "Uses of the Past in Modern China helped me develop a keen awareness of the complex ways in which the Chinese Communist Party leverages particular aspects of its national history to promote Party-favorable memories. I learned how to assess forms of both official and unofficial Chinese memory, from firsthand accounts of the Great Leap Forward to posters depicting the Cultural Revolution to contemporary websites devoted to eulogizing Mao Zedong, for the multilayered and selectively critical interpretations they provide about the CCP's political actions since 1949. Overall this course provided me with the tools to recognize how socially integrated CCP propaganda is throughout Chinese society in the form of culturally pervasive exhibitions and media productions. It's also taught me to consider the extent to which certain motifs of class struggle and nationalism are relied on for promoting the underlying ideology of the CCP.",
    "I learned a lot about the history and the study of spaces through both a Chinese and european lens."

   "comments": [
    "I think that the class is interesting in some ways, but I think it was the wrong seminar for me. Really too heavily based in philosophy and sometimes felt very esoteric. I think that Professor Ho should talk more and be more involved in the process as our professor; obviously she is one of the most brilliant people in her field and has a massive knowledge base, but by making students come up with all of our questions, I feel like most of the time she was simply choosing who would speak next. I wanted to learn from the expert, not a bunch of college students pretending to be smarter than they are.",
    "I really loved how this class was organized, with students creating guiding questions and taking turns leading discussions. Everyone was so engaged with the material, mainly because Professor Ho set a high bar and guided us supportively through our intellectual arc. I do wish we touched a bit more on contemporary issues and how a modern 21st century China reflects the theoretic and historical frameworks we studied.",
    "The syllabus was very well constructed in this class. In addition, the weekly journals made the seminar discussion very fruitful because everyone came to class with synthesized ideas about the readings. At the beginning of the class, I feel like we stuck a little too closely to the discussion questions (there were always too many of them) and so that hindered discussion a bit. Also, in the beginning of the semester, it was difficult to discern what Professor Ho expected of our journals.",
    "Strength: interesting topic, flexible final paper topic, great students' conversation Weakness: I wish Professor Ho can provide more her insight during discussion",
    "My favorite times where when the professor would step in and share her knowledge. Otherwise it was just listening to your peers talk, and I didn't feel like any of us were experts of any of the topics, so it would've been so much more valuable had the professor driven more of the conversations.",
    "I enjoyed all the readings. Some of them are more theoretical than others, but they gave me a clear theoretical foundation for many topics. I wonder whether there could be a few more theoretical readings that provide the same insights and background.",
    "The seminar itself was extremely well organized and there was always something to talk about. No awkward silences there. But I found the subject matter got a little boring over the course of the semester and the assignments to be repetitive and somewhat unclear. The weekly reading responses, for example, were graded really opaquely.",
    "The material is fascinating and grouped in a way that makes the class progress nicely. The reading load is perfect: there's enough to feel that one has actually read a decent amount, but not so much that one ever can't finish it all. The material at the end did, however, get a bit repetitive. It might also be good to talk about the context of each period a little bit more and really flesh out what is at stake for each group in their interpretation or commemoration of the past.",
    "I believe that the course was very well structured in the sense that it compelled students to think critically about the readings and formulate questions that connected them to previous readings from past weeks. As for weaknesses, I believe the only drawback to the class was an occasional lack of coherence in student discussions of the readings that led to us straying away from our discussion focus. This was something that is I think inevitable in most seminars, but perhaps Professor Ho could take a more prominent role in guiding discussions back on track when these moments arise. Besides that, however, discussions were very lively and designed by Professor Ho to foster our engagement with the course material in the form of organized weekly discussion questions provided by two to three students."

    "I have two main opinions on this: first, I think that you have to be aware of exactly what you're getting yourself into content-wise for this class, and second, I think that the feedback and grading criteria are very poor for this class. I think that this class seemed deceptively simple based on the reading period class. What I soon discovered after locking in my schedule, however, was just how philosophical the content of this class is. We spent the second week debating the difference between a 'monument' and a 'historical monument,' an esoteric distinction that I don't think was meaningful to me at all. Some of the stuff we learned about in this class was interesting and cool to me, but a lot of times I left class thinking 'why does this matter?' Some people really really loved it and ate it up, but it wasn't for me. I also think that the class didn't give me a comprehensive understanding of Chinese history in general, but rather focused very closely on museums, performances, art, propaganda, and other forms of media. If you are wanting to take this class, I suggest that you take a more general Chinese history class before this one to give you context. My main problem with this class is not the content, however, but rather the feedback in this class. We have weekly reading responses, which are supposed to be one page, but nearly everyone writes two pages. They're really frustrating because Professor Ho wants these 1 page reading responses to be a full-blown essay with a thesis statement and concrete evidence, and so she constantly writes things like \"expand\" and \"more detail\" on a reading response that's already twice its recommended length. She also grades them on a check\/check+\/check- system, but there's no rubric, so it seems almost random which weeks would earn which scores. I don't think that I became a better writer throughout the semester through these reading responses because I felt like my opinion was constrained to trying to please Professor Ho, and the inconsistent, unclear feedback and criteria made it difficult to know what was correct and what was incorrect. As I am writing my final paper, I feel very discouraged and don't expect to do well, because the lack of objectivity in this class, both in content and in feedback, makes it incredibly hard to know how to succeed. Overall, I am not going to say I don't recommend this class, but rather that it was not the right class for me. Perhaps some people have no problem with a wishy-washy grading system, and maybe people really like the intersection of philosophical thought and history. Wasn't my cup of tea, and if I could do it again, I would have picked a different history seminar.",
    "Yes, absolutely! This is such an intellectually engaging course. Lots of readings, but you'll actually feel the need to complete them to be prepared for the high-quality discussions. Not too much workload at all and Professor Ho is so lovely.",
    "I would strongly recommend this course to another student who is interested in visual culture, history, and China's use of propaganda. I have taken many introductory China courses at Yale, and this was a whole new way of applying that information.",
    "Definitely! The weekly discussions are so thought provoking and you really improve your writing skills through the weekly entries.",
    "Definitely",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to someone who is truly interested in contemporary Chinese history, the relationship between history and memories.",
    "I wouldn't take it unless you have a real interest in the very specific subject matter and in going at it again and again. It's not a survey course on twentieth century China, and it's not an art history course. It's a history theory course with some application in modern China.",
    "This is a great class with fascinating material and a manageable workload. Professor Ho is wonderful and runs seminar very well. I highly recommend it.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this class to someone who has a strong interest in learning more about Chinese modern political history as told through multiple perspectives that go beyond a official fact-based political science perspective offered in a large East Asian Studies lecture. Professor Ho does a wonderful job carefully curating unofficial and official historical accounts of pivotal periods of the Mao era that give a rich and nuanced look at how some of the more troubling aspects of the CCP's political campaigns, many of which helped the Party consolidate its political hegemony in China, have been exposed, retooled, or altogether silenced in modern-day China.",
    "This was an extremely interesting class which covered modern Chinese spaces through the lens of modern though and architectural theory. You should take a general Chinese history class before this class. I learned a lot."
