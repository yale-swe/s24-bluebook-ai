    "Strengths- passion and commitment of preceptors Weaknesses- did not have preplanned projects",
    "Overall, I thought it was a good opportunity to learn about multiple aspects of the healthcare industry in more detail. Ways it could be improved include more review frequent review sessions or more explanations of exam content during the lectures.",
    "It was hard to get started in the beginning.",
    "The experience with the practicum was largely dependent on where the student was placed, but the amount of general support from the check-ins were appreciated.",
    "Good practical experience. Was more useful for understanding an organization than for actually learning new skills. If you have multiple students at the same place, please be careful about not having one mentor the other. At times, it felt like I was being asked to mentor my colleague, which both put me in an awkward position and took time away from what I wanted to learn in my limited time. Overall, an amazing experience however! Glad to have done it!",
    "Very structured, great learning\/shadowing opportunities Supportive team members Extremely rewarding experience",
    "strengths: good way to get experience out of class with good support from professor weakness: need funding to take care of expenses incurred from practicum",
    "I really enjoyed my experience at Smilow. I think it is not very practical though to expect one final deliverable given that our schedules and that of our preceptor\/ team typically do not match up, and things tend to frequently change.",
    "Very practical. May want to communicate with organizations to allow heavier responsibility for students.",
    "Strength: Great way to get work experience Weaknesses: time constraint",
    "The course is what you make of it - the instructor (Marty Klein) is very approachable and easy to reach, so you have plenty of room to communicate with him regarding issues that may arise, or any questions you have about your specific practicum.",
    "Not super helpful for those already doing clinical work. Would prefer the practicum requirement be waived for those students.",
    "Strength: great hands-on learning experience for healthcare management students Weakness: depending on the site and the preceptor, some practicums lack the structure and support for students to really learn and contribute",
    "The biggest strength of the course was getting practical experience to back up the more academic classes taken throughout the program. The biggest weakness of the course was the travel involved and the time spent getting to and from the practicum."

   "comments": [
    "Varies greatly based on placement- if you are passionate about your topic and if it is relevant to your career path then I would definitely recommend it.",
    "Great for someone without much exposure to the professional world, but be selective about the practicum placement",
    "Experience working for a health care system in a practical setting",
    "Very great way to gain hands-on experience in a healthcare field of interest! You are matched with a project that you are interested in, and its a wonderful opportunity to apply class concepts to real world experiences.",
    "Very useful if willing to spend the requirement of at least 7 hours per week. Yes, I would recommend.",
    "If you are a policy student, do the policy practicum with Shelley instead. Much better course layout!",
    "A good way to gain practical hands on experience in healthcare. Recommend it to students who have limited work experience",
    "Great way to basically do a healthcare management internship in the local CT\/NY\/MA area during the semester and earn class credit. Would recommend, especially for students with minimal work experience.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to any student that has not had a significant amount of work experience."
