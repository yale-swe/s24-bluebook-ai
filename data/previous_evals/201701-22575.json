    "historiography, contextualization, historical narrative, reading for methodology",
    "The obvious skill learned in this course was how to read and write a micro history, as well as discuss what micro history is.",
    "I gained new insights concerning the way that historical narrative is put together in a scholarly context, which raised interesting problems and questions.",
    "I loved having the chance to explore the process of writing intensely focused projects.",
    "This class was about a specific type of history writing rather than a historical time period or theme, so I looked for how to write historical narrative better and more clearly. Prof. Wrightson's selection of microhistories was excellent - all good examples from a variety of fields, and enough to help improve my writing and gain insight into the historical school.",
    "This is a fantastic class for understanding a ubiquitous and yet specialized mode of historical writing. I think the class naturally attracts interested people, since it is so based on method rather than topicpeople in my class wrote about the Ottoman Empire, the Santa Fe Trail, and 20th Century Indian land rights. Professor Wrightson is a great captain for this class; he is at once laid back and firm in his knowledge and expectations, and I think it results in an environment where people are excited to talk about the readings and dedicated to their projects. Be sure to have an idea for what broad topic, at least, you'd like to write your final paper on. It's best to start early on that.",
    "A better grasp of the historian's craft. The way historians use the narrative method in their work",
    "By reading and discussing a variety of microhistories, I was able to see the strengths and pitfalls of other authors' approaches. The insights I gleaned through reading and discussion in class have already had a significant impact on my other research projects."

    "Wonderfully open discussion environment.",
    "The structure of the course with its heavy focus on reading in the first weeks and focus on writing in the later weeks is a great strength.",
    "I had expected a bit more direct discussion of research methods and approaches in the archives, but I felt that the dialogue ultimately fostered was valuable. The opportunity to read some microhistorical classics and discuss them in the classroom was great.",
    "I wish that we all read the same books each week. It would really enable a better discussion.",
    "Prof. Wrightson was excellent. Maybe we should have had a few weeks where everyone reads the same thing, but otherwise excellent.",
    "It was an excellent seminar with a excellent selection of readings. If anything, perhaps a few reading options for modernists."

    "Yes, definitely.",

    "Yes, absolutelyas long as you're more interested in method than topic. You will hear a fair amount about early modern England.",
    "Absolutely. I recommend this course without reservation",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to anyone with an interest in broadening his or her toolkit for historical writing. Though some might balk at the occasionally inclusion of unsuccessful microhistories, such case studies were also highly informative."
