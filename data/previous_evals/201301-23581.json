    "Lectures were just fantastic, and the class notes were clear and very valuable.",
    "Fantastic engaging lectures that go beyond how to run tests, but why the math works",
    "The homework and final project did help to get a handle on the material. The flexibility that the professor provided in choosing which program to use and the guidance that he gave to get through the assignments. I also really enjoyed working in a group on my homework and project.",
    "Practical, Useful, Job oriented skill",
    "application of methodologies",
    "Professor's humor",
    "The enthusiasm and level of care of professor",
    "This course provides a great introduction to multivariate statistical methods, and you get an overview of the different methods available to make sense of messy data",
    "Professor's accessibility",
    "The answer is how he taught to so many level and statistical programs. It was magic and I am not just using that word because it is a fun word to use. This meant that people from very different disciplines and experience levels could take what they wanted- if you were an anthropologist who just wanted to know what was out there you could use spss and just get the concepts. If you were an econ Ph D. you could spend time trying to understand all the formulas and doing everything in R. To be honest, I came into the class with almost not experience and was very nervous, so I started off easy, but by the end I was using R for all of the word. This meant that I focused on using the program and how to apply it to my work, but did not focus on learning the forumla behind the stats test.I really like these options and it allowed me to very easily customize this course to my needs."

    "More resources should be advertises or provided for learning the multiple statistics programs. For example, the R workshop was only minimally helpful. Even with the written code, I didn't know how to read all of the parts and had difficulty changing them correctly. Expanding the workshop would've been helpful.The lecture notes have some holes that make it difficult when trying to refer back with one's own results - especially in MANOVA.The beginning of the course was long and boring, but made more sense once we got into PCA. Integrating this earlier may be helpful?The statistics flowchart, while helpful, is not entirely clear. A more detailed flowchart or outline.",
