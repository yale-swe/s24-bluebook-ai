   "comments": [
    "Don't take it. If you like the reading list, read the books on your own. Really not worth it.",
    "YES - TAKE THIS CLASS! A wonderful series of books, great conversations, and interesting papers. What you put into the class is what you get out of it.",
    "I would summarize the class as an overview of literature about American perspectives (either from within or without the nation). The readings tied loosely together, so one of the strengths of the class was the way it forced students to draw these connections for themselves.",
    "I would recommend the book list for sure, but shop it first to see if the discussion type is something you are interested in.",
    "lovely class, lovely reading list, lovely professorwai chee is kind, understanding and brilliant. at first she comes across as soft spoken and dull, but you will soon realize that she knows exactly what she's doing; she leads one of the best seminars i've taken at yale.class is comprised entirely of two papers. do the reading..",
    "American Literature and the World is a bit of a mixed bag. The reading selections are generally fantastic and expose you to a number of very interesting issues that a lot of people are otherwise mostly unaware of, like the civil war in Sudan or the shady underworld of the cattle industry in America. However, Professor Dimock didn't always stimulate the best discussions in class - it often felt like we were only talking about superficial aspects of the novels and barely skimming their surfaces. When we did go deeper into the works, as we did earlier in the semester with the Paris novels, though, class was great. Overall, not much work outside of the reading, so it might be worth it take the course just for that, but don't expect to be amazed by the discussions.",
    "I thought the books were great. The discussion was generally good, though I would have liked to focus more on the relationship between the characters and their locations\/cultures, in line with the name of the class.",
    "this is a good english seminar with not too many papers, no final, and a good reading list. professor dimock is really nice and always willing to meet with her students outside of class.",
    "It's a good class for people who want to learn about the rest of the world. It could easily be an ER&M class because of the sheer diversity that's built into the syllabus. Moderate amount of reading, but fun reading - it's mostly novels every week, plus a bit of poetry. Some of my favorite books I've read at Yale.",
    "Yes definitely. You read some amazing books and the discussions are great and help you understand the books even more.",
    "I would recommend this class to the avid reader, or someone who enjoys thinking out loud. The reading load can be heavy but this is balanced by a low work load (only 2 papers).",
    "This is a great class. Professor Dimock is excellent, and the syllabus is refreshingly varied in style, content, and perspective, which isn't exactly common in a class like this. Very reasonable workload."
