    "it's fun and chill. don't overestimate your classmates. if you find it hard, most of them do too so no need to think this class is hard. go to class. because the prof gives extra credit questions on things he said in class. like random things. and i missed all of them........random 90's band name??? NYC museums????",
    "Surprisingly enjoyable and easier than I thought it would be. Professor Schmuttenmaer is fantastic, the text book is great.",
    "An odd class. The material isn't too hard per se, but it can be tested in so many different ways that tests and problem sets have almost no correlation to each other. This makes the exams kind of arbitrary, especially because Schmuttenmaer is so whimsical and zany. Psets are only worth 5% of your grade, but can be quite difficult. Of course, you're probably only taking this class because you have to, so you don't have much choice. Beware of the curve, which is not good at all.",
    "I actually really enjoyed this class. Schmuttenmaer is hilarious and adorable, and I got the sense that he genuinely likes teaching undergrads. This is also not really that difficult of a class. Find people to work on the psets with and it will be totally manageable. I would definitely recommend this class. I took it concurrently with the lab, which was a lot (the lab is awful, but necessary for chem majors), but I felt like the two built off of each other in a fairly helpful way, so I would recommend taking it concurrently (as long as your schedule is light enough to accommodate the lab).",
    "CHEM 332 is a standard first-semester physical chemistry course. The course is mostly thermodynamics, but touches on electrochemistry and kinetics at the end. Professor Schmuttenmaer is a great lecturer and teacher, and I would definitely recommend taking the class with him; if anything, he makes the class more entertaining and fun. There are weekly problem sets, but they are not too difficult and contribute very little to your final grade. There are three midterms and a final exam, which are all weighted fairly equally. The first exam was difficult, but Schmuttenmaer acknowledged it, and beyond that, the exams were exceptionally manageable and fair. While there was not much required work, I found that I had to put in a lot of time every week towards learning the material, because you really do need to know the concepts for exams. Still, if you enjoy chemistry and physics or math, I think you will find the class totally engaging and actually enjoy putting in that time.",
    "This class is ok--Schmuttenmaer is super nice and fun\/entertaining, but lectures weren't all that helpful-- if he posted them online, there would be no point of going to class. It seemed as though minimal effort was being put in to just get through the class (let me pull out my notes from 3 years ago and write them on the board, etc, etc). Exam questions also were sometimes poorly written and often required assumptions to be made or didn't actually test the important points, but rather seemed to be quasi-random things Professor Schmuttenmaer thought up. Doing the homework doesn't help you do better on the test (because tests and homework are usually completely unrelated).",
    "It is a good introduction to thermodynamics, electrochemistry and kinetics. It is a challenging course but I hear from other classmates that it was actually doable if we payed attention to lecture and read the textbook, just like other chemistry classes you've taken before. Be prepared to study yourself a lot, but once you study it this course will allow you to start appreciating chemistry from a different perspective.",
    "If you are at all interested in higher levels of chemistry, take this class. More likely, you have to for your major-if that is the case, don't worry about it. It's a great class, tests are exceedingly fair, and the material can be challenging, but is very do-able. Schmuttenmaer is a great professor and is very helpful one on one.",
    "dry, boring, reasonably do-able",
    "Physical chemistry was one of my most enjoyable subjects studied this semester. However, since this class is mostly taken by chemistry and chemical engineering majors, it is pretty difficult to stay on top of the curve. The tests are fair considering the breadth of material covered, with the emphasis mostly being placed on thermodynamics and thermochemistry. Overall, it is a course I highly recommend (in addition to the fact that it is required for the chemistry degree).",
    "People hype up the difficulty of this class. CHEM 332 is hard, but not impossible. I think the difficulty lies in the fact that you have to do a lot of self-learning (studying and potentially getting explanations outside of lecture) and many people take other hard classes, which can make for an overwhelming semester. In short, plan carefully and you will not find CHEM 332 overwhelmingly difficult. If you are an MB&B major, I would take this class over CHEM 328 if you want an fun, engaging lecturer and the chance to really learn physical chemistry. If you just want an easier class, take CHEM 328--but I found CHEM 332 very fulfilling.",
    "Chem 332 is alright. Prof. Schmuttenmaer is great and the material is mildly interesting. It's a lot of physics and mathematical manipulation than you would think. I'd go with the biological version if you're an MB&B major, but if you want to be hardcore, by all means, go for it since this class is definitely more legit than the biological version ('fake' pchem).",
    "This course is definitely not easy, especially with all the math-based majors skewing the curve wildly to the left. But reflectively, I enjoyed the majority of it and came out knowing a lot more about how the world of engineering and physics works. There's numerous applications that are very conceptually interesting, although most of the coursework is calculus-based. Problem sets are reasonable (5 hours a week probably), and not too absurd for the most part. You'll probably have to take this course for major credit, but if you like science and math, you might just enjoy it.",
    "I had to take it so I didn't have a choice. Little easier than orgo.",
    "Pchem is a surprisingly good class, if you're interested in chemistry. The workload isn't that much greater compared to lower-level chemistry classes and even though some of the material is complicated it's probably going to be okay if you study. Professor Schmuttenmaer is awesome.",
    "Hard class, but not impossible. Keep up with the material, having a good math background will be very helpful.",
    "Chem 332 is a strong chemistry class and, for those interested, I would definitely recommend it. The lectures go at a reasonable pace and the book is a great compliment to the lectures. Professor Schmuttenmaer does a great job lecturing. He was engaging, explained the material well, gave good examples, and was often able to get the class to laugh with a quick tangential comment. In addition, the workload was manageable and the once-a-week problems sets never took too long. As far as the sciences go, this is probably the best class I have taken so far.",
    "Really great! Schmuttenmaer teaches quite well and clearly and the textbook is clear as well. Coleen, my TA, was also really dedicated and even made summary worksheets every section for us to reinforce the concepts. The tests were fair and everyone ended up doing quite well in the class. I don't know how he'll swing the grades, but the class was fair and I'll assume Schmuttenmaer will reflect that in the final grade as well.",
    "This is a great class. The topics are cool but not overly complicated. Lecture and textbook explanations are often similar, but lecture is better so when crunched for time skip the book. Requirement for chem and chem E but would be a fun class for someone who just likes chemistry.",
    "Lectures were interesting, and they explained the concepts in a more easily digestible manner compared to the textbook. Professor Schmuttenmaer made lectures engaging. As an MB&B major, I decided to take the Physical applications one over the Biological applications one because of learning style, and Im glad I did because Professor Schmuttenmaer was a great lecturer.",
    "You'll learn a lot.",
    "This class definitely wasn't the nightmare it's reputation implies. It was actually a really good class, and maybe the best taught one I had this semester. The midterms and final were all very reasonable--except maybe the first one, which was too long to finish (but the distribution was still fine), and the psets were maybe 2-3 hours a week. You probably don't have much choice if you're taking this class, but if Prof. Schmuttenmaer is teaching again, it'll be a good experience.",
    "Curve is awful. Be aware. You don't have to study much to get ~90s on the tests, but be aware that everyone will be getting ~90s on the tests.",
    "The material in chem 332 is pretty much advanced gen chem. The first semester class isn't anything special, although it's sometimes cool to see real-world applications of physical chemistry. Professor Schmuttenmaer is a great professor and is the only reason I was able to stay awake for a 9:25am class. The problem sets are not extremely difficult and the exams aren't too bad either. They are very straightforward and fair.",
    "Usually, this is a required class if you're taking it; that said, I really enjoyed it and found that it wasn't that scary, especially not with Schmuttenmaer, who's an excellent lecturer. Schmuttenmaer's also generally described as \"zany,\" which is perfectly apt--he's a little bit disorganized but not really in a confusing way. Overall, subject matter was interesting, so this class was not at all painful.",
    "Good course. You learn a lot, but it is not too much work. Schmuttenmaer is great - really engaging and good at explaining the material.",
    "It's a great course. Schmuttenmaer is a hilarious lecturer and he's also very good at teaching. The material is challenging but manageable. Don't worry about this class too much.",
    "Based on my experience with MB&B Pchem during shopping period, I would say that this class is much clearer, more organized, and just better taught in general. Professor Schmuttenmaer is excellent and provides terrific class notes on the board.",
    "CHEM 332 is definitely a challenging course. At first it feels familiar because high school chemistry and general chemistry includes basic thermodynamcis and kinetics, but this class teaches you the math behind the equations and shows you the rigor of pchem. I think the quality of this class is dependent on who teaches it and how well they can explain the concepts, but the content is useful and pairs well with CHEM 330L and CENG 210.",
    "Overall, first semester p-chem was a good introduction to the derivations behind most of the concepts you learn in gen chem. I enjoyed the class. Prof. Schmuttenmaer was also pretty funny, and covered the material well for the most part (when he was a little disorganized, the book filled in the blanks, so in the end, you'll learn everything well).",
    "This class is mainly thermodynamics, with a bit of kinetics and a bit of electrochemistry. For people who have taken engineering thermodynamics, it isn't much work at all. For people who haven't, I still doubt that it's incredibly difficult. Prof. Schmuttenmaer is great, and it's a good experience all around. I highly recommend it.",
    "A traditional chem class. Pretty innocuous, not too hard, especially if you had gen chem here. Pretty reasonable.",
    "General overview of the first half of the Atkins Phys. Chem. book. Lectures summarize the reading for the week and don't really add much extra material. Try to learn from your psets and do extra book problems and review general concepts to study for tests. I took this because I had to as a ChemE ABET major. If this course isn't required for you then I wouldn't recommend it as it was not very interesting or novel, especially if you've already taken thermo. I will say that I had an excellent background in math\/science coming out of high school, and I wish I had taken this class freshmen year before orgo. I think it would have been easier.",
    "Id recommend this course, especially if Prof. Schmuttenmaer is teaching it. Hes an awesome professor and is absolutely hilarious. Schmuttenmaer speaks very cogently and explains concepts with great detail. The textbook is quite good, and Prof. Schmuttenmaer follows the textbook, giving the course a very nice structure. Homework problems and tests are fair, and Prof. Schmuttenmaer is very approachable. Take it over the biology-based physical chemistry!",
    "I would definitely recommend, especially to students who enjoy both chemistry and physics and want a deeper understanding of the physical, theoretical basis for chemical concepts including thermodynamics, equilibrium, electrochemistry, kinetics, gases, mixtures, and phase changes (especially thermodynamics, which is essentially the basis for the rest). I found learning about the real, theoretical basis for familiar concepts and ideas (such as enthalpy, entropy, Gibbs free energy, phase changes, kinetics, equilibrium, electrochemistry, the kinetic molecular theory and Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution, etc.) to be very interesting and even enlightening. After deriving the theoretical basis, we also took these familiar concepts a step further, applying them in new ways. Im really glad I had the chance to take this class because I feel I gained a much deeper understanding of concepts I had always wondered about. The workload and exams are very reasonable, and I found that really digesting the material and making those connections took a bit more time and effort than whats needed for the problem sets and exams alone (so to some extent what you get out of the class is what you make of it, although the course covers a good amount of material either way). Professor Schmuttenmaer is also really great, and I would highly recommend the class with him if you have the chance. His lectures were clear and understandable, and I always found him to be very approachable and helpful with questions. Hes also hilarious, so the entertainment factors there too. Definitely recommended.",
    "Chemistry 332 is a great course in physical chemistry covering gases, thermodynamics, phase diagrams, mixtures, chemical equilibrium, electrochemistry, and kinetics. I would strongly recommend this course to any student majoring in MB&B, Chemistry, or Chemical Engineering. As an MB&B major, I was initially torn between this course and Chemistry 328. Having shopped both courses, I chose this one because Prof. Schmuttenmaer struck me as the better, more engaging instructor and because I thought I would learn more in this class. Moreover, I preferred the format of this course and the grading scheme. Although Chemistry 332 definitely entails more work and is more mathematically rigorous, based on what I heard from MB&B majors in Chemistry 328, this course was still the more enjoyable one. Overall, I am glad I chose to take Chemistry 332.",
    "Really hard.",
    "This class is going to be VERY difficult if you have not taken physics before. It's 80% Math and physics and 20% chemistry. And if you're not good at Math and Physics, it's going to be a constant struggle. BUT if you work hard enough, it's manageable. Just don't take it with other equally demanding courses. Pchem needs a lot of attention.",
    "Good class, learned a bunch about physical chemistry and its applications to the physical sciences. Material is mostly concentrated on thermo (quantum etc is second semester) so a little brushup on genchem is nice. Overall pretty straightforward."
