    "Overall - great class. It would have been nice to have slightly more structure in the laboratory setting, as there were multiple times where we were waiting for reagents to be prepared by TAs or just simply unsure of how to calculate certain values (problems that could easily be solved with advance preparation). But again, a great introduction to using techniques you might not be accustomed to, even if you have prior research experience. Ends with a 10-minute presentation worth 35% of your grade - take that as you will.",
    "much more organized than 342L; Lab time are much shorter 342L (though still slightly longer than the official period)",
    "Take it if you need a bio lab! Great way to earn a full credit for a semester of lab.",
    "343L was one of my favorite courses I have taken at Yale. While not necessarily the most successful of lab projects, we learned about an extremely novel technology - CRISPR - that will be a very important part of molecular biology research going forward. Despite it being a new technology, Prof. Nelson thought we could handle it and taught an excellent lab course using the technology. I recommend taking both 342 with 343 as 342 is a good introduction to the methods used in 343 and 343's project was very appealing to our lab class. Definitely recommend this class.",
    "In the second half of the nucleic acids lab course, we learned and worked with the CRISPR\/Cas9 systema new, cutting edge technique. The days were generally pretty long: instead of ending around 4:30pm, it would usually end around 5:00-5:30pmsometimes later. Though, the second half of the semester usually ended earlier than the first half. I think some of the extra time could have been reduced if things were better organized and prepared for in advance. Of course, that can be difficult because were working on current research and what we do next depends on previous steps. Nevertheless, Professor Nelson was very patient, understanding, and put in a lot of extra time himself so that we wouldnt have to waste time redoing steps that failed. Overall, I believe the class is well taught, but not the most organized. In the second half of the semester, your grade is based on psets, your lab notebook, and a final journal-club-style presentation (10 mins)."
