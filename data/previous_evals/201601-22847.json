    "The course is a seminar bioethics class that covers important topics regarding research ethics, lab dynamics, and neuroethics.

    "I got to think about and discuss topics that I would not otherwise have put much time into. I think it was useful to give us a survey of ethical topics. The final essay was also a good chance to explore further.",
    "It allowed me to explore ethical issues within the field.",
    "It provides helpful introduction to process and meaning of research."
