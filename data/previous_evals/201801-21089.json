    "This course is divided into weekly modules that focus on different types of viruses. Some modules were much stronger\/engaging than other ones, mainly because they moved at a slower a pace and covered more background (e.g. history, clinical significance, epidemiology). A few (very few) modules jumped right into the molecular mechanisms making it extremely dry and hard to focus. Overall, this was a very well coordinated course and I gained a much greater appreciation for the field virology!",
    "I really liked how there was a survey of a wide range of topics and most of the lectures were interactive.",
    "It was great that all the notes were made available on Canvas",
    "Class was very good at giving a general overview of virology. It was very good to have the adjacent lectures on things like modeling and the immune system. The course could be further improved by the addition of primary literature based elements. Even a short (1hr\/1paper) discussion of either a historical or modern virology paper would improve the relevance and usefulness of this class."

    "If you are interested in pursuing a career relating to microbiology or virology, I would highly recommend you take this course!",
    "Yes. It is an excellent survey course and the way exams are structured encourages learning the topics you are most interested in very deeply. Also, a good way to interact with some cool researchers.",
    "Yes, it is a great introduction to virology basics",
    "Yes, This is a really good course to learn fundamental knowledge on virus.",
    "If they have an interest in Virology and have not previously taken a virology course, this is an excellent first course. Probably not if they had taken virology previously."
