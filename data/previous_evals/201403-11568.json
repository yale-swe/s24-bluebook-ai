    "Guest speakers from a variety of backgrounds; all had interesting insights about land use planning.",
    "The diversity of speakers and perspectives. Also the breadth of topics and strategies covered.",

Also, students could be assigned to do a presentation for the last class instead of writing a final paper, so that we have an opportunity to interact more and learn from each other. This class is a one hour seminar, so there is little time to do so during class.",

    "If you think you may be interested in issues of land use planning, law, or design, this course is an excellent and low-effort introduction. After this course, you should have a much better idea of whether or not topics of land use is for you, and will have a great opportunity to interact with related faculty throughout the university (and beyond due to Professor Nolon's connections with Pace Law School).",
    "This is a lecture-style seminar.",
    "Just do it -- having different types of smart people explain things to you for an hour once a week has never hurt anyone and inspired many.",
    "Quite simply, if you're interested in land use at all, take this class. It's a perfect survey class of relevant issues, and it can help you discover whether land use is a topic you wish to pursue further."
