    "This class was amazing and I would highly recommend that someone take the course. Not only did it educate me about ancient conceptions of sex and violence, but it also demonstrated modern interpretations on the subjects.",
    "Its a deep engagement with a particular aspect of Greek and Roman culture that will end up teaching you more than you might imagine about the culture in general. I would highly recommend this course to anyone even remotely interested in classics, social history, or gender and sexuality studies.",
    "CLCV 224 is a very demanding and challenging class with a huge workload, especially in terms of reading. However, every student, who is genuinely interested in the study of Classics will be fascinated by the amazing texts students have to read and prepare for class. I learnt so much in this class and I am so grateful that I was allowed to be part of it."
