    "Phil 084 gave an overview of the philosophical and psychological background for our understanding of emotions. It started off by looking at ancient philosophers, which could be slow at times, but later on proved useful for understand the progression of writing on emotions. A lot of the class focused on developing a theory of emotions, and by the end I found that I could effectively evaluate theories of emotion. I would recommend this class to another student.",
    "If you're interested in psychology and philosophy I would take it. There's a decent amount of reading but overall it's fine.",
    "It's an interesting discussion style class that was a very easy intro into philosophy in a course that involves no memorization or pointless papers (unlike what I hear of many of the intro to philosophy course). I would recommend the course to a friend, but I would tell the friend that the course is much more philosophy-based rather than psychology. The tutorials are very helpful in developing ideas and arguments.",
    "If you are new to philosophy but interested in seeing what it's like, I would strongly recommend this course. It was a great introduction, particularly because it was a small seminar style class. The material was also interesting and the professor was good.",
    "This class is interesting forthose who are devoted to philosophy, but otherwise I don't know if I would recommend it for anyone who simply wants to fulfill a distributional requirement.",
    "I would recommend starting Credit\/D\/Fail if you're new to philosophical writing, but more often than not you'll wanna switch to a letter grade after the second paper."
