    "This course helped a lot with vocab, grammar, and listening. All the homework and daily classes built a solid foundation for me.",
    "I developed the skill of having class on a specific subject every day. That and the fact that we also had homework every day was totally new to me and made me develop the skill of taking a time every day to practice a new language.",
    "I learned how to communicate in French e.g. ask questions and respond to others or have a meaningful conversation. I learned not only what is a correct way but also what is an acceptable way of speaking. (The use of certain works might be correct grammatically but inacceptable in the French culture.) This course helped me master the basics of the French language. I learned a lot about the French culture as well.",
    "My French was born and developed really fast, mainly my speaking and writing skills."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Even though the small class setting helped with practicing speaking, I still don't think I had enough opportunity to speak French, and the oral portion was generally my worst in quizzes. I think class could also have been more intensive in terms of reviewing grammar.",
    "The strengths include the French in Action methodology and the every-day contact with the language. I thought the idea to learn in a french environment and with a big time commitment helped me learn the language naturally and quickly. However, considering that the French language has a lot of grammar and specific rules, I felt a lack of written activities using the board and working specifically with grammar. Furthermore, I think we could use more recent sources with vocabulary that they actually use nowadays to balance with French in Action and some outdated vocabulary.",
    "One strength of this course in my opinion is entirely covering all aspects of learning a new language- speaking, writing, reading, listening, vocabulary and grammar- this holistic method made this a great and efficient course that teaches all the basics of a language. The material was entertaining as well. The weaknesses or rather what I did not like about this course is first of all the oral production- the distribution of how much time we were given to prepare our answer and how much time to respond was not efficient. I either needed more time to prepare my answer or more time to answer, or forgot the details of the question by the time I needed to answer, and I was always nervous for having to record my voice e-v-e-r-y test, every single week. Also, the tests (the last 4-5 tests) take more than 30 minutes to complete especially since we not always had enough time to practice the grammar rules we were tested on, in class. Moreover, the fact that we did not get to keep the graded tests really disturbed me, I think that reviewing our mistakes of a test would be a great revision to the following tests and final exam. And if there is a legitimate reason to why we should not keep them, it should at least be explained.",
    "The videos are a great resource for students, but a lot of the content and words learned are outdated. Perhaps filming a new story for French in Action would be a great idea to preserve the success of the method in the next years."

    "If you want to be good at French and build a solid foundation, this is the way to go. The workload is a lot and you have to really commit in order to do well on quizzes. But setting time aside everyday helps with improving your French overall.",
    "I would recommend this class. If you do the work every day you will make great progress with French.",
    "Yes definitely. That is a great foreign language course. Beautiful language, fantastic course and an amazing professor.",
    "Yes. It is a great way of learning french fast and efficiently."
