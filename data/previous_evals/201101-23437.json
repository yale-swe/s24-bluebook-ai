   "comments": [
    "Strengths are the labs, but the class time is very redundant and dry",
    "n\/a",
    "This course does a good job applying statistical principles learned in the first semester to problems\/situations you would encounter in the real world.",
    "The focus on statistical interpretation was helpful, but the same examples were used over and over again. Also, many of the examples were not health-related.",
    "Good follow up to 505a",
    "I like the conceptual approach, understanding what types of regressions to run on what types of data, instead of forcing us to follow strict formulas, etc",
    "I think this course was good overall - I have a much better understanding of statistical methods, and how to apply these to data that I will collect in the future. The class was focused on the practical aspects of statistics and its applications, which was great. I felt that the lectures themselves could have been a bit more straightforward - I occasionally felt as though we were jumping from one subject to another or taking a really long time with one particular subject, but in all, this was a good course.",
    "This course could have easily been taught in half the time.",
    "It could be shortened to a half semester and then during the second half of the semester, students could complete a small biostatistics project using SAS.",
    "The course and textbook are too abstract and don't provide a detailed understanding of any particular statistical concept, which makes it difficult to truly learn. I also felt it would be helpful to focus more on public health biostatistics instead of just general statistical concepts unrelated to public health. (Average temperature, beanie babies, etc.)",
    "Great course!",
    "Weakness = exam did NOT test material from class! T-test was covered in fall semester class that I did not take. I think based on the emphasis the exam had on t-tests, the professor or TAs should have covered t-tests.",
    "Overall, I thought the course was very good. The course focused on the underlying reasoning behind why we use which statistical method and how to interpret the data from SAS rather than on the computation that we learned from Biostatistics 505A. This information is more applicable to what we will be doing in the future in regards to summer internships and thesis projects.",
    "I very much enjoyed that the focus of this course was on the theory of statistics.",
    "1) Class needs to add something beyond the textbook.2) The professor shouldn't assume everyone took biostats I the previous semester; many students waived out of this course. This created problems when the professor kept saying \"I'm going to skip this since I'm sure you covered it last semester\".3) Class needs to be more structured. It can feel a bit rambly\/disorganized at times.",
    "The course was too subjective and did not have enough statistical concepts",
    "This course was good but I would have learned more from having problem sets that were more similar to the final",
    "Strengths: Emphasis on the conceptual aspect of biostatistics. I enjoyed how the focus was not on the mechanics, but more on the application.Weaknesses: The pace of the course was a little slow.",
    "it's a slow moving course. i'd say either go to lecture or read the book, but not both unless you need the reenforcement. the labs really help with understanding the material. they are tedious though.",
    "I liked how different biostats II was compared to biostats I in terms of seeing the big picture, but sometimes I wish we were given a bit more concrete ideas\/exercises. I liked how the lab codes were ready for us to use because that put all the emphasis in interpretation.",
    "Strengths:Labs usefulClear expectationsWeaknesses:Lacking rigor",
    "It was a great course, necessary for all studying public health and\/or epidemiology.",
    "The strengths definitely lie within the lab. I think the class should be strictly lab-based. The theory behind the work was provided in lab and it allowed us to use SAS to understand it. Lecture was a bit dry, hard to follow, and seemed unnecessary.",
    "This was a great class. I find the labs and textbook very useful. The final was significantly different from my expectations, however. And I felt that although I spent a long time preparing for the exam, it did not cover what I expected it to.",
    "It was a very useful course in that I was able to learn widely used biostatistical methods, such as Poisson regression and survival analysis. I also got more interested in taking more biostatistical courses for my remaining time at Yale.",
    "I think our ability to think in statistically relevant ways is very important for MPH students. I liked the subject matter in this class. The material and methods learned were extremely applicable to real-world research and occurrences. I wish we had time to go more in depth into some of the methods.",
    "I would like it more if this class focused more on math (it is statistics afterall). There should be more focus on how to do the math and not just how to make SAS solve the problem for us.",
    "good overview class",
    "This class is repetitive, uninformative, and confusing - even to those who may have done well in the first semester or have taken biostatistics before. A topic is covered at length, phrased exactly the same for 2 weeks straight. You easily could have gone to one class a week and would have had a complete set of notes.",
    "The professor personally is wonderful, and great to talk to one on one, but I think the course should be laid out in advance with topics, and have some sort of schedule to follow, because the general consensus is that the course is very irregular, the lectures are confusing, the lectures don't match the labs, and it's difficult to follow what is going on. It's a complicated subject, and for people with less background in this, it's just generally hard to actually learn anything.",
    "Dr. Zelterman is a wonderful professor and every single one of the TAs was a great help in understanding the material for the course. However, more examples and real life application of what was learned would have been more helpful.",
    "Maybe let us choose to not do 1 lab. That would be nice.",
    "overall it was a good course, strengths were the lab sections - the ta's this year were fantastic.weaknesses, overlapped with our research methods course, could've taken one or the other. no need for both.",
    "great",
    "Great courseStrengths: Professor's teaching style, labs, TFs' responsivenessWeaknesses: Exams lacked breadth (and thus limited students' ability to demonstrate knowledge)",
    "I really liked how the course focused on concepts and application rather than theory and equations. The labs were very useful, and complemented what I learned in Data Management quite well.The lectures were quite redundant for those who read the text book. Maybe the lectures could have been more interactive? We could have been given some sample problems to think about and then try to answer in class (beyond just the \"final project\" on the last day of class).",
    "It would have been nice if the actual exams reflected the sample exams more closely.",
    "This class was a great introduction to numerous statistical regression methods. I felt like the first section on linear regression was a bit long and after many labs felt a bit redundant. More time could have been spent on other methods, such as Survival analysis and Proportional Hazards.The labs were perfect correlates to the material being discussed in class and really helped solidify our knowledge. It was also very helpful to have a length limit as it helped us practice using concise language.I wish more emphasis had been spent on interpreting output parameters for each regression method, as this was often not made clear by lecture notes or in the book.",
    "Less class time or more course material. TOo drawn out.",
    "Great course with fair assessments.",
    "this class is not necessary after BIS505a",
    "The lectures were a little slow, could cover more or figure out ways to introduce more diverse examples",
    "The course does a good job of applying the principles you learn to real problems. I enjoyed how the text and the labs took us through tangible examples of problem sets.",
    "At times the course seemed slow but covered each topic in depth.",
    "Its good course and provides great insight into statistical thinking",
    "In my opinion, the greatest weakness of this course was the speed. Since it moved particularly slowly, it was difficult to stay engaged. Furthermore, I believe there was an opportunity to cover more material, or cover it in deeper depth, if the pace of the class were changed.Although the course was intended for us to think of the big picture of analysis rather than getting caught up in the calculations, I believe some forays into the math would have enhanced my understanding.I do think it was valuable to focus on when to use the different methods given the data collected. In this way, the course was a nice pairing with the research methods course. However, there was considerable overlap and both courses would potentially benefit from coordinating the curricula to prevent this in the future.",
    "The course was good at applying principles of biostatistics. It was very open-ended at times so it was difficult to gauge what was important and what was not as important. The final exam was surprisingly difficult.",
    "strengths: the lab reports were a useful way to solidify information; the lab power points also were a good summation of course materiallimitations: lecture attendance did not teach me anything I couldn't get from the book.",
    "Enjoyable and helpful course occupying the difficult territory between introductory and specialist statistics. I enjoyed the 'think for yourself' approach of the instructor, and it was convenient to have most of the course material and all of the exercises and labs in one text book. I particularly liked the way that SAS programs were made available for the labs, and that we were expected to modify and extend the lab exercise creatively.",
    "The labs were in depth and pertinent. However. I would have like to have used more biostats examples than were used in class.",
    "Good emphasis on applications of SAS and understanding the process of statistical thinking.",
    "The strengths of the course was that it really forced us to think critically about statistics- I felt that the weekly lab assignments were most useful. These are important in lieu of doing mechanical statistics problems.",
    "excellent",
    "Strengths: The book was good. It explained the topics well. It would have been even better if it was coupled with another more detailed book.Weaknesses: Attending the actual class felt like a waste of time.",
    "Exam questions are ambiguous. Homework does not prepare students for the exam questions.",
    "The professor worked hard to make sure we understood the course material. I liked that the information was meant to be more practical and less theoretical.",
    "class time wasn't best spent sometimes. often repetitive and redundant.",
    "Strengths: Text was very clear and easy to followWeaknesses: Actually doing the SAS for some labs might be helpful in learning the codes, something that was not available in the course."

    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0The professor spends class time simply going over what is already in the textbook. It would be beneficial to present the material in a different manner in during lecture.",

    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0Very energetic and enthusiastic, made a potentially dull topic more interesting",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0Professor Zelterman was a good lecturer overall. I really liked that he started each class with a clip from stats in the news, as that really brought the class to reality for me. I thought that he could have engaged the class a bit more in participating, but he did well making sure that everyone understood the material before moving on.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0Highly entertaining.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0Dr. Zelterman seemed engaged and available, though again, the general course concepts were too abstract.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0Very approachable",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0Professor Zelterman was an excellent professor. He explained the material very well and repetition of the material helped to reinforce the information. However, there are some instances where information conveyed would be confusing. For example, he interchanged the terms \"leverage\" and \"influence\" in his lectures. Reading the book and talking to TAs clarified this. Also, during lectures where there were not many students as a result of snow storms or because the Epi class did not have lecture that day, he would review previous material rather than continuing with new material. I feel that that is not necessary.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0WON.DER.FUL.",

    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0Very responsive to students",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0Overall a great instructor. At times his explanations were a little long-winded.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0nice man. goes on tangents. but helpful.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0Dr. Zelterman is very passionate about the course material. His book is well-written and I appreciated how closely it matched topics covered in class. I'm not sure what can be done to increase class attendance because several times that seemed to be in issue (being one of the constant attenders). Sometimes too much time was spent saying the exact same thing, especially during the \"in the news\" section at the beginning of class.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0Dr. Zelterman's enthusiasm for stats was evident, which made the classroom an enjoyable experience.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0Professor Zelterman was very clear in lecturing, motivating, and encouraging. I think he did a wonderful job instructing the course, and that the tests, while difficult, tested our understanding of the knowledge taught. He challenged our thinking abilities and provided us with a solid foundation of biostatistics that will help us in our future course of studies.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0He stressed how to practice what we learned in the course in the real situations, and the textbook written by him was extremely helpful.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0Dr. Zelterman was a very pleasant instructor who was always upbeat at 8:30am. I liked that he wrote his notes as he talked instead of slides. I appreciated the review of methods he had talked about previously, but also thought that some of it could be cut back so that we could learn more in depth about some of the methods. Overall, I enjoyed Dr. Zelterman as a professor.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0Dr. Zelterman is very friendly and concerned with his students. Very nice guy.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0PROS-humorous teaching style-very broad overview of many topics-gave students a lot of independence",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0Professor was not receptive to class feed back, would avoid answering questions directly and overall did not appear to have a solid grasp of the epidemiology base of biostatistics. The professor is extremely intelligent and seems to have a philosophical understanding of biostatistics, but is unable to communicate effectively to the students - who are trying to understand biostatistics at the epidemiology level.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0The instructor is great, he is very communicable and open to office hours and one-on-one help. He is also a very entertaining instructor, however that entertainment needs to be balance with actual instruction, especially for a class so early in the morning he is very difficult to follow.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0I absolutely adore Dr. Zelterman. He made getting up at 8:30 AM a joy rather than a burden. His energy in the morning extended throughout the auditorium and made learning the material enjoyable.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0One thing...don't preach that there are multiple ways to look at problems and multiple ways to reach acceptable answers and then penalize people for thinking outside the box on the final.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0he was great. he was a good lecturer, and very approachable.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0Wonderful",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0Great -- great lecturer, responsive",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0Dr. Zelterman was a great instructor. His qualitative approach was the most interesting and applicable method to teach biostatistics I have had yet. It was obvious he cared about the material. I also really liked the \"in the news\" portion of class.I felt sometimes we spent a bit too long on certain areas, particularly on single and multiple linear regression. Overall, the pace worked for me personally.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0Very nice. And enthusiastic. Could challenge us more",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0This professor does appear to be sincere about teaching students the principles of statistical thinking. The professor is filled with enthusiasm for quantitative methods and encourages student learning. However, the lectures are often unclear and riddled with personal anecdotes and jokes. These asides are not only unnecessary but also distracting. For example, in the lecture discussing residuals, the professor noted that students should focus on the \"signal\" to \"noise\" ratio. Then, Zelterman commented that students would \"have a problem\" if they heard additional sounds in the classroom, and he subsequently started to laugh. This joke seemed inappropriate as it marginalizes those with mental illness, which is indefensible in a career such as public health, which has a responsibility to protect vulnerable populations.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0Dr. Zelterman was a great instructor. He was very responsive to student needs and invited questions.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0his text book is excellent; his class is his textbook so it becomes unnecessary.",

    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0He is really entertaining and dedicated. The course is very easy to follow!",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0Zelterman is a great, engaging instructor. Sometimes he did not have definitive answers on what concepts were more important than others making it difficult to know what to focus on for labs and exams.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0strengths: though arguably redundant, the professor was good at presenting one issue using multiple perspectives (or scenarios)limitations: instructor could have been more accommodating to students-- for example, understanding that students have different learning styles and answer keys to all the midterm exams would have benefited many students.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0For a class this size I felt surprisingly engaged with the instructor. I liked the style of the lectures and especially the occasional deeper digs back to basic principles e.g. whether the chi squared test was one or two tailed.I also found the instructor very approachable and helpful outside of class.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0Wonderful man!",

   "question_text": "How would you summarize this course for a fellow student? Would you recommend it to another student? Why or why not?",
   "comments": [
    "Take the course and you'll learn so many statistical skills that will help you in the future, whether you're going into medical school or banking",
    "I would recommend this course to other students who will be using statistics in their future careers or courses. It teaches you how to take data and problems and apply statistical principles to them in order to find an appropriate solution.",
    "I wouldn't really recommend this course to other students if they had a choice of taking it or not. Learning how to interpret statistics is highly important, but we learned how to do that pretty much in the first half of the course.",
    "Not tough at all, builds on and solidifies 505a",
    "Introduction to various types of statistical methods used to analyze different kinds of data",
    "The course material covered is really important, and will be really helpful going forward in my public health degree. I think that the course could have been a bit more streamlined in terms of the material we covered, but it was an interesting and relevant course.",
    "Nothing like the first course.",
    "Biostatistics 505B teaches you about the underlying reasoning as to why particular linear statistical models are applied, how to write the SAS program for those methods, and how to interpret the data. The class is very useful for understanding why journal articles use specific methods and how to perform tests for inclusion in articles, as would be helpful for the summer internship and for future projects. I would definitely recommend this course to other students.",
    "I would not recommend this course. Exempt out of it if you can. It's a waste of time; you can learn similar material in other, better courses.",
    "The course is different from the first part of biostatistics. I would recommend the course to another student because the content is applicable for a career in public health.",
    "Only if you are required to take it.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course, as it provides a more indepth look at regression and an opportunity to synthesize the material covered in 505A",
    "you have to take it.",
    "I would recommend the course just because it increases your knowledge on what we learned first semester, specifically in relation to interpreting data and results (which is necessary in public health). Sometimes the classes gets repetitive, which is why many people do not attend every class, but always thought I'd miss something said in a new way if I missed a class. Overall, a pretty good complement to Dr. Claus's course.",
    "Necessary class to complete core. If you focus on the labs very well, you should have no problem in the course.",
    "I would recommend it because it is necessary.",
    "The course definitely helps to learn SAS and using linear regressions in SAS. I learned a lot but mostly from lab.",
    "This is a statistical course focused on modeling. You will learn how to do linear regression, logistic regression, survival curves, etc. You will have SAS lab work every week. Overall course load is moderate. I would recommend it to another student.",
    "I Recommend. I think it makes perfect sense to make this course as one of the requirements for MPH candidates for the practical purpose.",
    "Intro to Statistical Thinking II is an overview of statistical methods and their application to public health research goals. I would recommend it to another student because I think it important to understand using statistical tests concurrently with specific methods in understanding a public health problem.",
    "It's required so take it. Take good notes and you will do just fine.",
    "broad overview of statistical methods",
    "Not worth your time, would do better just reading the book and paying attention to the TAs during lab. Time would be better spent taking a course of interest, if you can place out of this one.",
    "It is a required course. It is a nice intro to multiple linear regression, logistic regression, poisson regression, survival analysis, etc.",
    "Make sure you read the book, because it makes a lot more sense for the lectures. Understand all of the difficult evaluation methods of data because that's really the key part of the class. Good luck because it's hard.",
    "The course is a general overview of various models used to analyze data.",
    "i dont think this course is needed for those not doing research in the future. either biostats or research methods is fine, but not both.",
    "It was quite good learning experience, and Dr. Zelterman makes this course very interesting by incorporating real life examples.",
    "This class provides an introduction to various statistical regression methods. I would highly recommend it as a theoretical and practical approach to biostatistics.",
    "Yes",
    "this course is required, but the school should make it better. it doesnt add much to BIS505a",
    "It is required, and combined with Methods (the other req. for pol\/mgmt) not necessary.",
    "This couse goes well with the Data Management and Analysis course because they go over the basic statistical approaches you would need to tackle any data set. A very useful course.",
    "The course is straightforward and a good qualitative overview of statistical analysis. The course is very manageable and at times even seems repetitive.",
    "Good course with excellent professor and TAs",
    "This class was an additional introductory course into the field of statistics, covering many of the basic tools statisticians use (i.e. linear, logistic, Poisson regressions) on a broad scale. This course places emphasis on the approaches of researchers to data more so than the specifics of the methodology.",
    "The course is good and I would recommend it to a fellow student. ou learn a lot about the application of biostatistics.",
    "a summary of biostats 1 plus a few extra models, as well as the SAS diagnostics that go with them.",
    "Good bridging course between basic and advanced statistics.",
    "learning linear and logistical regression methods for SAS data analysis.",
    "This course analyzes statistical methods that can be used to evaluate various statistical tests. It focuses on the application of statistics more than the mechanical component of solving problems. I would highly recommend it to students because itprovides practical tools to evaluate statistical data.",
    "go to class",
    "Its just Biostats... a necessary evil...",
    "No. Too repetitive of simple concepts. Not enough preparation for exam material.",
    "I felt like this class solidified my understanding of basic SAS and biostatistical concepts, and I would recommend it to anyone planning on doing statistical analysis for their thesis or in their professional work.",
    "Repeat of Biostats 1."
