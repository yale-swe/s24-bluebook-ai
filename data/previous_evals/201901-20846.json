    "Critical analysis of Shakespeare through a religious lens. Very interesting discussions in class led by intelligent students of diverse backgrounds (div school, undergrads, grads, auditors). The course was great because the students in it were very engaged in the discussions and the professors were so intelligent.",
    "I think I learned a lot about how to function in a graduate setting and how to pursue my own interests within the framework of a class, getting the most I could out of the course.",
    "Learned lots about the Shakespeare plays on the syllabus, going over each in careful detail and wondering how they work scene-by-scene and also as broader artwork. Blog posts forced interactions with important themes or motifs and provided a backbone for discussion.",
    "Better general familiarity with Shakespeare's text historical context consideration of \"religion\" as an analytical object and as an analytical framework ways of thinking and speaking about character development\/psychology"

   "comments": [
    "Could be improved with increased religious focus on text--occasionally we discussed the play from a literary perspective and a religious one second",
    "This was a great and informative course. For all the knowledge presented on Shakespeare, less was presented or assigned on religion. The course started in the first or second week with secondary reading, which would have been a welcome inclusion in the rest of the coursematerial on the history of religion in particular. Conversation in seminar was a highlight, with no awkwardness or silence, and excellent participation.",
    "more attention to the things that religion can mean earlier on in the course so that those differing interpretations could be brought to bear in discussions of plays themselves given this attention to the definition of religion, maybe some preliminary remarks on negotiating the reading of historical texts and themes in those texts against contemporary theories\/definitions"

   "comments": [
    "David Kastan and Abdul-Rahman Malik (AR, as we called him) are a wonderful teaching double act--they bring different academic backgrounds and life experiences to what was definitely one of the most unusual Shakespeare courses I've taken at Yale. Our conversations touched on issues of faith, contemporary politics, identity, and much more...it wasn't the most focused discussion sometimes, but we always went in interesting directions, and DSK + ARM are wonderful, compassionate, and humane readers and teachers.",
    "Yes!",
    "Yes! Great way to engage with Shakespeare in seminar form",
    "I would recommend this course to any undergraduate interested in Shakespeare, as well as any graduate student willing to research early modern religion on the side to put theology\/religion in touch with course materials.",
    "Yes."
