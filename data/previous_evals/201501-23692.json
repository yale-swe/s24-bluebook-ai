Thoughtful about pedagogy. Interesting guy. Weaknesses: not many. Maybe does a little too much recapping and summarizing of what others' said (though many times this came in very handy)",
    "Instructor: Timothy Michael Terway \u00a0Strengths: Tim is patient and open, and gets very excited about students grasping new and unfamiliar concepts. He is a tremendous guide and facilitator, and pushes students to critically challenge themselves in academic pursuits."

    "Q15: This is the most valuable course taught at FES.",
    "My best course at F&ES. Relevant to everyone who wants to better understand what's happening in the world and what they believe. This is what I wanted to find at this school and I'm so glad that in my 4th semester I finally found it. Dr. Clark is a great asset to this school - her pedagogy is effective and transformative. Thanks!",
    "This class will teach you how to think not what to think. it is a departure from standard learning and much in need in our education system. a complete shame that it is not going to be available at FES for longer as it really is revolutionary and essential for what FES purports to do. This class is about how to approach the multi dimensional problems that exist. it does not pretend to give answers, only tools. it is wonderful.",
    "The content of this course is unlike anything that I have experienced in my conservation career. Because of this, I have a new approach to dealing with an entire range of issues in conservation and beyond. Dr. Clark operates on a higher level than most people that I have ever interacted with. At the same time, she is inviting and encouraging as students try to grasps with some unorthodox ideas. I would recommend students from across FES to become familiar with the framework that is taught in this class. Doing so will provide students and professionals to take new, more pragmatic approaches to conservation in the hopes that advances in this field could be realized. I have continued to study the concepts taught in this class beyond the end of the semester, something I could scarcely say for other courses I have taken at FES. This course changed my way of thinking at a foundational level, and I will be a better leader in my field because of it."

    "The concepts taught in this course are critically important and are being taught no where else at this school.",
    "I really enjoyed the group projects for this course. It really allowed us to dive into using and applying the framework. I would have been a lot more confused about the framework and how to use it if I did not have this opportunity to apply it to this project and have a group to discuss it with. I also loved hearing from the guest speakers and learn how they were using the framework. What I found most interesting is how they were able to subtly use the framework in conventional terms. This seem very practical and will be useful to us as we graduate. I also really appreciated how willing Susan was to meet outside of class to just chat. Having a professor who was so willing to have a fun conversation (whether it was related to class or not) was really meaningful.",
    "Field trip was invaluable",
    "The field trip was great - I learned a lot.",
    "In-class dialogue",
    "The field trip was an incredible opportunity to learn from others, myself, and my colleagues. There was a tangible project as well as opportunities to figure out what conservation really is and how I want to fit into it. Good discussions too.",
    "Very well designed and executed by the teachers. The field trip opened my eyes to what people are thinking out there in the working world. The perfect experience to make sense of what can be a fairly abstract framework. This course's material is relevant to my own life in so many ways."

For example, it would have been really useful to have had the context group go early on so that other groups could have more effectively incorporated the context group's work into their own.",
    "The expectations for many of the assignments were not always made clear. For instance we were not quite sure who we were writing our chapter for or exactly what it should contain. My only recommendation for improving this course would be to make expectations a bit clearer.",
    "The information felt repetitive towards the middle of the class. The field trip provided a refreshed perspective.",
    "The assignments were sometimes a little unclear (in terms of expectations). I think the readings could be classified in terms of recommended and required. I loved them, but they could be selected a little more judiciously, perhaps",
