    "Although it was a fast paced course the problem sets and the reading quizzes provided a way of checking if we were developing a good understanding of the material. The distribution of time between the chapters also reflected the amount of material and was helpful."

    "I would recommend this course to any student who is interested in gaining a good introduction to quantum mechanics. It provides a good base of knowledge by itself and would also lead well to the study of further subjects. It is a fast paced, but a very well taught course."
