   "comments": [
    "An incredible overview of a hard-to-grasp region, presented in a factual manner so you can use these facts to develop your own opinions. Professor Foster provides a wonderful, clear presentation of the information and is a truly gifted orator.",
    "This is an excellent introduction to a fascinating part of the world. Foster brings a unique perspective, based on his scholarship and travel. It feels like an old school course. The readings are all print, and slideshows are done on an old projector, so if you don't mind that I would recommend it.",
    "This course is very interesting, has a lot of content, which can be a bit overwhelming for a subject where most of us don't have much background knowledge, but I definitely would recommend this course to anyone who doesn't know anything about the Middle East.",
    "I really liked this class. The middle east is SUCH a complex region, and so many people thing they know what it's all about without really knowing anything. The course gives a good overview of various regions, explains how many of those histories overlap, and takes it all the way up to the modern day. Super informative -- really influenced the way I think about middle eastern history AND current events. Professor Foster's lecturing style is like storytelling, which I found engaging. The readings are extensive but actually really really interesting if you can keep up. You can still do pretty well in the class if you haven't done all the reading, but you'll be rewarded on the exams with top points if you have done it and can reference the readings in your answers. I would definitely recommend it, whether it's relevant to your field of study or not. It's material that would be useful to anyone.",
    "Highly recommend this class! Only a midterm and a final and the assigned reading is very optional and not on the exams. You cover a ton of material but Professor Foster is a great lecturer and always shows pictures at the end of class of the region\/time period that we discussed. I learned so much this semester and if you want a basic understanding of the history behind the conflicts in the Middle East today, this is the class to take.",
    "I would definitely recommend this to another student. Although the lectures go really fast, Professor Foster's office hours are really helpful and the only real things one needs to know are the key terms (found at the front of your course packet). Do the readings, because they really help you comprehend each unit. No matter how long it takes, trust me it's worth it.",
    "Fine, but I don't think I got as much out of this course as I did from any other course I took this semester. The textbook reading was very interesting, and usually more deep than the lectures-- you could come away with a pretty similar experience if you only read the textbook. The lectures were very good-- Professor Foster is engaging and often quite funny, but I still wouldn't recommend this class. You can probably also find a similar series of lectures online (I know Columbia's comparable course is on iTunes for free). That said, I would imagine a discussion section\/ the writing section would make this course worth taking at Yale rather than independently.",
    "Great class to take credit D because it's 50% midterm and 50% final. So you can get away with just going to class twice a week and then studying for the tests. It's also very interesting information that's important to know in order to understand conflicts in the Middle East today.",
    "It will help immensely to do the readings after lecture to pick through what is most important. There is obviously a vast quantity of information, but Professor Foster's notes help to orient the knowledge in a way that is more digestible. Professor Foster is also very kind with meeting with students and is generally a lovely man with interesting stories\/pictures. Take it, but only if you are actually interested in gaining a broad view of Middle Eastern history. Otherwise, the relative lack of depth would probably be frustrating.",
    "A very thorough introduction to the Middle East - as thorough an introduction as you'll get over the span of a single semester. Would highly recommend to any student who's looking to understand current events and affairs in the Middle East. Whereas I earlier would have steered completely clear of any conversations regarding the ME, I now know more than enough to engage in meaningful conversation. Do the readings. Pay attention in lecture. This class definitely isn't a breeze, but if you do the prep work, then you'll be fine.",
    "Take this course!!!",
    "Absolutely take this course. Professor Foster is an incredible lecturer. Every class was exciting, interesting, informative, and delivered in a really engaging way.",
    "An excellent take on Middle Eastern history, religion, culture and current issues. Take it if you want a broad overview of the entire region by a renowned, passionate professor. Lectures are early (9am) but they are worth the early rise.",
    "I can't say yes enough. I took this class to fill in a gaping hole in my knowledge of world history and was not disappointed: besides covering an absurd amount of material in an engaging and entertaining way, Prof. Foster is unbelievably knowledgable and clearly an expert in his field. Despite having class at 9 in the morning, it was the class I looked forward to most every week because I walked out every day feeling like I gained a great deal of understanding. Tests are fair, and are doable without doing the reading, but the readings are chosen well and are worth spending time on. Yes!",
    "This class starts from the very basics and assumes no prior knowledge. The workload is not difficult (just a midterm and a final, plus 3 papers if you take the writing section), although doing all the readings would take a significant chunk of time, not to mention that if you buy the optional textbooks too, it's quite expensive. I would suggest this class if you don't know much about the middle east and want to learn more without causing too much strain on your other courses. Professor Foster is great.",
    "MMES 102 01 is an amazing overview course perfect for someone looking for an introduction to the region. It really peaks your interest for the topics that are dipped into in the lectures. You have to attend every single lecture in order to keep up, but the information is so interesting and Professor Foster is awesome that it is definitely worth it. I would really recommend this class.",
    "Out of the 15 courses I have taken at Yale, this is easily the best. I came in knowing very little about the history of the Middle East, so everything I learned was new knowledge, and every lecture was whirlwind and edge-of-your-seat. That being said, when you're covering 1500 years of history in one semester, you won't know tons about every single topic. Furthermore, if you zone out for 10 seconds you can miss the introduction of a new group or person and be lost the whole lecture.",
    "I loved this course. It gave an overview of the Middle East from Muhammad to ISIS. Professor is amazing and really has mastery of the US's role in the Middle East and the complex nature of the peoples living there. Definitely take!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to any student wishing to gain a wide foundation of knowledge about the Middle East from which to later build upon with more specialized knowledge. That's why I took this course, and that's what I got out of it. I wanted to gain a basic set of vocabulary with which to talk about the Middle East, which I felt like I was lacking entirely from my education thus far. I hope to take classes later during my time at Yale that delve deeper into certain countries and cultural aspects of the region, which I will be able to think about analytically because of this class.",
    "This course is an excellent introduction to the Middle East for anyone who wishes to better understand a region of strategic interest. The course is fast-paced and involves a lot of reading, but the lectures are outstanding. The material examines Middle Eastern history from about 600 AD to the present, so you will leave with a broad body of knowledge applicable to many other fields of study. I would also recommend taking the optional writing section--a fairly easy WR credit with worthwhile assignments.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone interested in taking a history course. The workload is very manageable and is really only readings and prep for exams.",
    "Good info to know!!",
    "If you are looking for a general overview of the history and the peoples of the Middle East, then this will be a good class. However, if you are looking to learn about specific topics such as Middle Eastern politics, Sunni\/Shiite split, ISIS, terrorism, etc. then this isn't the class you are looking for. Readings are long and a bit intense but they won't be addressed or discussed in lectures, so you won't get a whole lot out of the readings unless you do the writing section. Lectures are long, not engaging and quite tedious.",
    "I would recommend this class to a student who doesn't already have a lot of knowledge about the Middle East."
