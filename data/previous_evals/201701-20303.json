    "This class has changed how I interact with most films and television, and my understanding of the relationship between trauma and culture in general. One of the best classes I've taken at Yale.",
    "I learnt a lot about trauma theory! Im really glad to have learnt about this, as I think knowing about it has given me a better perspective on peoples various backgrounds (regardless or not as to if they have undergone trauma). Also Im a STEM major, so this class was super different from most of the classes I normally take. So I really was able to develop my skimming through readings skill.",
    "I definitely have a new eye to representations of trauma in film and TV, as well as an understanding of what actually constitutes trauma.",
    "How to close read and really mine psychology\/other texts for information and then go beyond that to understand situations",
    "AMST 385 trained me to interpret visual texts such as film and television through a cultural lens.",
    "I learned not only about different perspectives on trauma and culture, but how to integrate the two. I also learned how to speak tactfully and comprehensibly about trauma as well as how to be sensitive to different perceptions of and opinions about traumatic events. I also learned the importance of representation, as well as the difficulties of representing cultural traumas.",
    "Throughout this course, I learned how to think more critically about texts and foster that analysis into a meaningful discussion. Additionally, I learned more than I ever have about the human mind, body, and brain, and just how delicate it all is.",
    "I learned about trauma, culture, and various traumatic incidents throughout the twentieth century. I further developed my research skills with the final paper."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The structure was so clear. The readings tied directly to class, and built off each other. The essays built on the readings. A clear, precise direction.",
    "Good class with interesting material. Interesting lens to look at trauma through, but the prof handles the whole class really well.",
    "I thought the material selected was very strong and worked well with the themes of the class. I do wish we had done more film analysis or perhaps used the film to discuss the readings instead of discussing each reading and then the film. At times, I felt the class discussions were a bit surface level and could have gone further.",
    "I often feel like the films or tv shows were talked about in a very general way and not linked back to the theorists we were reading as much as I would have liked. It would have been nice to do more of this sooner since I also think it would have made analyzing our text for the final essay a little less novel and difficult.",
    "To improve, maybe add cultural traumas to people of color. We only really hit specific wars at the end. But there could be a lot done on police violence and trauma from racism.",
    "The readings were really great, and they made for excellent discussions during seminar. I think the readings and the movies\/TV shows were the greatest strengths of this class.",
    "The course is well structured and well paced. The film representations are well selected and discussions are structured well around them. Assignments are reasonable and plenty of feedback is given.",
    "I absolutely loved the discussions and assigned materials for this course. There could possibly be more books about trauma in a cultural context rather than simply defining trauma and its symptoms.",
    "Strengths- Dean Muller- She's amazing! Readings were informative and interesting. Weaknesses- Some people participated in class way more than others"

    "I would highly recommend this course, just makes you a more intelligent cultural participant.",
    "Sure! Especially if you want to watch TV for homework :). But actually, it was an interesting course and I learnt a lot!",
    "This class is incredible! Took as a fifth class, and the workload is very manageable and you learn a lot about culture and how to evaluate representations of trauma.",
    "Take this course!",
    "I would recommend taking AMST 385. Professor Muller is great, the readings are very interesting, and it teaches you to view film and television through a critical and cultural lens.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student.",
    "Absolutely! The discussions and texts were engaging, and Professor Muller is awesome. Take this seminar!",
    "The workload was manageable, and the class was incredibly enjoyable! If you can ge tinto this class, then absolutely take it!!"
