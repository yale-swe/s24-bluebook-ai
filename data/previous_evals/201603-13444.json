    "I developed the skills to do more historical research and go deeper that I ever had into a subject that shaped the world we live in today.",
    "Origins of WWII",
    "I learned a lot more about world history, and I feel like I developed a deeper appreciation and understanding of the events that led up to World War II. While a lot of people can point to WWI starting because of the Archduke of Ferdinand, there are seemingly endless possibilities for what events started WWII. Everything is connected, and thee were so many countries involved spanning several decades. So, I think this information was very useful, and I enjoyed learning about it. It was also useful to write a long term paper for the class, because I feel like it prepared me to write my senior thesis.",
    "I learned a great deal about reading British historical archives and about the role of military mobilization in grand strategy.",
    "I learned a holistic, multidisciplinary approach to studying WWII. We were able to focus on the historiography of the war as well as the events that led up to it, specifically appeasement.",
    "I learned a great deal about Grand Strategy and how to look at it in the context of a specific case study (in this case WWII). Additionally, the class exercises on document reading helped me better engage in primary source analysis, and the class presentation and research paper likewise strengthened my research skills and ability to form a cohesive argument for a long paper."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The strenghts are Prof. Kenendy himself and the incredible ammount of information he posseses. On the other hand, it is not a typical seminar in which students participate a lot or engage in a discussion. It is mostly to hear Prof. Kennedy, which is an incredible experience as well.",
    "One thing I really liked about this course is the scope of topics that we discussed. I felt like I came out of the class having a good overview of the entire prelude to world war II. I enjoyed doing the readings but I thought that the class would have benefitted more from more student discussions. The documents week was interesting and helped me to see what kind of sources we could look at for the final paper. I enjoyed doing the final paper and thought that the research process really helped me to consolidate many of the themes we talked about in class.",
    "The course's obvious strength is Professor Kennedy - he is a brilliant man and a wonderful teacher. The class learns so much from him, not just because he knows so much about the subject but because he is so thoughtful and passionate in his presentation of the information. The course's only real weakness is it's lack of true discussion. Occasionally, the class would discuss the subject of the week's readings, but class meetings were usually a combination of Professor Kennedy's lecturing and the student presentations.",
    "I think that the information we learned was incredibly interesting. We also did a couple presentations that were useful to get a deeper understanding of a topic and help us prepare for our final papers. I think that the course could be improved, however, by talking about the readings more and getting the class more engaged. It was often just Professor Kennedy speaking for the entire 2 hours instead of the class engaging.",
    "Professor Kennedy was very interesting to listen to as well as kind and understanding. I really enjoyed the two weeks spent looking at primary resources regarding the Munich Crisis.",
    "The readings were great, but we didn't always touch on them in class.",
    "Overall, the course was very enjoyable. We learned a great deal and Prof. Kennedy is so knowledgeable about the subject. He would often give us great insight into what we discussed, as well as personal anecdotes.",
    "I think greater feedback could be given throughout the course",
    "Professor Kennedy did a wonderful job of integrating his vast knowledge into that course, and often encouraged students in the class to engage in their interests.",
    "I think more feedback on the presentations and perhaps another smaller paper at the midterm would have been beneficial. Oftentimes, it was hard to determine in which areas I could have improved, especially while writing and preparing for the final paper. There Outside of that, I learned a great deal in this class, and think the class presentations and document analysis were definitely highlights of the semester. With these two assignments, I began to think more about the quality of the sources I was using and how to find them."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, if you would like to understand how is it that the Second World War came to be... Also, the opportunity of taking a seminar with Professor Kennedy is amazing.",
    "If you magically have the chance to take this seminar, you should absolutely take it. Having the chance to learn from Professor Kennedy in a seminar setting is unparalleled. He is an amazing, brilliant, adorable, and compassionate man on top of being a wonderful teacher. Class meetings can sometimes get a little boring since they're mostly dominated by Professor Kennedy speaking or the student presentations, but you will learn a lot regardless. There's also not much work required, aside from a long term paper, which is nice. Overall, I definitely recommend you take it if you're remotely interested in the subject matter.",
    "If someone doesn't like speaking in section\/seminar and wants an interesting class with an incredibly knowledgeable professor, then yes, I would recommend it. However, if someone wants a class that they will learn a lot in and be really engaged in, then I wouldn't recommend it.",
    "You learn about each of the European militaries before WWII - and their respective leaders - and there is a final 20-25 page paper. Class presentations twice per semester. Much of the learning is independent, and most of the reading is not touched on in class, so keep that in mind when shopping or preregistering.",
    "Definitely.",
    "I would highly recommend this course. It is very interesting, and being able to hear Prof. Kennedys musings is amazing.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. Professor Kennedy is a fantastic professor, and every class featured a unique event or facet of the inter-war period. Though classes were arranged by topic, Professor Kennedy was always able to tie the different subjects together to paint a cohesive picture. The flexibility in choosing final papers and even presentation topics allowed for some student specialization in a course of great breadth."
