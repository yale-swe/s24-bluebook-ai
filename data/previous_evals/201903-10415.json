    "I practiced and developed my observation skills, especially for drawing still life. I also became adept at planning and executing larger, more time-consuming projects, and putting several layers of work on one piece.",
    "I learned to push myself more as an artist.",
    "I learned how to draw with basic techniques. I learned that art can be done by people who have not done it before.",
    "A greater ability to see visually. I honed drawing skills already in my repertoire and was introduced to some new techniques. The most fruitful part of the course, in my opinion, was learning how to plan for a bigger piece",
    "I learned about introductory drawing techniques.",
    "I learned concepts like form, value, and line weights and was able to try many different mediums, such as charcoal, soft pastels, and ink.",
    "I had never taken an art class before this, so I learned a lot about scale, value, and contrast.",
    "Basic drawing techniques",
    "I became more familiar with a wider range of materials, in addition to gaining more practice in drawing technique.",
    "How to observe and draw."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "As an intended art major with prior experience in art school settings, the Intro Drawing course was not engaging for my artistic development. The majority of my classmates were non- art majors with little experience drawing. The professor ended up focusing on these students and letting those with more experience move on their own. Exercises then neither stimulated\/challenged my technical skill nor gave me enough creative freedom to push conceptual developments. Need to take the course as a pre-requisite for the major nonetheless.",
    "The strengths are the observational drawings and critiques we do. The weaknesses are how short the studio hours are, along with slight lack of structure in the course. It felt like I improved simply because I was drawing at least four hours a week with other students, not because I was being instructed or learning new things.",
    "I think I should have had more patience with my artwork but I did always finish my work.",
    "This is a great course, but not really \"basic\" drawing. The only drawback is that I believe that many people in this course already had a lot of art experience. This made me feel uncomfortable at times, but I just had to get used to that feeling. It was very low stress and really helped you get what you wanted out of it.",
    "Strengths include introducing students to different types of drawing media and techniques, as well as a couple of artists. The biggest strength was teaching a more loose way of drawing while not distracting from technical importance. A major weakness is the weakness of the art major in general. There is no way to test out of beginner's courses, and the most basic of courses are required for the major. I feel like I did not learn as much as I could have from a Yale level class simply because I was forced to take such a low-level class for prerequisites.",
    "This is a great eye-opening course for non art-majors. However, it is slightly confusingly organized since about half of the class is art majors and half is non-art majors. Thus, it does not offer a lot to students who already have experience with drawing and it does not teach a lot of the formal techniques to new students. Also, the final project takes an overwhelming amount of time.",
    "A lot of time was spent in class drawing and getting feedback, which was very helpful and made the class very engaging. I wish that there was more instruction on how to approach portrait and drawing, as well as an explanation on the different materials we were using, whether it's the kinds of paper or the drawing utensils. Instead, we were mostly left to experiment on our own and figure it out by ourselves.",
    "For me, the class was a really supportive, low-stakes way to learn how to draw. Being a prereq for art majors, it was really intimidating at first being around a lot of talented, well-trained artists, but everyone was really kind about your work. I got to learn a lot about how to make a successful picture, and I felt that I was taken seriously even though I wasn't as advanced as everyone else.",
    "The course did not have a lot of opportunity for creative choice",
    "I would've preferred a wider range of subject matters and drawing prompts."

   "comments": [
    "Yes. Drawing is an important foundational skill for any kind of art.",
    "Yea I think its a good class for non art major seniors.",
    "Yes! I have not had any drawing experience, but it was really cool to see what I could do!",
    "If you are an art major, you have to take this class. This class is most suited for a student who has never taken an art class in their life. To those students, I recommend this class. To prospective art majors, it doesn't matter if I recommend this class or not.",
    "Yes! This is a great introductory course, especially for students with an interest in drawing but haven't formally explored the subject before.",
    "I would recommend this class to any student who is willing to put in the time and effort to draw, as while a lot of work is done in class, a lot of work also has to be done outside of class, whether its keeping up a sketchbook or finishing a larger piece for a critique. I definitely improved as an artist, but the workload was not small.",
    "Yes, this course provided a strong drawing foundation for taking future art classes. The class is what you make of it, and it was really easy to become engaged with the assignments.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to any student interested in drawing, particularly with Professor Curiel. You really do improve loads in confidence if you don't have a lot of experience drawing (like me) and you get to see your classmates make loads of cool art."
