   "comments": [
    "The workload for this class isn't horrible, it's just a 30-50 page (sometimes more, sometimes less) paper for each class, which is manageable for the most part. Reading, two papers, and a final. The class itself is purely discussion based. Interesting material, although I wish the format of the class was more lively.",
    "PHIL082 was an interestingly built class. I don't know if I'd recommend it to another student simply because discussions seemed poorly built at times (and very enlightening at others). The extent of information that we needed to know for the final exam is more vast than one could possibly imagine during the actual course. Though at the same time, some of the information is actually quite interesting. For example, the readings on innateness of morality and meta-ethics are incredible.",
    "Take it! This was my absolute favorite class. I encountered so many topics that kept me thinking for hours or days after class, and i always brought it up with my suitemates to ask them what they thought. This class is fascinating. There is a lot of reading, but it is so interesting that it doesn't even matter.",
    "Take it if you get the opportunity to! Introduced me to philosophy for the first time.",
    "The best class I have ever taken! I've often heard people say, \"that class changed my life,\" and I didn't really believe them. Well, this class has absolutely done just that: I go about my life differently (and more morally, I think) because of what I learned in this course. This course completely changed my views on morality, individuals, and humanity in general. The ideas presented were simply mind-blowing. Professor Knobe is brilliant, and the best instructor I've ever had. The work was absolutely manageable, and thoroughly enjoyable. This course was as close to perfect as one can get.",
    "This is an amazing course! It's not that hard, you will learn a lot, and professor Knobe will guide you smoothly through your first philosophy course. If you are thinking of taking a first philosophy course, take this one!",
    "This class was one of my favorite of the semester. Engaging and insightful- I would definitely recommend this class to a fellow student.",
    "I would definitely recommend you take this class, although I did expect it to have a more cognitive science emphasis as in more studies focused on technological aspects. If you haven't taken a philosophical class before, I would also suggest going to the professor's office hours since that might have helped to consolidate the material a bit more.",
    "It is an exciting course on moral questions and topics that are seemingly unanswerable and therefore extremely intriguing. I recommend it to someone who likes to talk and argue difficult questions.",
    "I recommend this course if you're interested in morality and philosophy and just questioning life in general. Some of the readings are a little repetitive, but it definitely changed the way I thought about things and really opened my mind to different types of views.",
    "I would recommend the course if you don't mind doing reading. The material is extremely interesting and thought-provoking, but you can glide by without doing much, and then you'll get nothing out of the class and not get a good grade."
