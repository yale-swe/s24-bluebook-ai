    "Take it if you are looking for an easy survey course or need a Hu credit. If you are a religious studies or MME major with no previous classes on Islam, this is a good starter. Otherwise, the material will likely be review for you.",
    "Do it! It's good!",
    "It is a good introductory course. I particularly enjoyed the introduction of Islamic Theology and the different Islamic organizations e.g. Nation of Islam. The lectures can sometimes be boring but Professor Bowering is adorable. The work load is very manageable and it is not difficult to get an A in this class.",
    "If you are looking for a class that isn't too demanding and interesting from time to time, take it. It's the perfect 5th credit class",
    "It's a great class. Not a ton of pointless work, it's really just some basic readings and Professor Bowering's extremely detailed and perceptive lectures. He is among the most intelligent and professional professors I encountered in my four years. You can tell that you are getting an expert account of the issues from someone who has read every relevant text from the Qu'ran itself to the most recent papers written, and that his view is well-reasoned and representative neither of a view that seeks to demean Islamism as backwards, nor one that blindly defends the religion either historically or as it contributes to many current global issues. If you want to know what Islam is, what it isn't, and how it comes to be the latter in the eyes of some, Bowering is your man and this is your class.",
    "I would summarize it by saying it takes Islam from its earliest days up to the present. It looks at its founder Muhammad, at its theology, its leadership and forecasts the future.",
    "I would, I now have amuck better understanding of Islam.",
    "Yes. Good\/relatively light workload survey course."
