    "As much as acquiring academic knowledge in crucial, what separates high professional achievers from non or average achievers is their leadership ability and skills. The congenial teaching environment and discussion sessions that are woven into the classes makes it very ideal for opening up and sharing values, ethics and long-held belief-systems. This is the kind of course that trains one for life because it transcends academics. The relevance of this course cannot be overemphasized.",

    "The congenial class environment that encourages sharing of ideas, knowledge, beliefs, ethics, etc.",
    "The fact that we got to practice the theory we discussed in class by forming an organizational hierarchy within the class and planning all the details of our Washington trip ourselves, and meeting with leaders from different environmental fields. I learned a lot more about group dynamics, organization and management than I would have if this was just another seminar.",
    "The field trip to Washington, DC where we met with leaders and had the chance to learn from them the secrets of leadership.",
    "The best thing about this course was definitely having the opportunity to go to Washington DC and use everything that we had learned in theory into practice. Meeting all of those incredible leaders was what truly made this seminar incredible.",
    "Chad !!!",
    "The field trip is marvelous. I learned so much from it!",
    "the DC trip was very rewarding. The instructor is very well connected to the various leaders in DC, as well as many of our fellow classmates in class, thus we were able to meet many NGO, governmental leaders in DC. I greatly benefited from meetings with these leaders through asking them questions and discussions in round table meetings. Monday night Monacle dinner was once in a life time experience- watching environmental leaders gave speech on state of the art issues was breath taking. thank you chad!",
    "Learned lots of thing more than I expected",
    "Chad was very open to listening to the students and hearing what they had to say. It was a mutual learning environment"

    "It provided an opportunity to learn from other students from different parts of the world with different temperaments, attitudes and values. It was a great opportunity for knowledge sharing and learning how to work effectively in teams. The downside is that sometimes it takes a long time to reach a consensus and some individual attitudes can sometimes disrupt team cohesion and effectiveness. It was great figuring out how to accommodate diversity and harnessing the individual strengths and opportunities available to create a winning team.",
    "The group work gave us practical insight into how organizational hierarchieswork and we learned more about working together and each other than we would have otherwise. It was a great experience.",
