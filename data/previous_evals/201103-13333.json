   "comments": [
    "English 114 is a fantastic course that really honed my ability to read and write works of analytical nonfiction. The topic of my section, piracy and intellectual property rights, provided an interesting background within which to apply the various analytical writing techniques taught and exercised throughout the course. Professor Menges is a passionate and helpful teacher and made class very enjoyable to attend. I would strongly recommend this class to anyone who wishes to strengthen their analytical reading and writing skills.",
    "This course is geared toward students looking to build a strong foundation in analytical essay writing. If you are insecure about your writing abilities, this course really breaks everything down and shows you how to craft essays in very manageable processes that leave you with an impressive final product. I have never been particularly interested in the issues of intellectual property and copyright, but this class sheds light on a wide range of issues that all prove to be very intriguing and relevant in today's digital world. I would definitely recommend this course to another student. Professor Menges is wonderful and the curriculum really improves one's writing abilities.",
    "I would recommend this class especially to freshmen",
    "Yes, English 114 is a must take for any freshman. It really helps one adjust to the college writing format.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to other students. I used to be afraid of writing and taking this course was a fun way to brush up my writing skills while learning about very interesting and relevent topics.",
    "I would recommend this course to some who is interested in the topic. If one is looking for a class to get better at essay writing and is not attracted to the topic, it is worth looking elsewhere. But I find that the faults in the class can be overlooked for the material one gets to write about."
