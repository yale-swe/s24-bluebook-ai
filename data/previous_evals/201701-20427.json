   "comments": [
    "Pauline LeVen is a remarkable teacher, and our syllabus was ambitious. Most students were engaged every day. As we began to read one text consistently, discussion slowed and lass became significantly less interesting.",
    "The class's weakness was that there was not always a clear sense of the link between our translation work and the broader picture. It would also have been nice to read more literary theory alongside each author: that is, theory of lyric alongside Sappho, etc., to have a firm grip on each genre as we went. The great strength of the class was its students, and of course the instructor, as well as the undeniable interest of the material."
