    "I would recommend Anthropology 542 as a good foundational course for anyone who wanted to gain a better understanding of both anthropology and the modern-day connections between societies across Asia, with a focus on economics.",
    "yes. it's quite interesting! I learned a lot from it!",
    "The course uses interdisciplinary materials to rethink an interconnected Asia, rather than state-centered conceptualizations. Because it provides a very important analytical and conceptual paradigm that includes dynamics of culture, positions of history, power within interactions, and space of localities, I would definitely recommend this course.",
    "Definitely. The course was very useful."

   "comments": [
    "This course gave me a much stronger background in the social theories and anthropological methods that play an important part in works in my discipline. It gave me a firmer perspective on the foundations and current state of networks of economic, political, and cultural networks that connect Asia, and in this respect I believe it will contribute greatly to my future research.",
    "This course led me rethink cultures and markets as processes at the interface of history, power and place, instead of taking the static categories of people and place for granted. Such knowledge definitely provides a firm foundation for my future research, both theoretically and analytically."
