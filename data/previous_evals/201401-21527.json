   "comments": [
    "Hm, so the films are amazing so it's hard not to enjoy the class. Prof Andrew is very disorganized and hard to follow at times, but his readings of the individual films and other clips he showed were excellent and interesting. Also the work load is reaaaal minimal.",
    "I took this class because I needed a writing credit and I enjoy writing about film, but I would warn a future student that, because it is world cinema, there is a large historical\/cultural component to what you study about the films, it is not just considering them individually as works of art but talking about the context from which they came, so if you're into that definitely take it.",
    "FILM 240 is a run through of various films from around the world. The professor shows and talks about a different region of the world and gives a brief history on their film. The films he picks are good representations of each region. I would recommend this course to a friend that is looking for a great film class, but doesn't want too analytical of a film course. Also, to friends who are interested in seeing films from all over the world.",
    "No, unless you're actually really into world cinema and reading a lot of articles about the theory\/history that goes into it.",
    "It's a good class. The written assignments are fun and reasonable and the films are interesting and for the most part entertaining even for the non film majors. I didn't really understand why we had the final when another 4-8 page paper would have made more sense with the overall structure of the class. It was also stressful that the professor didn't seem to know how the final was going to be structured until a week before. It wound up being three essay questions from 11 that we were given at the start of reading week. Lectures were a disjointed and somewhat confusing. Lots of name dropping that goes over the heads of non film majors. They usually were somewhat interesting though. The reading wasn't really important except for one paper and some of the questions on the final, so only do what you need.",
    "Good survey, you leave the class with a broad understanding of different films outside of Hollywood. My problem is that although Professor Andrew is passionate and clearly informed, his lectures are poorly organized. So you really have to be interested, and seek out knowledge and do the readings and the screenings. You can't just show up to lecture passively and expect to have knowledge and insight instantly plopped into your brain",
    "I would not recommend this class to another student unless you need a low-key writing credit (which was why I took this). I found the course underwhelming. The lectures were not illuminating - they relied too much on anecdotes, and were too light on analysis to be intellectually stimulating. Many of the readings were not very interesting. (I would have liked to read more primary sources rather than so many secondary texts.) I don't feel I have a good grounds on which to criticize the choice of films, since I am not 'well-watched' and this was my first film class. While I did enjoy the films and thought the breadth of the selections was excellent, you're better off watching them on netflix or in the film studies center on your own time, and keeping your Monday nights free.",
    "It is an excellent film class to take for someone from any level. It was my first film class and I thoroughly enjoyed it. If you are interested in films or different cultures around the world, I definitely recommend this class!",
    "i would definitely recommend this class. The workload is light, but the number of hours spent can be a lot given the movie screenings. But the readings were not totally necessary in order to follow the class. I was able to scrape together the basic gist of all the readings and focus more on learning how to analyze film",
    "A good class overall, especially if you're interesting in getting a broader view of the types of cinema that comes out of other countries around the world."
