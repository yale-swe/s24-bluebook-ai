    "This class is about the development of music from the advent of recording technology to the present. It's also about whatever you want it to be about during that time period, because you do two presentations and have a lot of freedom to choose who you research and talk about. It's a really cool class in terms of subject matter, and there's not a lot of work you have to do - this does mean that a lot of people don't do the reading, so class discussion isn't as scintillating as it could be.",
    "It is a lot of fun researching and writing on the vernacular musics you love, but less fun reading long books on types of music you aren't particularly interested in. The individual work was enjoyable, but the seminar discussions tended to be slow. Professor Denning's comments were always great, but he tended to take a backseat and let us spin our wheels.",
    "Yes! The books are great. If you're taking this class as part of an American Studies curriculum the books are especially great because you're able to learn about other vernacular musics across the world. It's a great way to understand American popular music, which can be surprisingly different (or, surprisingly similar). You're also given freedom to study topics on your own that you've been curious about."
