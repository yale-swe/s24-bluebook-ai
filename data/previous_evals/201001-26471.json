   "comments": [
    "Yes, it was a good overview of Middle East history and current events. I took it Credit\/D\/Fail so I did not always keep up with readings. Even so, the lectures, videos, and discussion were still informative. Ellen Lust is very passionate, knowledgeable, and approachable.",
    "Yes, a great introduction to very relevant topics",
    "Interesting class. Good WR credit option.",
    "A great overview of history and politics in the Middle East, as well as some of the theory behind the way the nations act as they do.If you want to have a good, general understanding of the Middle East, take this class. Professor Lust gives good lectures, and it's usually very interesting material. Even if you haven't done IR or poli-sci before, the class is very accessible and understandable.",
    "It's a very, very basic intro with good readings that you won't be forced to read, so you don't learn all that much.",
    "Take this course if you want a basic understanding of the Middle East. However, if the class is still held 9am and you are not a morning person, then beware that the lectures are not a very big motivation to attend class. Sections are interesting if you have a good section leaders and some interesting people in class.",
    "Great course if you'd like to learn more about politics in the Middle East, especially if you have no previous knowledge - you will learn alot!",
    "So much reading. Recommend taking another intro Middle East class if you can, because this one was full of people who were so intense on the Middle East and wasn't so much \"intro\" anymore. Should be one of the easier writing credits though. Taking it non-writing credit was a rip-off.",
    "It is a broad course with some disorganization in presenting a cohesive view of the Middle East but it's attempt at covering so much is admirable and it does provide great detail of the 20th century political atmosphere that has so significantly influenced the way the Middle East is known to us today.",
    "It was a very interesting class, but if you've never taken a political science or MMES class before (as had been the case with me), beware. It's extremely difficult to keep up with the immense amount of reading if you're not used to that kind of thing, and as a bio major with only an interest in the subject but no prior experience or background it's also hard to keep up in section with all the IS\/MMES\/poly sci majors. If you just want to learn about the middle east, I suggest taking a different class. However, if you have the proper preparation it would be a great class. The paper (if you're in the WR section) is fun to write, and the discussions are lively. The material is also relevant to the world.",
    "Pretty dry lecture course on Middle East history& politics. Don't take it for Lust and certainly don't take it for section, but take it if you're really interested in the topic, because the actual material is fascinating.",
    "I would with enthusiasm. Take this class if you're interested in the Middle East.",
    "This was a great course! Very interesting and not too much work! Ellen Lust is super nice, maybe not the most dynamic lecturer but her classes are by no means boring. I definitely recommend this course!!",
    "TAKE THE WRITING SECTION!!!!!!! No seriously! Professor Lust is very smart and knows what she's talking about. the class covers a lot of material and it's all soooooo fascinating. however, sometimes it's not that necessary to attend class. the midterms are a little tough so keep up on your reading. otherwise, it's smooth sailing...but really, it IS interesting. just look at the packed syllabus. It's not a lot of reading but a lot of information that is completely relevant to the problems facing the MENA region today!",
    "TAKE IT. A wonderful, brief summary of Middle Eastern recent history and a good basic understanding of international relations as relating to the MENA. I'd recommend having at least one other Poli Sci course under your belt, though. Also, Prof. Lust is a baller.",
    "Take it if You want to spend hours reading articles that you won't necessarily discuss.",
    "Only take this class if you are really interested in the Middle East and are able to learn all the material for a class on you own.",
    "Definitely take this class if you're looking for a well taught course that doesn't entail too much work. Also if you do, take part in the soliya program cause it allows you to have discussions with some really interesting people, and exempts you from a final at the same time!",
    "I'd say that this class is great if you want a cursory knowledge of the history and current affairs of the Middle East. The second half of the class gets a little disorganized. We simultaneously look at case studies of specific countries in the readings while approaching the Middle East by topic (like regime-type, elections, economy etc) which gets a bit confusing. Also, the readings can be excessive at times. Overall though it's a good class to develop general knowledge about the region.",
    "Yes, I would absolutely recommend this class. It's a good intro course but isn't boring for those who have taken another MMES intro course besides this.",
    "A cursory overview of the problems in modern middle east politics.",
    "This course gives you a great introduction to the region. There are quite a lot of readings, but it's okay if you don't do all of them. The professor is very engaging, but the course experience also depends on the TA. (Calli happened to be awesome)",
    "I would certainly recommend this course. I think it's very confused as to whether it's a lecture or a seminar, but it's a pretty good. Professor Lust is fantastic. She's very warm and personable, in addition to being extremely knowledgeable about the topic. She's more than willing to answer every single question posed to her.The class is a great overview of the Middle East, focusing both on regional politics, as well as on each individual country in the region. If you don't know much about the Middle East, the this is certainly the class for you. Even if you do know quite a bit, it's still a great overview.There's not a whole lot of reading, but the readings that are assigned are chosen very carefully and are truly worth reading, which is more than you can say for most classes. Also, there's two midterms, both of which are fair and too bad, and then a take home final, which was not nearly as much work as a real final would have been.Definitely a great and worthwhile class.",
    "I would strongly recommend this class, i just wish the class had focussed more on present day politics rather than how the middle east to got to where it is. The workload is not too bad, especially if you take it as a writing credit, and the final project is really interesting.",
    "Great class. Take it even if you don't need another WR; if you do, it's a great way to get a WR.",
    "Ellen Lust is a good lecturer and very knowledgeable on the subject matter, however the structure and organization of the class was frustrating. There were too many guest lecturers and they were mediocre if not absolutely terrible\/confusing\/a total waste of time.The readings posted online were SO disorganized it was really hard to keep up with changes in the syllabus and readings that were sometimes misplaced or had unclear titles: it took me so long just to figure out what i had to read and then try to find it on classesv2. Between the guest lecturers and disorganization, in addition to the Israel-Palestine stimulation and various films, none of which were helpful, I left the class wondering what I had learned. It would have been infinitely better if Ellen Lust just taught the class and did all of the lectures instead of various substitutions.",
    "A fairly basic, though wide-ranging, introduction to Middle Eastern politics. Probably best-suited to people who want to be able to discuss the region intelligently in general conversation. The Soliya program seemed rather intriguing, although I personally did not have enough time to participate.",
    "Professor Lust is kind of mediocre. She's a very nice person that can't seem to grab your attention with the material. If you're willing to put in the work to do the reading and pay attention, it might be worth it. As someone who did neither, it wasn't.",
    "A very high quality overview of Middle-Eastern politics and their historical roots. I highly recommend it as a must-take course to anyone who is even remotely interested in the region.",
    "yeah, if you don't know much about the middle east and want an overview, this class is good."
