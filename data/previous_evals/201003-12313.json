   "comments": [
    "I would certainly recommend Professor Garcia-Donoso but I don't believe he is teaching any more semesters. The class as a whole seemed to be very good if Spanish is something you need to take. I believe it to be easier to pick up than many other languages.",
    "Really a terrific elementary language course. Reasonable workload, applicable information, and amazing organized. Runs like a nice, friendly, perfect robot. Love it.Highly recommended for anyone interested in Spanish.",
    "This is class is very good if you have taken some level of spanish in high school. I would recommend this class to someone if they want to build on the little spanish they remember from high school. I would not recommend this class to someone who has never spoken spanish before because the instructor speaks spanish the entire class and you are expected to respond to all questions in spanish.",
    "Spanish 110 is a fast paced introduction to spanish but you learn so much. By the end of the semester, you are shocked by the amount of spanish you already learned. Recommended.",
    "I would recommend it if you want to learn Spanish.",
    "If you have no Spanish background, this class is a decent challenge and you'll have to work much harder than your peers.",
    "Having spanish class everyday may seem a bit daunting, but L1 was one of my favorite classes throughout the semester. I learned so much spanish in just a single semester, and it was great to have both a better understanding of spanish, and to gain writing and speaking ability.",
    "Spanish 110 09 provides an introduction to the Spanish language by teaching the basics. The course also teaches you about the culture and history in Spanish speaking countries throughout the world. I would highly recommend this course to another student because this course teaches you the basic tenses (present and past), adjectives, numbers, colors, vocabulary, etc. that will help provide a solid base to furthering your knowledge in the Spanish language and culture.",
    "Everyday, a lot of homework, fast pace.",
    "Yes! its a great class"
