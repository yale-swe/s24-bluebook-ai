    "YES! If you are at all interested in cultural studies take this class. It does not really even require you to be interested in this half a century long time in American history, it is such a brilliant way of studying history that I think it would be an intellectually intriguing experience for anyone interested in multidisciplinary ways of studying humans, culture and how culture is born, shaped, reshaped, intentionally or unintentionally.",
    "history of american culture from civil war to WW1. Focus on art and music and cultural objects -- light focus on political and social history.",
    "Absolutely every Yale student should take ForMAC. It was an incredible, mind-blowing course and Agnew is brilliant. It's changed the way I see America and it's so relevant to everything that's going on today. I wasn't planning on taking this class but I shopped the first lecture and could not be happier that I chose to take ForMAC. Each lecture is a masterpiece and I would look forward to class each day. It's not insane amount of work, and some of the primary documents can be challenging, but I've never learned so much in 24 lectures. This course is absolutely AMAZING!!",
    "American culture is crazy in ways you don't know until you take this course. Agnew is such an unbelievable lecturer\u00e2\u0080\u0094in one session, he drew connections between Hannah Arendt, American football, and Andrew Carnegie. His lectures make you actively not want to go on email\/your cell phone\/Facebook because what he has to say is interesting enough to make you forget how short your attention span is. (Also, try to get Rebecca Jacobs as your TF.) Honestly, this class changes the way you think about modern and contemporary culture. Take it take it no matter your major. Assignments aren't too hard and the take-home final option is nice.",
    "I am not a history major, nor am I an American Studies major. I ended up in this course somewhat randomly, a last minute shopping-period decision based on the recommendation of a friend. That being said, I absolutely LOVED it. This course got me really interested in a period of American history that I had honestly never thought about before, and beyond that, it opened my eyes to new and incredibly exciting ways to study history. It's a cultural history course, which means that it traces the various strains of American culture that were growing and shifting during this time period. Our weekly reading reflected that; we were generally assigned an assortment of articles, poems, and literary pieces, all primary sources written during the era. Lectures would bring all of these works together, and add in film clips, paintings, advertisements, photographs, and songs. Please note: these lectures were among the most brilliant I've had the pleasure of sitting through in my entire Yale career. Professor Agnew is an absolute genius. I do not say that lightly.Work for this course was essentially weekly reading + short reading responses (fairly hefty amount of reading but definitely not necessary to do all of it), two 5 page papers, a midterm exam, and a final. The midterm was tough and required a very detailed level of knowledge for the identification section, which is difficult in a course that introduces 30 new potential identifications in each lecture, but the professor\/TFs did a great job emphasizing the most important things to study. The final is a choice between something similar to the midterm and the take-home final; at that point in the course we'd learned so much that I couldn't imagine having to have it all memorized so the take home seemed to make the most sense.",
    "Survey classes are tricky things, but as far as they go this one is among the most powerful and well done. It spans a deceivingly small amount of time, but so much nuance is afforded to the time period as a result. What you'll begin to realize from this course is that 1) people and their biographies matter 2) the years matter 3) things aren't as simply as they seem on the surface. Agnew is like a detective, uncovering treasures from the annals of American history. IF you take this class, be prepared to be blown away as you leave the lecture hall twice a week.",
    "Great class to start credit\/d and ultimately switch to a grade. Lectures can feel overwhelming but there is a takehome final so you will be fine. I repeat, TAKE-HOME FINAL SO YOU WILL BE FINE!!! I literally thought I was taking it credit\/d until I accidentally did well on the first paper and acceptably well on the midterm, and then I freaked that I wouldn't actually know anything for the final. Well I didn't have to know anything for the final because it was TAKE-HOME!!! Amazing.",
    "YES!",
    "Absolutely. This is one of Yale's many hidden gems. Professor Agnew is brilliant and engaging, I could go on for hours about his amazing lectures. Seriously, I recorded a lot of them and am planning on re-listening to them over winter break. There's not too much work, and most of the readings are actually pretty interesting. There's also a good variety in the types of readings\/assignments, so they never really get boring. All in all, this was a fantastic course that offers insight into the hidden backstories from a time period that can easily be forgotten when viewing American history using the standard political\/military structuring. By the end of the course, you really do begin to understand the concept and cultures of \"America\" in a more comprehensive way.",
    "This is the best class I have taken at Yale. I never thought I would say that about a lecture, but Professor Agnew is incredibly talented and so dedicated to teaching well that every lecture is fantastic, and quite a few are masterpieces. Many of us would leave class after he wrapped up with his analyses just shaking our heads at each other, thinking how we'd had our minds blown.The two short essays are fantastic exercises in learning how to do close analysis. You are required to focus on just a few texts, which I really appreciated since it forced me to think closely and deeply. If you take the assignments seriously, it's hard not to develop an original argument you are interested in and might even truly believe. The essays gain greater meaning and relevance as you are also asked to situate them in historical context, which led me to feel that I was uncovering new understanding about the time period.The only weakness in the lectures is the difficulty of following everything Agnew packs into his discussion in the first few lectures, but this became a strength as I learned how to listen. It takes a while to get a grasp on how to process and focus on what he is saying, but eventually it becomes incredibly rewarding to listen because of the complexity of his ideas and presentation - there's always more to find in his words. I frequently had the experience in going over my notes that I was learning new things or refining other ideas. It's hard to explain just how much dedication and time Agnew puts in to his lectures.The other weakness was section. Our discussions never seemed up to par with the level of analysis that Agnew presented and it felt that we spent way too much time covering basic comprehension of the texts or lectures rather than developing the ideas further or challenging them. It was pretty unsatisfying but I suppose this depends mostly on the TA and the kids you have in your section.A final strength of the class was the students it seemed to attract. The material seems pretty esoteric at first - America from 1876 to 1919 - and it seems to filter out everyone but the people most interested and prepared to do the work and do it well. It was a rare lecture in which I felt that we were a community learning together.",
    "As a junior American Studies major mostly done with the requirements of the major, I think that this is the best american studies course at Yale, and easily one of the best classes I've taken. ForMAC is an in-depth look at the 40 years between 1876-1919, years that Agnew masterfully argues are the foundation for all the things we consider, and maybe have never even formally considered to be fundamental aspects of modernity. This class will make you smarter, it will provide you with a better sense with what history is and how its formed, and will clue you into a sense of understanding of American intellectual, art, and social history that I have not experienced anywhere else. The class isn't hard to do well in, and you'll want to come to lecture. If you're at all interested, I'd say take it",
    "Take it! It is very interesting and well worth your time. Agnew is a fantastic lecturer.",
    "Great class on culture formation from (1865-1919). This is a must take for anyone interested in American History. Some of things learned in this class will even give you insights to some of things happening in America at the moment.This class is not a gut. The readings are challenging, and you are constantly forced to form your own interpretation of history. You'll get a lot out of this class if you put in the effort.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. A true gem at Yale. Quite possibly the very best lecture class that tends to go under-the-radar (possibly overshadowed by the Spring Formac). This class is utterly fascinating. Professor Agnew knows just about everything about American history, meaning that each lecture provides a fascinating and unexpected lens through which to examine American culture. You will learn about everything from the culture of labor to the rise of consumer culture to the importance of Birth of a Nation in America's cultural history. The ways in which you view American society--both its past and its present--will be totally changed. If you are at all interested in American history and culture, it should be required that you take this class.",
    "FORMAC is a completely unique approach to US history that will reshape your perspective on examining how a culture and society evolves. I would highly recommend it to anyone who wants to understand his or her reality better; it is a must-take for anyone who wants to get the most out of Yale.",
    "AMST 190 was a fantastic course, one of my favorites I've taken at Yale. I was initially hesitant to take the course because of the time period-- 1876-1919 -- which in previous classes I've found to be a bit dull. Prof. Agnew, however, completely changed my understanding of it. He is a fantastic lecturer, and his clear enthusiasm for the subject came through in each class. Essentially, the class focuses on understanding history through cultural documents. What made the class so rewarding and exciting was its highly analytical nature--Prof. Agnew structured the course around themes (ie we traced the understanding of labor, children, masculinity, femininity, the geographical regions of the country, \"foreigners\", race, children, industry), and each class would draw connections to past--and future--topics. He structured each lecture as a story, which made them fascinating and attention-keeping. I looked forward to lecture each time, and always left feeling that I had learned something more about how to analyze history through cultural documents.The readings were also great, and I really enjoyed them and felt they added to my understanding of the course. They included short stories, films, newspaper articles, diaries, comic strips, and other cultural documents. Readings were typically around 50 pages or less a week.Aside from the reading, we had 2 five-page papers, in which we analyzed one or two of the readings--these were very fun and rewarding to write. Additionally, we had a midterm and a final (with a take-home option for the final).Section was also great, and I felt I got as much out of section as I did out of lecture.I would absolutely recommend taking this course!"
