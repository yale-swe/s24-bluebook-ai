    "Differential equations and Linear algebra applied in biology. I recommend the course to a student already versed in differential equations and linear algebra. They are used frequently throughout the course.",
    "MCDB 361 is a decent follow up to MCDB 261. The material was interesting. I enjoyed modeling cell biology phenomena. The neuron-based section of the course was a bit harder to follow, though still very interesting. The math was not too overwhelming, at least for the first half of the class. In the second half, some of the analytical methods became hard to follow. More explanation would have been appreciated. The papers were good supplements to the lecture materials. Although strong prior Matlab experience is not required, it is recommended that you have a bit of experience before taking this class. I would definitely recommend taking 261 before 361. Professors Clark and Howard and the TAs were all very generous with their time and helpful in explaining concepts in more detail.",
    "Great course. Teaches you biology at very advanced level. Very current and cutting edge.",
    "It's not a ton of work but is very different from most other MCDB courses--I would recommend at least shopping it if one's interested in systems biology, and would also note that the previous class (261) isn't completely necessary to take this."
