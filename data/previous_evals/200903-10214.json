    "It might not be easy to recommend this course because it was so general and lacked a strong focus. I could recommend the course to someone who is interesting in gaining a basic theoretical understanding of memory and history.",
    "The material is emotionally difficult, but also interesting and rewarding. If you plan to write on a related topic, this course is a must. If not, the syllabus might seem a bit too scattered (for example, you may not be able to put the books on an orals list). Prof is quite flexible when it comes to writing assignments, so you can find a way to make them work for you.",
    "As a history student, I would recommend this course to those with particular interests in collective memory and race."

   "comments": [
    "Readings and class discussions raised important questions about style and narrative. I expect to come back to some of the theoretical readings again, and I might use some of the material from my final paper in my dissertation.",
    "Hard to say at this point as I am just a first year. Although I will say that this course (as well as the final paper exercise) allowed me to begin considering the possibility of and methods for writing histories of collective memory in the Cuban case - my country of focus historically.",
    "I took this course because my interest inhow artworks are used to memorialize or embody memories. Through the exposure to a broad range of theories of memory, literature, and visual art that respond to, reenact, or activate memory, this course has given me a solid ground upon which to construct my own ideas about the way memory is used by artists. It also provided a way for me to think about how I might instrumentalize my own imagination as a way to access artists that have been lost or erased from canonical memory. In this way, I think that it will be very important to my future research."
