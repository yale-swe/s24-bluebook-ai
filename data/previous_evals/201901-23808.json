    "I've taken an introductory class on China but have always wondered how domestic policies work on a more micro-level, especially on the economic side. Professior Liu's class offers just that, and I learned a lot about the role of local governments in China's miraculous growth, which is something that most literature on China today lack.",
    "I gained a more in-depth understanding of the issues at stake when considering China's rise, particularly the systematic and political issues surrounding reform and opening. The discussions were helpful in understanding the main areas of contentions in political science surrounding contemporary China.",
    "I learned how China experienced political and economic reform from the Mao era.",
    "We learned about the history of how Chinese politics and the economy have shaped each other. We learned about the intricacies of Chinese governmental set up, and how they have changed to encourage economic growth."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I think this was a great overview course of Chinese political economy, but I felt like at times the assigned readings for a specific topic were all kind of just saying the same thing over and over again as opposed to presenting different perspectives on an issue or at least looking at the issue through a different lens which I guess makes sense if there is some sort of consensus in the literature on a specific topic, but I think the class would benefit from having more diverse readings.",
    "It may be useful to have students write a shorter response every week, on 2 or 3 of the readings, rather than 4 spaced throughout the semester on all of the readings. 2-3 pages never seemed sufficient for me to craft a truly meaningful and critical response, and having to incorporate all of the readings sometimes made it so that I'd come away with a cursory understanding of each. I think having students write shorter responses on just a few of the readings, but every week, would help increase participation during discussions. Perhaps having a miniature lecture at the beginning of class, where key questions and themes are highlighted, might help provide important background and set the tone for the discussion.",
    "I think Professor Liu did a great job facilitating discussion and providing valuable insight into many of the topics we were discussing. I liked that he often asked follow-up questions to our points, which made us think harder about the connections we were trying to make. Professor Liu was also always very helpful in office hours.",
    "The strengths have to be the selection of readings and the questions that Professor Liu posed during discussions, since they pushed us to think more critically while also teaching us how to better evaluate research and methodology. The only weakness is that there was not enough background material\/lecturing which was not a problem since many of us had a basic understanding of Chinese contemporary history, but it may be difficult for someone who is unfamiliar with the topic.",
    "Overall I found this course was very interesting and highly engaging. The weekly readings were very applicable and allowed students to improve their skills in analysing political science texts. In class discussions, while text based, allowed for different opinions and theories to be considered."

   "comments": [
    "The professor is only teaching at Yale for one year, so this class will likely not be taught in the future. However, it was a solid class and the professor did an excellent job for his first time teaching a seminar.",
    "Yes, the readings were great and I learned a lot about a subject I was interested in",
    "Yes, definitely! It was a great class on China. Just a heads up it is more of an intermediate\/advanced class on China and prior knowledge on Chinese history and politics would really help in understanding some of the materials covered in class.",
    "Yes, I would highly recommend this class for anyone who is remotely interested in modern China.",
    "I would recommend this course to students, who have a slight background in Chinese politics and history, that have great interest in China's economy and politics."
