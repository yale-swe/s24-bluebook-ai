   "comments": [
    "I definitely recommend this course whether you are already a Scorsese fan or want an introduction to his work. Professor Kerbel is amazing, you get to watch and discuss some of the best and most influential films of the last 50 years, and the work load consists of mainly 3 essays.",
    "Yes, if you love the art of film it's a must",
    "I would definitely recommend it. It was really enjoyable. If you're interested in Scorsese, take it.",
    "Really wonderful class! Profesor Kerbel is a great lecturer, always eager and willing to meet with students. I at first worried that this class would be too specific, only focusing on one filmmaker, but in fact Profesor Kerbel widened the scope, making Scorsese's canon a way to look at the history of American cinema in the past fifty years.",
    "Great films, great professor--a chance to get to know an important filmmaker really well, and follow his work into the present.",
    "Fun class, less academic than some film studies classes, but Kerbel is really sweet and you'll have a lot of fun.",
    "I whole heartedly recommend this course to anyone interested in film. Scorsese's cannon is broad and often very engaging. He is a wonderful director to study because he serves as an excellent jumping off point for so many different kinds of film.",
    "TAKE THIS COURSE. Who doesn't like Scorsese films? And if you think it's all gangster movies and gore, think again. There's a stately period piece and even a mother-and-son roadtrip, as well as a Biopic. The readings are great and the screenings are AMAZING. Although there are three papers, they really aren't that bad. Overall, this is a wonderful course, and Professor Kerbel is excellent. If you get in and don't take it, there's something wrong with your head. Or as Travis Bickle says, \"I'm not square, you're the one that's square.\"",
    "Take it! It's so fun and the watch list is amazing!"
