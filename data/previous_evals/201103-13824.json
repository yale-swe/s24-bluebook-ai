   "comments": [
    "English 120 is probably the most enjoyable introductory writing seminar offered at Yale. It is not much work, but you need to actually read the reading that is assigned unless you plan to broadcast your unpreparedness to the class. Also, do not take this class if you plan on sleeping \u0097 it is a small seminar that requires engagement. That said, engaging with the course is neither difficult nor time-consuming. Readings are fun and a lot better than 114's readings. You are expected to write an essay one week and submit a revise of that essay the next week, for a total of six essays and six revisions. My approach to writing changed considerably for the better after taking this class.",
    "Yes i would recommend it! Annie Paul is a great professor and you learn so much about how to write different kinds of essays. I don't even like writing but i loved this class",
    "If you've only done literary analysis writing before, this is an excellent class to take. However, if you've already taken a class on nonfiction essay writing, you might not get as much out of this. Be prepared to do a lot of reading and to constantly be in a state of either writing or rewriting an essay! It's a fun class though. I really enjoyed it.",
    "It's a great course. Take it. The readings are, for the most part, interesting; the classes are fun and relaxed (although this also depends on your classmates and the quality of their work\/engagement); your writing WILL improve. The workload isn't as bad as people make it out to be -- one essay draft every other week with revised versions due every week in between. Also, only the grades for the revised essays count, which takes some of the pressure off. So take it.",
    "It depends on what teacher you get, but in general be prepared to read a lot of nonfiction and like writing. Also be good at discussing the stories.",
    "I would certainly recommend this course to a fellow student. English 120 helps one become a better writer\/essayist, and that ability in itself is applicable to practically every other major at Yale.",
    "Yes yes yes! Take it! You haven't had the full Yale experience without this class."
