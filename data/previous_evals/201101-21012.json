    "I would definitely recommend this class to PhD students interested in intellectual or cultural history, or Europeanists who want to demystify intellectual history. We read books published recently, which helped us get a sense of the field today. This is a great course to help you think about writing, especially as a few of the books were first books \/ dissertations.",
    "Would definitely recommend: good bibliography, great, intimate discussion. However, those who are looking for a more authoritarian approach and\/or don't have a background in the field might find it difficult."

    "This course has certainly helped me think about writing history, and about possible dissertation topics. We also discussed the business of academic publishing occasionally, something few instructors do.",
    "Since I would like to pursue intellectualhistory further, I found the seminar to be personally extremely helpful for my academic development."
