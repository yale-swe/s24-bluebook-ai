    "great way of learning a language, recommended for quick grasp of chinese",
    "Chinese 140 is a continuation of the level 4 sequence and provides a strong basis for speaking, writing, listening, and reading Chinese at an intermediate level. There is too much time spent on rote memorization and repetition in class, but the usage of that teaching method does ingrain certain sentence structures in students' minds. I would recommend taking this course.",
    "Yes. It does require time and commitment but the benefits far outweigh the challenges. It is also incredibly well-run and structured. Definitely recommend students to continue studying Chinese.",
    "If you've never taken Chinese here before and placed in, be prepared for a decent amount of work. If you've taken Chinese 130 previous to this, the class won't be too different. There are daily homework assignments, weekly quizzes, tests covering 2-3 lessons. Expect to always, always be doing Chinese work. The teachers are great, meeting every day can be a bit of a struggle sometimes, but overall definitely worth it if you're hoping to improve your Chinese.",
    "Not an overwhelming course but certainly a demanding one that I definitely recommend. Will give you confidence and command of the Chinese language.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class if you are serious about improving your Chinese. It's a lot of work with assignments or quizzes to prepare for every single day, but at the end of the semester you will see a noticeable improvement! Great instructors, highly regimented schedule, very intense!",
    "Definitely take Chinese. It's a strong department and all the professors are great. Yes, there are a lot of daily assignments, but you only get out of a foreign language class what you put into it. I feel so much more confident in my Chinese abilities after this class.",
    "Just like 130.",
    "Definitely take it! You have to if you want to take L4 Chinese, but even if you don't have to, do take the course, it's a lot of fun and the classroom atmosphere is very chill. The professors are nice and funny and your Chinese will improve a ton.",
    "The L3\/4 Chinese teachers are awesome. They really care about their students, keep class sizes tiny, and make sure that you are speaking and practicing Chinese in every class. Also, they are very well-organized and classes are sensibly taught. Tutorial is also a really good opportunity for 1-on-1 speaking time. Also, go to the Chinese table!! It's really fun and improves your Chinese.",
    "Chinese 140 is a good class. The work is somewhat intensive, but very consistent. Expect 2-3 quizzes every week and approximately 1-2 hours of homework every night. Weekly assignments range from 200 character essays to listening comprehension, reading comprehension, and grammar and vocabulary exercises. The professors are all very understanding and genuinely try to make learning the language enjoyable for students.",
    "If you want to greatly increase your command of Chinese, don't be afraid to put the work in and take this class. The work isn't too easy, but it is constant, sothere aren't a lot of all-nighters spent on a surprisingly hard assignment, like some classes.",
    "If you're taking this class, I recommend you take it with the mindset that you'll likely spend 1.5 to 2 hours preparing for each class. If you memorize the vocab for each chapter before you start studying that chapter, you'll be much better off in class and will understand and get more out of class time. Mu lao shi is a beast but he's also really caring, don't be afraid of him!"
