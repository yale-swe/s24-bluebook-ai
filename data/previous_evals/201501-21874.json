    "I would recommend EEB 290 to someone who has a lot of time of there hands to devote to memorization and treating this class like a full time job because that is really the only way that you are gonna come out of the course with an A",
    "Overall a pretty awesome introduction to the way evolution has shaped vertebrate morphology\/physio. As an MCDB major I really learned a lot of interesting things. The issue is that because we covered such a wide range of topics many of them were covered for an arbitrary amount of time. For example we learned about the evolution of vertebrate muscles from the waist up, presumably because there wasn't time to cover muscles from the waist down. Also I wish the class was a bit more concept based (i.e. focused on the path of evolution) instead of memorizing useless names of things.",
    "Really great class! Extremely well taught, and Prof. Wagner is awesome.",
    "Comparative Anatomy is a very interesting and enriching course. The course will teach you the evolutionary origins of various anatomical structures and the differences that define taxonomic groups. Professor Wagner is a great professor. The grade is made up of three exams, which you are given plenty of time to study for in order to fully understand the material",
    "A fantastic course. Take it if you can!",
    "A great class if you need it for your major\/premed, or if you are just interested in the subject. Be warned that you will need to memorize a lot of information for the midterms, so start studying early.",
    "Prof. Wagner is a solid lecturer. I took the lecture only, no lab, which I probably would not recommend. I think that the exam were a bit too memorization-based. A decent amount of memorization is unavoidable in this subject, but I think that there could have been more exam questions based on critical thinking and that could be reasoned through.",
    "This class is hard. Do not be fooled by the other reviews like I did. However, it is an interesting topic.",
    "A fast-paced lecture on comparative anatomy with a evolutionary developmental perspective. I would recommend this course to non-majors if you want a different perspective of biology than in your molecular\/cellular biology courses. Lots of memorization and lecture isn't always the most stimulating but I absolutely learned new things. If you need a bio lab that doesn't take that much time, I would also recommend taking the lecture + lab.",
    "I would highly recommend this class if the subject interests you. Chances are you are taking it because you have to, but even if that is the case don't worry because it really is a worthwhile class. I feel like I learned a ton about different systems and their evolutionary and developmental paths while never being too stressed out. The three tests are scary but overall pretty fair. It's a lot of studying leading up to the tests but other than the three weeks of the test the class is absolutely no work.",
    "If you are looking for an alternative as a pre-med bio to 103-104, take it. So much more relevant and interesting. That said, it is a lot of material and can get monotonous sometimes. You really can't miss any lectures, as all of the material is given in class (the books are more in depth than is necessary). While the material is interesting, don't expect a lot of support (There is no homework, discussion section, or readings; all of it is on you to understand). More than a few lectures were straight boring.",
    "I would not recommend this course for someone who just wants to learn about anatomy, or specifically human anatomy. Since this is a comparative anatomy class the amount of material you need to know is double or triple that of what you would need if you were only studying one species, or just mammals. Each class provides you with a large amount of information, it's interesting, but it is definitely difficult to balance when you you have to learn roughly 12 classes worth of material for the tests.",
    "I would highly recommend E&EB 290 to anyone who does not mind memorizing information and to anyone who has a slight interest in anatomy (although do keep in mind the difference between anatomy and physiology). The course topic is great - in this class, you learn about homology among the entire vertebrate subphylum, which is quite fascinating. Professor Wagner is an absolute expert on this topic, but despite being an expert he still found a way to make this class worth going to. The midterms are not cumulative, and there is no final or homework, but you do have to put work into studying for the midterms. If you pay attention in class (and DO go to class - the lecture slides may seem like a substitute, but they're really not) and don't cram for the exams the night before (devote one week to studying, and spread out the material) you should do well in this class.",
    "A great lecture and professor, but your grade comes only from the three midterms, and there are no other assignments.",
    "I would recommend this class. It's good if you want to understand the way the body works, but keep in mind before taking it that this is not human anatomy. This is an evo-devo perspective on anatomy and therefore focuses mainly on adaptive innovations throughout evolution, not the current working of the human body. You have to take this for one track of E&EB, but I think it is worthwhile even without the requirement."
