    "They aligned well. We actually covered far more than I expected.",
    "very well",
    "I thought wed get a little more background information and context on finance, but it was mostly hands on work",

    "Exceeded expectations",
    "The brevity of the course made it challenging to work on many examples, which I had been expecting to do. I didn't really feel like I had actually gained tangible skills by the end of the class because we were moving at such a fast pace, but rather just gained the resources to refer to later.",
    "During shopping period, it said the course was intended for financial concepts working in non-government. But actually, the course was business and profit focused financial concepts. So, the class did not align with my expectations.",
    "I wish it had been clearer, more engaging, and with a little bit more guidance and explanation.",
    "The course aligned with my expectations.",

   "comments": [
    "Strengths: Maureen is clearly extremely knowledgeable Weaknesses: Seems like a full-semester course that's been squeezed into 6 weeks; pace is so fast that I began to get lost towards the end; I'm not sure why it's billed as \"for Environmental Managers\" because nothing about it was especially environmentally oriented, other than the fact that the hypothetical companies discussed were related to aquaculture and energy efficiency.",
    "it was a great course - moved quickly, but good.",
    "The course is structured well and I liked the repetition of concepts",
    "Strength: Lectures were engaging. Weakness: nothing I can think of.",
    "I appreciated the substantial amount of material that was covered in just six weeks. However, it would have been helpful to spend more time on each topic and to have more in-class opportunities to practice the skills we learned.",
    "Strengths: This course requires little effort and does expose you to some basics of financial analysis.",
    "course moves too fast.",
    "Great course",
    "The resources provided in the class seem very helpful, but it was challenging to really apply the concepts in a way that felt like I was actually learning them. Is it possible to make this class longer? The format of the class (lecture and in class exercises) is good but it would be helpful to have more time overall.",
    "In class exercise are somewhat helpful. It could be improved giving more references and extra reading so as to be helpful for homework.",
    "The class felt overwhelming and a bit hectic. Things moved really quickly and I never quite felt like I could catch up or really grasp the information. A list of terms, definitions, and equations would have been very, very helpful. The Wednesday 6-8 time slot was very challenging, especially in an underfilled large lecture hall. Its the sleepiest time of the week....",
    "The course fulfilled its promise of providing knowledge of basic financial concepts, but I think it might be valuable to move through the material a little more slowly. There didn't seem to be enough time to think about one thing before moving on to the next topic.",
    "I did not like doing the in class exercises. I felt that I did not have enough time to adequately understand and review the information before being expected to an an exercise. This portion of the class was wasted time for me."

   "comments": [
    "Make sure you look back over the notes Maureen provides before starting the homework (and maybe even before attending class). The lectures are so fast-paced that you may need to go over the concepts several times.",
    "If you need to learn the basics of financial concepts, take this class.",
    "Great for an intro, but I doubt I will retain any of the skills I learned",
    "If a student is considering learning about financial concepts, this is a good place to start to decide whether or not they should further pursue this path.",
    "The course has a very low time\/effort investment, so if you want to be exposed to some financial basics it may be worth it.",
    "Interesting course",
    "This class is suitable for students who are seeking to pursue business focused environmental studies and thinking to take financial classes in the coming semesters.",
    "Good intro class on financial fundamentals. The basics of accounting are covered, which are necessary skills for anyone working in the for-profit sector.",
    "Dont. You can get a good background in financial concepts for free online. (If they change the course format, professor, or even timing of the course, it may be better.)",
    "Definitely read the syllabus, and dont commit before attending the first class.",
    "An excellent class for students wanting an introduction to financial concepts going beyond income and expenses. Includes weekly, but not very time-consuming assignments. Great for anyone not wanting to dive into a full accounting course but would like some appreciation of some basic accounting lingo and knowledge."
