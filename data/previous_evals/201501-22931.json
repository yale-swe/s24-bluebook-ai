    "An awesome class that teaches you all the technical aspects of photography that is necessary whether you prefer film or digital.",
    "If you are willing to put the time and make an investment (literally) into the course, then the payoffs are great. I love the art of black and white photography, and this class not only covered the basics but also really advanced techniques. Be prepared to spend 10+ hours shooting and in the darkroom every week- it may sound like an extra job, but really it's such rewarding work. So glad I took this class!",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course. Really helped me gain strong technical skills in the darkroom as well as a greater understanding of photography as a medium.",
    "Yes! Although it takes a lot of time, it really worth it. Take it credit\/D if you are not planning to be an art major."
