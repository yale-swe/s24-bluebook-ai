    "Take it if you can! A great class unlike most offered at Yale due to the semester-long design project. The professors (Zimmerman and Anastas) are clearly experts at the top of their field. It was exciting to learn from them, especially since they are both so passionate about the topic.",
    "I recommend this class for those interested in sustainability and product design. Pick an idea that you and your teammates really like because you'll be working on refining the product throughout the semester.",
    "Class is heavily focused on design project, and therefore requires individual\/group initiative to make progress. If your group is motivated and you are interested in your project, the class is very enjoyable. You learn how to work in a group dynamic, which is lacking in many other engineering courses. Also an excellent overview of topics affecting sustainability issues.",
    "Take it!! You won't find many classes like this at Yale. It'll be worth your while. And you'll get really close to a group of people. I mean really close -- you'll be meeting outside of class for hours and hours every week.",
    "I really enjoyed the class because I had a good group for the final project. The lectures and in-class activities are interesting, but I'd say the project is what really defines the class. What you put in is what you get out. I'd recommend it!",
    "Don't expect to learn much of substance from this class. That being said, it gives you an interesting perspective on product design and the final projects are fun.",
    "ENVE 360 was a fun class to actually make things. It takes a lot of time to do the project, but the class is interesting.",
    "I was SO excited for this class at the beginning of the semester but it ended up being a real disappointment. I don't think I learned much and it ended up being a lot of green marketing and not much green engineering. It wasn't bad though.",
    "GESD is a great class to get an idea of how things work and how things should work in the future. It makes everyone feel more involved and invested in the future of our planet. Great class to make you realize your potential.",
    "I would summarize this class as being very different from most of the other classes you will probably take as an engineering student, especially environmental. It is very hands-on, which was pretty cool, even though at times you felt a little lost and dependent on Larry. How much you enjoy the class is very dependent on your group. If you have a good group and everyone puts in the same amount of work, it can be a very rewarding experience. Otherwise, the project will become incredibly frustrating. In terms of the material, it is pretty independent of the big project. We are only tested on the first half of the class, so the second half is not has important. There is also the Blue Juice project, which was interesting and a nice way to practice some of the skills we would use in the big project but was pretty annoying and sort of unnecessary.",
    "This class is my favorite class that I have taken at Yale. It gives engineers a unique opportunity to learn practical skills and how to come up with and market an idea. There is so much support in the class and its really exciting to see how it will improve over the next years.",
    "YES. It is an amazing opportunity to get some hands-on experience in the CEID. The class topics are interesting and are applicable to most career paths",
    "It's pretty difficult to get into, but if you're a senior or an ENVE major, you have a pretty good chance! What to expect: a few problem sets (we only had one), a really difficult midterm that was graded REALLY nicely, a final group project. embrace your group! you can elect to stay with people you know or be randomly assigned."
