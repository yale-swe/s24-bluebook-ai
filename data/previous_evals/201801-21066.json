    "The grammar part of the course is essentially an extension of French 130, like subjunctive, imperative, faire causitif, passe simple, etc. I learned much more through the literature and films about France in WW2 and the experiences of people in the different stories of Diversite. The course also requires more oral production, so my pronunciation improved a lot.",
    "Got much better at French.",
    "Grammar; reading; listening; conversation; culture",
    "We further polished grammar, greatly increased vocabulary, and explored various African and European cultures (ending with a multifaceted study of the Holocaust)",
    "I strengthened my knowledge of written and spoken French, and gained enough of an understanding of the language to be able to study French literature.",
    "Conversational and written u derstanding of intermediate french as well as a solid ability to read full novels in french."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: Engaging. It starts to move away from grammar and focuses on culture so it's not tedious. Interesting readings and films. There is also more opportunities for oral production, which is nice. Weaknesses: There were so many readings that it was difficult to go into depth for any of them, especially the Diversite stories. It essentially consisted of learning the vocabulary, timeline, and characters for each story and not much else, and it leaves you wanting to learn more about francophone countries.",
    "Great teacher, sometimes homework was tedious",
    "Strengths: Thorough review of grammar; culturally in-touch; engaging Weaknesses: Could include more in-class discussion",
    "Great course overall! Please rely less on Barson's in the beginning though. It's dry and not always helpful.",
    "The course is structured very well, with a large emphasis on grammar and reading. I appreciated the inclusion of more diverse texts as well as different media like films in FREN 140, and I think it greatly increased my engagement with the material. The student presentations were also a very useful way of increasing my level of comfort with the language."

    "Overall this is a good class. I definitely felt I learned a lot and my command of the french language improved greatly. Madame Burton is a great teacher and is very energetic in the mornings which is nice. It is a lot of work, though, so I would only take it if you have a light-er semester.",
    "Yes. The concepts in the class are pretty simple if you have experience in French, and it helps to solidify concepts you may already know. The workload can be annoying but that comes with almost any language class.",
    "If you like learning languages",
    "To a student interested in becoming comfortably independent with speaking French, I would recommend this course.",
    "Yes, but be careful what professor you take F140 with. Some provide more busywork than the class is really worth",
    "Yes - it's well taught, and the jump in fluency I experienced from L3 to L4 was worth the extra work!",
    "I would recommend as a way to solidify a basic understanding of the french language and continue practicing.",
    "Yes"
