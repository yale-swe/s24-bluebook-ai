   "comments": [
    "I would highly recommend it for those interested in game theory. Non-cooperative games are fascinating in themselves. I didn't have any technical background in game theory before this class, and I was able to handle it.",
    "Best class I've taken this semester, definitely take it if you can get in",
    "If you need an econ seminar with a low work load, then take this class. The material is interesting if you already have an affinity for Game Theory. But don't expect it to be mind-blowing, and to sit through some long proofs in the morning. I tried to take it \"for fun\" and kind of regretted it.",
    "Yep! Why not",
    "Take for a interesting proof-heavy topic that does not presuppose any previous knowledge of math, Econ, or game theory. Pradeep's Martian analogies make for an engaging lecture.",
    "Though the classes can get a bit dry after an interesting start, I'd recommend Cooperative Game Theory as a good way to learn how to approach problems differently. The problem sets and final paper allow you to work through these concepts and their applications. I feel like the course accomplished the college clich of teaching you how to think in a new way, even if only through a few basic concepts, and I'm glad I took it.",
    "An interesting course with a relatively lighter workload. Professor Dubey is a great lecturer, and you will learn a lot about the Shapley Value, the core, Nash bargaining, and other concepts in cooperation. Some game theory background will help but is not necessary.",
    "One of the easiest ECON senior seminars - only three problem sets, a midterm, and a final paper. The material is actually super interesting, though much more math\/CS-y than many other ECON classes here. Professor Dubey is incredibly clear, though a bit heavy on the proofs. Overall, definitely take it - worth the 9:25 AM!",
    "It's a good game theory class."
