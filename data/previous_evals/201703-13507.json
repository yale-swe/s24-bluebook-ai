   "comments": [
    "I received a nice refresher and was able to expand my skills\/understanding of statistics.",
    "I gained an introductory understanding of statistics--an ability to speak the language and understand different experimental and research designs.",
    "In-depth understanding on how statistics can be applied to research and how to read the statistical results of other researchers",
    "I developed a skill set in statistics using minitab and math. I feel like I can now understand the statistics behind academic articles.",
    "A foundational understanding of statistical analysis, including probability and including various regression analyses.",
    "Learned a lot about MiniTab, refreshed with stats, and did some good refreshing work!",
    "After taking this course, I feel much more capable of understanding the concepts in setting up and analyzing fundamental statistical tests, particularly in comparison to my undergraduate intro to stats course. Now, I feel ready to set up simple experiments and use basic statistics to analyze the results.",
    "I learned how to perform statistical tests to analyze data and identify relationships between variables. I also learned how to use Minitab.",
    "I learned regression analysis, probability, experiment design, and how to evaluate statistical claims.",
    "I thoroughly enjoyed this course. Jonathan is an excellent teacher, who bends over backwards to make stats accessible, interesting, and memorable. I had some background in stats from my undergrad, but it had been a long time, and I was actually disappointed at how little I remembered from that time. I don't think that will be a problem again - Jonathan's course went deeper, I was decidedly more engaged, and the work helped ground it in a way I hope will last. I feel that I am coming away with a strong foundation in introductory statistical analysis, and will likely take additional stats course while here at FES (with Jonathan if possible) to further deepen that understanding.",
    "Could learn many new statistical skills and knowledge.",
    "I had a decent amount of exposure to stats before, but I filled in some critical gaps and became much more comfortable with concepts I had been exposed to before, especially related to probability.",
    "This course represented my first comprehensive introduction to statistics. I've now developed some competency in data and trend analysis methods and techniques, with a moderate degree of proficiency in the use of a new statistical software package (Minitab). The course has also provided some insight on some research methods and tools that I may be interested in undertaking.",
    "I learned a lot about the principles of statistics. I feel more prepared now to understand and interpret results from papers, but also to think more deeply on how I could develop further research.",
    "Better undertsanding of stats concepts I had covered in previous stats courses, plus an intro to ones that I hadn't (ANOVA).",
    "I developed a solid understanding of basic statistical methods and analyses, and learned how to think about applying them to a variety of situations.",
    "I learned various statistical methods and how to apply them in the environmental field",
    "Core statistical analysis",
    "Great overview of essential statistics. The Professor went in to a decent amount of depth on many different topics and was very engaging. It was very apparent that he truly loved to teach and that he wanted his students to become engaged in the subject matter.",
    "Basic statistical tests--regression, ANOVA, t-tests, etc.",
    "I learned how statisticians think, what kind of tests they use, and how to set up a study.",
    "Stats isn't as hard as I thought. It's an approachable toolbox of skills I should be more comfortable using and reading going forward.",
    "I had never taken a stats class before, so this class was very helpful in providing a foundation in basic statistical concepts like probability, data analysis and regression. The lectures and problem sets, as well as the final project, created a nice balance between knowledge intake and hands-on application.",
    "I gained skills to read and interpret statistical information and graphs, and I learned to determine the statistical significance of my own data.",
    "Sampling approach Data explorations Statistical analysis of data"

   "comments": [
    "They teach you exactly what they say they will!",
    "We covered a lot of ground in the class. The course met my expectations.",
    "Very well--the content of the course was exactly what I was hoping for and expecting.",
    "Very well aligned",
    "What I gained aligned well with my expectations.",
    "The knowledge, skills, and insights gained through this class exceeded my expectations. My understanding of statistics was very perfunctory prior to taking this class, and the class provided a thorough overview of the statistical methods that can be utilized to determine relationships.",
    "Yep, pretty much what I expected. Most engaging stats course I've taken -- I'm not in love with the topic generally, but I really appreciate how Jonathan taught it.",
    "This course taught you the concepts and reasoning behind statistical tests, compared to my undergraduate statistics course, which was much heavier in the math and where I didn't walk away with any big-picture understanding of why and how to use certain statistical tests. Therefore, in this way, this course surpassed my expectations by making me feel more competent than I had previously.",
    "This course met my expectations and additionally taught me how to formulate appropriate questions of datasets and understand the limitations of statistical analysis.",
    "100% exceeded my expectations. One of the best classes I've taken at FES so far.",
    "Well aligned",
    "Met my expectation.",
    "I had hoped for a slightly more mathematically rigorous course because statistics is something I hope to pursue in my career. Overall, we hit on all the concepts I wanted to see, but I could have used a slightly more in-depth stats class.",
    "Exceeded my expectations",
    "Very well. I'm truly grateful for this learning experience which exceeded my expectations.",
    "What I gained in class definitely aligned and even exceeded my expectations. The homeworks were crucial to understand better the topics and midterms were a great opportunity to review the material. Everything was very well designed for our benefit.",
    "Great understanding and knowledge",
    "We covered what I expected.",
    "Very well. I actually feel like I've retained more practical and useful stats knowledge than I thought I would, given that I have very little stats background.",
    "It matched my expectations, I learned a lot of useful methods that I'll be able to apply",
    "I had taken university level stats in the past and these subjects were good for me to review. I had taken the class >5 years ago and forgotten many of the core ideas. ANOVA was new to me. During the class, I realized that I had remembered some of the material, so some of it wasn't additive to my learnings.",
    "My expectations aligned very well with what the course offered.",
    "About what I expected. It is a good overview of stats--nothing too in-depth, but wide ranging.",
    "They aligned pretty well with my expectations. I would have liked to learn more about how to read statistical analyses in scientific studies.",
    "Better than expected",
    "Well -- this class lived up to my expectations.",
    "The skills I gained matched my expectations for the course.",
    "Well aligned"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of the course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The course did a great job of covering a wide breadth of content, however, the first few weeks of the course moved much slower than the rest.",
    "There is a strong emphasis placed on learning rather than evaluation. I felt like this focus enabled an environment where long-term knowledge retention was placed over short term retention.",
    "Jonathan is very engaged with students, both in class and during office hours consultations. I'm glad he recorded the classes and made those recordings available on Canvas; all instructors should do this.",
    "The strengths of the course are that the classes build off of each other and the homework align with the classes. The biggest weakness is that the course is very fast paced.",
    "I do not think the course has any weaknesses and do not think it could be improved.",
    "Jonathan has the course down pretty well, and he really makes time for his students.",
    "Dr. Reuning-Scherer explains concepts very clearly, and I definitely benefited from his engaging teaching style. I was very satisfied with this course. However, one weakness I would comment on was the grading system. I was sometimes caught off guard by my homework grades being lower than expected, and it seems to be because I didn't fully understand what was expected for our answers. This could be made clearer going forward.",
    "The course is very well organized and lectures are engaging. Learning objectives and assignments are all clear. The TAs are accessible and knowledgeable, but occasionally did not seem to be on the same page in regards to homework expectations (i.e. what key points to include for full credit). I also feel that probability could be covered at a higher level in a shorter time span in order to leave more time to practice regression and ANOVA with real data. While understanding probability concepts is essential, the practice questions and specific applications did not seem necessary for the rest of the course. But perhaps I felt this way because I had recently taken a statistics course that covered probability extensively.",
    "The course strength is the professor, who is engaging, fun, and provides students with all the tools necessary to learn stats. The TAs were also incredibly helpful.",
    "Honestly none, this was a well designed and executed course, and one got the sense that Jonathan has honed it carefully over the years.",
    "Jonathan's teaching style is so great and engaging! It's a great survey course for statistics. Again, I would have liked to see a bit more rigorous\/mathematical approach to stats for those of us who want to pursue stats\/data analysis in our careers.",
    "I liked the props and prices, especially the light saber pointer. Challenging material was made more accessible.",
    "The course content may be considered heavy, but Jonathan's delivery is organised, simple and charismatic. The problem sets are also well aligned with the course content that further assists in student learning.",
    "I feel that the needs of the students were met with the two versions of the class. Maybe one thing that has room for improvement is the speed at which the professor speaks in the normal class.",
    "I would have been more engaged if there were a reason to come to class - i.e. quizzes. I just didn't get as much out of the videos. But I realize that's more on me than the professor.",
    "It seemed there were some inconsistencies in the grading standards among the TFs, and that was unfair to some students depending on which TF graded their homeworks. The grading should be more standardized.",
    "The pace of the class is a little too fast",
    "It's very engaging and fun. I like the connection to real life research studies and topics. I think the homework could have been harder...I didn't do well on every assignment because I thought that they assignments were graded very nitpicky. I don't care too much about my grades though so tried to focus on the larger concepts above the individual grades.",
    "I thought the professor did a very good job covering many topics in a relatively little amount of time. I learned a lot and did not feel overwhelmed by the information which should be credited to Professor Reuning-Scherer for his organization of the class. Overall I really enjoyed the class.",
    "If lectures could be delivered at slower pace.",
    "Required use of SPSS or R--although Minitab was easy, it doesn't seem useful at all.",
    "Once I switched into the flipped course, I became much more engaged and successful. I think that having an element of practice with support is incredibly valuable to this course. Jonathan is a great teacher, but his in-class lectures move far too fast for a first time stats student. The probability segment went especially quickly and felt impossible to succeed in as a student with little background in the subject.",
    "All of the resources made available (video replays, video explanations, tutors, TAs, office hours, multiple texts, preprinted notes) is certainly the strength of the course and it unparalleled by any others in that regard",
    "The strengths of this course include Jonathan's teaching style and his organization of the material. He clearly has put a great deal of thought into preparing each lecture, and he makes sure to transition between concepts logically and make connections to previously discussed material. Additionally, the generous availability of the TAs and Jonathan's willingness to answer questions even when stopped in the hallway of CSSSI make the course a rarity among FES in that in this case it is clear the professor really is invested in student learning.",
    "The course is well structured and the content is great"

    "Take this class if you haven't had a stats class before. Teaches you all the basics and is very fun and engaging.",
    "Start the project early.",
    "Classes are super fun. Don't skip classes, materials\/concepts carry over to the next classes. Start your end of term project after fall break.",
    "Work in the stats lab during office hours of the TAs.",
    "If you have not taken a statistics course and believe it may comprise a portion of your future work, then definitely take this course!",
    "It's a great course, but sometimes does move very quickly. So just have to be ready for a Stats course that can go pretty quickly.",
    "All FES students should take this class. Data analysis is increasingly important in all fields and even those who do not need to perform analysis themselves should have an understanding of the applications and limitations of statistics. I do not think any prior experience with statistics is necessary for this course. Students who have taken an undergrad course will find the first few weeks to be review.",
    "Take it!!!",
    "Take it, it's great",
    "If statistics is really important to your professional and academic goals, considering taking a mathematical statistics class instead.",
    "Keep up with the material and start the final project early. Go to office hours and review sessions.",
    "An excellent foundation course that will serve most, if not all students well at FES and beyond - and a must-take if your learning objectives at FES is to improve your data analysis\/quantitative skillset. Workload is very manageable. The flipped teaching modality also offers students significant flexibility, allowing them to attend class or watch lectures online.",
    "I strongly recommend this class, you will learn a lot about the topic and feel very confident about the knowledge and skills that you acquire. However, if you think stats is a hard topic for you, take the flipped class.",
    "Go to class, whether that be the flipped course or the in-person lecture.",
    "Be self-motivated to keep up with the concepts because if you fall behind on understanding the basics, you will get lost easily.",
    "They should focus on the lecture and doing the homeworks that's the main way to excel in the course",
    "Learn the core concepts and don't worry about your grades.",
    "I would take this class if you have taken 1 or no college level statistics classes. It was a great review and was very helpful. Professor Reuning-Scherer is a great teacher!",
    "Give a try.",
    "Do it in R!",
    "This is a helpful course for understanding why stats is an important element of data analysis and study set-up. This course will be most helpful if you plan to conduct your own research.",
    "Please don't fall behind, and if you do, don't be ashamed to find help or talk with Jonathan.",
    "Take it if you think stats will be useful to you in any way, and attend the classes. Getting behind is the only way I saw people struggle with the class; if you show up and do the work, you'll learn a lot and do fine in the class.",
    "It's a great class and just stay on top of your work.",
    "If you are new to statistics but have enjoyed math previously, I would encourage you to take this course. If you have taken statistics before, I'm not sure how repetitive this course will feel -- it's worth asking others.",
    "It is one of the best taught courses. The professor is friendly and quite approachable"
