   "comments": [
    "The course really made me think about the difficult questions surrounding development aid. I liked how we started off the course with Tocqueville, made our way through the different USAID cases, and finished if off with Tropical Gangsters. Professor Blair is intimidating at first but he really cares about his students and this shows in how he conducts his classes (meetings for the paper and regular office hours). Professor Blair's in-field experiences was what made the class discussions so interesting.",
    "I loved PLSC 401. Professor Blair is funny and has immeasurable experience in the field with USAID. You'll read some theoretical texts, then some case studies. The reading isn't terrible, and it's well-chosen to reflect the sorts of problems requiring analysis. You're only required to do short reading responses, and then Blair will ask you to expound a bit on your particular subject of interest from the readings. If you're interested in the challenges of engendering democracy in developing nations, it's pretty much what you're looking for.",
    "If you're taking this class because you're interested in democracy movements in developing countries, don't take it. Take it if you'd like to be something of a USAID officer.",
    "This course aims to provide a real-world glimpse at the ways in which Western agencies promote democracy in the newly-industrializing and Third World. Prof. Blair brings a wealth of experience to this class, having worked for a variety of aid organizations, most notably USAID. I learned a great deal from our readings about the various issues in democracy promotion today (from a predominantly American perspective) but the class discussion fell flat at times. While he is certainly knowledgeable, Prof. Blair wasn't the most engaging or dynamic seminar leader. If you want a bit more nuanced and multifaceted understanding of what issues face democracy promotion efforts, you might want to look elsewhere. My grade will also be a surprise, as I have no sense of how I've done throughout the semester and I don't think anyone else knows how their performance has been either. Nonetheless, it offers a solid introduction to American views on the movement towards an entirely democratic world.",
    "This class is A LOT of reading and A LOT of discussion... it's basically entirely discussion. Professor Blair doesn't lecture; he facilitates discussion between students for the entire time. So be prepared to read a lot and talk a lot. That being said, this class is really interesting and should make you think about democracy promotion and democracy itself in entirely different ways. Some of the reading is also really interesting... there were a few books that I absolutely couldn't put down! Unfortunately, not all of it is like that however. Overall this is a challenging but rewarding (and definitely interesting!) class.",
    "Yes, but only if you are interested in the subject. Case studies can get boring otherwise",
    "I would recommend it if a) You are completely sold on the merits of democracy, as if you're not, you will just be frustrated by the assumptions in this class, b) If you don't mind a lot of quite dry, technical reading, and c) If you are a practical sort of person, interested in how to implement programs etc."
