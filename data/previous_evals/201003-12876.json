   "comments": [
    "Wonderful opportunity, if you have the time for observations. You'll be so happy to spend a few hours a week with the infants, toddlers, or preschoolers. The lectures and discussions are interesting as well.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. it is a really unique and valuable perspective on childhood and development. it allows you to explore your own childhood, understand the science and psychology behind child development, and really learn to connect with kids.",
    "This is a fantastic course! I had this one on my \"to-do list\" ever since I came to Yale, and I'm glad I finally took it. You learn about interesting ways in which children grow and develop, through lenses such as language, play and relationships, and then see how these theories play themselves out -- or not, as often the case -- in the child care centers to which you are attached. The workload was manageable, but certainly NOT a gut.",
    "I'd definitely recommend it. Fun class and not difficult as far as readings or work go.",
    "I'm glad I took this course, but it's a very mixed bag. The course is a weekly lecture\/seminar (1.5 hours of lecture and then 30 minutes of discussion), and a weekly 3-hour observation period at a local daycare. I LOVED the observation period-- the chance to play with toddlers for credit is amazing! However, the lectures were usually extremely dull-- most of the information seemed geared towards people who had never seen a kid before and needed the very very basic elements of children's personalities explained to them. Basically, this course *was* the observation period: the lectures were boring, and the readings were largely unnecessary. Work is minimal outside of the observation period, but the 3-hour block of time (and mile-long walk to the center) meant that it was rather time-consuming. Basically, take this course if you love kids, because playing with them is great. Do not take this course if you're more interested in the classroom\/intellectual aspect than the observation aspect, because as a lecture it's very lackluster-- what makes it worth it is the observation period!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course...so much fun and great learning material",
    "Awesome class absolutely take it if you can",
    "I would highly recommend this class to all students. Everyone should have a background about child development and education. It allows students with little to no background to really feel apart of a special experience. The weekly observations are a great time to actually see the developments you are learning in class ... and you get to be with cute kids!",
    "This course is something anyone with an interestin children should definitely look into. The observing is incredibly fun and rewarding and the material is interesting as well. The professors are very nice and the work load is not bad at all. Highly recommended.",
    "This was a great class and one of my favorite at Yale so far. Though it seems like it would be a lot of extra work going up past the divinity school for three hours, the time flew by every week!",
    "This class was great- you should take it if you like kids. The assignments were not difficult. The lecture could be really boring at times, but the practicum -- 3 hours per week at a childcare center-- was awesome. I loved getting to know the kids and watch them as they interact with each other. Take it!",
    "Great class. I'd definitely recommend the course. It's wonderful to be able to integrate what you learn in the classroom into what you see during observations at daycares... and to be able to talk about all that in small groups. It was a great experience.",
    "This class is fantastic if you want to learn about children in practice, though less so in theory. I suggest Professor Keil's class if you want a better understanding of theoretical developmental processes and neat developmental experiments, but take this class if you want to understand how to interact with children.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. You pretty much need to be a senior to get in. Once you do, take it. It meets once a week; they're lectures with small section groupings during the last thirty minutes or so. You have to spend three additional hours a week at a day care center hanging out with adorable kids. Then you write about them in journal entries. Really pretty sweet.",
    "This class is an amazing opportunity for people who like children. It was a lot of fun and was a life changing experience working with the children at Calvin Hill. Fun class with not too much work.",
    "Definitely. It is a bit time consuming since it requires a 3-hour per week visit to the daycare in addition to the weekly lectures, but it is well worth it."
