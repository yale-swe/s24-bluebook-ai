    "I have a better appreciation and understanding of generating concepts for my art, which is something I have struggled with in the past.",
    "I learned important concepts of building a narrative within painting. Meleko also taught us how to mix paints, skin colors, stretch a canvas, and many more essentials. The intellectual conversations and critiques we had of museum and student art were rewarding as I learned how to look deeply at a work of art and analyze it through the artists choices, narrative and more.",

   "comments": [
    "The course allows for a lot of exploration and time to paint, which is so hard to get outside of class. The professor was incredible and had amazing answers to all my questions. The class was mostly free painting time with only a couple of real deadlines for creating work, and I felt a bit aimless at times. I ended up with three unfinished pieces that I had to complete for my final class, and I think if each had a separate due date (not even for being finished but due for separate critiques) that could have helpful for dividing the time. That is a minor complaint though - the way the class works now is also very nice and kept painting as a fun creative practice and not soulless labor (which I've experienced in other art classes). Another thing that I loved from this semester was when we did a museum visit. I wish we did more because it was very helpful to have a facilitated discussion about different types of narrative figure paintings.",
    "Some classes were very hands on and some classes were work-on-your-own studio days, and i really enjoyed that. It may not work for some people! However, Meleko is always very present on Thursdays, while Kathia (TA) was present on Tuesdays and Thursdays.",
    "I don't see any points that require improvement."

    "Yes absolutely, if you are a self-guided painter\/painting major who wants to explore different aspects of painting and constructing an image to impact viewers, this class is certainly for you! Meleko is amazing.",
    "This is an amazing chance to study with a leading artist in the world today.",
    "would definitely recommend! meleko is amazing and super smart and you will learn a range of techniques and get helpful feedback in crits."
