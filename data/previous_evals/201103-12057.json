   "comments": [
    "Yes! Take this class if you're interested in the least in French theory from the XXth century.",
    "GReat",
    "Ehhhh...If you are interested in 20th century literature and philosophy thinking then yes. It was conducted in English, which i did not prefer as a French major.",
    "I would totally recommend this class. It was an amazing introduction (for me) but also in depth look at the intricacies of French thought starting with Sartre. We cover a ton of material, but Professor Zhuo does a great job in teasing out the intricate arguments in class. There is a lot of reading, but I would recommend taking the time to do it and raise questions in class or on the forum. Professor Zhuo is brilliant and gives every question an extremely well thought out answer that takes into account the intricate pieces of the author's thought. This can sometimes be frustrating though, as she sometimes asks to look further before providing an answer to someone's question. This, I would think, is overall a strength though. But don't take the class if you're impatient, with the course material or the professor. Also don't take the class if you're not willing to assume what each author assumes and work from their premises. One of the most frustrating parts of the class was when students wanted to dismiss various authors because they didn't agree with the premises. But if you want an introduction to many french thinkers since Sartre, with as in-depth an explanation as possible (given the time), take this class. It's fantastic.",
    "Make sure you are interested before you take it. Look through the syllabus and check out the readings. I really enjoyed the first part of the course, but wasn't particularly moved or interested by much of the latter half.",
    "A great introduction to some of the most relevant texts from theory.",
    "This is a wonderful class. Great readings. Always left with more questions than answers. This was the first philosophy course I have taken, even though it was listed under the French department. Professor Zhuo makes the readings a lot more digestible for those of us who may not have a complete grasp of the material (and digestible to anyone really because who can understand Foucault?).",
    "If they decide to offer classes on more focused topics within French theory, they might be worth taking. If you are interested in getting exposed to some authors, and plan to read a lot of books on your own, then maybe this one would be okay (we didn't read any whole books, and it felt a little aimless and scattered reading so many excerpts and short articles.) Realistically, I'm sure most people don't find time to do that much extra reading during the semester, and without that the class doesn't feel like much.",
    "The authors are amazing. Derrida, Foucault, Deleuze, Sartre, just a bunch of bosses. Their ideas are really interesting and great at expanding your thought. Take it! The readings are difficult, but don't shy away from them, they are well worth the challenge.",
    "French Theory has a liberal-arts-minded students' dream syllabus. We read Sartre, Foucault, Barthes, Deleuze, Derrida etc. and Professor Zhuo gave us a good understanding of each author despite our limited readings of each author. My only complaint was that we didn't read enough of each author, although it's hard enough keeping up with the reading as is. We had only 2 papers (one 5 pages, one 10), plus a participation grade. In short: YES. If you want to read these authors in a relatively low-stress setting, take this class. Professor Zhuo makes everyone feel comfortable and is so incredibly knowledgeable about the topic."
