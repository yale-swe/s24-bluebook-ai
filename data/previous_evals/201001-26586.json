    "This studio had a lot of coordination at the urban design and planning scale. It also had some potential for structural coordination.",
    "The studio mainly stressed good graphic presentation skills along with fabrication. No coordination with landscape\/planning\/structures was really encouraged."

   "comments": [
    "The most valuable aspect of the studio was reviews and pin ups. class discussions would have been helpful and desk crits tended to be less productive.",
    "I found the desk crits most valuablefor this studio. More Pin ups would have been helpful as well to see what other students were thinking and producing.",
    "I found the juries (mid review) and final review the most inspirational\/educational. It was rather enlightening to hear what postmodernism means to contemporary practitioners today, and how they would revive and react to an iconic (motif) architecture."

   "comments": [
    "the strength of the studio came from its initial studies on heraldry and communication. while there were other assignments (border crossing) that were more aligned with the original program, it actually disrupted the momentum that the studio started with.",
    "The heraldic objects did not necessarily translate to a heraldic architecture. I found working backwards in terms of architecture, THEN program to be a very challenging exercise (typically students are given program, then initiated to design the architecture). I'm not sure if i'm a firm believer in an iconic architecture that could prompt program afterwards..."

   "question_text": "What were your expectations for this studio and how well were they met?",
   "comments": [
    "my expectations for the studio were met. I feel there could have been more personal attention and development of individual ideas, instead of pure critique.",
    "The studio met my expectations in that it made me investigate the ideas of postmodernism in a site-specific, program driven, context.",
    "My expectations were met in the studio as i had alot of fun designing my final project which is typically the case every other semester. I think students were encouraged after the heraldic agenda but not forced to marshall as the only viable solution. I think of the studio as a very experimental studios - as we were the guinea pigs in a lab experiment with no placebo counterbalance."

   "question_text": "Discuss the main strengths and weaknesses of your Studio Head and if there was one, the Assistant Teacher.",
   "comments": [
    "The FAT members were mostly disorganized and unprofessional. They have interesting ideas, but their offhand manner makes for a very stressful, last minute and unmanaged working process. They are hard to work with, and do not have much consideration for the students' concerns and schedules. They neglected to give us a proper tour of their office in London, which was completely unprofessional, and were largely absent on the studio trip, except for Sean who spent time with the students in London. Jennifer Leung was a huge help since she was very organized and receptive.",
    "The studio instructors divided their timee equally with the studio and were very accessible over the course of several long weekends F-M. The assistant teacher was also very effective in tying ideas together between the three heads as well as insert her own ideas and feedback.",
    "I found the instructors extremely helpful but would have been better if they had been more available during the course of the semester.",
    "Sam was very visionary in his thinking and advising - he was quick to judge an idea but very accurate with constructive criticism. His main weakness was his short attention span.Jennifer has very keen insight into every project - she was very thorough with her criticism and her desk critis."
