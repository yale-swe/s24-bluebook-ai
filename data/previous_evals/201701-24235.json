    "In EPE 301, I learned about the ways in which the theoretical assumptions that ground conventional conceptions of justice can be thought of differently. We read about how indigenous cultures have different viewpoints than do western societies about how humanity relates to the rest of the living world and the environment. We read a philosophical account of biology and life. We learned about ways in which to think differently about space and time. We read about theories of intergenerational justice. We also discussed topics in environmental justice and climate change. This class will help you to become a better thinker and will inspire you to challenge the assumptions you make when formulating thoughts about the world.",
    "David Leslie is a wonderful professor who thinks differently than any other professor I've had at Yale. He does not take any assumptions for granted and pushes all of his students to think on the largest scale. He is good at offering a mix of wisdom through lecture while also encouraging discussion. I also really appreciated the exercise of having printed out notes\/handouts at the beginning of each course."

    "Small seminar but was awesome because allowed for great discussion and analysis of topic",

    "Absolutely loved this course! You learn so much about some incredibly cool topics, get to read some really varied and interesting books, and have a lot of freedom with the final paper to really explore something of personal interest to you."

    "I would recommend this course to another student who is either interested by the topics and readings on the syllabus or would like to take a seminar with an amazing professor. Either is a very good reason to take this course.",
    "This class was very interesting and eye-opening. The discussions we had in class always seemed to flow naturally and the topics we covered really extended my perspective.",
    "Yes, and be prepared to have your assumptions challenged (in a good way)",
    "100p would recommend this course!! You learn so much about some really fascinating topics, get to read a bunch of books\/studies from incredibly varied and interesting authors, and Prof. Leslie is amazing! Really gets you thinking long-term about where we're headed as a species, and the interdisciplinary nature of the topic itself makes it relevant\/interesting for mostly everyone. Definitely defininitly take it if you have the chance!!",
    "Yes! If you are prepared to do a good amount of reading and have some really crazy out-there discussions, take this course!"
