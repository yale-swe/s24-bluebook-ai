    "Klinkenborg gave comments on pieces every week, so my response about the professor being responsive to student comments is sort of misleading. But i think only half of my pieces received an emailed response about the content of my prose- which i really i got every week.",
    "While I appreciated the complete freedom to write about any subject I chose each week, I would also haveappreciated occasional more structured assignments targeting specific issues in writing. There must be common issues that we could all benefit from focusing on.",
    "The readings that the professor chose I found to be really helpful and inspiring. Sometimes, the lack ofexpectations made it challenging to know how to approach the assignments, but the creative space provided a lot of learning and growth.",
    "I enjoyed both the in-class instruction and the readings assigned out of class. The class time was productive and while the overall workload was lighter compared to other classes, I believe (in retrospect) that this is by design. I have no complaints or suggestions for improvement.",
    "Re: question 3: the workload was lighter than most of my other classes, but the work was so worthwhile and helpful!",
    "I think the out-of-class assignments need a little work. Sometimes I was a little confused on the goal for a writing assignment. It would be helpful to add some sort of \"theme\" to the assignments. For example, writing about a childhood\/memorable life-changing experience during one week; and another week, writing about a current event. However, not having a theme did not affect the overall outcome of the class, in which I learned quite a lot."

   "comments": [
    "Klinkenborg, besides being a brilliant writer, is quietly and almost deceptively a brilliant English teacher. Great interpreter of prose. Loved reading and discussing prose from writers each week.",
    "It was an honor to learn from Verlyn Klinkenborg",
    "Detailed feedback on writing, open-ended and participatory class sessions, exposure to a variety of excellent readings.",
    "This course was an interactive peer-to-peer learning experience. The weekly submissions, the public reading of peer material, and the sentence analysis where the best experiences of this course. Overall, a great insight on your writing style.",
    "Verlyn is an inspiration. A true teacher. His approach to clarifying and strengthening our prose worked wonders. The collective improvement over the course of the term was shocking.",
    "The weekly writing assignment, combined with weekly feedback on each piece, is the strongest aspect of this course. Being asked to think and write creatively each week was both a challenge and incredibly gratifying. The only way to improve your writing is to practice, see what works and what doesn't.",
    "everyone needs help improving their writing skills and this class is tremendously helpful for doing that.",
    "Verlyn is not only a master of prose, he is a masterful teacher. He began each class by asking, What challenged you this week in your writing? That class and those following responded to our needs. He gently led us through the sentences worst of our prose, helping us see in our writing what he sees. When he read to us from the works of accomplished writers or our classmates, there was only one discussion question: \"What do you notice?\" Verlyn was also ever-available, whether in office hours or by email, to assure us in very concrete ways that we could do whatever we were trying to do, and that we should give ourselves time and space to do it. I have learned that I can create a space where writing feels easy. This class leaves me feeling not only better at writing, but better at thinking. And way better at connecting the two. I also find myself beter able to interpret art, a task that has always made me nervous. Now I just ask, \"What do I notice?\"",
    "Class discussions. And reading each other's papers.",
    "The cohesiveness of the assignments, readings, and in-class instruction. I enjoyed the selections we read and the challenging aspects of learning to improve as a writer--including facing the potential of weekly humiliation when errors are pointed out in front of one's peers.",
    "Writing was tremendously good for practice, and deconstructing sentences with Verlyn. It was great to go through the few, selected, really good readings, and hear the rhythmn in them. His comments on our work were really useful when they were detailed, if a little hard to read.",
    "I loved this course. It was great to be in a class where the whole point is to become a better, clearer writer. the fact that the pace wasn't overwhelming was really helpful. Writing and getting feedback every week was also really helpful.",
    "The weekly writing assignments were fantastic ways to practice what the course was teaching and get more comfortable with other people reading my writing.",
    "The absolutely uniqueness of this course - I was introduced to new prose and assignments. I was taught to decipher writing in a new way - look at things from a new perspective. It helped me understand not only what the piece was about, but also how the author was feeling, or what his\/her intentions were for conveying certain information and inducing particular feelings for their readers."

   "comments": [
    "More workshopping. Not Klinkenborg's fault- he had to admit more students then he would have liked, which made him have to change the course focus.",
    "I think this class ran pretty well. I would encourage the use of the classes V2 portal for the weekly submissions.",
    "I wish we'd worked on at least one piece in greater depth. Everything was a short, one-shot deal. I wish I could've brought at least one piece to a more whole, developed stage.It would work to choose one piece and rework\/rewrite it for another week. Instead, we produced something new every week.",
    "The course could have benefited from additional \/ more lengthy readings, and more variety in class structure. Readings were for the most part read aloud in class, limiting the incentive to invest time in reading outside of class. It also would have been incredibly helpful to see one piece through further revision and improvement-- in other words, to go further into the writing process with one piece, and perhaps create something that is 'ready for publishing'. While I have no doubt that the Prof. Klinkenborg would have supported us if we chose to do that on our own, he never asked us to revise a piece or incorporate his suggestions.",
    "while i appreciated the consistency in class format, it would have been nice if there were some differences each week in terms of approach, presentation\/discussion style, so that it would be more clear how we were building skills",
    "I think maybe a *tad* too much time is spent reading other students' sentences in class. That said, I understand why this is done and do not think it should be eliminated. Maybe just spending 15 minutes less on this would free up time for discussion elsewhere.",
    "The course was a bit big, and while I appreciate being let in, it would have been great to have a varied format for workshopping and social interaction, so I got to know other students better. It would have been good to revise at least one piece, and to vary the format of the class from week to week, so that we weren't always doing the same thing. I don't have a lot of concrete outputs from this class, although I think it was good for me. Mostly, I just got that I need to keep working on it.",
    "It would be great if giving feedback on the writing of others was part of the course (e.g. providing written commentary on other student's writing). This would be a good way to get more advice and input on our written work.",
    "I think I would have used different techniques or chosen more personal topics for my prose if I did not submit many of my pieces to the entire class (although I know we were not obligated to do so). Maybe we could choose 5 or so of our assignments to send to the class - and have students make comments. Also, I think it would be good to allow some pieces (maybe a few the instructor chooses) to edit\/re-write."

I feel my writing advanced throughout the semester and has improved significantly. This is one skill I'll cherish for life. This course provides you a skill to apply on the rest of the program.",

    "Although the goal of this course was not focused directly on scientific writing, it allowed me to decipher unfamiliar writing categories, which I feel I can now apply to many new genres. With this broader experience, I feel more comfortable reading and understanding writers with different backgrounds. For example, those without scientific backgrounds discussing scientific issues. Now I understand how I may better read their views and extract some of their feelings\/justification behind issues presented, without feeling so \"offended\" or confused."

I was glad a course was offered that was not focused directly on scientific writing. I think there is too much emphasis on scientific writing (e.g., experimental research, lab reports, etc.). However to advance in any career, it is beneficial to learn to write with a more \"public-friendly\" voice and to understand many new types of prose."

You workshop 2 or 3 students' pieces every week.It's as challenging as you make it. Verlyn will help you work on whatever you want to work on in your writing. He is such a mentor - astute, attentive, supportive. And writing every week (in a very different way from in other classes) is such a good exercise. Keeps your prose - and imagination - in shape.NB: You write something new every week. \"Revision\" (ie, handing in a second version of a piece) is not a regular part of the class. So by the end of the term, you'll have a collection of short (possibly half-baked) pieces that probably need some help. I wish I'd had more time to develop each piece.",
