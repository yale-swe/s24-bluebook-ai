   "comments": [
    "Fantastic. It's nice to have a class where class time is actually beneficial, and not just tedious. The assignments, critiques were well thought out and nicely presented.",
    "I would certainly recommend the course to a student with interest in taking basic visual arts. It has certainly impacted my aesthetic tastes and sensibilities, making me more discerning about the visual world.However, I would warn that the long critiques will get boring and tiresome, and if you are not invested in any of the assignments, they will feel like BS.",
    "Art 132 is a great introduction to graphic design intended for both art majors and non-art majors. The first half of the semester you design by hand (not on computers) and there's a lot of cutting and paper involved. The second half of the semester is more focused on fonts and computerized designing. Julian is the best teacher ever! He's hilarious, give great feedback on all your assignments, and isn't too harsh in his critiques. The class itself can be a bit boring--it's basically a 2 hr critique twice a week. But it's well worth it and definitely recommended!",
    "Yes take this class! It seems like a lot of work at first, but it gets better. It can get tedious cutting stuff by hand. Computer things start halfway through. I learned a lot in this class. Be prepared to sit and talk about compositions on the wall for hours though. Julian is a funny and insightful guy. I liked him a lot and enjoyed having him as a teacher.",
    "great art class. lots of weekly hw but manageable during finals\/midterms. interesing work and teaches you to use photoshop and indesign!",
    "You learn a lot about the important elements of graphic design and make lots of cool, individual projects personally.",
    "Intro Graphic Design is a great course. However, be aware that you will not come out of it knowing how to use computer programs to make graphic designs. Instead, most of the course is focused on manual work (meaning x-acto knives and xerox machines) and all of the projects relate to visual composition. It is reasonable to assume that you will spend about 10 hours a week working on projects outside of class, although that number does fluctuate a bit. I thought that course was great and I really learned a lot about the way that I look at things and the way that things are composed.",
    "Yes. It's a ton of time and effort (and hunting down good xerox machines), but I really appreciated everything I got out of the class. This isn't a class you can really slack off in, because it's super noticeable when you put your work up next to everyone else's. But that usually motivates you to work harder for each new assignment.",
    "This class is work-intesive all semester long. You have to commit to doing quite a bit of work outside of class. That said, it is by no means unmanageable. In fact, I found myself looking forward to doing my homework for this class because it was a nice break from the reading, paper writing and problem sets for my other classes. The work requires you to think in a different way than other classes allow. For this reason, I would recommend the class to anyone interested in graphic design who is also looking to round out their semester schedule.",
    "Intro Graphic Design was a fantastic course. I absolutely loved it, especially because of the small class size and the personalized feedback. Julian was a great professor, very knowledgeable and approachable. He was always willing to talk to students about any concerns they had with their work. I truly feel that I learned a great deal and can apply it to other design-related work I do in the future. If you are involved in publications at all, or anything related to design, I would highly recommend taking this. Even if not, it's still a very refreshing course because it teaches you to think in such a radically different way than, say, a science or social science course.That said, don't think that just because it's an art class it will be an easy A or a class not involving much real work. You have to put in a LOT of time perfecting each weekly assignment, because we spend 2 hours twice a week critiquing everybody's work. You don't want to be that person who obviously put in no time. I would recommend not doing it as a 5th class.Take it though!! One of my favorites at Yale so far.",
    "Intro Graphic Design is an extremely enjoyable class--I looked forward to it every week and feel that I learned a lot over the course of the semester. Interestingly, the first half of the class is manual graphic design. We used X-Acto knives, rulers, and cutting boards, which was extremely time consuming but also incredibly fun. The second half of the semester switches to digital design, using Photoshop and InDesign (note that you're expected to already know these programs--there are only 2 short tutorials given in class). The class assignments were very diverse, which I really appreciated. I felt that I was able to build on my knowledge\/skill set, while at the same time developing new skills with each project. I loved having Professor Bittiner--he was very funny and kept class entertaining. He was supportive, but also didn't hesitate to critique our work, giving very valuable and constructive advice."
