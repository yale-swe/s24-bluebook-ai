   "comments": [
    "Excellent. The common readings and associated discussion were superb, and I appreciated the opportunity to produce a substantial research paper on an area I cared about. I would highly recommend this course.",
    "Political Leadership is a fascinating and engaging course which addresses the many important questions of leadership in a political environment. I feel that my knowledge of leadership and my writing skills have improved tremendously in this course. I highly recommend it to any student.",
    "If you are passionate about the material, take this class. It will be challenging, there is a lot of reading, but the material is extraordinarily interesting. The class is hard in the sense that it all comes down to writing one paper throughout the semester. Plan well, read a lot, and come in with a solid person you are interested in studying.",
    "Should not be offered as a writing credit (beware the disinterested students this label attracts). But it is fun to spend a semester on the final paper. And there's no more eminent professor to work with than Skowronek.",
    "Great course! Professor Skowronek delivers an extremely helpful mini lecture on the readings for each seminar that really clarify their theme and contribution to the study of political leadership. Workshops were also helpful, and just getting to read the work of others is a great way to learn and improve on one's own writing. The experience of working extensively on a single research project is a daunting and rewarding one. Professor Skowronek is very helpful in his paper feedback and during office hours."
