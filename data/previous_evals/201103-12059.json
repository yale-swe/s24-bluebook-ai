   "comments": [
    "Take this only if you're going to major in electrical engineering. Otherwise by a hobby kit to learn about electronics.",
    "The tests were harder than I had expected based on the problem sets. However, they are worth very little (all three combine to make up 24% of your final grade). The labs are very easy to get 100% on and are also worth 24% of your grade, so they are a very helpful grade booster. Overall, the class was a good class and not too difficult to receive a good grade, and TP Ma is a very good (and pretty funny) professor. You probably won't take it if you don't have to, but if you do, it's a pretty interesting class.",
    "Electrical Engineering 200 is strange. The book is involved. The lectures are very easy. The homework is easy. The quizzes are very easy. And yet, the tests run the gambit.Also, I wonder why an engineering course would have no calculator tests.",
    "A good class that is cumulative from an understandable textbook. TP is a good teacher that enjoys the material and knows it, while also finding a way to keep class relatively light. He gives very good, brief spiels on what it means to be an engineer, like our ability to approximate while scientists go for the exact, that are nice to hearin the intro classes as they assure your sense of place.The workload isn't too bad with a manageable problem set each week and the 6 (7ish) labs that are extra class time but are also a nice boost to your grade and are fairly instructive.",
    "Take it with TP Ma only if you have to. The course material has the potential to be interesting, but some of it isn't covered in lecture (mostly because he takes 1 hr and 15 mins to cover something that could be covered in 40 mins). This makes the p-sets more challenging than they ought to be, because you're stuck teaching the class to yourself.",
    "This class teaches you how to analyze circuits. If you are interested in this kind of analysis, then it will be a rewarding class. I'm not sure how useful the class would be if you are not an EE or MechE major, but I know that I found it very interesting, and the concepts learned are enlightening, considering the importance of technology today.",
    "I would summarize it as a burden to get through to become an electrical engineer in this institution. I would definitely not recommend it for someone who is thinking about taking this course outside his or her major requirements.",
    "Even though required for EEs and MechE Abets, it is a great class and certainly worth it.",
    "I would not recommend it for a non engineering student, but it definitely taught me the basics for modern electronics and computers.",
    "Yes. Highly recommended. The course is very thorough and I learned a lot about electrical engineering.",
    "This course is a basic introduction to circuit analysis, and it pretty straightforward. The book is excellent until the final few topics, so you must seek guidance in order to do well on the final. However, I thought this course was manageable with my junior year mechanical engineering requirements and would definitely recommend it to any student with an interest in the subject matter. It was a class that I thought I was going to dread, and ended up being one of my favorite classes this semester.",
    "Hard class. Has a mandatory lab that you don't get credit for, and I didn't know about until I was already in the course. TP Ma is the greatest teacher ever though.",
    "It is a lot of circuits.",
    "For a major requirement, it's fine. The subject matter is interesting and not to difficult. Professor Ma, while a very nice man, lectures far too slowly, usually meaning you have to teach yourself out of the book to complete the problem sets. The added lab session is a bit of a pain while you're there, but worthwhile in retrospect.",
    "Yes, very interesting material but be prepared to put in A LOT of work. 10+ problem sets, 3 tests, and a final exam.",
    "Solid course on introductory circuit analysis. Doesn't use any differential equations.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student because everyone should have a basic understanding of this material",
    "While some people say this class is easy, those people usually have experience in circuits or physics. Seriously consider taking this course AFTER you have taken phys 181\/201, even if you're EE. Having taken E&M will seriously help you with this material.",
    "This is a pretty decent intro-level class. The class moves relatively fast but you can definitely keep up if you go to lecture and do all the work. I found the material interesting and this is good foundational stuff to know.Prof. Ma is pretty good, he tends to make weird jokes which make the class interesting.",
    "It is a really good introductory class, specially for prospective electrical engineering majors!",
    "TP Ma is a boss and you will learn plenty about circuits if you aren't afraid to teach yourself a few things along the way. The three tests given before the final are reasonable and the grading is lenient. Don't base your decision to do electrical engineering off of this course.",
    "This was a great course. It was well-taught, and I learned a lot about electronics. I would recommend this to another student who is interested in electronics, or has to take the class. It's definitely a doable class. The work is very reasonable, and if you work hard you will get a good grade. For a freshman looking to take this class make sure you have a strong physics background, otherwise you might be better off taking that. Last, Professor Ma is an awesome teacher. I loved going to lecture to listen to him. He is smart, funny, and interesting.",
    "It is a very interesting course that gives a good introduction to electrical engineering and basic circuits. I thought the lab was very helpful and gave some good hands on experience working with electronics. I thought the tests were very challenging compared to the assigned homeworks and readings but the class was good overall."
