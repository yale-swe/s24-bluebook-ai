    "Yes, if you're willing to put in the work.",
    "Great class if you want a small seminar about the history of cancer or biomedicine, but be prepared for a lot of work! The readings were really eclectic and interesting--I looked forward to doing them every week--but they were long and did not get shorter when we were working on our final research papers. The format was readings, weekly short reading responses, class discussions, and a 20 page final paper.",
    "This course will open your mind to new ideas about health and illness. It will challenge your ideas about how history and science are constructed. It will challenge you to read, write, and think in a new critical way. I highly recommend this course for all students interested in these fields.",
    "This course is fantastic. The readings were a little much in the beginning, but the professor took the time to evaluate our responses to the workload and to adjust it accordingly. And goodness, I don't think I have ever learned more! The seminar was a ton of fun and class went by quickly for being so long. Granted, you really need to be interested in the History of Medicine to find the class as great as I did. The only thing I would improve is the way in which grading is done. We have no idea of how we are doing grade-wise until... well... I still have no idea. Regardless, I feel I have come out of this class with real skills and knowledge. It's rare I say it and mean it.",
    "The class is a very good overview of the social and political aspects that affect cancer. You learn a lot about cancer that doesn't fit the inspirational pink-ribbon mold, and it's a good class for people interested in the history of cancer. That said it's very demanding, a lot of work, so if this is going to be your 5th class, I wouldn't recommend it that way. It's hard to keep up with everything, it's about a book a week, and sometimes the material is very dense. This is probably expected of a junior history seminar. You do a lot a lot of reading, which Professor Scheffler did decrease later in the semester, but it's very hard to do all the reading. The reading responses and essays are relatively harshly graded, but Scheffler puts a lot of advice for improvement. If you're willing to work for it, and don't have that hard of a courseload, I'd definitely advise taking it, especially if you plan on working in the field of cancer (medicine or research)."
