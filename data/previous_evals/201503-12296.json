    "This course is amazing. It takes such a nuanced look at the body and what the body represents and what it means. Dean L did a great job teaching this class and making it interesting. I was able to take a class while at the same time not having to dread going to it.",
    "An amazing class if you can get into it! A very chill discussion each week about the readings & topics for the week, covering things like: body as property, consent, pregnancy, gender, disability, end-of-life decisions, cannibalism, zombies, etc. It was a relaxing and safe space to talk about things, and Dean Lizarribar is so kind and great at leading the discussion along. Also you get a WR credit? incredible. Absolutely take this class!",
    "This class was a fascinating exploration of the ways in which the body is portrayed and conceptualized in different laws and literatures. The work load was very reasonable, and though the reading was often quite long, we didn't always get to all of it in class, which meant you could really focus on the readings that interested you most. Dean L is an incredible instructor and really cares about her students, which makes the experience of taking the class very intellectually fulfilling. Would absolutely recommend taking this class!",
    "Dean L is wonderful and makes even zombie movies sound like incredibly rich and meaningful narratives. The readings are substantial, but, since Dean L allowed us to turn in our two papers whenever worked best for us, the class was less work than anticipated. It could be frustrating that many people did not engage with the class, making it at times slow. However, overall would recommend.",
    "This class is epic. You talk about all kinds of interesting things, from rape law to abortion to disability to physician-assisted death to cannibalism to zombies. It will blow your mind while it is happening and open it up afterwards. I really see things differently for having taken this class!",
    "A fun, enjoyable class on everything from reproductive rights to cannibalism and zombies. TAKE IT absolutely if you can!",
    "YES! Take it!"
