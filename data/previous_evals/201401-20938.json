   "comments": [
    "Best class at Yale, hands down. If you are interested in the premise of the class (natural products from Amazonian endophytes may have interesting and novel activity), definitely take this class. However, don't get lulled into a false sense of a security during the first few weeks; although you'll have almost no work at first, the course more than makes up during the last few weeks when the lab component kicks in.",
    "Absolutely take it if you have the chance. The trip alone is an unforgettable experience, but the rest of the class is amazing as well. You'll learn about all aspects of the research process and have lots of practice developing interests or ideas into projects. You are allowed quite a bit of creativity for the big assignments, so they require a lot of thought (get started early!) but they are very rewarding.",
    "Best class a Yale. A trip to Ecuador and summer research. The professors become family and the class is so close. The professors are so helpful and nice. the work isn't too intense, but when big projects are due it's a decent amount. Getting to work on an original project is an amazing opportunity.",
    "Definitely take this course. Life changing.",
    "YES. 100%. The people on this trip are phenomenal and I can't wait to spend the summer with them! Also I'm learning so much about different scientific fields and I know this summer will be a fantastic learning experience in the lab. Do be warned that you will spend a lot of time in lab after you come back from Spring Break. Also on assignments, they definitely pick up.",
    "REAL is a once in a lifetime opportunity. That does not mean it is for everyone, but I think a wide variety of people would enjoy and benefit from the course. The trip itself was life-changing, the research guidance is top-notch, and the resources provided are unparalleled in comparison to other undergraduate biochemistry\/biophysics programs. Definitely take this course if you are willing to work hard, learn a lot, and have fun doing it. This is the first course at Yale I am categorizing as 'Excellent.'",
    "This class is literally a once in a lifetime experience. I'd have to agree with some evals though, and say that it isn't for everyone. Everything up to the trip is light-hearted and relaxed, and the trip is amazing--but there is a good amount of work to do, and fieldwork can be annoying, especially in the rain and mud and being attacked by mosquitoes. But after the trip is when the real work begins. After spring break, I think I put in an average of 7 hours per week in the lab. The instructors are amazing, and they really care, so I would recommend that everyone apply. As long as you're willing to put in the work (including your summer), you'll be rewarded.",
    "One of the coolest classes offered at any university anywhere. Obviously the spring break trip is amazing, but what should most excite you about this class is the potential to discover a totally new organism and\/or compound and the chance to cultivate your very own research project from beginning to end. If that's not what attracts you to the course, then the 10+ hours (some of which may be in the dead of night) a week you'll spend in lab during the weeks following spring break will probably make you miserable. This class is by far the most time-consuming one I've ever taken, but it's been worth it to me. The first half is pretty chill, but from right before spring break until the end of the semester, it becomes a totally different beast. Take this class if you're looking for a place for your scientific curiosity to thrive and if you're willing to put in the work necessary to achieve that.",
    "TAKE IT! IT WILL CHANGE YOUR LIFE!",
    "A truly incredible experience, and I can't express properly how grateful I am for the opportunity to explore, research, and learn with such a top-notch group of instructors and classmates. Run, don't walk, to sign up for this class, and keep your fingers crossed until you learn whether you're accepted. Workload-wise, it does get a bit overwhelming right before spring break and for the month or so immediately after, so don't overload your schedule if you plan to take this course.",
    "If it's offered again, definitely take it! We haven't started research yet but the class and the trip were amazing. It's a completely unique opportunity to develop whatever kind of research project you want, not to mention explore the Amazon and do really cool field work. The semester starts off very relaxed and then the work piles up a lot starting from right before spring break to the end, so be prepared for that. Also be prepared to spend a lot of time outside of class in lab after spring break - I think the syllabus says 4-8 hours but I definitely spent 10-15, if not more, for at least the first few weeks after we got back.",
    "This is the best class you will ever take. The trip is obviously incredible, and will fundamentally change the way you think about biology, but REAL is so much more than that. You basically get to take ownership of a scientific project, from deciding your collection theme to collecting your target plants in the field to processing them in the lab to designing your bioassay. You will learn SO MUCH, but not in an orgo-lab kind of way where you'll synthesize some chemicals only to throw them out at the end of the day. In this class, you're not just going through the motions of science. You're doing something that might just have real world implications, and will certainly add to the body of knowledge of a vastly-underexplored area of biology. Plus, the professors are all awesome, and your classmates probably will be, too. I can't think of a better way to spend a semester and a summer.",
    "This is an amazing course! You learn so much about how to develop and conduct research, and you're given opportunities that you couldn't have possibly imagined. This has definitely been my favorite class at Yale. Although it is a fair amount of work, and although you have to commit your summer to being in New Haven doing research, it's all 100% worth it. I've become so much more confident with my abilities to design an experiment and justify why it's beneficial and feasible, and I've learned research techniques that will be useful throughout my life. You should without a doubt take this class."
