    "I would definately recommend this class if you're interested in understanding management schemes as they relate to the environment and the complexities thereof. Professor Fotos does a great job facilitating conversation and guiding you on your final paper.",
    "Yes definitely. Be wary it less about \"democracy\" versus \"authoritarian\" methods of dealing with environmental issues, but more of a look at institutional design principles. Prof Fotos is great just make sure you do the readings to avoid his wrath."
