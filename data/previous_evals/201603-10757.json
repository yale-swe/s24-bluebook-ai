   "comments": [
    "I have a better grasp of how to read Shakespeare and feel more familiar looking for and analyzing rhetorical techniques, literary style, and thematic concerns of his works.",
    "The paper assignments helped me practice new ways of close reading the texts. In general, the class taught me that there always exist layers of interpretation and possible meaning.",
    "I expanded on my ability to close read and analyze literature effectively.",
    "The course covers a full breadth of readings and interpretations in Shakespeare's major canon.",
    "I learned how to deal with immense amounts of text, and I covered enough Shakespeare that now I've read almost the entire cannon. That's pretty damn cool.",
    "I became acquainted with Shakespeare's most important histories and tragedies. I learned how to read Shakespeare effectively, and I learned how to write an academic argument about Shakespeare. I have become a deeper thinker and have developed a more profound appreciation for language because of this class. I have also learned how exciting puzzling over big academic questions can be.",
    "I gained a better understanding of Elizabethan England and how Shakespeare's historical context influenced his plays. In reading the plays I became more familiar with Shakespeare's often difficult language and was able to write about the plays with greater skill. In each lecture, I found Professor Kastan's perspective on the plays to be informative and often eye-opening. I feel more capable of discussing and thinking about Shakespeare thanks to this class.",
    "How to think about difficult texts, craft literary arguments, etc.",
    "Close reading -- on a micro level.",
    "Shakespeare Histories and Tragedies was one of the most engaging English lectures and lectures for that matter that I have been in at Yale. Touching on themes from revenge to love to the very essence of what it means to be a person, the course addresses many of the big questions in life all while linking it back to the plays we read in class. On a more technical level, you'll definitely improve your close reading and understanding of Shakespeare (3 papers, one's a \"manic glossing\" exercise that's unorthodox, but the other two papers are pretty navigable). Readings can be overwhelming as well if you don't keep up, but you definitely get quicker at reading them as the course progresses.",
    "I took this course hoping to have some fun reading some good plays, and I accomplished that goal! Seeing the early copies in the Beinecke was a great experience, and learning then and in class about the different ways people have modified and edited Shakespeare was fascinating.",
    "This course improved my critical reading skills, particularly of Shakespeare's unique writing style. The variety of essay prompts also exposed me to new approaches to essay-writing, most notably the idea of \"manic glossing.\"",
    "I read a lot of Shakespeare. It was great. I thought critically about big questions raised by literature and life, and honed my critical reading and writing skills, and produced several more pages of decent but unremarkable academic prose. I wish that I'd had the time to put more time into itI would have happily read each play twice before lecture, and once more after, but I couldn'tin which circumstance I'm sure I would have gotten twice as much out of the course, but as it stood, still it was an excellent experience.",
    "I had never taken a class devoted entirely to Shakespeare before, but I was already familiar with many of the texts and ways to analyze his plays. The most notable thing I got out of this class were new interpretations of the texts. I was also given a number of questions that encouraged me to think about the plays I was already familiar with in a different way.",
    "Gained the critical analysis skills to read Shakespeare",
    "Gained an appreciation for Shakespeare that I didn't have in high school.",
    "This course gives students a terrific crash course on the great works of Shakespeare and provides excellent insight to the plays.",
    "With the completion of this course, I can proudly say I have read most of Shakespeares canon. Professor Kastans lectures also gave me insight into the richly complex world of Elizabethan England, and the Elizabethan theater scene. I learned that Hamlet is what happens when you go home for the holidays and Julius Caesar is what happens when you refer to yourself in the third person. Finally, and most importantly, this class reaffirmed something Professor Kastan stated at the end of class: Shakespeare doesnt teach you what to think, but what to think about, and in that way, he can save your life.",
    "I have a better understanding of the original context of Shakespeare's plays, how they were published, and how they might have been performed. I also developed my critical analysis, reading, and writing skills. It was also really entertaining.",
    "Prof. Kastan's course gave me a first gateway to Shakespearean writings, and by the time it was over, I felt able to read and analyze pretty much any of Shakespeare's plays. Prof. Kastan has a unique and wonderful way of teaching textual attentiveness, reflected in his assignments and lectures. This kind of close reading can very well be applied to modern texts as well, so it was a great gift to be able to learn from a such a great (and patient) reader."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Kastan is an amazing mind. The pacing of the class works very well. Despite its structure as a lecture it still feels like an intimate and engaging environment to discuss the text. The assignments were sometimes difficult to understand and not well structured over the course of the semester, although they did force us to think in new an interesting ways. Sections were abnormally small (around 6 people) and discussion became awkward at times in such close quarters.",
    "This course perhaps moves a little too fast to be able to give each play the attention and enjoyment it deserves. The sections could have been more standardised in their administration, as some were clearly much more demanding and stringently graded than others.",
    "There was a huge amount of text, but I knew that this course would have to be more of a survey than a close-reading exercise.",
    "This course had a very fair amount of reading and writing assignments. It was not particularly stressful, but it required a lot of intellectual engagement. I got more out of the course when I had more time to do the readings. I wish we read one or two fewer plays so that we had a full week to do Antony and Cleopatra or Coriolanus.",
    "I don't know if Professor Kastan always had the most interesting things to say about Shakespeare, simply because they were often so obvious. I'm very glad I took this class, but it felt a little dumbed down compared to the ENGL 200 course I took last year with Professor Manley. Additionally, while I enjoyed the lack of technology use in class, next year having a projector (just for putting up images or quotes) would be helpful. All in all, this is a really solid lecturer course, and it's the backbone of the department. Kastan clearly enjoys teaching it, and I don't think much could be altered. I have a few suggestions below: -spend longer than one lecture on Antony and Cleopatra! -use projector slides (or have more handouts with quotes so we don't have to skim in lecture) -go deeper into the plays than just cursory descriptions. Assume the students have actually READ and UNDERSTOOD the play, and skip all the plot summary and get to the meat of the lecture. If we don't read, that's our fault not yours. -be more open-ended with the last two essay prompts",
    "Strengths: entertaining lectures, great reading list Weaknesses: section sucked (50 minutes is not long enough to discuss a Shakespeare play), sometimes the lectures went long (and I had a class right after) Improvements: make section an hour and fifteen minutes. that's the only way to have a meaningful discussion.",
    "Could be improved by allowing students to choose their own essays, allowing them to be longer, offering more sophisticated discussions. A major weakness was that the course almost compulsively avoided any discussion of any female characters -- even lady Macbeth and Cleopatra received zero attention. The lectures, while engaging, were often fairly repetitive and spent a lot of time just praising the text.",
    "The course was very engaging especially the lectures. Some of my classmates, however, found that the prompts on the essays were sometimes vague and hard to write.",
    "The lectures were fantastic and section was very engaging. There weren't really any major weaknesses in the course.",
    "The strengths of the course is that you are able to engage with many of Shakespeare's greatest works and Kastan's lectures are incredible. I think the down-side of the class is that some of the assignments are very difficult for students with no experience in theatrical or English analysis at the college level.",
    "The lecture is great, because it is really valuable to hear an expert's thoughts on the plays before discussing them as a section. This format actually worked much better for me than a seminar would have. It would be nice to get more time for assignments. I know Professor Kastan did not want us to spend too much time on them, which is why he released them only a week prior to their due date; however, the assignments' weeks often coincided with other big projects, so I would have appreciated getting the prompts a little bit earlier and having the opportunity to spread out the work and put more time into the papers.",
    "The strength of the course is in the medium sized lectures and the strong section discussion. Unfortunately, the large number of plays sometimes make in depth discussion of a single one impossible.",
    "The course operates pretty smoothly at this point: two 50 minute lectures and a 50 minute section per week. While of course, the primary weakness is that lecture focuses solely on the professors opinion, there are still sections so that the students can analyze the text with each other.",
    "You get to read great plays and benefit from Kastan's incredible knowledge about and personal history with them. Weaknesses: section.",
    "Professor Kastan's lectures are engaging, and I really liked how he doesn't allow laptops in the class. Everyone seemed more attentive than in any of the other lectures I've had. He does a great job of introducing students to a variety of interpretations of the plays, but perhaps more importantly, he teaches you how to read and appreciate Shakespeare. That being said, the essay prompts are kind of weird. But you can always meet him (or your TA) to talk about it, which I highly recommend.",
    "The frontal lecture is extremely engaging and very well balanced with the course's sections, which allow the students more room to speak, ask questions and engage in active discussions. Such a well-thought class, taught by such a caring and experienced professor, has really very few to no weaknesses."

   "comments": [
    "For anyone looking to fulfill a pre 1800 credit or just to get more Shakespeare in their lives, this is a great course. Kastan is incredibly engaging and insightful, and while your writing experience will depend on the TA, Kastan's lectures alone can still help one to read and appreciate Shakespeare in a new way.",
    "Yes! Professor Kastan is amazing!!",
    "Anyone with a passing interest in Shakespeare should definitely take this course. Kastan makes it interesting and relatable, whether or not they are english majors.",
    "Professor Kastan is a wonderful and generous teacher. These texts are probably best experienced in a seminar setting, but this course is a phenomenal chance to expand your reading experience and learn with one of the greatest academic in the English department.",
    "Yes! It was great to have such a comprehensive review of text that matters so much to me.",
    "This is the perfect course for anybody who wants to familiarize themselves with Shakespeare or challenge themselves intellectually. Your thinking will be stretched and you will grow so much as a scholar and a person in this class. Kastan is one of the best professors at Yale and his course is not to be missed. Make sure to take him up on his offer for coffee -- it's the best part of the course!",
    "This and ENGL 200 on Comedies and Romances should be must-take classes for anyone who is serious about the English major. Professor Kastan is such a unique character that (as with most classes) his personality makes the class enjoyable. He's super friendly, loves meeting with students, and knows a lot about the field. If Shakespeare scares you, this class will make you more comfortable with the greatest the English language has to offer. Invite your non-English major friends to take this class too!",
    "If you're looking for a more engaging way to read Shakespeare than Kastan will absolutely give it to you, I was not at all a fan of Shakespeare before taking this class but I got some great tools for reading and understanding the plays that I'll use going forward",
    "Yeah, I would. It's not often that you have the opportunity to read about 15 of the greatest plays ever written over the course of a semester.",
    "I would not recommend this course to an English major after their freshman or sophomore year. The class is good for a survey of Shakespeare's plays, but it doesn't require incredibly rigorous engagement with the works. There is little room for pursuing your own interests.",
    "Shakespeare Histories and Tragedies was one of the most engaging English lectures and lectures for that matter that I have been in at Yale. Touching on themes from revenge to love to the very essence of what it means to be a person, the course addresses many of the big questions in life all while linking it back to the plays we read in class.

Readings can be overwhelming as well if you don't keep up, but you definitely get quicker at reading them as the course progresses.",
    "I would strongly recommend this class! Kastan is a deeply knowledgeable and often delightful lecturer, and the reading list is, unsurprisingly, excellent. (Without this class, I never would have believed that Shakespeare's histories can be as engaging as the tragedies!)",
    "This is a must-take course for anyone remotely interested in Shakespeare. It's a fantastic selection of plays taught by a world leading expertProfessor Kastan is an absolute delight and one of the smartest professors at Yale.",
    "YES take this course with Professor Kastan if you can. He is a phenomenal lecturer, always gives a clear and interesting reading of the plays, and shares his enthusiasm for Shakespeare's works. While taking this course, Professor Kastan convinces you why it is still so important to read Shakespeare, how the plays relate to our lives, and how they make us think in unique ways about the world. I would highly, highly recommend you take this course if you have the chance.",
    "Histories & Tragedies is an excellent course. Professor Kastan is an excellent professor his humor is what it is, and his catchphrases age over the course of the semester, but he is a genuine, intelligent teacher whose readings of the plays have much to add to your own. DO take him up on the offer of coffee: he will pay, it will be charming and good conversation.",
    "Yes, yes, 1000X yes. If you're even remotely interested in Shakespeare take this class. You will read a lot of plays and will leave with completely different perspectives on the plays you read and thought you knew in high school.",
    "Kastan is amazing- take the course just for his lectures and especially if you want a great Shakespeare course with a low workload.",
    "This class is really nice for someone who wants to \"rediscover\" Shakespeare, or gain a more in depth understanding of why his work is so famous. Very engaging lectures, which help you to understand the content in a way you probably didn't in high school.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this class to anyone looking for a great intro to Shakespeare or English majors looking for a pre-1800. It ultimately is a survey, so should be considered thus.",
    "Yes!! This class is a wonderful pre-1800, and of course an obvious choice for any Shakespeare lover. Professor Kastan makes every lecture worthwhile, blending his humor, knowledge, and subtly complex analysis. The assignments are reasonable (3 papers and a final), and the reading is enjoyable.",
    "You can't--and shouldn't--complete the English major without at least one course focused on Shakespeare. This one has all the strengths you could reasonably expect: Kastan is brilliant professor with a pretty inexhaustible store of knowledge, and he's great at getting you interested in and excited about the material. But the course, as a lecture, also has the weaknesses you'd expect, or the one notorious weakness: section. It was usually unfocused, overly general, and our meetings didn't build toward anything over the semester. Another thing to consider is your course load and extracurricular schedule. Paper assignments are given about one week in advance, and if the subsequent week is a busy one for you, you just have to settle for writing a lackluster paper. Overall, I'm glad I took this class for the background I got on these plays, as well as for the chance to think deeply about Shakespeare's language.",
    "If you want to read Shakespeare, take this class. Kastan is excellent, and very friendly and cool, and will teach you tons about Shakespeare, England, and close reading. Our section discussions were also very lively and helpful, but this of course depends on your TA. The plays of course are awesome- and for every single one after lecture I appreciated them so much more.",
    "Yes! Whether you're an English major or not, this is a great survey course of Shakespeare's tragedies and histories. Don't skip the readings or there's literally no point in taking it. It's fun! Professor Kastan is an amazing lecturer and person, get to know him.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to anyone who is interested in reading Shakespeare."
