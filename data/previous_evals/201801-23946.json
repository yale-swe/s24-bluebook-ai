   "comments": [
    "amazing",
    "Reasonable amount of workload, really interesting topics",
    "In terms of material addressed, I learned a lot in this class. However, Dr. Ginsberg tended to go on tangents during class into his own experiences. Although this was interesting and I think worth hearing at times, it made it very difficult to understand the overall picture of risk assessment. In the future, I would like to see this class with a little bit more rigid structure, both in the syllabus (clear directions for each assignment and when they are due), as well as in lecture (provide an outline of what is to be covered, key points you want us to take away). Also I think it needs to be recognized that individuals take this class that are outside of EHS, and thus, it is not ok to assume that everyone has a background in this material (some things may need more of an explanation and abbreviations on the lecture slides are unhelpful). Additionally, I would have liked to have more in class activities as a group working on calculations for dose and such (not just having Dr. Ginsberg solving it on the board).",
    "It should not be a course for non-EHS people. Those who were not in EHS were at an extreme disadvantage, and I find it unfair that due to scheduling, I had to take Risk Assessment as opposed to an easier or more general EHS requirement course. I don't think I have really learned much from Risk Assessment, and I most likely won't use this in the future.",
    "I think it is better to assign some weekly homework for us to review the knowledge points on time. If not, we cannot well understand and keep all of the knowledge points in mind on time.",
    "Materials could be more in sync with each other, but overall a lot of useful tools were learned.",
    "Strengths: - great if you're an EHS student Weaknesses: - didn't learn much, if at all - I still don't know what a risk assessment really is - Quizzes and exams did not align with learning material Improvements: - Don't include it in the list of courses that can count for general EHS requirements. And please follow the syllabus.",
    "Terrible for non-EHS students. STAY AWAY unless you want to feel like you're perpetually lost and wasting your time.",
    "Very detailed explanation of this subject, with plenty of real-world examples",
    "I was expecting so much more from this class, but at the end I feel like I still don't really know what risk assessment is. Or how to properly carry one out in different scenarios. I was never motivated to pay attention in class, especially since the syllabus basically changed from week to week... I wish we had more \"homework,\" or things to do that complemented what the (confusing) lectures were about.",
    "Strength: -Interesting material and great to have a professor with so much real life experience Weakness: -As an supposedly introductory course, it covers a lot of EHS material that is difficult for non-EHS students -Not enough practice for test questions, would like to have some homework to teach us how to do it",
    "The course was pretty disorganized from the beginning, I was not sure what the assessments were until about halfway through when the syllabus was revised. I felt like I would have gained more from the class if there was more active participation and maybe optional assignments or practice problems given throughout the semester rather than just the term project at the end. It was mostly lecture style teaching and I think there could have been more engaging ways to teach the topic.",
    "If you're interested in the topic of risk assessment, this is great. If you're taking this just for the requirement, maybe not.",
    "Strength: Can get to know the principles of risk assessment. Weakness: Too much details for students not major in environmental health",
    "The lectures were not well organized or planned. They should have been succinctly focused on a topic and shown how it plugs in to risk assessment. The slides were confusing.",
    "very poorly structured",
    "Important topic but could have been taught in a more concise format. The powerpoint lectures could have been better organized and key topics such as calculating risk could have been more clearly explained. The student presentations were a great learning opportunity.",
    "-This class was disorganized and did not follow the syllabus. The assigned readings did not match what was taught in class, which was frustrating for students who were actually trying to follow the syllabus and readings. -The exams were mostly regurgitating class material and did not require much critical thinking -I would have liked some problem sets\/homeworks along the way in order to practice the quantitative aspects of the course material. -The class has the potential to be interesting, but I think the focus on memorizing acronyms and other random facts was not useful"

   "comments": [
    "Instructor: Gary Ginsberg \u00a0amazing",
    "Instructor: Gary Ginsberg \u00a0Dr. Ginsberg is really engaged, very knowledge on this subject, and receptive to feedback. Great instructor.",
    "Instructor: Gary Ginsberg \u00a0I think Dr. Ginsberg did a decent job teaching this class. He is obviously very knowledgeable and has a lot to offer YSPH. However, his class was disorganized and changes were made in regards to assignments (like the night before the midterm) that made this class a lot more stressful and challenging than it need to be, given the material. However, overall it was obvious Dr. Ginsberg attempted to make us the best risk assessors possible.",
    "Instructor: Gary Ginsberg \u00a0I think YSPH should have provided him with more context of the kind of students he would be teaching and provide him with resources to be a better instructor. He was always nice though and seemed to change the course depending on the needs of the students. The thing that bothered me most was his assumption that we all had some level of risk assessment background and the fact that the syllabus would frequently change in the beginning.",
    "Instructor: Gary Ginsberg \u00a0He is good.",
    "Instructor: Gary Ginsberg \u00a0Could improve slides, change up the two-hour course to include group discussion\/work. Add office hours.",
    "Instructor: Gary Ginsberg \u00a0Ginsberg is brilliant and clearly knows a lot about toxicology; however, he is one of the worst instructors I have ever had in my entire life. He assumed we knew certain biochemical pathways and chemicals and made students who didn't know those (aka every non-EHS student) feel incredibly inadequate and confused . He also did not abide by the syllabus and was not clear in his directions. He would change what he had previously said last minute, and it was just incredibly frustrating to be in his class. He also did not give timely feedback. For example, the syllabus mentioned a final group project as one of our last assignments. When asked about the group sizes, he adamantly stated that it had to be an individual project. He then emailed us a couple of days later to say that we can either do the assignment individually, or we can do it in groups of three. When we did our presentation before the final paper was due, he didn't give us a lot of feedback before we had to do the write-up, and we never really knew how we were doing in the class grade-wise.",
    "Instructor: Gary Ginsberg \u00a0Ginsberg is a prominent professional in his field; however, he doesn't know how to teach a course while meeting the needs of students who have no prior exposure to his field of work. There are many chemicals and biochemical concepts he brushes over in class, and he uses a lot of acronyms as if we're already professionals working in toxicology. However, I took this course because it was the only EHS core that fit into my schedule. If we weren't pushed to take all of our core requirements the first year, I would have dropped out immediately and saved myself so much time and frustration. Ginsberg rarely follows the syllabus (i.e. he added in a quiz by surprise and turned a group project into an individual project then later changed his mind and said it could be an individual OR group project) and set very unrealistic expectations for the course. He also doesn't give good timely feedback. By the end of the semester, we only had 5-6 lecture powerpoints, as it took about a month to get through Lecture 1's powerpoint. And each week he would upload a new version of the powerpoint, so there wasn't a lot of good continuity.",
    "Instructor: Gary Ginsberg \u00a0Very knowledgeable on this subject. Introduce us so many examples and facts",
    "Instructor: Gary Ginsberg \u00a0Super smart, but I think he wasn't able to make the material palatable for non-EHS students. He obviously knew the field very very very well, but translating it to a intro-level, core course wasn't his forte, I think. Still, he was very responsive to email and that was helpful.",
    "Instructor: Gary Ginsberg \u00a0Strengths: -Great at responding to emails regarding questions Weakness: -Would have been nice to have a consistent syllabus throughout the entire semester",
    "Instructor: Gary Ginsberg \u00a0He is very knowledgeable and a very dedicated teacher. Fortunate to be in his class.",
    "Instructor: Gary Ginsberg \u00a0Dr. Ginsberg is very knowledgable on the topic and is great at answering questions on just about anything risk assessment related. I think his lecture style can be a bit hard to follow at times when we do go off on some tangents. It would also be more engaging if the class wasn't solely lecture based.",
    "Instructor: Gary Ginsberg \u00a0The instructor needs to understand the importance of syllabus. A syllabus is a contract between the instructor and students and not only was he not familiar with his own syllabus, he gave a revised version only a week before spring break.. He is very knowledgeable on the topic but he needs to receive a formal training on teaching.",
    "Instructor: Gary Ginsberg \u00a0I think his slides can be more detailed to help students which are not familiar with the toxicology and environmental science to understand the concepts.",
    "Instructor: Gary Ginsberg \u00a0The lectures could have been organized more efficiently. Fewer interruptions of student presentations would have been appreciated.",
    "Instructor: Gary Ginsberg \u00a0disorganized",
    "Instructor: Gary Ginsberg \u00a0Seems really knowledgeable and was approachable. Lectures could be improved with more organization and structure. Powerpoint presentations could be better formatted and designed to more concisely explain concepts.",
    "Instructor: Gary Ginsberg \u00a0Great. Patient and nice.",
    "Instructor: Gary Ginsberg \u00a0Dr. Ginsberg did not seem to enjoy teaching the class and as a consequence it was difficult to be engaged and interested in the material as a student. He did not convey enthusiasm for his profession or the subject matter. His focus was on memorizing acronyms and that sort of thing, rather than teaching an analytic and thoughtful approach to risk assessment."

    "amazing",
    "Great course for toxicology minded students.",
    "I would recommend this class if you want to learn a broad amount of information for risk assessment and get exposed to environmental health. I think the class has the potential to be great, if changes are made in terms of making it more organized and including class activities that provide opportunities to carry out portions of risk assessment (instead of just having us do one big risk assessment in a paper).",
    "I would only recommend this course to EHS students or for those particularly interested in risk assessment, so maybe CDE students as well. Otherwise, this course was a waste of space in my limited classes I get to take during my two years here. It is unfortunate that this class is on the EHS core requirement list. It should be taken off for next year.",
    "If you want to do some research work which is correlated with environmental risk assessment, I recommend you to select this course, if not, I do not recommend you to select it.",
    "Only take it if you're an EHS student. If you're looking to learn how to do a risk assessment, I would suggest taking this course after taking other EHS requirements. Would not recommend to any non-EHS students.",
    "EHS students would love this. If you don't have a strong background in chemistry\/biochemistry, I would stay away, especially if you're not in EHS.",
    "A good choice for not EHS major student as well",
    "Don't take it, unless you already have a background in toxicology and want to work in the field. Otherwise, it's not terribly useful (you don't learn how to apply skills in risk assessment).",
    "I would recommend this course to another student if they were planning on going into a field that required heavy risk assessment knowledge as Dr. Ginsberg knows a lot on the subject. If someone were planning on taking this out of interest I would not recommend it as it could be more engaging.",
    "I hope the instructor can give us second thoughts (like relevant textbooks) on the topics",
    "No",
    "great subject, very poorly taught",
    "This course teaches an important topic but was made more difficult by the lack of teaching clarity and overall organization of the course. This course is harder than the average course at YSPH.",
    "Yes. It's important for EHS learning."
