   "comments": [
    "This German course really covers all the introductory grammar. It surveys a lot of essential vocabulary and really builds conversational skills. While the talking exercises are minimal they really help you understand how to pronounce things. I'd recommend this course for anyone who thinks that they'd enjoy learning a basic level of German.",
    "YES",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. Alex is very laid back and is reasonable when it comes to work load. You have to do a lot of the grammar studying outside of class, but that was typical of most german classes. If you take L1 german, definitely take it with alex.",
    "This class definitely takes work...as do all language courses. You have to really stay on top of things, especially with the online workbook assignments. Those take quite a long time. But otherwise, the class is wonderful and German is a great, if complicated, language to begin learning.",
    "I would absolutely recommend German to anyone who can't pick a language. The classes are a lot more personal and laid back than both Spanish and French. German is a wonderful language and I recommend that anyone looking for a language credit or anyone with even the slightest interest in Germany should take this course.",
    "Intro German course.",
    "Yes, it's not too hard and a lot of fun.",
    "German 110 is not an easy course, but it is very well taught. Alex Gardner makes what could be a very tedious language fun.",
    "Yeah! If you need to fulfill a language requirement, German has a light workload and is fun. If you've already fulfilled the requirement and just want to learn German, again, don't hesitate -- it's a really easy and enjoyable fifth course, especially with Alex.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to any one. Don't be intimidated by a new language, either. All the instructors are accessible and make the language fun (Alex Gardner is the best, though!).",
    "German is definitely tough- don't think that learning German will be easy just because learning other languages was easy for you. It's a different grammatical structure, sound and feel. Honestly, I suggest taking German if you don't speak any other language besides English since German is closer structurally to English than other basic romance languages. That said, L1 is structured at Yale pretty well, just be prepared to wrestle with articles!"
