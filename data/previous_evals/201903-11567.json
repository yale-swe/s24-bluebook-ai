   "comments": [
    "Learned about the collective action problems that face the government today and the institutions that facilitate the solutions to these problems. Deeper understanding of the dynamic of American government and the powers of each branch.",
    "The collective action problems faced by American politics and how our institutions overcome them",
    "This class was a really great introduction to political science and was explored through the lens of collective action. Before taking the course, I had not read political science studies-- the class provides a great setting to learn about how to conduct real political science. The focus on the bureaucracy in this class was particularly interesting as well.",
    "I learned a lot about the foundations of political science. I feel like I have a good sense of how political science approaches modern political issues.",
    "American political system",
    "This course taught me how to really engage with political science theory which I'm sure will be super helpful going forward. I also gained a super extensive understanding of the American political system.",
    "I gained a lot of the elemental knowledge of political science and how the American political system came to be the way it is today.",
    "This was my first exposure to the structure of American Politics and I learned a lot. I learned about the ulterior motives and unstated agreements that run elections, reelections, the bureaucracy, and the executive. I also benefitted from reading the papers assigned.",
    "I learned about the history of the Constitution as well as our civil rights and liberties. Much of what I learned is applicable to daily life, and that's what made this course so valuable.",
    "I learned how to skim readings to simply get the key pieces of information. Also, I think I learned how to make deeper connections between different concepts of political science.",
    "I developed a fundamental knowledge of our political system, how it was created and how it changed over the course of time.",
    "I developed a foundation of knowledge involving the organization of America's political system in its earliest years, and the ways in which it has changed since its founding. The class' writing prompts for papers were quite interesting, and helped me discover successful methods to conduct a successful paper in the field of political science. Often, I found topics so interesting I was ultimately eager to converse about what I had learned to both friends and family.",
    "I really liked how this class incorporated aspects of current political science research into a general study of American politics. Each lecture had a very distinct topic with a lot of information, which I think was helpful to allow the students to decide what direction they'd like to take within the political science department. I learned how to thoroughly analyze texts and think critically about politics from this class--very important skills needed in the current political climate.",
    "Very basic intro to American Politics. If you took AP government you will know a lot of the material, but the readings are very interesting and you get an introduction to scholarly work",
    "I learned a lot about the development of the United States government, its basis, its beginning, the parts at work now, etc. I learned how to evaluate government and government officials, and how legislation should be administered and created, and how the behind the scenes of politics works.",
    "Having taken AP Gov in high school, I do not feel like I learned a lot of new information in this class although it was a good review of the material.",
    "Having never taken a government class in high school, I learned much about politics and the three branches of government plus the media and the bureaucracy (among other institutions). I learned what political science and politics is, and got a glimpse of what it would mean to be a political science major. I improved my writing, specifically argumentative writing. I learned to read political science readings efficiently. I got faster at reading.",
    "I learned about the field of political science, particularly how political scientists approach research and major theories of poltical science.",
    "I learned some of the basics of the American political system that filled in some gaps in my knowledge.",
    "I learned a lot about the unseen details of American government.",
    "I learned to think like a political scientist",
    "An ability to dissect political readings.",
    "A basic understanding of american politics",
    "I learned the basics of American politics. I also developed skills needed to read and interpret political science research.",
    "Great intro to the American political system. Not only do you learn about how the government was designed to function, but Professor Kinane did a fantastic job of always incorporating context into our discussions.",
    "Gives you an overview of the American political system, with more depth in important areas. Also teaches you how to read political science literature.",
    "I gained a basic understanding of the structures of the government and of the American political landscape and their foundations. This course focused on creating a deeper understanding of the reasons and logics behind the structures and patterns of the government and politics. I also got better at reading social science research papers.",
    "I learned a significant amount about the political system as an institution and the role collective action has in the political process.",
    "Understanding what political science entails and how government functions."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: relevant readings that helped to understand material and discussion sections were very helpful Weaknesses: lecture slides were too fast and not posted to Canvas entirely",
    "The professor was engaging, weekly quizzes ensured I didn't slack off with readings, assignments were interesting.",
    "She really wanted us to do well in her class and learn which made it a really good experience.",
    "Strengths: interesting research was presented, nice class format (midterm, short essay, final paper\/final option), engaging professor, discussion sections deepened insight into the class Weaknesses: discussions on how to understand the statistics presented in political science research came later in the semester",
    "Strengths - introduction to political theory, exciting and thought provoking studies Weaknesses - not that challenging, spent a bit too much time on specific studies",
    "The quizzes were kind of unnecessary and there were a couple times I did the reading and didn't even get the quiz right. I think it's good to encourage attendance and doing reading, but the quizzes just caused unnecessary stress sometimes and weren't necessary. Also, there was so much material on the slides sometimes I didn't have a chance to write it all and then not all the slides were filled out fully online. Professor Kinane is awesome though and really wants you to learn and is always willing to read rough drafts, etc. and give feedback.",
    "Strengths: The course itself allows for you to get out of it what you put into it, if you do the readings, engage in section discussions, and ask for feedback you'll learn a lot and do pretty well. Also, there were ample opportunities to get feedback on papers before you turned them in which was really helpful.",
    "I think this class could have been improved by having discussion sections that directly address the reading material.",
    "The course has a quiz (almost) every day which is good and bad because it forces you to do the readings but it can also make the amount of work stressful to get through because you know you will most likely be tested.",
    "Strengths: I really liked my TA (Mr. Allison), as he really pushed me to engage more with the material and make deeper connections between different ideas we were discussing in class. If you want a broad \"skimming\" of American politics, this is could be the course for you. There were also 10 pop quizzes throughout the semester, so this forced you to at least skim the readings. Weaknesses: I wish we were able to go more in depth into some concepts, but, naturally, this isn't possible since it's an introduction to American politics. Honestly, I feel like I didn't really learn much in this course, and the lectures were not very engaging.",
    "The strengths of this course are the greater understanding of why the Framers structured American government the way they did, and what events caused them to act in certain ways, as well as how modern dynamics have changed the political landscape over time.",
    "The strength of this course was the ability of Professor Kinane to present concise versions of large amounts of information and textbook readings to help us further understand the readings. The papers we wrote were also a big asset to the class because we were able to bring in topics that we personally found interesting.",
    "Strengths: Not too difficult but very interesting course material Weakness: none",
    "Sometimes the readings were challenging to do properly because they were so lengthy, so the information really wasn't digested. But other than that I thought the class was engaging, and informative.",
    "The lectures were enjoyable and I feel like the midterm and quizzes covered the material accurately and fairly.",
    "Strength--Professor Kinane is a professor who makes class very engaging and fun. She was really passionate about what she did and encouraged participation, even in a big lecture.",
    "Its a lot of basicsI understand that it was an intro class but I hardly learned anything.",
    "The strengths are that the information is presented in a clear and organized way. The tests\/assignments were not too difficult and provided a lot of freedom so you could focus on topics you wanted. At times especially at the beginning the class was a little slow and was pretty much review from American History\/Government. I also would have liked to focus more on the readings adn research we covered, as this was often glossed over.",
    "Overall concepts of American politics and government.",
    "The difficulty level of the class was all over the place. I understand the reading quizzes, but I didn't like them. They could be improved",
    "Covers a lot of material.",
    "Section was my favorite. I do wish there had been more reinforcement of the material throughout the course though.",
    "Great course!",
    "it was a little basic but well taught",
    "The amount of reading was a little extreme and perhaps more than necessary to understand the course material.",
    "The lectures were always engaging and interesting. I felt like the lectures were a bit fast at times because there is just so much to cover, but it was nothing that wasnt manageable if you take notes on a computer.",
    "This course was a very good introduction and made me excited about political science. But, even though it's a survey course, I feel that it could have gone more in-depth at times.",
    "This course could improve in incorporating current events and actual modern-day things to relate readings and theories. I feel like this would help students understand and learn the material in a meaningful way.",
    "I think the biggest strength of this course was how engaged the professor and TFs were with this subject."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, was extremely interesting and the readings were dense but helped facilitate learning throughout the course. Helped to think critically about politics today.",
    "This is a great social science credit if you aren't typically a social science person. Class was designed for you to succeed which was a breath of fresh air.",
    "This is a phenomenal course. It does a great job of teaching fundamental concepts surrounding American politics. Every political science major should take this course! Professor Kinane is amazing!",
    "I absolutely would recommend this course-- it shows what real political science is and what it means to ask political science questions. Even if someone took government in high school, this course presents new ways to explore previously-learned topics.",
    "If you want a real introduction to political science, it offers that. It's not that challenging, though, and a bit too focused on specifics rather than general knowledge.",
    "Yes, it gave me a solid understanding of the American political system and I think that it's really important to learn.",
    "100 percent for anybody thinking of majoring in political science. Even if you're not thinking about political science, you'll learn a lot about government and politics. Also, Prof. Kinane is truly amazing!",
    "I would recommend this course for someone who wants to dip their toes into political science, has some interest in American history.",
    "Yes, good intro to American Politics. I've heard it was similar to Ap Gov.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. The content is intriguing and is useful for understanding many of the ways in which our government works and operates.",
    "If you want to see whether or not political science is for you, sure, take the course. Otherwise, maybe not, as I didn't find the course or Professor Kinane that engaging (even though she is very animated). You can pretty easily skim the readings and still do really well in the class, but it's also not the guttiest of classes, as there are pretty much weekly quizzes to keep you accountable.",
    "Yes, I feel that the knowledge i gained in this class will help me understand politics and our government better moving forward.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this class to anyone who is curious about the basic dynamics of the American political system, and wants to understand how government truly works in the US.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student, especially if he\/she has never taken a government course before. Coming in, I had no knowledge about the government systems and how political scientists studied these systems. The course was very good at outlining further interests that I may have in political science. The readings were also very interesting, especially when they were published by current Yale professors.",
    "Yes",
    "yes. Especially if Prof. Kinane is teaching this. It is a great intro class and won't present too much of a challenge.",
    "Yes, especially for those interested in politics and political science.",
    "I would recommend this course to students who are looking for a very introductory political science class.",
    "Yes, great class!",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who has not taken a government\/political science-related course before, this is a great introduction to political science\/the government. This course might be boring, though, if the content is not new\/not interesting to you since it is a pretty basic overview of political science. I like that many of the readings assigned were by professors at Yale because that provides a good intro to the professors and future political science classes at Yale for the Political Science major. My TF was extremely helpful especially when writing the papers, they gave very specific feedback I could work on.",
    "No, not unless they needed an easy class to fill up their schedule. Its just not challenging or enjoyable.",
    "I would recommend this if they are political science student and need credit for the major, but for others it might be dry.",
    "100%. I loved this class.",
    "It depends on the student. If they need some serious political knowledge gaps filled, then yes, but it is generally pretty simple stuff.",
    "I would recommend this course, it was fun yet challenging.",
    "Yes. It was easy to manage and a great intro to political science.",
    "Yes would recommend.",
    "yes, 100%",
    "yes i would for someone who wants a introduction to politics",
    "Yes! Especially if interested in political science",
    "Yes",
    "Yes, if you are at all interested in American politics, this is a good course for getting your feet wet and figuring out which area is interesting to you.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student interested in politics. But, I would say that the style and introductory nature of the course did make it feel a bit basic and unchallenging at times.",
    "Yes especially if interested in studying political science."
