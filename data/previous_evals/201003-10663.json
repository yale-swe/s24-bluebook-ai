   "comments": [
    "I would recommend HIST 740 to any other Americanist--particularly to first-semester students. I couldn't have imagined a better research seminar to start off with.",
    "I would recommend this class for anyone looking for a new research topic in the area of Western History, whether he\/she intends to work on the project after the conclusion of the seminar or not. It is almost entirely research\/writing-based, so be prepared to spend plenty of time in the archives!",
    "If you are interested in exploring the American West and are interested in researching unseen documents, take the class. The books we read at first were at times insightful; meeting with professors who turned their dissertations into a book was inspiring.I would not recommend the class based on lack of critical engagement, laissez-faire attitudes from teachers and students, an atomization of history to tiny particularities that may not further knowledge.",
    "Great way to dive into primary document research with great access to the Beinecke. Faragher and Miles are incredibly helpful and want your stuff to get publish. If you choose, they will help you every step of the way until your paper gets published. That's commitment",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to a fellow student; it will at the very least encourage them to think about their note-taking and research processes, re-evaluating them with an eye to the increasingly larger projects grad students undertake after completing coursework.",
    "I would definitely recommend it as a wonderful opportunity to explore the West in depth along enthusiastic counterparts.",
    "This class is strong in teaching you note-taking systems to prepare you for orals and your dissertation, especially for History students. While George Miles and John Faragher are open to interdisciplinary studies, the sort of research processes taught in the class and the kind of writing that is encouraged is rather squarely historical. As the class played out this semester, there was very little time spent workshopping classmates' work, leaving one last marathon-length class where we gave feedback to one another, one at a time, in front of the entire class, with the professors giving the last word of evaluation on each paper. Very little emphasis throughout on what makes for good historical writing, only a public assessment at the final class about whether you'd achieved it or not."

   "comments": [
    "By luck of my own research topic, I don't think the course contributed to my dissertation. But it did allow me an opportunity to become more familiar with a few archives, to become more comfortable with the basic techniques of social history and narrative writing, and to wrap my head around a large historiography with an eye for making a contribution--all of which has been profoundly helpful in shaping my knowledge of the profession, andin contributing to my own growth this past semester. Johnny and George: thank you!",
    "As I masters student, I began this course with only a peripheral knowledge of Federal Indian policy during the Jacksonian era. Having chosen a research topic in that area, I became much more familiar with the essential scholarship. I also improved my skills as a researcher, while learning the ropes of important note-taking and bibliographical software such as Zotero and Filemaker Pro. After taking this course, I feel one step closer to being fully prepared to enter a PhD program in the near future.",
    "The course was most useful as practice, rather than as conceptual preparation. That is, what it taught about how to do research was its greateststrength.",
    "It did not contribute to my dissertation work. Knowledge of the profession was learned in the way fellow academics approach history. Also, the class reflected the sensibilites of a certain type of historic project. That was informative.",
    "This course definitely helped me grow as both a researcher and a writer and gave me a great foundation for future projects.",
    "I felt that this course was able to contribute significantly both to my knowledge of the discipline and to the preparations for my dissertation.",
    "I look forward to revising my work in the future.",
    "This course was most helpful in providing a platform for sharing and experimenting with research methods and software. I feel much more prepared for a longer research project in all aspects of the process, especially organizing notes.",
    "This course made me think hard about getting into the habit of meticulously taking notes in a way that would preserve them for orals, a dissertation, and posterity. That was very important. Also, good tidbits throughout the semester about how to go about publishing papers. This course, however, did not focus on improving students' writing or teach us to craft a historical argument any differently."
