    "The course material was fun, but the class should definitely be taken seriously. I would recommend it. It's a great seminar.",
    "Awesome material, no other class really lets you think this freely",
    "Take it. great seminar, not too much reading",
    "Radical California is a great class for pondering interesting happenings in California's history. Expect a lot of reading - but interesting readings, if a bit disconnected. Don't expect to gain a working knowledge of California history from this course, but do expect to examine some far-out movements and ask pertinent questions.",
    "A very good amstud\/er&m seminar with a really awesome professor.",
    "Radical California was a wonderful class. The readings we did were always enjoyable and engaging, and Master Pitti helped move discussions along so that we really got the best possible information from them. At first, I was intimidated by the number of history majors in the class, but part of the reason why this class is so great is that it is filled with people with a number of interests coming from a number of perspectives. Definitely recommended!",
    "Take the class, great material, great teacher, great thesis for the rationale of the class."
