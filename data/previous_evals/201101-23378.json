    "I thought some of Chuck Peters' lectures were fascinating; others, however, just incorporated far too much common sense learning. I think that Chuck's experience is valuable, and he's got extensive knowledge of the literature, but sometimes his way of breaking down silvicultural treatments got to be a little bit rote and simple.",
    "As a researcher and practitioner, Chuck is really good at weaving together multiple disciplines and personal experiences to make his points. Lectures help to illustrate what forest management looks like, feels like, and implies for community members in parts of the tropical world. Readings were very good and helpful to understanding core course concepts.",
    "Q 9: Was not able to attend field trip so cannot comment.",
    "The course is very helpful to understand the importance of traditional management systems. Understanding them is crucial to design and implement successful projects that involve development or sustainable use of resources.",
    "This is a important and must do course to anyone interested in Tropical forest \/ or management",
    "Excellent class. Essential for students with tropical interests.",
    "This was the best class I have taken at FES. The instructor clearly is a founder and leader of his field, and conveys this amazing excitement and intellectual passion to his students in every lecture. He clearly sees a need for this field to grow, and we drank the Kool-Aid. This class was so important for one, because it offered a concise and essential history of resource use in the tropics - from a forest management perspective - and at the same time introduced management concepts that aren't taught in any other class at FES (and according to Chuck, probably very few places anywhere).We wanted this class - we nagged for this class, and I am extremely grateful we had the opportunity to take this class. It provided a way to combine my social science background with my long-standing interest and work experience in conservation of tropical landscape and my current focus on tropical forest management. It provided a theoretical underpinning to my work, and it focused my attention on the key questions I would like to work to answer. I loved many classes at FES, but before taking this class, it seemed like I was oscillating between so many different interests. This class really helped ground me and enabled me to focus my career interests and plans in one coordinated direction.I think in part this is due to the intensity and passion of the instructor - I can imagine the same class being taught by someone lackluster to turn out to be awful. We students of the class would see each other around campus and talk about how much we loved this class, and how key the instructor was for the learning experience. We are very, very grateful that he was willing to take the time to commute to New Haven, and to teach us all semester long. Thank you!"

This is the only lecture class I have had at Yale that is not completely dependent on Power Point, making the knowledge transmission process much more effective (at least for me). The instructor's personal experience and deep knowledge of the subject matter was evident from his lectures.I appreciated discussion of specific trees, plants, crops, and crop sequences as well as description of silvicultural processes. The class did a great job of linking the social and ecological elements.",

    "A field trip to the NYBG should definitely be built into the course!",
    "Chuck's responsiveness to students.",
    "It would be great to see outlines of Chuck's lectures occasionally or to think about leaving more time for discussion of major points at the end of class rather than throughout when it provided a distraction. I also would have liked more time to think about issues of scale,governance and global applications in the last few lectures.",
    "The organization of the classes, they should folloe an axis",
    "The field trip was a student-led initiative and was a great experience. It would be great if the field trip is included as part of the course.",
    "Three hours can be too much. Need better structure to accomodate lectures.",
    "It needs to be taught again, and it needs to be more clearly described in the course handbook, and the online course listing. I appreciate that the instructor wanted a small class which helped us maintain an active and lively discussion, but I spoke to so many students at FES over the course of the semester who would have loved to take the class but weren't aware it was offered, or didn't have a clear understanding of what it entailed (and how it was different from, say, a purely social science or silvicultural approach).For the field trip (which was an excellent learning experience), it went really well for a student-run, first time trip, but there definitely are improvements that could be made to future trips. The students should be assigned preparatory readings by the professor - not by other students, there should be an orientation session with someone knowledgeable about the area, maps and basic geographical and cultural information should be studied beforehand, and a good basis for forest management history and how to assess quality of forest operations should be part of the field trip. Our route could be mapped out in GIS, with added layers of hurricane impact, human population growth, deforestation pressure, overlap with Mayan population, etc. to create a clearer image of where we were on each stop. The trip was fantastic - these ideas would just help ground the participating students a little more and help create a better understanding of the basic context (and save time for more questions about the management systems)."

    "It's good!",
    "Very helpful for understanding the way that traditional knowledge informs natural resource use, and the ways that western or conventional silviculture might benefit from traditional practices.",
    "Indigenous silviculture is essentially the subject matter I came to Yale to explore through my research, but I never expected there to be a class offered in it. This class absolutely overlaps with my interests, was an excellent survey of the topic, and was invaluable to how I think about my research. I am extremely grateful that Dr. Peters agreed to teach this course and that Yale maintains a relationship with the New York Botanical Garden. I think it is vitally important that a top forestry school is offering courses in \"non-conventional\" forestry practices, and I believe that some students experienced significant shifts in their understanding of what silviculture is and how to engage with it. I sincerely hope that future students will have the opportunity to take this course.",
    "This course should be part of the basic curriculum, to everyone interested in Tropical forest, management.",
    "As I stated before, this was the key course in the curriculum for me. It provided the only in-depth, interdisciplinary engagement of silviculture and social sciences, as applied to specific management systems while not losing sight of the larger questions of tropical resource management. It provided a framework to my (seemingly) divergent interests and gave me a work plan for how to combine these interests in my further research and career. I don't anticipate turning into a Chuck Peters, but what I learned in this class really furthers my career philosophy and provides me with a theoretical justification for integrating concern for the community with concern for the resources. I can't get myself to take Dove or Carpenter classes - they seem miles and miles removed from actual management concerns. The classes they teach are fundamental and extremely important for a lot of people, but this is the ONLY class that combines the study of the actual silvicultural operations employed by communities with a study of forest ecology, with a study of community resource management and use. I certainly left with may open questions, and am not by any means sold on Chuck's worldview. There are still many issues he dodges, and he is quite good at deflecting hard questions. But the class made us approach resource management questions in a new light, asking a specific set of questions about actual management without forgetting about the motivations and interests of the actors involved. I just wish there was an advanced version of this class, or just more class sessions, to discuss in more detail some of the overarching questions on how to move forward, what research needs exist in this field, and how to engage in research on questions about dynamics and impact of external factors.Chuck to me is so much more convincing than pure social scientists because he addresses the actual forest use and impact of management on forest ecology. He's well-grounded in theoretical ecology, while having enough field work street cred, as well as humility (at least in regards to communities), to really provide a meaningful integration of the disciplines. Few others can do that, which is why I always felt that social science research wasn't getting to the real point - actual sustainability of resource use. I think that's why we all loved this class so much (and we did - we kept telling each other so all semester long)."

    "My only critique is I would have wanted more intensity, more readings, etc. I did audit the course, though--which may have meant my experience was different than those actually taking the course for credit. One thing I really appreciate about his teaching style is it's Socratic, almost, in nature. Every time he poses a hard question for the class, it engages us more with grappling with the material. Rather than tell us, he invites us to posit hypotheses--which I appreciated far more than discussion-based courses or strict lecture-based courses. Got us thinking like ecologists and social scientists! I loved the small size, as well. Wish that auditors could also go on the field trip--there's so much to learn from an experience in the field with regards to this material!",

    "Since we don't anticipate Chuck to teach this class again until 2013, there needs to be some kind of mechanism of letting students know of this potential class. This is an amazing opportunity, but only if 1) there is a core group of excited students that really wants this class, 2) the instructor is excited about teaching it, and 3) FES knows it exists and students show up. We only found out about it through our trip to NYBG. If Chuck can be convinced to come to FES to guest lecture in another class, or speak at an event (which I am surprised he does not do, since he is so passionate about the subject matter and the need for dissemination), and generally engage with the school on a slightly more regular schedule, it would help create a core constituency for the class. Please - there are so many students who should be learning this. Most people planning on working with tropical resource management really should learn this stuff. It opens up a whole new area of inquiry, and teaches true interdisciplinary thinking.Thanks so much to Chuck for agreeing to teach this class - and to Mark for helping talk Chuck into teaching it, supporting it at FES, and for helping us finance and organize the field trip. This has been great."
