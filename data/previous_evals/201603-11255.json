   "comments": [
    "I furthered developed my mathematical skills that had been previously acquired in Math 120 and Math 222. I learned the basics of writing a good proof, and felt that my reasoning skills, and my desire to question basic premises got stronger.",
    "Taking MATH 250 has given me a deeper understanding of multivariable calculus and, in addition, has allowed me to significantly develop my ability to read and write proofs.",
    "Higher-order derivatives and integrals, manifolds, a bit of topology, a bit of real analysis and a bit of linear algebra.",
    "I learned a ton about how to generalize concepts in math to as many dimensions as I wanted. It was very interesting to see how the formulas and theorems I had been learning since high school are all related.",
    "Achieved a much better understanding of math and learned to really appreciate the beauty of mathematics.",
    "generalized multivariable calc to n-dimensions and learned some analysis; got better at writing and doing proofs",
    "The structure and theory behind MATH120 topics is basically revealed in this course, so if you want to know why calculus does what it does, this will tell you a lot of that.",
    "Fun class",
    "Proof writing and attention to the details in theorems improved. Also understanding of taking basic calculus and applying it to n-dimensional vector spaces.",
    "I gained an introduction to abstract math, and I refreshed my skills in multivariable calculus and linear algebra.",
    "Lots of math - too much math",
    "This was my first introduction to \"real math\" if you will. Thus I was exposed to mathematical theorems, definitions, and using them to right proofs. In addition we did do some more \"computational\" problems but the emphasis was on theory.",
    "I developed a deeper knowledge of multivariable calculus and linear algebra.",
    "Combined knowledge in Linear Algebra and Multivariable calculus to build an understanding of how to integrate and differentiate in higher dimensions. Introduced new like the exterior derivative and pullback to study Stokes' Theorem.",
    "Taking limits (especially using epsilon delta methods), differentiation and integration.",
    "Through this course, I gained a better understanding of vector calculus, or the integration of multivariable calculus and linear algebra; as well as a better understanding of aspects of higher-level mathematics, including set notation and proofs.",
    "This course helped me learn some basic information about vector analysis.",
    "Better understanding of the limits of calculus learned in other classes and how to generalize those results so that they are useful in many dimensions. Some better understanding of how to structure mathematical proofs. Much better understanding of open\/closed sets, even though we didn't spend a lot of time on them.",
    "This course is a great culmination of both multivariable calculus and linear algebra, and does a lot to increase the level of mathematical maturity",
    "math skills",
    "In Math 250, I gained a more theoretical, deep understanding of multivariable calculus beyond what is presented in Math 120. The course was a mix of theory as well as problem-solving techniques. The primary insight I gained through this course was the depth of problems and topics in multivariable calculus that are not discussed in Math 120, such as integration over manifolds and a more rigorous version of Stokes Theorem.",
    "Math 250 helped me develop some basic intuition for some deeper areas of math (the \"analysis\" part), while also really explaining the mathematical motivation for the generalized versions of the many things taken for granted in earlier calculus courses (as fundamental as differentiation and integration). Also, General Stokes' Theorem (taught near the end of the course) blows my mind and the long process of building up to it over the semester really became worth it after that."

   "comments": [
    "The material for this class is quite interesting and enjoyable. I felt that at times, the material on homework was somewhat out of touch with material covered in class. Other than that, fantastic course.",
    "I think that this course was very well-organized and well-taught. I would not recommend making any changes to MATH 250.",
    "Very little support was a big weakness. Also the lectures did not supplement the homework very well. We did lots of proofs in the class but they never showed up on exams.",
    "I wish Professor Casson had more materials to be reviewed for exams, such as practice questions. Studying for the two midterms and the final exam was very disorienting. There was a large discrepancy between the types of problems asked in the homework and those in the exams.",
    "Great class. Possibly more section times and more accessible office hours",
    "Professor Casson is a clear and engaging lecturer, which made the abstract parts of the course easier to understand. I did feel that the proof-iness in our psets dropped off during the second half of the semester.",
    "The course covers the material, but it didn't do so spectacularly. Most of the exams felt like they didn't fully test one's conceptual understanding of the material, being mostly computation instead.",
    "Precise and brilliant professor, but lectures slightly dry.",
    "I appreciated the extent to which the professor and peer tutor made themselves accessible to students. I would recommend that, moving forward, solutions to the problem sets and exams be posted online.",
    "Strength - the peer tutor was amazing. Predicable and we know what the expectations are. Weakness - no TA, no solutions to the homework to provide feedback",
    "I feel like I've learned a lot, but sometimes I was just very confused, especially in class and starting the first couple of questions on problem sets. I think this course could benefit by spending more time at the beginning teaching students how to write a good proof because I struggled with that a lot, and I still don't think my proofs are very clear.",
    "The sections for this class were enormously helpful for my understanding of the homework and also for the concepts we learned each week.",
    "The course is a good introductory survey of manifolds and higher dimensional calculus-- you will leave with a better grasp of the material and its justification than from 120. However much of the material is presented very obscurely and without example application, so study outside of lecture is very necessary.",
    "There could have been more emphasis on teaching us how to write proofs and how to understand it. Many math classes jump right in without telling you how to correctly do the problems\/write the proofs. Since this is the first \"real math\" class for many students, time spent teaching us how to do real math would have been helpful.",
    "Great material, problem sets, professor, and textbooks. No way to improve it.",
    "Very well taught and material was also very interesting.",
    "For strengths, I would say this course is well rounded when it comes to subject matter. We covered a lot of topics fairly thoroughly for the course length and class period. For weaknesses, though, I'd say the explanations of some of the topics were very vague and I feel like we did not spend enough time on the literal interpretations of them, instead spending times on proofs that did not help in either homework or tests.",
    "Strengths: clear lectures, an excellent peer tutor, and fair, reasonable exams. Weaknesses: lack of practice material to prepare for exams, lack of answer keys for exams, homework did not receive enough weighting grade-wise relative to their demandingness.",
    "This course moved at a very slow pace, and it focused more on using the theorems we learned than on understanding those theorems well. However, it was a reasonable workload, easy to follow, and Professor Casson was very available to his students.",
    "Kinda made me want to be an English major. The textbook was just OK -- it didn't help with the homework around 50% of the time (random \"Prove this: \" questions abounded). However, Casson is patient and clear. It wasn't as proofy as it was cracked up to be, which was a bummer. I'd rather have each homework be 5 difficult proofs rather than a couple along with 10+ computational problems -- the computations were often redundant, and their presence meant that people (including me) could get away with fudging the proofs, because they didn't count for very much of the homework grade.",
    "it will be nice to have answer key for hw and exam.",
    "The course was well-thought out, and Professor Casson delivered clear lectures. He generally presented the material in a way that was easy to follow, though occasionally lectures did not cover enough of the complexity of the topic needed for the problem sets. Furthermore, I often felt that the bigger picture was often lost, and it was difficult to see how the different pieces of the course were connected. That said, the course was strong overall and its strengths certainly outweigh its weaknesses.",
    "I think that the course does a very good job of providing a rigorous description of most of the wide range of topics covered. Proofs for most non-trivial things are given in class. However, in providing such rigorous descriptions, the examples given afterward are limited and usually the simplest cases, which is often unhelpful if one were planning on rehashing them to do the homework. The homework assignments also quickly become quite slow and difficult to do alone, so the weekly office hours \/ peer tutor sessions become perhaps more mandatory than advertised. I don't think these are necessarily weaknesses of the course as long one is willing to adapt. Also, some of the \"trivial\" things not covered in class are actually a series of trivial steps put together in a non-trivial way, so make sure to verify the things that are skipped make sense.",
    "Find the Shifrin lectures on YouTube. Fun material, can seem more difficult than it really is the first time you learn it. Go to peer tutor office hours, they were helpful and fun!!"

   "comments": [
    "Math 250 was pretty bad. All the topics felt very disjointed and the problem sets were painful with no real guidance. Lectures were also dreadful. There is no question Professor Casson is an incredibly intelligent man, but he is not a good teacher. Even when I went to his office hours I would leave feeling unfulfilled and often more confused than I was when I went in.",
    "If you're taking this class, you probably don't have too much of a choice, but I would recommend it to anyone who enjoyed Math 120. This class expands the ideas covered in Multivariable Calculus to n dimensions and makes for a very interesting class.",
    "I would strongly recommend MATH 250 to any student interested in math and wishing to develop their ability for abstract mathematical thinking. In this course, you will gain a deeper understanding of multivariable calculus and will, more importantly, develop proof-writing skills that will be useful in higher-level math courses. I originally enrolled in this course simply so that I could take MATH 300 in the spring semester--however, I found that MATH 250 was in itself quite a rewarding course.",
    "Take it if you have to. It's a bizarre course that focuses a lot of time on doing proofs in the pests and lectures, but we never learn how to actually write analysis proofs.",
    "This class is a ton of work, but you definitely learn a lot. Prof. Casson is very helpful in the sections (which he himself holds twice per week), and it's easy to get questions answered (which is good, because generally there are a lot of questions on pretty difficult material.",
    "Take this class is you enjoyed MATH 120 or 222\/225.",
    "Pretty much a combination of multivariable calculus and linear algebra, but n-dimensional. If you're into that sort of thing, take it.",
    "I would recommend Math 250. Most of the course is devoted to developing a more general and more rigorous formulation of vector calculus (as covered in Math 120), with the notable addition of manifolds. The last portion of the course delves into the theory of integration over high-dimensional manifolds using differential forms and covers the generalized form of Stokes' Theorem, which is an elegant extension of the classical version presented in Math 120. Casson is an excellent lecturer, and the workload is fair.",
    "If you wanted to take a super exciting higher level math course I would not recommend. But if you want a very useful course which can be applied to many fields then I would.",
    "Yes! Just start early stay on top of the material.",
    "Only if you think you need it. For analysis, you can skip this class.",
    "Read the book, answers the homework problems. This class is pretty self explanatory. Lecture was the book in blackboard form. Review sessions and working with classmates on homework let's this class fly by.",
    "It's a good class and I recommend it, but be prepared to teach yourself material (not because Casson is lacking as a professor, but because there is too much to cover in too little time.)",
    "I would recommend this course if you want to see multivariable calculus in a more general and rigorous setting. Helps one become more comfortable with the concepts of MATH120 and MATH225.",
    "Yes. The material is very interesting. Professor Casson has a deep understanding of the subject and is good at teaching it.",
    "I would recommend this course solely because it is a requirement for a lot of upper level math classes, but not because I found it extremely engaging. If you need to take 300 level math for whatever reason, I'd say take this class, but to fill just an empty slot in your schedule, I would urge you to choose another.",
    "Take it if you have to. Math 250 is a prereq for a lot of higher level material. Otherwise I don't think I really appreciated the material for its own sake. The workload was surprisingly low. Still weekly psets but they weren't at all brutal.",
    "This review is from the perspective of an Econ\/Econ-and-Math major who took Math 250 to prepare for Analysis (Math 300) in the spring. While I have heard differing things about whether Math 250 is actually needed for Math 300, I am glad that I ultimately took 250. It prepares you for the rigor of 300 and introduces aspects like set notation and proofs that have likely not been present in other math courses previously. Prof. Casson is an effective instructor overall, with clear lectures that elucidate the material well. The course is divided into weekly problem sets, two 3-hour midterms of 5 questions each, and a final exam (which was pick 8 questions out of 10). The homeworks were very difficult; expect your entire Thursday evenings to go in problem sets for the course. However, the midterms and final were comparatively reasonable, albeit graded on a very strict curve that gives no room for error. There are no practice exams or other materials to prepare for the exams, unfortunately, but working through past homeworks helps. However, the best part of the course by far was our peer tutor, Andre. His explanations were incredibly helpful in working through the assignments and preparing for exams, and he was very dedicated to tutoring, with extended hours well into the night before homeworks were due. Overall, Econ-Math majors taking 300 in the spring should definitely take this course to prepare. I did (and took it Credit-D-Fail) and have no regrets doing so.",
    "If you have to take 250, then Casson isn't a bad professor to take it with. He moves at a very slow pace, and is easy to understand. He is also very available to his students. He has a ton of office hours and weekly discussion sections to help you on the homework. However, this class can be really boring. It is especially boring if you are a math major and are used to deeply understanding all the theorems you use. This class is more about just using the theorems in a more practical, problem solving kind of you. You do not learn with nearly the same amount of depth as in classes like math 350 or 370. However, it is a very reasonable workload and very fair tests.",
    "If you have to take Math 300 and you have some Cr\/D to kick around, try taking this Cr\/D at first in case it kicks your bum like it did to me. If you think you like math -- TAKE MATH 230\/231. I WISH I HAD. Now, if you've already done 120 and 222\/225 and want to continue in math, you likely have to take this course -- maybe you can talk to students who have taken 300 or 301 and see if they think you could skip 250. Without having taken 300 or 301, I think you could skip this course. Iy doesn't focus on proofs like I thought it would, so what you would be missing you could learn in a few days, max [wedge product, pullback, things like that]. It's not like you'd be skipping out on a semester of practicing mathematical proofs.",
    "A good bridge course between computational and proof-based math. Professor Casson's lectures are always very clear, although the lectures tended to be on the slow side.",
    "yes",
    "This course is a requirement for some majors, and as a required course it is fine. Professor Casson does a solid job and the material was generally interesting. If you dont need to take this course, Id still recommend it if you are interested in building on what you learned in Math 120. Finally, there is lots of support for this class, as Prof. Casson had numerous office hours, sections, and we had a peer tutor, which was also an invaluable source of help.",
    "I would definitely recommend Math 250 to anyone who didn't take the 230\/231 sequence but wants to get a mathematically sound and no-bs introduction to analysis-y math. I think this course is definitely good for those who aren't sure they're mathematically \"mature\" enough to skip to Math 300\/301 etc., and Casson also teaches Math 300, so he definitely tailors both Math 250 and 300 in a way so that they don't make each other redundant. I think I've definitely gained a few new perspectives in approaching math problems in general from the class.",
    "Yes. Will be hard but you learn a lot."
