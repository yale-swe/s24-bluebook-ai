   "comments": [
    "It should be renamed \"Fractal LIFE 101.\" I would recommend it if you could have Michael Frame. And if you are interested in seeing how fractals are everywhere.",
    "Take it 100%. It's his last semester teaching it (Spring '16) so don't miss out.",
    "This is a great class for a non-STEM person. Fractals are interesting, but I found the material confusing at times. Frame is super sweet and very accessible, so he made the class. Sad to see him go!! The homework was short and challenging, but do go to office hours. I went every week and Eva always made sure I did well. The grading can be stressful---just homework, midterm, and final, but it made for work. The tests are open note, but don't let that fool you too much since it's not traditional problem solving. This is a whole new form of math to many, but definitely worthwhile. Take it if you want an easier math credit that doesn't touch on conventional topics.",
    "Here's how I would describe this class. It's like the professor made up his own game of dominoes, then insists on teaching you the rules and counting that as a class at Yale. The course material is so random, it will never possibly apply to your real life, but it is interesting. The classes are long though so don't go, just learn on your own it's much faster. Awesome credit\/d but pretty easy to get an A if you aren't lazy.",
    "Fractal Geometry is a fantastic course. You'll be exposed to a topic and a way of thinking that you've likely never seen before. The units are really interesting and have many practical applications. The best part of the class is Professor Frame. He's an expert in the field and truly a pleasure to learn from. His sense of humor and his beautiful stories made me look forward to each meeting. Ultimately, I definitely recommend that you take this class. In addition to learning a lot about math and fractals, you'll learn more life and the type of person you want to be.",
    "I would recommend Fractal Geometry to anyone, regardless of their skill\/interest in math. One, because it is super cool to be in a class taught by a Professor who helped discover it and also its makes you realize how many things there are in the world that you have no idea exist. It is an honor to be taught by Professor Frame. What I got most out of this class was not the actual information of the course, but the stories that the professor tells about the discovery of the field and being able to feel the passion Frame has for the subject.",
    "Michael Frame is a kind and funny professor who obviously cares about his work, but this course is not as great as it's made out to be. Some of the assignments are painfully easy. I spent less than an hour a week on this class. Wish I had taken something else instead.",
    "If you are intrested in the patterns around you take this class. It is an easy QR and the math is weird and fascination. You will fall in love with Frame and his bad jokes and life advice.",
    "Fractal Geometry is more difficult than I thought it would be: I went to every single lecture and every session of office hours with the TA that I could (for help with the homework), and I still found myself struggling at times to understand the material. That being said, Professor Frame is endlessly kind and willing to answer any questions one may have. If you are willing to put in the effort, I definitely recommend it, as it is a fascinating and entirely unique subject that is related to much more of life than I thought when I first began the class.",
    "Not a complete gut, but definitely manageable. If you attend lectures and make an effort to learn material with the tutor, you will be fine. Open note is pretty great as well.",
    "A good QR, but not as much of a gut as people think it is. The homework is super simple and doesn't take long at all, especially with the course tutor. The midterm and final are open note, but just make sure you print EVERYTHING out. It ALL helps.",
    "I highly recommend this course without reservations. Take it for both the content and professor Frame.",
    "Math 190 was an introduction to the field of Fractal Geometry, which is a relatively newly discovered area of geometry (and in which Professor Frame is one of the first and leading experts.) Homework was very manageable with one short problem set a week, and the midterm and final were very fair. Would recommend.",
    "I would recommend the course to anyone who wants to experiment with a branch of contemporary mathematics.",
    "TAKE IT IF YOU CAN BEFORE HE LEAVES YALE!!! Fractals is definitely meant for a specific type of student, and I loved the course bc my brain thinks in that way but a few of my friends found it unbelievably difficult and weird, so shop it and see if you find it interesting. That being said, take it for Frame. He is an incredible person and will teach you things FAR beyond the scope of the class.",
    "I would recommend this course. It brings new insight into a unique branch of mathematics and geometry that has a huge potential for application to other subjects.",
    "It is an excellent and interesting math class for non-math people who want an interesting math course.",
    "The topics of Fractal Geometry are very interesting, but their presentation in lecture is not compelling and you will spend a lot of time figuring out later PSETs on your own. Also, there's a pretty big discrepancy between the practice tests and the actual exam. Often, an exam will present you with a problem type you've done in class, but of a difficulty level not represented in anything you've seen.",
    "Good class if one has any interest in fractals, or wants a reasonable QR.",
    "It is a great way to explore a groundbreaking topic in mathematics while still being able to survive the workload.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone. It is not overwhelming and is a good class for humanities majors but it is also really interesting and very different from most math classes so I think STEM majors would enjoy it as well. Frame is a super sweet person and his lectures are interesting and engaging.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student, but I recommend you treat this class with the amount of preparation you would give any other QR.",
    "I think this class should be renamed \"Life.\" The things that Professor Frame teaches in this class will change your perspective on life. This course is wonderful and I was impressed by Professor Frame's character on the very first day. He tells jokes half way through each class. They are really bad puns most of the time but you can't help but smile because he loves telling them so much. Take the class even if you don't like math. There is obviously math involved in this course, but a lot of it is stuff you've never seen before and is really fun to learn because they are more like puzzles and less like equations and stuff. And get to know Professor Frame. He is very wise. The course has a pset every week, a midterm and a final. All the notes Professor Frame takes are put on the course website right after class. There is no textbook because the course website has everything.",
    "I recommend Math 190 for anyone looking to get a QR. It is quite interesting and not too difficult overall. Professor Frame's jokes and life lessons are priceless.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to any student with or without an interest in higher mathematics. The material discussed was extremely interesting and presented with the goal of engaging students not raising testing grades. I looked forward to each class lecture and am quite sad to have come to the end of the course.",
    "It is a good math class to take if you aren't studying in a quantitive reasoning field.",
    "The course walks you through ways to look at fractals (mathematical ways--the class is not largely visual). There is no textbook but the website does a good job of summarizing the material. Totally manageable homework loans and fair exams. Go to office hours!!!",
    "I would recommend the class, but I would warn students that it is harder than they have heard. This class can sometimes be known for being really easy, however by second semester it picks up. The calculations and theory start to get much more difficult than the start, however Frame is always there to help and does a great job guiding. As long as you put in work, the class is a great time.",
    "MATH 190 01 AKA: \"Fractal Geometry\" deals with observing and understanding aspects of patterns within space, time, and spacetime. Respectively these represent fractals, chaos, and cellular automata, and each have important real world applications that make this course a useful endeavor.",
    "The course felt somewhat theoretical, and it was a little difficult to understand some of the applications of the content being taught. I would recommend this course for a student if they are up for a bit of a challenge."
