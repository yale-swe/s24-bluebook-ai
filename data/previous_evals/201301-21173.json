   "comments": [
    "No questions asked, apply to this course. If you get in, there really shouldn't be any reason to stop you from taking it. I addition to the access to the amazing faculty in the program, this course provides you the ability to interact with a wide range of visiting scholars and practitioners in class and over dinner. The summer project component is also a very unique opportunity. The class has three papers, which is manageable for a Yale course. Keep in mind that each paper requires covering a very wide range of material in a very short word limit. A great lesson on conciseness.",
    "Take it",
    "Definitely take it!!!",
    "do it. forget wot you've heard. it's worth it. very eye-opening and provides a unique to approach history (strategy-based) that you won't get at the rest of yale.",
    "The course didn't meet my expectations. I don't feel like I'm learning much. The course has a prestigious reputation and the very many fancy dinners GS students get to attend are quite impressive. Yet, in the end, you will end up wondering what did you learn: some history? for sure. something else? unclear. GS is unlike other courses: less academic or intellectual, it claims to touch upon wisdom and leadership. Both are elusive concepts and I doubt to what extent they can be taught. And I also had some complications with the summer grant, since for ISS it looks like the fancy dinners several times a week are more of a priority than student grants for the summer. Anyways, it is still a very different experience from anything else I've had at Yale and I am grateful for that. A big advantage of this course is that it doesn't give definite answers to your questions: you might go to Hill and Gaddis and get different answers for same questions from them, which is how I feel like real life works.",
    "Great course. Don't take it just to take it, but if you're interested, it's well worth the time.",
    "Second half of the class is quite interesting once you start actually discussing historical examples. The first (political theory) is less so.",
    "If you can get in, please take it. Just do it. There are so many opportunities and it really does make you consider problems in a whole different way. Don't mind its reputation, most of it doesn't hold up and people are really down to earth.",
    "I would recommend the course, with the caveat that GS isonly what you put into it. It offers general principles and leaves it to you to fill in the blanks.",
    "I totally recommend discuss to anyone interested in leadership and decision-making. Even more to people that are used to think under a black-or-white paradigm."

   "comments": [
    "very much! very strong readings, very good change from other history, poly sci& epe courses. affected how i think about national approches to foreign policy, etc.",
    "I'm a physics major, so the connections are fascinating but not always immediately apparent.",
    "I'm a cognitive science and economics double major focusing on behavioral economics and decision making, so this is really looking at decision making at the highest level. It's not for a senior essay, but I would imagine the ideas would be applicable when the time comes.",
    "Class is intellectually stimulating and professionally relevant.",
    "Leadership and great decision-making are skills necessaries not only in every profession but more importantly in life. This course is for everyone desiring to lead a successful life (however he\/she defines it), though I hardly see a lot of people realizing this before or even during the course. I know that it will linger in me for many decades."
