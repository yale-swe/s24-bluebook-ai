   "comments": [
    "Learning to analyze and produce real criticism of academic articles. Having to present the articles sounds terrible but was great, actually.",
    "Matt's teaching style. To the point, but accommodating.",
    "The readings. They were interesting and manageable. I liked the class discussions, especially once computers were banned and presenters focused less on what the paper covered and more on critiques and opinions.",
    "The readings and topics covered in class were very interesting. Behavioral economics\/psychology aren't addressed in many other FES classes.",
    "The seminar format of the course. Matt Kotchen is a great professor who offered lots of insights and raised interesting questions.",
    "Interesting readings",
    "I really appreciated the seminar-style of this course. So many classes at F&ES are REALLY PASSIVE in terms of learning approach, and basically are grounded in a professor lecturing at you, and people asking a few questions, but most people are multi-tasking on their computers (as I have done in a few classes) with seemingly little effect on comprehension.I enjoyed that the seminar format facilitated my learning from my peers, which is one of the great advantages of a school like F&ES. I thought that Matt did a great job spurring the conversation in class and ultimately asking us to put away our laptops and focus better.The content of this course was useful to me in that it was a great combination of applying classic economic theory, learning more about behavioral economics and then also seeing how the outcomes of policy can leverage these principles or surprisingly contradict what is assumed to be the expected result. I enjoyed all the connections that were made across the course, and seeing the role of government and policy-making in a new light. I also liked the dynamic of the course - at its best, being communal, friendly, yet argumentative.",
    "practical, number focus",
    "The readings were really useful to understanding voluntary markets and most of them were really interesting. It was also great to have fairly informal class discussions each week and to have students presenting the information rather than the professor.",
    "Professor Kotchen did a great job selecting the reading material and guiding discussion. I thought every class was interesting and engaging. He did a great job making behavioral economics relevant to our day to day lives. I really learned a lot from the entire course.",
    "topics were very interesting and practical for applying to policy idea development. The professor is good at explaining complex topics.",
    "- the small size of the class, which permitted intimate, in-depth discussion- the make up of the class: great discussion- the diversity of topics- the experimental, empirical approach of the papers read, and the consideration given in class to experimental methods"

   "question_text": "The things about this course most in need of improvement are:",
   "comments": [
    "It may be nice to have some early primer readings (in the Nudge, Malcolm Gladwell vein) before diving headlong into published literature for the rest of the semester.",
    "More explanation at the beginning of the course on how to interpret statistics. It might helped if Matt sat at the back of the classroom so people are less inclined to check their phones and computers. More prompting for better discussions.",
    "I think this class could have slightly more work required to cement the take-home points of class, or Prof Kotchen should lecture for 1\/2 the time. Some student presentations were better than others, and what we should be taking away from each paper\/study was sometimes not clear.Either one required paper at the end, or maybe weekly one-page reading summaries would be recommended to help encourage students to get more from the material.",
    "Some of the readings were pretty technical and didn't spark a lot of discussion or give ample opportunity for critique. Every so often, these types of paper are no doubt important, but the course was definitely more interesting and fun when there were more controversial papers, or papers that raised more questions than they answered.",
    "I would have loved more guest speakers - I thought that Pavan and Daylian both added great insight to the conversation - and also just mixed up the pace a little, and perhaps more time from Matt in a more formal teaching mode. I also thought that it would have been helpful for Matt to present a few papers at the outset of the class to role-model for us what he expected from the presentations in terms of style, depth, insights, etc. Sitting through some of the presentations was downright painful and while this may not have been avoidable with any preventative measures, I would think that had it been clear that we weren't supposed to copy all of the text onto the screen, maybe some wouldn't have.Also, it would have been nice to have beengiven an intermediary grade for the course, even a harsh one, to motivate people to continue to contribute to the course throughout the entirety of the semester. I would say the no laptop rule was MUCH NEEDED by the time that it was implemented. Other tactics such as calling on people would have been appreciated - I often felt like I had comments but other people were inclined to talk over me, so a little bit more active facilitation of commentary by Matt would have been helpful, when presenters weren't inclined to play that role with their peers, as some did so well.",
    "It would have been helpful to have been required to write a brief response or summary of each paper we were assigned to read. This would have forced us to read more carefully and to grasp a better understanding of the material. This would of course increase the course load but it would help me to remember what we covered each week. Also, I found the discussions difficult to participate in so perhaps a more facilitated discussion would be helpful.",
    "The only potential drawback to this course is that it was quite easy, since there was no final project or paper. But I was very happy with that arrangement. I am a second year student and had a LOT of other things happening at the end of the semester, so it was great to have one course that required consistent work over the course of the semester but not a lot at the end.",
    "At times reading material was not necessary for preparation for the class. Although this can be nice, it also means the core point of the class is at times lost since this is the bulk of the work for the class. More theory would be nice too explaining economic arguments, since although students had taken courses none of us were experts. Therefore, the analysis at times by students lacked rigor."

    "Pretty available to meet before presentations with good insight and description on what the paper was covering.",

    "Matt was always very willing to help with presentation preparations, although I did wish that he were available the Monday before class, rather than just the morning of.",
    "Instructor not always responsive to email.",
    "I thought that Matt was particularly scattered in the organization of this course based upon trying to be in two places (working in New York and teaching in New Haven) at the same time. For example, at one point, he thought that there were 5 weeks left in the class and there was truly only 1 week left. Given the nature of the course, in which we read academic articles and commented on them, it really didn't make too much of a difference. However, it did lead me to believe that he wasn't really always paying attention to this course, which is mildly troubling when your grade is based on your class participation. In my experience, he had very limited availability for talking about the papers - but of course, in sitting down with him once, he was helpful, engaged, and willing to spend time.",
    "Matt was very available and always happy to meet with us.",
    "generally ok.",

It gave me a much better understanding of how voluntary programs can work, what factors help make them effective, and effectively they can solve environmental problems. Since it was a seminar, rather than a skills\/knowledge-based lecture course, I gained a lot of perspective, both from the readings and the discussions.",

    "Do all the readings and write down thoughts and questions before class to help engage the discussion.",
    "The readings are interesting, so make time for them even though there's very little accountability in the class structure.",
    "Take it if you're someone who enjoys participating actively in discussions and can sit through a three-hour course without losing your attention span. A stong interest in economics is important, and you should have a solid grasp of economics and statistics. Do the readings carefully so you can be prepared for the discussions and offer insights, rather than just random comments.",
    "This is a great course. I can't imagine taking it with someone at F&ES other than Matt Kotchen though - it's both his area of expertise and is well-suited to his teaching style. Plus, students respect and enjoy Matt in a way that I believe motivates them to contribute in a rather loosey-goosey seminar format. My advice is therefore, if Matt isn't teaching it, as he may well not be in the future, don't take it! If he is teaching it, you should consider this course if you are interested in learning about how academics and environmental economists do research and write papers OR if you are interested in what policies have surprising impacts on changing people's behaviors related to environmental actions.",
    "This is a great class that will give you an understanding of behavior economics and psychology. The readings are really interesting but a bit heavy with statistics and methods. Get to know Matt, as he is a great professor. The course load is fairly light, although prepare to spend a fair amount of time preparing the 2-3 presentations you give. I really enjoyed the topics and readings, and be sure to participate in the class discussions to get more out of the class. You will come out with a better understanding of how to influence people to make decisions, eco-labels, and green markets.",
    "Do the reading, all of it. You get so much more out of the discussion that way.",
    "Do the reading. You learn much more.",
    "You will get into it as much thought as you put in. It is an enjoyable course to participate in."
