    "This course taught me everything from a scientific understanding of the nature of sound to the creative process. I now can look at sound systems and understand how they work and what effects common terms like filters and envelopes will have on it. It taught me composition and specifically what I need to do to implement specific sounds in my head.",
    "I learned how to program in Supercollider, a little bit about psychoacoustics, and how to generate interesting sounds using granular synthesis, additive synthesis, filtering, buffered audio manipulation, and FM\/AM synthesis."

   "comments": [
    "The biggest strength is obviously Scott -- he is engaging and passionate, and it is obvious he cares about his classes and the students he is teaching. The problem sets were extra tricky for me, and I think doing some more hands-on SuperCollider in class, like \"If I wanted to do this, here's how I would go about it\" would be helpful in that regard.",
    "Strengths: the course itself has quite interesting material that serves as a useful springboard for sound synthesis techniques. Weaknesses: Unfortunately, this class was very much a make-it-up-as-you-go course, with Prof. Scott generating problem sets with ambiguous instructions. Once the problem sets more accurately match the level attained in class, this course will run much more smoothly."

   "comments": [
    "As this course stands, I would recommend it to students interested in sound design and sound synthesis. One word of warning, though: you will have to deal with the ups and downs that come with a course being in its early stages. Because the class is being offered as an undergraduate course only recently, there are some road bumps that you as a student will have to accept in terms of organization and expectations from Prof. Scott. However, I'm sure that Prof. Scott will be able to iron out inconsistencies he found in the course and will be able to make this course not only fun and interesting, but organized and enriching for all his students."
