   "comments": [
    "I would absolutely recommend for anyone. It covers interesting aspects of the world wars that everyone should know, as well as smaller subjects and other conflicts that I didnt know as much about and which I am very happy I got a chance to learn about.",
    "History 255 is an incredibly interesting course, you get to think about all the wars that you have read about before, but in an almost literary way - looking for themes, patterns and ideas rather than just learning about when the battles happened and who wrote the peace treaties. Be warned though, this is a bleak class. I had known in advance that studying war for a semester would be tough, but nothing prepared me for the overwhelming misery and hopelessness that I came to feel every time I opened the course packet or walked into WLH for lecture. There were one or two lectures that I actually chose not to go to because I didn't think I had the strength to sit through them.",
    "The material can get depressing and tiring. However, it did change the way I viewed certain actors in certain wars. I however mistook the purpose of the course and had gone into it hoping it would talk more about military strategy and action. It is interesting though, if you can handle some of the more gruesome readings.",
    "Great class without much work. The lectures are especially interesting.",
    "Definitely take if you are interested in any war at all, especially history majors. If you want to learn about war through the soldiers' eyes, then take this!",
    "overall, I wouldn't recommend it: trying to be a psychology of war class without the necessary historical context or rigorous psychological approach. I took it for a Europe credit.",
    "Experience of war is an excellent class. Though sometimes quite depressing, it is not like any other history class I have taken at Yale. It allows you to look at history from a new perspective, the perspective of experience. I would absolutely recommend the class. Professor Cabanes is excellent, the work load is not excessive at all, and its a nice change from the normal memorization of events and dates in other history classes.",
    "I really liked this class. The subject matter was interesting (though quite depressing) and the reading was actually pretty good. Prof. Cabanes's lectures were okay, not mindblowing but very organized. Pick your TF wisely though. I think that's the make-it or break-it for this course.",
    "Fantastic course. Overall one of the best courses I have taken at Yale. The professor and TAs were interesting and helpful and the information presented was fascinating. Also, not a ton of work. I highly recommend taking this course if you have any interest in the title. This course was a pleasure.",
    "Take this class. Teaches about the war that you don't see in history books. If you are interested in the concept of war, it will teach you of its horrors.",
    "If you enjoy learning about war at all, take this course. It's not too demanding, and you learn a lot, especially in 20th century history."
