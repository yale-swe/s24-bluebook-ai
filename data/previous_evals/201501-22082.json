   "comments": [
    "Unlike other Yale courses, it is not abstract and theoretical. You'll interact with a variety of interesting guests and get a more thorough discussion than in a Master's Tea. What this course lacks in rigorous theory, it more than makes up for by making you think about decisions you'll make in your life and career.",
    "TAKE THIS IF YOU CAN. Amazing class. Exceptional speakers present every week. Lunches and dinners at Morys to further discuss and engage with the material. Vikram is great.",
    "I would recommend this class. It's very real-world applicable, which one doesn't find very often in an academic setting. The speakers were the best part. Being able to hear such accomplished and interesting figures from all corners of the business world was a treat. I think this is a good Cr\/D class if you are worried about grades, as the professor does not offer substantial feedback on your work and it is hard to know how you are doing. You do receive a midterm report but it is not entirely clear where the grades come from. Still the class is worth taking, especially because of the great list of speakers (though I think the class would have benefited from more female speakers; we only had two).",
    "Take if you really like Masters Teas and eating at Mory's. Don't mistake this for an academic experience... it isn't one.",
    "Most different class at Yale",
    "It was a fantastic class with a fantastic professor - such interesting guest speakers and super involved. The lunches with the speakers were also really fascinating and it's very different from any other Yale experience or class. Professor was very invested in the students and had such great questions and interesting ethical dilemmas. One of the best classes at Yale and a hidden gem. I learned so much about so many different industries and learned a lot of practical things also. Absolutely take the class if you can get in!!!",
    "Best class at Yale.",
    "Take it especially if you are a senior looking to write your thesis in a seminar. It is an incredibly difficult class to get into, so make sure you preregister if you can. If you dont get in junior year, try again. The speakers are all engaging and experts in their field. The workload is incredibly fair considering it is a seminar.",
    "With a plethora of interesting guest speakers and little work, I would recommend this class. You can also have lunch with the guest speakers at Mory's!",
    "Yes, do it. Easily the best class offered at Yale.",
    "Business Ethics was my favorite class at Yale. We got to hear guest lecturers from an array of different industries talk about their fields and go to lunch to talk to them more personally. However, I didn't think that the class should be called business ethics. It was more of a class sampling different industries and making life decisions. Moreover, it would have been nicer to have more graded assignments because the one final paper was essentially the only big graded assignment. I would definitely recommend it.",
    "A must take!",
    "I would definitely recommend it, because it broadens your perspective on life, ethics and business, in a way no other course could."
