   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this course. As an undergraduate student, I was intimidated at first by the graduate students who all seemed to have some prior experience in Africa, but the diversity of backgrounds of everyone in the class was a definite advantage and made for great discussion. This is the perfect course if you're looking for a survey of African agricultural history and the issues that arise from agriculture. You read a book a week, but in the end have a great sense of many different crops, regions, and conflicts in Africa.",
    "Yes, I would recommend the course to another student, although I would caution that time spent in Africa and some knowledge of agriculture before taking the course might make it more interesting.",
    "I would recommend this course- it's a good introduction to agrarian life in parts of Africa, it demonstrates the great diversity of African social and cultural life (through agricultural practices), and covers important themes in African history."

    "It deepened my knowledge of certain cases of agricultural production in Africa, the issues involved with researching agricultural processes (and research in Africa in general), and theories about agricultural change."
