    "Pretty fun class, but I didn't really learn much the whole semester. Definitely recommend taking it Cr\/D though.",
    "We were the guinea pigs so take this with a grain of salt. Take this class with a group of friends. Essentially professional bullshitting for a grade with a touch of programming. Free riders can also be a total possibility, unless they change the structure of the course.",
    "Pretty poorly run overall. More emphasis on the ability to sell your product and idea than what you make (groups that made great presentations but didn't code anything still did better than groups that had a functioning app). Grading seemed unfair and favored those who were close to the professors. The stock system was honestly dumb, stock prices should've been updated real time. Would not recommend. Don't think I learned much about entrepreneurship and definitely did not learn anything new about coding. I did have a great group though and loved hanging out with them\/coding with them.",
    "Do not take this course unless the instructors make significant changes to the structure. The grade system more or less coerces half the class into taking it Credit\/D and thus no one really takes anything seriously. Furthermore, you'll receive no useful feedback from the instructors or the TAs until its much too late to salvage your grade (or any hope you may have had to learn how to actually begin a start-up). Really, this class is a waste of time unless Jensen or Abadi tells you they have 1) Allowed you to pick your own team, 2) Removed the atrocious stock system, 3) Strictly forbidden seeking outside help or funding for a project, and 4) Re-emphasized programming so you actually have to learn how to build an app and not just Photoshop some images together. If even one of those is not done you're going to have a bad time.",
    "I'm really, really glad that this class is being tried out, and I thought it was a wonderful first attempt, although I really wish I had waited to take it. Jensen is the best, Abadi is a little too computer-sciency for a class that focuses on quick prototypes and MVPs. The grading system is terrifying, so take it CR\/D, unless they change it; a super duper chill 5th credit, and I learned a lot about entrepreneurial theory.",
    "Great if you know how to program apps. If not, great incentive to learn to do so. Also very helpful in understanding how modern startups operate.",
    "CPSC 113 is a great class that focuses more on the business side of programming and entrepreneurship during lectures. However, you will learn a lot of the technical side when you work with others on projects. You get how much you put into the class.",
    "So lectures don't necessarily apply to the work you actually do, but they are invaluable in terms of the knowledge\/networking\/experience you get. It's not super organized, but nice and chill if you're looking for an exploratory course in either of the fields.",
    "A fun class to motivate you to learn how to create your own start-up and actually work on something you can call your own. The professors are very nice and will help you if you seek them out. Definitely a useful class for understanding the world around you and to see if being a start-up person is something you're interested in."
