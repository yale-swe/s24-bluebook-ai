   "question_text": "What knowledge, skills, and insights did you develop by taking this course?",
   "comments": [
    "I learned about star and planet formation, the requirements for life on an Earth-like planet, the search and communication with extraterrestrial life, interstellar travel, and the probability of life in the Galaxy and the Universe. We also discussed philosophical themes, like the cultural implications of discovering aliens, the development of artificial intelligence, and the role of religion in science.",
    "This course is divided into three main sections: astronomy, evolution, and SETI (Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence.) The first section, astronomy, discusses the formation of the universe, formation of stars and planets, and our Solar System. The evolution section discusses the apparition of life on Earth. We study several origin of life theories and discuss the evolution of complex and intelligent life on planets. The final section discusses the search for intelligent life outside of our solar system, interstellar travel technology, and possible interstellar communication mechanisms.",
    "I learned all about the history of the universe, the Solar System, the Earth, and life on Earth. I also learned how to complete a college problem set and write an appropriate science essay.",
    "I have learned a lot about the nature of the Universe and the current body of research on the search for extraterrestrial life. I also learned new things about astrophysics, cosmology, chemistry, biology, and sociology. In general, the class changed the way I think about the Universe and my role in it.",
    "I learned the most in this course than any of my other courses, because I knew the least about this subject before coming to school. The class was extremely interesting for every time. I loved that the class was small and interactive. The workload was challenging and copious, but overall, I learned a lot.",
    "By taking this course I was exposed to new and interesting astronomy topics. I gained insight into how the universe was formed and developed. Additionally, I improved communication skills by interacting with the other students and the professors in the seminar class setting.",
    "Very deep understanding of the likelihood of life outside of Earth. Along the way, I learned a shocking amount about astronomy, biology, evolution, and the history of the Earth. This class presented a fantastic overview of many different scientific disciplines and synthesized them into one cohesive topic, with small forays into other areas of discussion like religion and artificial intelligence.",
    "I got a lot of insight into the timeline of the universe and how stars, planets, and other celestial bodies formed. The course also taught me a lot about how life started and how life could form elsewhere in the universe. I learned many theories for how simple and complex life could have originated. Lastly, I learned the methods that are used to search for evidence of extraterrestrial life and what other life might be like.",
    "I learned an entire set of writing skills that I intend to utilize in the future. I also learned how to research effectively, and how to read, and analyze new materials, while exploring both space and the origins of life and how everything tied together to lead to the universe we live in. The search for extraterrestrial life itself is discussed frequently throughout the course, but it involves a greater understanding of space and astrobiology itself, which comprises most of the course.",
    "I learned so much from this course. It would be impossible to list everything but the general topics include astronomy, biology, AI, as well as the current endeavors of space exploration.",
    "I learned how to write long research papers, read a lot of books in a short amount of time and study for the class beforehand in order to discuss."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Sometimes he leads the class discussion too much, rather than letting students talk ideas out. This was somewhat frustrating, but it got better toward the end of the term. Also, the class had WAY too much reading. If you didn't skim through passages, the problem sets sometimes took three or four hours! The reading is easy, interesting, and straight-forward and problem sets require very little math, I just think the information could be learned just as well without such a large time-commitment.",
    "This course has a lot to offer. It discusses very interesting and thought-provoking material. I think it's the class that I learned the most in this semester. One weakness I could say is that the course is taught at 4pm when most students are tired and droopy. I would have preferred to take it earlier in the day.",
    "It is very interesting, but it's not incredibly applicable. I guess that is the point of a frosh seminar.",
    "The problem sets and lectures provide a thorough understanding of the concepts, all of which are quite interesting. Some of the reading seemed optional. The field trip was great.",
    "The strengths were that the material was generally very interesting, and the psets and writing assignments correlate strongly to what we learned in class. However, especially in the first half of the semester, it felt less like a discussion-based seminar and more like a very small lecture. The readings also sometimes felt excessive, particularly considering that they were assigned Friday and due Monday even though class was Tuesday and Thursday.",
    "I don't have too many complaints\/recommendations for the course. One thing would be more\/quicker feedback on problem sets so I could know what I was doing wrong and how I could improve before doing more assignments.",
    "The seminar setting of this course was a new experience for me and the discussions it facilitated helped me get a better grasp on the material. The problem sets were reasonable and the assigned reading was interesting.",
    "Fantastic course. Strengths include course material and overall structure of the class - weekly problem sets and readings were long but in general very useful, midterms and papers were good. Trip to New York was also extremely helpful - helped put what we learned in class into a larger context. Weaknesses - could have used more structure and support when writing the final long paper. Also, classes were a bit too much of the professor talking and not enough of discussion between peers.",
    "The seminar was very fun and open to participation, and this made the course very easy to be interested in, regardless of major or other interests.",
    "The course was extremely interesting. I loved that as we learned about each new topic, we also read and talked about the current discoveries and research surrounding that topic. I would say, though, that the homework for this class took me longer than the homework for any of my other classes. There was an enormous amount of reading each week (although it was all very interesting) and the problem sets (which were primarily questions about the reading) were often very very long.",
    "The strengths of the course are the small size of the class and the flexibility of scheduling activities (trips and nights at the planetarium)."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, if you are interested in discovering the scientific probabilities for life in the universe, specifically in the realm of biology, you should take this class. However, do not take this class if you want to talk about aliens and conspiracy theories. You talk some about this, but he usually guides these topics away toward astrobiology.",
    "YES! Absolutely take this course! Personally, I'm not a science person and this was an easy and very interesting course to get a science credit with. Class discussions are fun and the readings are not that bad. The midterm is very easy and there is no final test, only a research paper. You'll also get to go on a field trip to the planetarium at the natural history museum in NY and to the Yale Observatory to look at some constellations. This class was amazing and I recommend this course to all other students. Plus, Dr. Faison brought us donuts every Thursday.",
    "I would recommend this course because it is an excellent introduction to astrobiology and some basic astronomy concepts, even for the scientifically and mathematically inept. Dr. Faison is also quite entertaining and a great professor, and there's a field trip, so...",
    "Yes! This is a very fun, interesting, engaging course that covers a wide variety of topics and introduces ideas that will definitely be new to you.",
    "If you're looking for a relatively easy science credit with an animated professor and pretty cool class discussion, I'd suggest this course. It's not looking for aliens the entire term - there are different topics each week pertaining to some field of science pertaining to the search for ET life. Not so in depth but still cool.",
    "Yes. I think almost every student I know would find this course extremely interesting.",
    "I would highly recommend this class to any student with even a remote interest in learning about the universe or how extraterrestrials could potentially be found.",
    "Yes, awesome freshman seminar, though it was more work than I expected",
    "I would highly recommend this to anyone interested in astronomy or biology as the class and the many readings really expand your worldview and the way you think about what life is. We read several books that cover origins or life and the timeline of earth which spark lots of discussion in class. The psets are not long and are a great review of the readings. Also, the class went on a great trip to New York to visit the Museum of Natural History.",
    "I would recommend this course because I think it is a very rewarding seminar to attend, and any student will gain something from the experience. I also appreciated that the seminar felt like somewhat of a family, which made discussion that much more interesting and involved.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone who is even slightly interested in astronomy. I cannot even express the extent of knowledge I gained from this course. It made me think about aspects of our universe that I had never even considered.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who wishes to take an astronomy course. Both students interested in cosmology and physics and students interested in the cultural impact of the search of life in other planets."
