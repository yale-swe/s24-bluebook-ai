    "If you are interested in humanistic strategies for music analysis, this is a good start.",
    "I would recommend Music 917 to anyone who wishes to become a music theorist because of its relevance and its growing popularity in current scholarship.",
    "See above. Would recommend, if student is not too much of an \"analysis techie\" with theory.",
    "yes.",
    "A very interesting introduction to the concepts of rhetoric and gesture and how they have been, are, and can be applied to music. A reasonably thorough grounding in classical rhetorical topics is one of the most helpful parts of the class - once you know an epanalepsis from hypotyposis there is a tendency to spot them everywhere!Recommended to students with an interest in the philosophy of how and why music works on its listeners, as well as those interested in rhetoric generally.",
    "There is a large amount of reading that is not covered in class sessions, so this course is best suited to an independent-minded learner who is comfortable without rigid structures and organization. The course is oriented towards how rhetoric and gesture challenge (or do not challenge) other music-theoretical paradigms, rather than to the interdisciplinary study of these topics or a more narrow repertoire focus, so the course is best for someone who wants to expand their methodological scope."

    "The last few weeks on gesture were like precious drops of research-nourishing nectar squeezed from a rhetorical stone. --this in all seriousness. However, others may well have found the rhetoric portion more useful than I did."
