    "The workload was about average, however it was too heavily loaded towards the end of the semester. I would suggest doing the role play activity (which was very useful and informative) before student presentations and making sure to regulate the time on student presentations. The presentations would have been just as interesting if limited to 15 minutes, and without the limitation they ran too long and took up too much class time. Additionally, we were overloaded during finals on work that needed to have been completed during the semester.",
    "The field trips were extremely interesting and informative, and I learned a lot from them. Very well-designed, and a lot of fun.",
    "Auditor.",
    "While the topic of the course was very interesting, the structure was not conducive to optimal learning. The midterm did not appropriately evaluate student's on the course materials and seemed to more as a basis for judging students on how well they memorized the material. The end of the course was too heavily loaded with work. A debate, written assignment and take home final should not comprise the last 2 weeks of the course. Rather, one evaluation (either debate or final) should be used to assess students at the end of the term."

   "comments": [
    "This class is not demanding enough for a graduate-level class. Great as an introduction for undergraduates, but either shouldn't be listed as an FES course, or should be made more demanding. For instance, more time discussing the primary literature.",
    "I wish the class were more discussion-based and interactive. The majority of the course was simply lectures, which I don't think was the best way of engaging students and communicating the material. The best class sessions were the student presentations and the mock hearing at the end; if there were some way to incorporate this sort of participation into other class sessions, that would great. Instead of 80 minutes of lecture and 0 minutes of discussion in every class, a 60-20 ratio would be optimal. Also, the plankton lab was great too; there should be more lab work if possible.",
    "Better methods to assess student knowledge. Perhaps a presentation and an essay rather than a presentation, short writing assignment and midterm. I wish I could have written more about the articles I researched but due to the word limit, I was not able to fully evaluate the strength of the research or express my interest in the topic.",
    "Overall I think the class is very well run. The only suggestion I have is to perhaps move the mock hearing to earlier in the semester, so it does not occur during finals when students are very busy already.",
    "Spread out the work a little bit; seems like all assignments were due at the end of the course."
