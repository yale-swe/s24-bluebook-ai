    "This class was a brilliant insight into how Color is multiplicitous, that how Color is employed and assembled carries different meanings and creates different contexts for work to be read.",
    "I learned so much about color theory.",
    "First through Joseph Albers' exercises and then through sculpture and video, I learned about the interaction of color in the traditional sense as well as the interaction of light and color and colored light and shadow.",
    "basic color theory and more playful strange comments about color."

   "comments": [
    "This course was excellent overall. I would have enjoyed a little less structure in the later Albers pieces we created for homework.",
    "GREAT course! Just the right amount of work and engagement. I loved the structure of the course - starting with albers and getting more and more abstract. Anna and Julia were both great.",
    "The course was very exciting and well taught. At times, it felt slightly directionless but was overall an awesome course.",
    "This class has many different strengths: it addresses the study of color from many different sources (color in nature, light, its relationship to material, etc.) and has very engaging assignments. I can think of no weaknesses.",
    "The course's largest strength was professor betbeze, who's the best.",
    "Anna Betbeze created the perfect balance in the curriculum, providing just the right number of readings, classroom assignments, and homework assignments. She was very supportive of all students, no matter what level art experience.",
    "This class is great if you want to explore an integral aspect of art, even if you have no prior training in art. It has interesting projects throughout the semester, though you'll get tired of cutting tiny pieces of paper by the end of it.",
    "The class is a great low-stress environment for playing with color and light. Readings and projects are interesting and useful. Weaknesses are that few of the pieces from this class could be used in a portfolio and within the classroom there is not a lot of structure to keep people on task."

   "comments": [
    "Definitely. Not very much work and tons of fun. You'll learn a lot no matter what your background, and you'll get a nice creative break from your other classes. If you can get in, you MUST take it!",
    "I would recommend this to anyone who is interested in art. It changes \/ broadens the way you think about color and gives you an understanding of the subtlety of its interactions.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to a student. This class has changed the way I perceive color on a day to day basis, and has made me better recognize the beauty in objects all around me.",
    "For artists and non-artists alike, this class is both fun and incredibly important in understand that which dominates our world.",
    "YES!",
    "I highly recommend this course to any student, with art experience or not. This course is structured very well, and Anna is an amazing teacher.",
    "I highly recommend this course.",
    "I would recommend this class to both art majors and non-art majors. It is a low-stress environment to play with the interactions and meanings of colors. The class environment is great and usually in class, we just talk or work on projects. The class briefly explores colors in relation to science, literature, film, and history. Anna is great.",
    "I would recommend this class to any student who is interested in taking a different learning approach to color theory. The class will challenge a student's perception of color and will set them with new skills that make them appreciate color as a medium of its own. An overall excellent class that added to my own artistic knowledge."
