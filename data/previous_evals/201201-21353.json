    "Yes, I would highly recommend this course. Anyone who is interested in photography should absolutely take this course, and I think it would be an enjoyable class for non-majors to take credit\/d.",
    "Unfortunate that there aren't many other photo history classes of this ilk, but definitely worth taking if you want to get to know 20th century photographers. Don't expect to get too into modern works.",
    "Really important class to take, as an art history student or just someone with a general interest in photography. Makes you feel like a well-educated person. Take it! Might not be the best fifth class though, because there is a lot of memorization. Maybe Credit\/D?",
    "TAKE IT if you are history of art major! And I think it is good class for everyone - but maybe not the class that exposes one the best for history of art in general. But definitely it rises important questions of what is modernity and how photography developed and what forms it took and why.",
    "This was a fantastic class. It really gave me so much knowledge, not just about photography of the 20th Century, but 20th Century culture and society in general. The readings were incredible, though quite difficult. The topics covered revolved around notions of art, documentation, and the importance of women photographers. I learned so much and it was a really fun class. I highly recommend it."
