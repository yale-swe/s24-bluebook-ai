   "comments": [
    "Knowledge of scales, chords, chord progressions, interval relationships, rhythm, tempo, time signature, key, cadence, and a smattering of music history, Marxism, and hegemony.",
    "I learned a lot! I didn't even know how to properly read music when I began the class, and by the end of it, I could tell you everything about major and minor keys and scales, chord progressions, seventh chords, voicings, and much more. As an amateur songwriter, this class was of immeasurable value to me.",
    "I learned the basics of music theory as well as some music history.",
    "I came in with limited knowledge of notes and scales and emerged with a practical understanding of the western musical system. Additionally, the course instruction allowed me to gain brief insight into the cultural significance of music, despite this not being a requirement of the course.",
    "Great course if you want a very challenging introduction to reading, writing, listening, and performing music. However, I was the only student in the class who truly had no music reading background. In fact, everyone in the class had already been singing or playing an instrument for years. From this perspective, I can say that if you are truly a beginner, the only realistic way to take the course is the Credit\/D\/Fail option. But aside from being salty about this, I would highly recommend the class to anyone who wants a serious crash course in the basics of reading, writing, listening, and performing music. It's a lot of work, tons of stuff to memorize, and there's really no way to excel if you're truly a beginner (for example, we were graded on our ability to sing scales and recognize them by ear, among other things). Also, a huge drawback is that there's no tutor or any other formalized way to improve your learning outside of class, which isn't a very functional system for a class that demands so much engagement and progress. But even with all of this, if you're prepared to work hard and take the class Credit\/D\/Fail, the class is a great option."

   "comments": [
    "Strengths: wonderful professor, fascinating course material, high level of engagement and class participation. The composition assignments were the right level of fun and challenging, and the presentation assignment, as well as the emphasis on critical thinking the seminar-style discussion on the interconnections of music and society, were both thought-provoking and enjoyable. Weaknesses: student contribution strongly influences the class, which can be an issue in cases where students are unmotivated. In truth I have no real complaints about the course itself.",
    "Strengths: Very useful and relevant material taught effectively and concisely. The assignments were fun! Weaknesses: The seminars on the political aspects of music, although valuable, weren't really what I signed up for.",
    "Strengths are that you learn so much about music theory with the only weakness being that it can be overwhelming at times.",
    "I think some of the lessons could be restructured to follow a more logical path and that possibly some of the early lessons could be drawn out so that those with less musical background have time to grasp the concepts.",
    "Too much reading for the seminar discussions.",

    "Absolutely. Zachary Stewart is a fantastic and engaging professor and very responsive to his students. You will get as much out of this course as you put in. You will come away from this class with a much deeper appreciation of music and how it works, and you will learn a surprising amount so long as you put the effort in as well. This was without a doubt my favorite class of the semester.",
    "Yes! If you're interested in music and want to learn how to write it and analyze it from a more technical perspective, this class is a very useful and comprehensive introduction.",
    "Yes. I think it is a perfect class to take for anyone with any interest in music, whether they are a tentative major, a talented musician, or just someone looking to learn more about the subject. I truly loved going to class each day.",
