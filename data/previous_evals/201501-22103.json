    "You spend a lot of class talking about narrative and going through the scripts of everyone in the class. If you have a good group, this can be pretty enjoyable. This is a low stress class and you get to read a lot of good professional scripts. Just remember to do the midterm folder ahead of time because it is a lot of work.",
    "You could read a bunch of scripts and try to write a screenplay on your own and come up with a similar product.",
    "If you are interested in film and screenwriting, FILM 350 is a good introduction to screenwriting. The midterm packet requires a significant amount of work and reading of screenplays, so if movies aren't really your thing, it could be a grueling process. Otherwise, the workload is pretty light, making the class pretty low stress.",
    "If you want to learn about screenwriting, whether to pursue it in depth or just from curiosity, there is no better option than this course. The workshop approach is essential; one learns to write, as one should, by writing.",
    "A great chance to learn the basica of screenwriting and to write a 12-page screenplay. Be warned, though, Professor Lapadula gives very little clarity and plays clear favorites.",
    "A class where you learn how to format screenplays, and have great discussions with the professor about film if you reach out to him! A great place to access scripts!"
