   "comments": [
    "If you are taking SPAN 140 it is most likely because you have to for a language credit. I felt like SPAN 140 was much more difficult than SPAN 130. You read several short stories that can be difficult, and at the end of the class you read a novel. There is a 25 minute presentation and daily homework assignments that can be tedious. If you can, absolutely take the class with Prof. Cividanes. She is a fantastic professor and genuinely cares about her students.",
    "Take it! It's a wonderful course!",
    "The course is a stepping stone to understanding the Spanish language. If a student has studied Spanish in high school and wants to keep\/needs to fulfill the distributional requirement, I definitely suggest taking Span 140 with Ame Cividanes.",
    "Take it!",
    "A great spanish course and there are more novels and videos which make it more interactive than level 3 spanish. Take it!",
    "It will help you improve your Spanish, especially grammar, but it will do so almost painlessly. I never felt overworked, and I was genuinely interested in learning the material, reading the stories, watching the movies, etc.",
    "Definitely take L4 with Ame Cividanes, who was extremely engaging and enthusiastic about the class. It was like my AP Spanish class in high school, and it was good practice because I hadn't taken Spanish since junior year. Lots of speaking (you're conversing really easily by the end of the semester), and a fair amount of work involving grammar and comprehension. Overall, it's a really laid-back class that helps you improve your Spanish.",
    "L4 Spanish provides a variety of means of improving one's Spanish, with everything from typical conversational activities and grammar exercises to short films and literary pieces being employed in classes. In particular, Professor Cividanes made the coursework fun and interesting with her passion for the subject matter (particularly with regard to Spanish literature). She is without a doubt a fantastic teacher of Spanish on the whole. Over the course of the semester I've been able to improve tremendously in understanding spoken Spanish, and my speaking abilities have improved. Writing ability has improved as well - writing skills were a major focus of the final.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. I enjoyed it more than my previous two Spanish classes.",
    "If you are taking this class it is probably for a language requirement. That said, L4 is great level, where students really seem to overcome a language threshold and move toward being more comfortable with conversational speaking. If you can, take it with Ame Cividanes, she is great.",
    "A good class. More literature-heavy than L3. If you can, take it with Cividanes. She's really nice and a good teacher.Take this if you want to continue learning Spanish. Not exactly the most scintillating (especially at 9:30), but it's pretty painless."
