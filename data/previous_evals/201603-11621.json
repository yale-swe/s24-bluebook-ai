    "My Russian improved a lot this semester. I learned grammatical concepts and vocabulary that were useful both in research and in everyday conversation. Memorizing responses and posting them to a voice thread is the only successful method for learning vocabulary that I have ever encountered. I was very pleased to discover this after struggling to memorize vocabulary in other languages for many years.",
    "Improved writing\/reading skill; increased historical knowledge of Russia as well.",
    "My knowledge of how to read in Russian greatly improved by taking this course. The historical essays assigned by Professor Muravnik did a wonderful job at keeping me engaged and interested in the material. I am also very confident with Russian case system and advanced grammatical concepts like participles after taking this class.",
    "I obtained further understanding about core concepts in Russian grammar, and we applied this language development to the study of Russian history.",
    "I was able to hone my prior grammatical knowledge with a better idiomatic understanding of the language",
    "History of Russia from Catherine II to the beginning of Nicholas I. Learned vocabulary to enable discussion of academic topics.",
    "Developed speaking and writing skills in Russian, also learned to effectively converse in Russian about fairly difficult topics.",
    "I was worried entering into Third-Year Russian that I'd be slightly unprepared for it. I had previously spent two years out of Russian language instruction, having completed the first part of a third-year course at a different institution. However, Constantine's instruction was precisely what I needed. Positioning verbal adverbs and participles at the start of the course quickly consolidated my understanding of previous grammatical concepts (i.e., you mobilize, or activate quite a lot of grammar in forming participles, requiring review and revision). Coming to the course with a focus on the 19th century, the historical texts that formed the meat of each unit were familiar territory (I knew the meta-narratives, which helped me infer from context) and a chance to learn new facts and trivia. More importantly, they offered a useful selection of widely applicable phrases and constructions. These were a shot in the arm for my level of speaking and fluency, allowing me to string together phrases and enrich extemporaneous conversation. \"To influence, or have an influence on,\" \"to be limited, or limit,\" \"imagine,\" \"to leave from something,\" \"to be proud of something,\" \"to be under the leadership of,\" \"to be considered,\" along with a whole slew of verbs with hard to define lexical nuance. I expected that the course would jump-start and expedite my ability to read Russian scholarship, in Russian, but I didn't expect how much it would also do for my ability to freely discourse in Russian."

   "comments": [
    "I think that this course is taught very well. There is a great level of engagement with students and the feedback on our progress is very helpful. Whenever I have questions of any kind (about the language or Russian culture and history) Professor Muravnik is always prepared with an excellent and comprehensive answer. He understands that Russian is a difficult language for native English speakers to learn and I really appreciate the patience he has with us when it takes us a while to learn a new concept.",
    "It touches on interesting historical topics and grammatical points. The pace could be increased to keep the class engaged",
    "We learned a lot of history, and my vocabulary certainly expanded, but there is little time devoted to practical use of the language. I am certain that if I went to Russia I could recite my memorized monologues about the Napoleonic wars but would struggle with basic human interaction. Perhaps some of the speaking portion of the class should be turned towards conversation, rather than reading\/reciting brief summaries of Russian history to better facilitate fluency and confidence with the language. That being said, Professor Muravnik is great. He explains things well and is obviously passionate about his job. He is a joyful person to be around and he is very helpful whenever you ask to see him outside of class.",
    "I addressed this slightly in Question 1. Putting the verbal adverbs and participles in our first unit helped to rapidly review a lot of grammar in a short space of time. Each unit's \"ten verbs\" are very helpful: these are problems of nuance that require the assistance of a Russian grammarian--and I feel that their shades of meaning are preparing us well for tackling aspect, later on in our training. Returning to key phrases across chapters of the reading and units of the course rapidly built up my ability to converse, creating conversational hooks that I could catch sentences on and transition with. I wished that the system of verbal types stuck with me more. Occasionally, I could infer conjugations and stress based upon the verbal types as intended (indeed, learning that stress shift occurs only in the present or in the past was a revelation to me). But more often than not, I pasted together my knowledge of types and memorized conjugations to achieve the desired results. I also question whether or not I entirely feel comfortable with participles. I was trained so thoroughly at a different institution to break my sentences into -clauses that I can't quite shake my suspicion of them."

    "Yes. Excellent course. You will be challenged by the materials and improve a lot.",
    "Yes - difficult, but very beneficial.",

Professor Muravnik is an incredible linguist and will help you to improve your speaking and reading abilities in amazing ways. You will also learn a lot about Russian history, in Russian, which is a really cool experience.",
    "This course provides the tools to effectively develop one's Russian language ability without requiring an unreasonable amount of coursework. Studying Russian at Yale is definitely a good choice.",
