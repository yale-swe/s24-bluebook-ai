    "I definitely recommend taking this course. It's fun and doesn't require too much work on your part so long as you do put in some effort at the very least.",

    "Great class! Definitely take it if you can. You end up becoming really good friends with everyone in the class and Swapnaji is so sweet.",
    "It is a good way to improve Hindi."
