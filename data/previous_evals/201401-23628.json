   "comments": [
    "I would absolutely recommend this class! It was fun but the workload is a bit high and the grading is rough so if you can you should take it Cred\/D",
    "Its a cool class, but a lot of the material is focused on religion... If I had known that going in I probably wouldn't have taken the class. Section every week; the usual, where you have to discuss the readings, or bring in your reading response. Short (1-2) page reading responses every other week. Final exam and final paper. The course SHOULD NOT have a final, because its so focused on the papers and medieval literature throughout. There is so much information, and memorization of terms. If it was a final in-class paper, that's one thing. But we're expected to memorize names, places, terms, excerpts from primary sources, larger concepts and issues, as well as DATES for everything. Wayyy to much for a history course that focuses so primarily on literature.",
    "Interesting class with SO much writing. The sections are pretty painful because you dwell on readings for weeks at a time and the writing expectations are very different for most classes at Yale.",
    "I would recommend History 206 to another student, since I enjoyed it and learned a great deal. Especially for those who, like me, do not have a very heavy background in history, this class is an excellent introduction.",
    "Definitely take it! Professor Winroth is really great and the material is really interesting! It was a really great class! However, be aware that there is a final paper (max 6000 words, no min) and a final exam. Otherwise it was great. Definitely go to lecture.",
    "Really glad I took this class. Fascinating and fun material, interesting readings, and Professor Winroth is a very witty, fun, and engaging lecturer. He really seems to have a lot of fun teaching the class and is a very good story teller. However, there were a number of short papers, and the first few were graded very harshly. We got the sense that he wasn't so concerned about our grades--we should just focus on learning to write well--but it was pretty stressful and unnerving to receive such harsh feedback on a paper that would have gotten a good grade in another class. Of course, my writing got a lot better and it was enormously helpful, but hopefully the early papers won't factor much into the final grade...",
    "The class had a lot of promise, but didn't exactly pan out for me. Winroth's lecture style is unfocused, with lots of tangents of dubious value (e.g. finding appropriate adjectives for various shades of yellow on a map). The writing aspect of the class is also disappointing, with lots of 500-word essays that get graded harshly and couldn't encompass the topic assigned because you only have 500 words and you need more. The final was a walk in the park, though, so you don't need to hang on the details in the textbook or lecture.",
    "The Middle Ages is a diverse and interesting period of history that is definitely worth your time. The course is also a good way to practice the art of making a good argument.",
    "HIST 206 is a great standard history lecture. It's the most interesting introduction to the Middle Ages that I can think of. I very much like how Professor Winroth emphasizes anecdotes, primary sources, and themes, because this is the richness that makes history come alive. I found him a good storyteller who was able to take little incidents to explain big trends in medieval life. I also liked the balance between political and cultural\/intellectual history.",
    "HIGHLY recommended. Take this class. 5 short papers (500 words max), a final research paper (10-15 pages) and a relatively easy final, with no surprises. Very interesting material, so it's worth it.",
    "Teaches a broad spectrum of cultures, religions and wars that took place in the middle ages. Insight on what happened during middle ages and what signifies them and their consequences.",
    "Winroth is a ball-buster. This class is set up like a gut, but don't take it unless you're prepared to have your balls busted on a regular basis grade-wise.",
    "Overall, History 206 was a good survey course for medieval history. If you think you're interested in learning more about that era, then it's definitely worth shopping. Professor Winroth is very picky about the way he wants you to write, but the 5 short papers weren't too bad and definitely make your writing more clear and concise. He wasn't very clear about the final paper (there's no minimum word\/page count) and final exam (it ended up being much easier than expected.) Some of the primary source readings were great and some were very boring. If you're interested in the Middle Ages and you need a writing credit, you should probably check this out.",
    "A great class involving writing some short papers and a long paper at the end",
    "To be honest, my recommendation of this course will hinge on the grade I receive. This is not how I would normally go about recommending courses, but in this case I believe it is warranted. The grading policy was so opaque and the grades on the first assignments so low, that I could not in good faith recommend this class unless the final grades bear little relation to the earlier assignments. Despite this great flaw, the course is otherwise amazing. Professor Winroth delivers entertaining and informative lectures, and the textbook readings will interest anyone with even the slightest curiosity about the middle ages. With some administrative changes, this course could be one of the best introductory courses at Yale. That said, the lack of transparency in the grading process adds so much stress that, depending on the final grades, I might not recommend this course.",
    "Fun, not too hard history class. Learnt a lot. Tough essay grading.",
    "A writing course geared towards a broad representation of the Middle Ages. Each writing assignment is based off of a primary source texts\u2014almost all books\u2014which are interesting to read and write about. The lecture does not really connect to the writing assignments and the lecture does not provide that much information. If you are looking for a great history lecture course\u2014do not take this one. While it did improve my writing, there are definitely easier, more organized, and more fulfilling courses to take in order to get a WR distribution credit. The grading on the papers is harsh, though you can definitely improve over time and the final is really straightforward.",
    "An interesting history course (especially if you are really interested in this time period). Lectures are amazing, the textbook is actually interesting (and even amusing at times), and professor Winroth is fabulous. I would highly highly recommend this course and would probably take it again if I could.",
    "Yes! Take it if you especially want to improve your writing skills.",
    "This class was oftentimes frustrating for myself and a lot of my classmates. I can't say I would particularly recommend it.",
    "I would recommend the class to students who have a general interest in medieval history, but I need to remind future students that the writing assignments are very focused on the reading texts. If you are more interested in economic and geopolitical history, the course might pay too much attention to literature for you.",
    "This would have been a great class, made better by a great professor, except that it was meant to be a writing credit. The writing aspects of this course were so numerous and tedious that they bogged the course down and made it somewhat intolerable. We had to cover 1200 years in a semesters yet the TAs and Professors still thought it necessary to devote ENTIRE LECTURES to writing instruction. Additionally, every other section was a \"writing section;\" when we should have been discussing the myriad material from the course were were instead discussing the most basic of writing tips. GET RID OF THE WRITING COMPONENT.",
    "I would only recommend it if they have taken a class where they've done historical writing before, because it would have been helpful to know what I was doing going into it. And they would also need to be fairly invested in the subject because a lack of enthusiasm makes it very difficult to motivate yourself.",
    "Yes, if the student is interested about learning history.",
    "This is a really good lecture course. Anders Winroth is a funny and engaging lecturer. This course gives a good survey of the Middle Ages in Europe. It tries to teach good historical writing, but doesn't provide as much feedback on writing as other writing courses. There was lots of reading but not a lot of writing, but the writing assignments are judged harshly. This made the final paper very difficult. The final exam was not that tough, though. I recommend it as a general history course."
