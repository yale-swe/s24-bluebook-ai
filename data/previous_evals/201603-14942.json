   "comments": [
    "I developed a breadth of knowledge about various mechanisms, their applications, and how they function. I also developed skills in performing original research.",
    "I learned more about what mechanisms are available to us to use and their general operating principles.",
    "I got a survey-type introduction to linkage design, gearing, transmissions, clutches, underactuation (especially in robotic hands), parallel mechanisms, flexural joints, and variable stiffness. I also got a little extra practice with SolidWorks and a deeper introduction to a current area of mechanisms research as part of the course project.",
    "3D CAD using SolidWorks, 3D-printing, machining, etc.",
    "In taking ENAS 778, I got a great appreciation of the wide variety of mechanisms employed in robotics applications. I also gained further experience with conducting mechanisms research and the publication process. While the course did not go into extensive detail on the math\/theory behind some mechanisms, it provided enough general background that I now know how to approach these sorts of problems and where to look for the information I might need."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: good content, very useful. Weaknesses: the spacing between deadlines was kind of tight sometimes. For example, a full blown working physical prototype was due about a week after the CAD model -- which doesn't leave much time for correcting assembly mistakes, such as procuring the wrong hardware, mistakes in machining, etc.",
    "I think homework could actually help reinforce some of the ideas while it was nice not to have any. I think more time is needed for the final project!",
    "High expectations with little guidance, which seemed utterly difficult at the moment, but ultimately helped to build independence and strong skills. A helpful survey of various mechanisms out there, but quick coverage with little reinforcement was both a curse and a blessing (didn't need to study for the exams and made the course somewhat stress-free).",
    "I believe the main strength of this course was its breadth, in that we covered a large number of different mechanisms, which will hopefully prove helpful for a variety of projects going forward. That said, I think this is also one its weaknesses, because I sometimes wished that we would go into more depth on certain mechanisms, going into the math and theory behind it. In particular, some of the concepts of mobility and 4-bar linkages, as well as linkage composition, might be an interesting area to explore more mathematically. I think that by adding psets to the class, this could be improved, since inherently we would be spending more time on a topic and could go into that level of detail."

   "comments": [
    "Yes. This class is a good graduate level mechanisms class.",
    "Yes. The assignments helped to acquaint me with the resources at Yale has to offer in terms of working on projects.",
    "Don't take this as an undergrad. It's overall not a difficult class (and the material is actually very interesting), but Aaron does not provide enough support for the really hard part: identifying an area of mechanisms research where you can make a dent in just two months, and actually coming up with a novel mechanism. Unless you are coming in with a great mechanism idea right off the bat, you might honestly be better off just doing some Wikipedia binge-reading on the syllabus contents. As somebody considering grad school, I did get some exposure to areas of research that I might be interested in pursuing, but that was the only good part of this course for me.",
    "Very hands-on, and you will definitely walk out of the course having improved skills in design and fabrication.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to fellow students. The MechE curriculum is lacking in mechanisms\/robotics courses, so this fills a void that I think its crucial for people's knowledge if they plan to go into industry in any sort of hardware design field."
