   "comments": [
    "This course, despite its name, is chiefly a study of public opinion, a topic that is probably more fun than you expect. And that\u0092s because studying public opinion is kind of like playing God: making sense of the way that the mass public operates just gives you an enormous sense of power. (This is all a long-winded way of saying you will enjoy the class.) Professor Bullock is excellent---easily one of the kindest and most accessible professors you will have at Yale. You should take the course.",
    "This class raises many interesting questions about public opinion. Does it exist (and when)? And that's only the tip of the iceberg. I have to say, though, taking the class was a bit frustrating at times without a sufficient background in statistical analysis... I didn't know what to say in my reading responses because I would always just be confused about whether I believed any of the articles. They'd raise questions and supposedly solve them, but it's so bought to find the holes in the authors' assumptions even though they're definitely there. The class purports to give students the ability to process and analyze public opinion data for ourselves, so that conniving politicos and mistake-prone poli sci profs can't fool us... but I didn't actually learn how to use the program (\"R\") and I am not as schooled at spotting the problems in others' interpretations of data as I wish I were. I'm probably better at asking relevant questions, though, and that's a start.",
    "Good class. One of the best parts of the class is that it points out GOOD research--you don't just look at papers and critique mindlessly.Bullock is a good professor. You'll come across a lot of interesting research in his class.",
    "PLSC 238 is an introduction to the world of public opinion - what you can and cannot gain from it. It is a thought-provoking seminar which allows you to critically read many academic studies, which usually have some broader application to politics or government. I would definitely recommend this course to any student who is interested in politics and who is looking for a well-run and accessible seminar.",
    "This is a solid political science seminar. Professor Bullock is an excellent discussion leader and appreciates when students put careful thought into their contributions in class. It was a bit more work than I expected, which wasn't necessarily a bad thing, but the reading responses can take some time (don't leave them until the end of the semester when you're most busy). Previous background in American politics would be helpful for this class."
