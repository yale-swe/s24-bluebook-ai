   "comments": [
    "I would only recommend this class if you are interested in the material. Do not take it if you are looking for a Humanities credit if you aren't interested in the class.",
    "its not a tough humanities credit. material can be interesting at times if youre interested in historical figures. id recommend the class not a huge workload and pretty interesting",
    "Easy class, pretty light reading and papers are not hard to write. Final exam wasn't bad at all, only based on primary sources",
    "Yes I would recommend it if you are interested in the material or if you are taking 5 classes because it is not hard to do well.",
    "Take this class. It is a good one.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. Although the lectures get boring sometimes, the assignments are do-able, and it's great that the material is centered around the idea of the hero.",
    "interesting classwould recommend it",
    "Yes I would recommend the class. The only real problem is motivation - it gets hard in the middle of the year to attend class because there is little incentive.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class for everyone at yale.",
    "If you are interested in this stuff then yes. if no, then don't take it. the papers were the most boring thing i've ever written.",
    "A fair class with engaging assignments. Pretty easy workload just 2 papers a final and 2 museum visits. each week has a reading response of about a page, but the readings are interesting.",
    "I would recommend this class to someone who isn't looking for that much work to do but they like the subject matter. The class isn't particularly stressful at all.",
    "Very good class. Interesting, workload not too bad. It's not necessarily an easy A but work hard on the two papers and section assignments and you'll be fine.",
    "Pretty good, not terribly challenging course on an esoteric topic. I'm glad I took it just because it exposed me to Sumerian literature, which is so different from anything else I've ever encountered.",
    "YES! It's not a lot of work. The material is interesting. It gets you to think. What's not to like? Approachable, nice professor. Really laid-back TAs. You also don't have to do all the reading (make sure to focus on the primary sources though!) and you get to look at art (in the Yale Babylonian Collection and the Met!). Weekly assignments are very easy to do, manageable even fun to write papers, fair exam. Grading is very kind. Plus you learn about Gilgamesh and Mesopotamia, things that actually do have relevance in today's culture.",
    "Yes.If you like ancient history, this is the class for you.Just a note for those of you who think this is a 'gut' class: it is not. Not. NOT.I've done more work for this class than some of my other classes.",
    "Very good and interesting course to take",
    "I would recommend this course. Interesting, easy to follow, and not a huge time commitment. Section is worthwhile, most of what you learn in section is repeated, emphasized, or built off of in lecture.",
    "Its a course on nothing relevant to anything really, just made up stuff that people want to try to explain that is pointless.",
    "I would recommend Heroes in the ANE to another student if they are into history and religion, since this course has many ties to Biblical stories.",
    "Pretty easy class, though this year we had a whole bunch of stuff due at the end of the semester. They weren't hard, but it was a pain to have a final, a paper, and a museum assignment in NYC all due during reading\/finals week.",
    "It was an OK class. If you are interested in ancient history other than the classic Greek history it is interesting. Take it if you need a HU credit.",
    "This class is interesting and not terribly too much work. You learn a lot about the ancient Near East, a region and era that you don't really get to learn much about otherwise. The Gilgamesh readings were very interesting and you gain a better understanding of the ubiquity of this ancient culture in our everyday lives now. Definitely take it if you can.",
    "If you have a true interest in history or Mesopotamia, it will probably be enjoyable. But. If you are looking for a random course to add, or a gut, DO NOT TAKE IT. Tons of busy work, a ridiculous museum assignment at the Met, and harsh grading (depending on the TA of course).",
    "TAKE IT. easy and FUN credit. in what other class do you get to play with clay?",
    "Absolutely recommend, a great course to fill a requirement.",
    "Yes, although lecture was not always that engaging we read some interesting texts, and it was cool to see the origins of many later religious texts and ideas in the ancient near east.",
    "Great class. Low stress and a perfect fit if you're balancing a tough schedule. Highly recommended.",
    "No, not unless you actually are interested in this stuff, because it is no longer a gut!",
    "Take it - it's fun, relaxed, and very interesting.",
    "Yes, take it. Its really fascinating and a good class to have that doesnt involve a lot of work",
    "this is an interesting class. i liked lectures, although sometimes slanski's voice would put be to sleep 15 mins before the end. the material we cover is fun though, and i hadnt read the epic of gilgamesh until now, if anything take the class to read that haha.workload isnt too bad at all, the TA i had, marina, is very helpful and her discussions complement the lectures.take it :)if you need a 5th class\/\"gut\" i think this is a good choice!",
    "Yes, take it. Not too much of a work load, class is interesting. Also, museum assignment is a lot of fun.",
    "Yes, definitely take this class. Very interesting subject and readings. There is quite a bit of work, especially as the semester progresses, but it wasn't incredibly overwhelming, nor was it too hard.",
    "yea take it for sure.",
    "Yes, it was an interesting class and the workload was very manageable"
