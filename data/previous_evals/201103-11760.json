   "comments": [
    "The thing about this class is that it's actually a lot of work. Maybe like 1 1\/2 to 2 hours every night toward the beginning of the semester and 1 to 1\/2 hours every night toward the end of the semester. However, the work is totally worth it. You will learn a lot of French, and the overall environment is not super stressful. Taking this class is a very rewarding experience.",
    "Yes if you need to take L3 French.",
    "There is work every night, but I never felt it was unnecessary. I would absolutely recommend the course. Great chance to really improve your french.",
    "L3 is definitely a lot of work, but definitely worth it if you want to get to know the language well. All of the instructors are great, and the department is very willing to help you. The only frustrating part is trying to get the section you want, but other than that definitely take it. The books and movies are actually pretty good!",
    "I would not recommend 130 unless you have to take it. The french department is super anal about attendance and you don't improve that much to have to be in class five days a week.",
    "Great class. I was originally not excited to take it as we had to meet every day, but in retrospect i am so glad that i did. it kept me disciplined. try to get Kathleen Burton! She's awesome.",
    "I would definitely recommend this French course. Dr. Burton is an excellent teacher who is not overly strict or overbearing but is strict enough to diligently check homework assignments. She makes the class engaging and interesting by having the right balance of grammar, class discussion, and test preparation. She has also had us play educational games during class - which was a nice change. The material for the class is really interesting, especially l'\u00c9tranger and Jules et Jim. Although it is a fair amount of work each night, I really enjoyed this class and would recommend it to another student who really wants to improve in French. If you do take it, take it with Dr. Burton - she really knows how to motivate the students and will definitely make the class an engaging experience.",
    "If you want to learn French, take 130. The professors are all pretty solid. Burton was great. There are only about half as many tests as 110 and 120, and you read some great literature and watch interesting films.",
    "A class that builds on the L1 and L2 material. Not much new grammar, but the curriculum is based on books and films rather than the French in Action videos. I would definitely recommend this class to those wanting to improve their French language skills.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student. Especially with Ms. Burton, who is a solid teacher. There is a significant amount of homework every night, which is pretty straightforward, but does take at least 30 minutes to an hour every night. If you do all the homework, this is a good class that will prepare you for level 4."
