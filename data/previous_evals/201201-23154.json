   "comments": [
    "I'd super recommend this course to people who think they might be interested in the topic\u0097it's obviously probably boring if you're not otherwise interested, but the course raised some really cool issues of language use and language change, and taught me a lot about a set of topics I didn't know much about previously. It seemed like that was the case for most people in the class. The readings and discussion were accessible without being boring, which has been rare in my experience.",
    "I really liked it. It's a nice combination of hearing from a very knowledgeable professor and your peers. The readings are interesting, and manageable and the final project is a fun way to explore a language that interests you!",
    "If you're actively interested in and engaged with the topic, you'll enjoy it. However, you'll only get out what you put in. There's a lot of reading, but you're better served by skimming and sampling than trying to do all of it.",
    "Endangered languages is great. Not a ton of work but still interesting material. The research paper is really fun to write and the readings give different perspectives on a lot of dying languages.",
    "A linguistic anthropological look at language death in its cultural context. Readings are great, but discussion is often somewhat stilted. A significant portion of the class is devoted to an independent project, and the last few weeks of class are just student presentations, no reading. All in all, class discussion can be dull sometimes, but if you are interested in a specific endangered language or even just a particular part of the world, this class is a great chance to focus that interest.",
    "Studying the way languages become endangered is so cool. This was a really fun class. It will likely be a seminar, which is great, because then Errington places less emphasis on the course reading and more emphasis on just letting you discuss the material. I really loved having everyone in the class pick an endangered language and give a presentation on it -- it was really cool to learn about these languages from students who were genuinely interested in them. The work for the class is not heavy at all -- it's really just the 12 to 15-page final paper, which won't be hard to write if you start in time. I was a little worried about writing it having never conducted Anthro research or written an Anthro research paper before, but I learned some techniques over the course of the class from the studies we read about, and Errington was there to answer every question and email I sent his way. The reading is (very) light and really interesting. If you're interested in languages\/language policy\/applied linguistics or anthro, take this class."
