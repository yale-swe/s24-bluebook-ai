   "comments": [
    "Yes, take this class! It's a lot of work, but worth it if you want to understand music on a more sophisticated technical level, andbegin to recognize musical tropes and techniques of the classical period.",
    "Very little analysis, lots of composition. That seemed daunting to me at first, as I'd never composed anything before, but the class is structured so that you're guided through the process. I'm much more confident about taking composition classes now. Stuart's great.",
    "MUSI 210 begins with an introduction to counterpoint and ends with writing your own exposition to a sonata. The class isn't easy but incredibly rewarding and I would suggest taking it.",
    "I would recommend this course if you are interested in learning about composition - it does not take a ton of work, but a lot of the work requires some amount of focus so avoid taking this course unless you are interested in the material.",
    "Composition from counterpoint to 18th century sonata.Very little analysis, almost all composition. Loosely following the first half of Aldwell and Schachter.Composition could be a lot of work depending on your level of experience. Just make sure you know what you're getting yourself into. It's not an easy workload, especially if you want to do well in it.",
    "I would definitely take it if you have any interest in theory or learning to compose music. The class was very well structured, and Dr. Duncan was an excellent TA!",
    "I would recommend strongly. Take if you want to compose.",
    "I really enjoyed Music 210; it was a great follow-up to Music 205. It strengthened concepts I learned in 205 and transferred the focus from analysis to actually writing and composing in the styles examined in Music 205. Since I'm interested in composition, this was great. In my class, we covered classical music era's ranging from species counterpoint in the Renaissance through Bach, the Galante period, and ended with studying Sonata Theory from the classical period. In each general unit, assignments focused on writing exercises that mimicked the styles we were studying. We also had a portfolio project due at the end of the year where we had to write a Bach Chorale, a theme and variation set in the Galante style, and the exposition to a sonata. Overall, it was a lot of work but worth it. Dr. D (Professor Stuart Duncan) was an AWESOME professor! He was a very funny guy, very passionate about the material, and totally committed to helping us learn. Our class had a great time! If you get the chance to take a theory class with Dr. D, I would highly recommend it!",
    "I would recommend Music 210 for those looking to learn how to compose in certain styles, such as Galant. While I learned a lot about composing in general, the focus was always on making it stylistic to the time we were learning about. Though it was a lot of work, Dr. Duncan was great, and the class definitely helped me grow as a musician",
    "Music 210 with Dr. Duncan is extremely assignment-heavy -- you'll be doing hours of model compositions and related assignments a week, but it's a very high-rewarding class as well. If you're not ready for this to be the most labor and time-intensive class you take in the semester, it's probably not the right time to take it. You'll learn a ton, but you have to pick things up quickly. A lot of weight is placed on composing in the styles of the music we're studying so you have to be simultaneously absorbing musical styles and compositional formulas and rules. Dr. Duncan is super good about meeting with people outside of class if they need it and he was very conscious about giving us some fun classes especially towards the end of the semester. If you're interested in furthering your theory and composition skills, definitely take this, but be aware that it's a lot of work! (But you'll walk away with some great compositional experience!)",
    "MUSI 210 is a challenging but rewarding class. It provides a very strong foundation to composition, and Dr. Duncan makes the class both enjoyable and comprehensive. Considering the amount of work required for this class, perhaps it is recommended to be taken if one is considering a music major or is really interested in pursuing composition. In the end, it is very satisfying and rewarding to have several original works."
