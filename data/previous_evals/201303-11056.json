    "This class is an overview of useful grammar needed to become a better Spanish speaker and writer. Sybil is an amazing, caring, patient teacher with a great sense of humor. She'll answer any question you have and may even help create a sense of community in your section. Also, the workload is nothing to worry about. If you're going to take this class, take it with Sybil Alexandrov.",
    "If you're taking 120, take it with Sybil Alexandrov. She's the best.",
    "Definitely. If you can take it with Alexandrov, DO IT. She was by far my favorite professor this semester. She is AWESOME. Super nice, funny, engaging, enthusiastic, incredibly helpful, and fun to interact with. She taught all of the material effectively and was great at making the class full of interaction that made the class fly by.",
    "I'd recommend it."
