    "PHYS 261 is higher level physics involving an extensive study of quantum mechanics and general relativity (with some E&M in the beginning). Ultimately, I wouldn't recommend this course to other students unless they were sure they were interested in studying these subjects in the future. It doesn't seem to be very relevant to students of other majors.",
    "This is definitely one of the best physics courses available to freshmen. Although GR and tensor analysis can sometimes seem a little intimidating, it is totally worth taking the class. You will have a solid overview of several rigorous topics in physics and cosmology. The only weakness of this course is probably the fact that sometimes, it tends to get very mathematical, which means you will spend a lot of time deriving a result rather than understanding the physics behind it. Nevertheless, I encourage you to take this course if you are into physics. In addition, I think Baltay is an amazing professor and the way he can teach and convey physical insight and understanding is phenomenal.",
    "Do not take this course unless you have done diff eq and tensor analysis. Otherwise, this will be more memorization than actually understanding stuff. Imho, after phys 260 go directly to mechanics\/EM advanced courses or drop down to 201. this class simply will not contribute to your physics development.",
    "Physics 261 is an OK course, although nowhere near as good as Physics 260. The time spent on relativistic electrodynamics and general relativity is essentially wasted time, since Physics 261 strips them of all the mathematical elegance that makes them interesting. The other segments (EM waves, modern physics, Schrodinger's equation, etc.) are all fairly good though.",
    "Difficult and few resources for help. You're totally on your own. Lecture is boring. You should already know vector calculus and it might be good to already know the physics material as well.",
    "You're taking this because you took 260 and enjoyed it, and you won't be disappointed! Baltay does it again, this time with quantum mechanics and general relativity. The tests are just like the first semester, maybe a little easier, and the homeworks are much much easier than E and M. This makes the class pretty easy in terms of workload, so you can sit back and enjoy the ride. The lectures are really entertaining and the material is fascinating, so pay attention! You'll enjoy it.",
    "Would recommend. Great introduction to modern day physics.",
    "Slightly different from 260 in that the material is more abstract, being quantum mechanics and relativity, and that it's covered much quicker. If you've taken 260 you know what you're getting into. Baltay can be a bit hand wavy at times when talking about gr, but for the most part he does a good job of introducing the material and making it interesting, and accessible.",
    "I understand this class has lots of fanboys (and let's be real, they're all boys because there are about two women in this class -- great job, Yale), but I happen to think it shouldn't exist. Phys 261 covers quantum mechanics and GR. As anyone who has ever heard of either of those subjects knows, they're both complex subjects. This is precisely why Yale has classes dedicated to each of them. Phys 440-441 (or alternatively, 439) is about quantum, and Phys 538 is about GR. Baltay is a pompous old troll who believes he can teach at least 3 semesters' worth of material in one semester. Turns out, he can't. The quantum section ends up being two weeks' of him deriving the uncertainty principle from a Fourier expansion of a Gaussian wave packet -- which most of the class, being quite unfamiliar with Fourier analysis, did not understand -- and two weeks of him trying to solve the Schroedinger equation for the Hydrogen atom using spherical harmonics -- which most of the class, never having heard of Legendre polynomials, did not understand. The GR section is basically a month of index gymnastics and Christoffel symbols (which no one understands). Baltay realizes that no one understands the meat of the course, so the midterm and final only go over the most basic \"boxed equations\" without even skimming the theory. My question, I guess, is why does this course exist? Everyone who matters is going to take Quantum and GR later anyway, so what's the point? Is this just another attempt to massage the egos of ~70 obnoxious freshmen mansplainers who already think they're God's gift to physics and surely don't need any more encouragement?",
    "While the course is at times interesting, it is nearly entirely theoretical physics that is not at all applicable to any engineering or non-physics majors. If you are not a physics major, it is most definitely in your best interest to take a different physics course.",
    "Physics 261 goes into very esoteric topics in physics, but is extremely fun to learn. Baltay goes at a good pace and makes sure that the class is following him.",
    "If you are reading this, you probably took 260. 261 is certainly harder, but it is definitely worth continuing.",
    "Physics 261 was completed what was a solid introduction to physics. I enjoyed being exposed to quantum mechanics and some additional topics in E&M, and felt that these subjects were the strength of the course. In terms of workload, Physics 261 is quite light; the textbook for the class is basically at a high school level, and so p-sets take no time at all. This also means that there are fewer resources to use to prepare for the exams, which aren't like the homework at all. The tests are pretty reasonable, though. 261 is different from 260 in some important ways, however. The material is harder, and also less well-organized. Because the textbook was useless, we were more or less reliant on Baltay's notes. This led to some difficulties in the treatment of modern physics. For instance, I was often frustrated with Professor Baltay's \"derivations,\" as he often made it very unclear what was actually to be interpreted as a derivation, and what was to be thought of as a plausibility argument. He never really differentiated between the two, and that meant that some of the more interesting \"derivations\" ended up being very hand-wavy and unclear. This problem especially pervaded the coverage of general relativity, which I found quite frustrating: it was more like we were learning Baltay's version of the subject, highly abridged and full of unexplained magic, and the pace at which this material was covered made for a painful experience. Consequently, some of the topics I was most excited to cover were disappointing. So, all in all, it's a pretty good class, but not as good as you might hope from looking at the syllabus. I feel I have a solid foundation in physics, but was disappointed with a lot of the course.",
    "Don't worry, the midterm and final are easy.",
    "Physics 261 is very different from 260. Where 260 was all stuff you've seen before, 261 is completely new. Be prepared to be presented with some fresh concepts and different ways of thinking. The PSETs are still manageable, and so are the exams. The final and the midterm were both fine as long as you study from the textbook and your notes and redo the problem sets. 261 is difficult, but afterwards, you'll have a great understanding of Modern Physics.",
    "This class will not be as easy as Physics 260, but you'll learn so much more. Baltay is very good at explaining the EM-wave stuff and quantum mechanics, and the textbook is also great for those topics. He'll probably lose you in the general relativity stuff, but the problem sets are easy and the GR questions on the final are essentially from the problem sets. I left the class having done very well on the final, even though I don't feel like I understand GR at all. Overall, completely manageable problem sets and exams, but you'll spend a bit more time understanding the ideas than you did in 260.",
    "Great class. You cover electromagnetic radiation, followed by a very condensed quantum mechanism chapter and, finally, general relativity. General relativity will be a pain to understand, but it\u2019s very satisfying once you do (note: you will still not be able to understand all of it; some of it is just incomprehensible if you don\u2019t master the tools that lie at its foundation). The non-general relativity psets will be a cakewalk, because they are only computational stuff and do not really reflect class material that well. The exams this year were fairly easy, but you never know how hard Baltay will make them next year. Take this class if you loved Baltay in PHYS 260 and are prepared to explore much more difficult but also much more engaging avenues of physics.",
    "I recommend this class to anyone with sufficient interest and preparation in physics and math. If you've taken the first semester you know the drill by now, weekly book problems and one midterm. However, this semester Baltay becomes a bit more difficult to follow, he does the same kind of hand-wavy derivations as first semester, except that the material is much more difficult to follow; more rigor would definitely have helped. Since our level of understanding is lower, having the rigor to lean on would have helped, since this is many students' first exposure to quantum mechanics and the tensor analysis of general relativity.",
    "Physics 261 is a great class. Covering some electromagnetic, quantum mechanics, and intro general relativity, the topics in the class depart significantly from those covered in AP physics or 260. Given how difficult these topics are, at time some explanations were a little hand-wavy, but especially with general relativity, Baltay usually finds an analogy or thought experiment to make the concepts\/math a little less confusing. Most psets were comparable in length to those of 260, and the test were difficult but mostly fair (the quantum mechanics unit is a little scattered, so the midterm covers some material that was only skimmed over in class). Overall, if you could do 260 and are willing to work through the feeling of being completely lost on first being introduced to tensor analysis, then I'd definitely recommend 261.",
    "If you took 260, you know how the class runs. It's harder this semester because electromagnetic radiation, quantum mechanics, and general relativity are probably not things you have seen before, and Baltay's extremely theoretical and mathy lectures are not likely to lead to much understanding..his off-color anecdotes and geddankenexperiments are funny and awesome but are too few and far between to make up for lectures in which the derivations are prewritten in his hand. Supplement heavily with the well-written Modern Physics textbook and conversations with classmates and physics majors lest you fall into profound apathy about the class like I did, and during GR learn tensor notation early from whomever can explain it to you! Don't sit in ignorance until reading period and the end of the semester will go much better.",
    "Take it if you are sufficiently versed in introductory level physics. It is a nice course in the sense that you don't have to spend so much time in solving tiny problems. But the part on general relativity will cause much headache and despair.",
    "Great continuation course--don't be daunted by the general relativity, as most people are starting anew and it's certainly one of the most interesting and philosophical topics in physics.",
    "As I said in my review for the class: The first couple of p-sets are extremely hard and made a third of our class drop out. Some people were guessing that Baltay kept the same exercise numbers from the previous year's p-sets, and did not care about the change of the books' edition, which made us get ridiculously hard questions (as the numbers changed from the 2nd to the 3rd edition of Griffiths). Quantum was ok and got a lot better after a group of students told Baltay we weren't understanding a word of what he said. The textbook has nothing to do with whatever Baltay taught us. However, Krane is a lot conceptual and is very helpful when we get lost in Baltay's math, because we usually miss a lot on important concepts when Baltay starts deriving non-sense equations on the board. But, somehow, I wished our p-sets had more to do with what we were learning in class. The p-sets were falling behind of what we were learning and had a lot of useless computation. In short, they didn't prepare us for the exams. General Relativity was pointless. It was half of semester that we could have used to learn stuff such as hamiltonian mechanics, thermodynamics, optics etc. Baltay says he's going to teach you tensor analysis. Don't believe him. It got to a point where nobody could understand whatever he was talking about. We got lost in tensor analysis as much as he did. He's extremely sloppy with upper and lower indices. Preparing for the final was hellish, because we basically had to memorize his notes, otherwise we wouldn't know how to solve the final's problems (they were basically: give me the derivation of this metric, or give the derivation of this tensor). We were joking that we would have chosen a history class if we knew we would have to memorize so much anyway. Side note: not even the TAs knew general relativity, so we were hopeless about learning anything. The final was a memory test. Even if we did poorly, we wouldn't feel too bad, because it wasn't testing our reasoning capacities, but rather how much time we had to memorize his notes. At the end of the day, a lot of physics major were discouraged, because they felt like the class was completely pointless. You learn something up to the middle of the semester. Afterwards, we just forgot about it.",
    "A fun and easy introduction to quantum mechanics followed by a more confusing introduction to general relativity. Great lectures with handy notes that the professor writes out fully on the board for the class. Reasonable homework and tests. Easier than Physics 260's section on electromagnetism.",
    "It's a good intro physics class, relative to the other ones offered. Not much workload-wise, but a lot to wrap your brain around.",
    "PHYS 261 was, for me, more enjoyable than 260. The content covered was more difficult, yes, but also more relevant to modern physics. We studied the wave equation, Schrodinger, atmoic physics, four-vector calculus and general relativity. Though I admit our coverage of these topics was very superficial, I appreciated the introduction to the theories that I, as an astrophysics major, may someday use in my everyday job. Baltay isn't always completely clear in his instruction, which contributes to the difficulty of the class, but still explains most concepts in understandable ways that I found manageable. If you did well in 260, or did badly in 260 but enjoyed it, take 261.",
    "This class is a good introduction to quantum mechanics and techniques in general relativity. However, the \"modern physics\" section is reminiscent of high school physics. The problem sets are not difficult, although the exams require a lot of studying. This is a good introductory course, although not necessary for a physics education overall.",
    "It's a taste of some extremely complex, difficult physics - but if you're interested in it, definitely worthwhile.",
    "Amazing course. The opportunity to study quantum physics and general relativity in an introductory physics course is unique and wonderful. The material was very well presented, Professor Baltay did a decent job staying away from the tricky maths, and problem sets and tests were reasonable. I would have liked to spend a little more time on cosmology, and a little less on the details of the general relativity derivations, but all the same, this was one of the best courses I've taken here. Take this course.",
    "Physics 261 is a crown jewel of the Yale physics department. Covering Quantum Mechanics and General Relativity to a fair bit of detail, getting to a point where you understand some of the main concepts in both fields: that\u2019s really impressive. And while you acquire a grasp of modern physics, you have a great time doing it. Professor Baltay is a master lecturer, truly concerned with ensuring that his lectures stay with you. This class is easily one of my favorites at Yale; I would even go as far as saying that this class is the reason you take Physics 260. So yes, I recommend it wholeheartedly.",
    "If you have taken 260, you will know how well you can perform. There is a lot of material that you may not have seen before, but it is very manageable, and I had a lot of fun. Take it!",
    "I would recommend this class only if you know math well and are passionate about physics. It's definitely challenging.",
    "If you're looking at 261, you already know what you're in for. The course material is much harder than last semester, but the homeworks and tests are not significantly more difficult. Also, GR and Quantum are awesome!",
    "Yes, I would absolutely recommend this class without hesitation. It\u2019s electromagnetic radiation, quantum mechanics, and general relativity in a semester! What more could you ask for? And if Professor Baltay\u2019s teaching it, you\u2019re in for a real treat, as you probably already know from last semester. His clear explanations of even complicated physics and his organized structuring of the course material, along with his passion for the subject and his great sense of humor, really went a long way in making the class such a terrific experience. He is also incredibly patient, helpful, and approachable; once we spent almost two hours in his office after lecture talking about my questions about quantum. I also thought he did an excellent job motivating the material and connecting the dots from topic to topic to really give us a comprehensive big-picture overview of the physics. From the very first two days of the first semester, when he presented us with his vision of what physics is all about, how it is organized, and what its major frontiers are at the moment, I knew that the class would be an unbelievable experience. Over the course of the two semesters, I gained not only a better understanding of each of the topics in physics that we discussed but also a greater appreciation for how they all fit together and how they respond to the fundamental questions physics asks about the nature of the universe and the interactions that govern it. He mentioned at the beginning of the year that the goal of the class is to introduce us to and get us excited about all of the physics that\u2019s out there for us to explore, and from my perspective he did all of that and more. Phenomenal class and phenomenal professor. Enough said.",
    "An advanced course, but one right for someone who took AP Physics C, and has multivariable experience. Much more confusing than 260, but very rewarding and cooler. Abstract and lecture is sometimes just a blank. Psets are very easy, and midterm and exam are fair. Baltay is great."
