    "I would recommend it to anyone who wants to become fluent in Italian. If you're not going to go to Italy anytime soon, and don't really have a place to use the language, then I wouldn't recommend this course, as it can get kind of old after a while.",
    "Yes, absolutely. Though my speaking skills generally stayed the same it was a fun class and necessary to get to the more fun L5 classes.",
    "It is a pretty good class. A feasible workload and fun.",
    "Eh. If you love Italian do. But I think the syllabus needs revising.",
    "The class was absolutely terrible. The curriculum was useless and horrible. I hated class time, and wish it would be drastically changed. Francesco was a nice teacher, but he didn't shine with the horrible curriculum. Easily the worst planned class I took at Yale. Only take it if you love Petrarca and Dante."
