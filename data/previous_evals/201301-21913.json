   "comments": [
    "Honestly if you have the chance to go with another professor I probably would. I thought it was fine and my speaking did improve but I think I would have had a better experience with a nicer and more equitable professor.",
    "Portuguese 120 is a great course to continue learning the language of Portuguese. It is essential that students become more comfortable with speaking and applying the language throughout this course.",
    "I would most definitely recommend this class to a fellow student. If you are thinking of taking L2, you presumable took L1 in the fall and thus need to take L2 as a continuation. I think that only in my second term of Portuguese did I begin to feel a little bit more comfortable with the language and feel like I expanded my vocabulary to words other than the basics.",
    "a little vocab, some good movies some bad movies and a lot of grammar.",
    "Harder than L1, but still a good class.",
    "Yes. Great Course. Straightforward and easy to understand the material.",
    "If you're planning to learn Portuguese and started with 110, this is what you will take. Have fun and go to the lunches and speak as much as you can!",
    "Although it's just L2, this class with Marta isn't treated like an intro class. Be ready to speak a lot of Portuguese every class and to be expected to write perfect compositions and answers on tests. Also, it's really really beneficial for this section to speak Spanish already, or you'll probably miss half of what Marta says.",
    "Portuguese 120 is the tail end of the introductory Portuguese course. The course covers several additional vocabulary units and rounds out the study of Portuguese grammar. The workload is very light, with only 1-2 short homework assignments due per week and a test or paper of moderate difficulty every 2-3 weeks. Instruction focuses on the textbook and is almost entirely in Portuguese. Additional oral instruction is also entirely in Portuguese, which can make understanding of some concepts, vocabulary, and homework assignments quite challenging. Since the workload is very light, it's important to be self-motivated if you really want to learn enough vocabulary and grammar in order to carry on a complex conversation."
