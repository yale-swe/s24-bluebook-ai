   "comments": [
    "Its math that makes you better at econ. If you want to do econ, you're going to do some sort of math like this so it makes sense to either take this course or a higher level course.",
    "basic, hopefully you'll have a better teacher",
    "Don't take this. Take 115, 120 or something higher. You hardly spend time on subjects and the problem sets are annoying especially for the Linear Algebra portion of the course.",
    "Basically, you cover the basics of linear algebra and multivariable in one semester. Although it is advertised as providing applications to the social sciences, don't be fooled. The only thing we covered relevant to econ, for example, was lagrange multipliers, and still only for a class. Fairly easy overall, but in retrospect I should have taken 112 or 115 again, because the problem sets were unnecessarily hard sometimes.",
    "Yeah. I would choose 118 over 115 any day.",
    "I would because the classes are smaller and getting out of mainstream basic math classes is probably a plus. 115 and 120 sounded like death, and this was just a step up for sure.",
    "This is really a lame excuse for a math course. You don't do real math work. It is actually a pity because it starts to get interesting and then you're done with that topic. What a let down!",
    "Math 118 is a course you probably have to take for economics if you\u0092re readingthis. The problem sets range form taking 2 hours to taking 5 hours. Be sure to go to all of the classes and read the chapters to understand what\u0092s happening in the class. I cannot stress enough how important it is to read the chapters before and after going to class. I did this only at the end, when it was time for finals, and it was really late. Besides that, this class isn\u0092t too bad. Just study hard, practice a lot, work on your problem sets, and you\u0092ll do well. Mara Neusel is an okay teacher\u0097not great, not bad. She mumbles to the board a lot, but she is really nice. Don\u0092t be afraid to ask her questions in class because she\u0092s really nice and would be willing to stop and explain something to you.",
    "The first half is on linear algebra and the second half is on multivariable calculus.",
    "Take it if you don't intend to go on in math. If you do, or you think you might, probably don't take this class.",
    "I would recommend it to someone who wanted to take a math class in college but was not going to pursue an academic career in mathematics.",
    "Don't take it unless you're econ",
    "This class was very ineffective as a math course directed towards economics majors. We didn't learn enough about either linear algebra or multivariable, let alone the practical applications of the material. For example, we learned optimization like the second to last week of class and spent very little time on it. My general sense is that both the econ and math departments think this class is a waste, and I agree. This class is a good idea in theory, but the execution is terrible. I would not recommend it and regret taking it.",
    "This is the get-ready-for-all-of-econ math class, and it sort of does the trick at that. It skips some of the really important math things you need to learn for econ, like Lagrange multipliers and differential equations. And if you want to do more math, you should do 120 so you can go on to other things. This gives you mainly linear algebra with some multivariable thrown in as well.Neusel is kind of crazy, but sweet in her own way. You can sort of learn from her in class, or you can just read the textbook.The class isn't too hard, just weekly problem sets that take 3-4 hours at tops, sometimes more like 2.",
    "I would recommend it if they want a basic knowledge of the two subjects.",
    "Very good class for those looking to be done with math courses, but still learn the basics of multi and linear. Teaches basics of linear algebra and multi-variable calc. Not good for intended math majors who want to learn each in greater detail.",
    "Math 118 is a good combination of linear algebra and mutli-variable calculus that gives students a good introduction\/overview of both topics. However, I did not feel like multi-variable calculus went much further than what I already knew from previous econ classes. It's definitely a helpful class for social science and econ majors though.",
    "It's a math class and it really depends on the teacher you get. The Math Department seems to marginalize the class and assigns sub-par professors to teach the class. As a result, it is the rare Math 118 student who ends up taking another math class while at Yale.",
    "I would not. Take 120 instead. 118 is just as poorly taught, and teaches you nothing."
