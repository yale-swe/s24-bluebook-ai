    "Well, yeah, sure. Do the year-long senior project\/essay; you'll get more out of it.",
    "Seminar designated for yearlong AMST essayists and artists undertaking creative projects (writers, composers, filmmakers, etc). Highly recommended for essayists; also recommended for those undertaking creative projects, although those seniors are advised to form a game plan early on with any other creative project seniors as far as meeting elsewhere during certain classes devoted to essay writing\/revision, etc.",
    "I'm not sure that I'd go through the process of writing a year-long senior essay again - it was way emotionally tougher than I thought it'd be. In my case, my advisor was not very supportive, and by the time I had really defined my topic (middle of first semester), I didn't have time to access the kind of materials and sources that I would have liked. That being said, Alison was the one beacon of light throughout this entire experience! She was so kind and understanding, and super helpful, too. The class itself was useful for providing structure to the essay-writing process; but the best part of it was that Alison was always available to meet with us outside of class to work with us one-on-one. She's probably not teaching this again, but if she is, get excited! Recommendations: (1) think really carefully before deciding on year-long because it's harder than you can possibly imagine (2) get ready over the summer, because you have to hit the ground running (3) pick a good advisor! do your research ahead of time, and make sure it's someone who will actually read your work.",
    "If you want to take the year-long, you have to take this colloquium. It could really be very productive if you do your primary research over the summer, secondary research in fall, and just write and edit in the spring. If you feel you need something of importance to add to the canon, start EARLY and really hone your relationship with your adviser. This way, the last month can be spent in editing. Workshopping with other people is not always helpful, but this class gives you deadlines and a graduate student adviser with whom to bounce off ideas.",
    "You should definitely enroll in this course if you're planning on doing an independent thesis, whether it be an essay or a project! It's taught by a different grad student each year I assume, but Alison was excellentvery helpful when needed but also not overbearing when you just needed time to work. The workshopping element might be more\/less productive depending on what your thesis is, but it's pretty low key either way. And the best part is probably getting to know your fellow AMST majors and their projects!"
