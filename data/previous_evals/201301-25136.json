    "TAKE IT. I learned so much, and it was a completely enjoyable process. This was the first class ever where I couldn't wait to do the readings and actually thought about them in my spare time. And Professor Granoff is absolutely incredible - hearing her speak about the material (with unbelievable expertise) is such a privilege. Plus, the papers were pretty fun and totally manageable, even alongside a busy schedule!",
    "Class is not set up like a lecture, a small class setting where you are basically guided through the main texts relevant to Hinduism. Professor Granoff is great and the course is not too much work- 2 papers and discussion grade. Take it!",
    "Yes, I definitely recommend it. It's a window into a different culture, and Professor Granoff is such a good teacher.",
    "Being unfamiliar with this subject I greatly enjoyed the readings, the professor, and the course. You will too.",
    "Take this class!!! Professor Granoff is a kind and wonderful professor, and is filled with profound insights that will make you view the world in a different way. The material is fascinating, and every class discussion was a thoroughly enjoyable experience. The workload is minimal (only two 5 page papers) and the papers were actually pretty fun to write. Even if you haven't been interested in Hinduism before, try out this class and you will come to have a deep appreciation for it.",
    "Yes! This is a great introductory class.",
    "Yes! Take it! Not that much work and you learn a lot about one of the most popular religions in the world.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. It was very interesting, and professor was very engaged in the material",
    "Yes, take it if you're interested. The workload is manageable (just 2 short essays), Prof. Granoff is great and always gives helpful feedback, and there's a trip to the art gallery. You definitely don't need to know anything about Hinduism or south Asia to succeed in this class. Strongly recommend!",
    "Would absolutely recommend."
