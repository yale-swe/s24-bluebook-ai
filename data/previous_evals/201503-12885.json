    "CGSC 390 is great. It's not required, but it counts towards your depth and it's a fun way to learn more about anything cog sci you're interested in. It's nice to learn cog sci in a seminar format too. Mark is great. Also, the final paper can be a nice stepping stone to a thesis in giving you the opportunity to do the necessary background research for credit. I don't see any downsides to taking this class.",
    "Take it without a question. It counts towards the depth requirement, you get to meet the other kids in the major, and you get exposure to a bunch of different fields of cognitive science that may or may not be related to your depth plan, but you might also get the chance to propose topics so that the whole class might end up discussing your depth plan! The work consists of weekly reading responses (as time-consuming as you want them to be) and a final paper at the end of the year, which takes some time but is a great way to transition into the actual hands-on research that you might end up conducting as a senior.",
    "This course - designed for CogSci majors - was great. It was kind of like Intro CogSci's older, more mature cousin. Each week, we discussed new, cutting-edge research in a particular field of cognitive science that we had read the week previous. The weekly readings and reading responses were really fascinating. It's a good opportunity to review a bunch of different applications of CogSci before you really start honing into a potential senior thesis topic. One of the most enjoyable parts of the seminar was getting to know other people in my major through the weekly discussions. Also, since a lot of CogSci courses are larger lecture courses, this was a great opportunity to build a closer relationship with a professor (and Professor Sheskin was great!). If you take this class, bear in mind that most of your grade is based on your final paper -- it's the only turned-in\/graded assignment of the whole semester. Do not leave it to the final moment, and bear in mind that it requires a substantial amount of research.",
    "A fantastic class, especially with Mark. It is basically intro cog sci, seminar style, so you learn about a different topic each week and come in and share your thoughts with other cog sci juniors. It is a really nice way to meet others in the major, and you will learn so much from Mark and from your peers. You will find yourself even more excited to be a cog sci major and it is also a really great way to get started thinking about your thesis by exploring new themes and also doing a literature review or even an empirical study as your final project (the only assignment in the class other than weekly reading responses)",
    "Good survey of different topics in cog sci, especially if you're a cog sci major and haven't completely figured out what cog sci is yet.",
    "Yes, a great history and also current subjects overview that also goes in depth.",
    "This class isnt technically required for the major, but I definitely suggest that all Cogsci majors take this class. It meets once a week for ~2 hours, you have weekly readings and reading responses and a final paper\/presentation. No midterm, no final exam. Professor Sheskin is a really flexible and understanding professor. For example, I handed in a draft for the final paper a day after the deadline and he was chill. At the beginning of the semester Sheskin asks everyone to email topic suggestions to him so he can begin to craft the syllabus. Then he sends out a survey to the class where you pick the topics youre most interested in, and he takes those survey results to make the final syllabus. When I took the class, we had readings about evolution, language, development, meta-issues in cogsci, the future of cogsci, morality, artificial intelligence, and user interfaces. If you like seminar style classes and want to take a class with below average workload, this is a good one for you."
