   "comments": [
    "This course takes the American Civil War as a case study to understand the body in pain as visualized in representation. Learning the history of the war was complicated by adding the layer of the visual. As the bloodiest war on American soil, the Civil War offered a unique and fertile climate for new and unexpected kinds of visual representations to emerge, including war photography, genre bending history paintings, and many others.I would recommend this course to another student without a doubt. It was the best seminar I've taken at Yale. It strengthened my self-confidence as a student, researcher, and budding scholar with its small size and ample opportunity for discussion and presentation of original work. Jenny provided a comfortable yet rigorous atmosphere that encouraged me to produce my best thoughts and work.",
    "This is an excellent course to take if only because it brings together so many different \"fields\" of potential research. Whether you're an Americanist, in Film and Media Studies, or you work on the long 19th century--or even are from History or the History of Science and Medicine--there's something here for you. Definitely take it.",
    "The course has a great amount of appeal to anyone who is interested in the history of photography because it delves into most of the essential literature, but it should also be of interest to any student who is interested in art historical questions pertaining to depictions of warfare and the human body. For these reasons the course has broad appeal for students working in fields outside of American art."

   "comments": [
    "I've been interested in photography for quite some time now and this course allowed me to explore my interests with more rigor and depth. I was also able to discuss difficult critical texts in an open and engaging environment and interact with primary materials in new and exciting ways this term. I feel more confident in my abilities to research, analyze, and build solid arguments from my time in the course.",
    "I was able to develop my understanding of philosophical and art historical approaches to understanding the body \"in extremis.\" Even better, I was able to read a variety of works that deal with questions of responding to the body under such forces, and of mediating the fact of bodily pain or death.",
    "The course contributed a lot to my own understanding of both the history\/theory of photography and nineteenth century media, both of which are relevant to my own interests."
