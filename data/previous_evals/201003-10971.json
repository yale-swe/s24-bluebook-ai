   "comments": [
    "Great course, highly recommended to pretty much anyone interested in biophysics. I liked that it was a survey course yet went into enough detail for me to appreciate some of the recurring themes. Learning Matlab was very useful, especially the homework sets where we analyzed real (or fake) data.",
    "If you are out to find the application of physics in biology, this might be a course to take. The additional consideration is if you are a biologist, you must brace yourself for a lot of physical topics that are well beyond high school and basic college physics.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this class for someone from a Physics background or who already finished Mathematical Methods.",
    "This class focuses on statistical mechanics (random walks, diffusion, statistical treatment of entropy, free energy and Arrhenius kinetics), with a number of other topics (fluid dynamics, solution electrostatics, cooperativity) mixed in. Biological examples abound for all of these, but it is the physical basis that's emphasized. The instructor and the text are both very good. Programming (MATLAB) is integral to most of the assignments for the course, however, it is possible to take it even without prior knowledge of programming."

   "comments": [
    "One of my interests is in the exploration of the intersection between computation, theory and experiment. This course fits into a piece of that puzzle by looking at biological phenomena from the physics point of view - that things can be quantified and\/or unified into rules and laws of nature.Some of the ways of looking at biology from physics are sometimes revelational to me.",
    "This class exposed me to how physicists solve biological phenomena\/problems and showed me the standards of reasoning involved in research in biophysics. I believe that the computer programming exercises will help me in the future.",
    "The course material deepened my understanding of molecular biophysics by revealing the physical and statistical underpinnings of a number of biological processes. It also gave me a new and more quantitative perspective on my own research, which I am excited to explore."
