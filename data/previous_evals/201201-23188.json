   "comments": [
    "THis was surprisingly one of my favorite classes this semester. Professor Thomson is so incredibly nice and he puts such an interesting spin on what might seem at first a very quirky topic for an English class. I walked in expecting to get some miserable grade because I hated English, and I walked out with a fairly decent one and I began to remember why someone would actually like English. The course material really challenges you think about things\/words from a different angle and while there is a response required for every class, the readings are almost never boring.",
    "Keywords really evaluates the meaning of words that, though used in daily conversation, are not entirely understood or well-defined. I loved the course because the prompts were not strict and you were free to decide how you wanted to address each essay.",
    "A typical ENGL 114 class. Might be slightly more writing intensive than others with reading responses due for each class. Only take it if the subject matter interests you.",
    "We focused on a number of keywords but some of the keywords were not of interest to me and so I found the readings on those keywords to be a bit of a drag. But no matter how dull the readings were our class room discussions were always interesting and people in the class always had things to say that were not apparent from the readings. I found the class very useful both in terms of improving my skills on close reading of a text and in terms of writing a coherent and well-reasoned essay.",
    "The course covers a wide range of keywords (including culture, euthanasia, family, marriage). Students are also able to propose keywords and Professor Thomas makes an effort to tailor the readings to the interests of the class. The workload consists of 2 readings\/reading responses per week and four papers. Professor Thomas is very helpful and meets individually with each student to provide feedback on rough and final drafts.",
    "Recommend. This is Intro Writing, and if you're handicapped at putting words to paper like I am, then this is the course to take. Otherwise, just go to ENG 120...",
    "I believe ENGL 114 helped improve my ability to write argumentative papers. The topic--Unpacking Keywords--was abstract and it took a while to grasp what was meant by \"keywords\", but at the end, I think it surprisingly opened my mind a bit more to different perspectives. It has the same structure as other ENGL 114 classes: 4 papers. Professor Thomas did assign a reading response (approx. 250 words) due before each class; these became a bit tedious and we didn't receive much feedback on them. (Although I believe Professor Thomas will begin to do that for future classes. He is also not a complete stickler when it comes to turning things in exactly on the dot.) The reading responses were used to fuel class discussion about the readings. The main research paper (the 3rd paper) was done on a keyword on your choosing; use this to your advantage and explore a keyword that interests you. Professor Thomas is an excellent professor to take ENGL 114 with; he has flexible office hours and is very helpful and detailed in his feedback. I found having conversations with him about my ideas was very enlightening; these conversations sometimes lasted an hour+.",
    "This is a great class; Professor Thomas does a wonderful job of teaching and leading discussions. The class is based heavily on analytical reasoning, so think about what you read, what the author's argument is, and whether you are convinced. You will definitely leave the class a better writer\/thinker. This will help you in all of your future classes.The 'key words' theme is very interesting and allows you to learn about different topics, from art and culture to society and anarchy.If you are thinking about taking ENGL 114, I would highly recommend you take this class with Professor Thomas.",
    "This writing seminar was very interactive and the class discussions allowed students to improve thier critical analysis skills. The weekly reading response was also beneficial!",
    "English 114 is a great course for anyone looking to improve their writing. English 120 is the better alternative if you're looking for freer topics and more flexibility in the prompts. For those ofyou looking for more technical writing seminars, English 114 is that course. There's obviously a lot of writing involved, but every bit of it helps you improve!",
    "Great class and great intro to writing at Yale. Take it, but make sure it's a section that you actually find interesting. that will make the difference in how much you truly get out of the class. Shop a few sections would be my best advice."
