    "I learned that babies are far more complex than we give them credit for. This class taught me an unbelievable amount about infant development and was very interesting. Hands down the best seminar I've taken at Yale.",
    "I learned a lot about morality and in-group bias. Every class I walked away excited to tell my suite mates about what we had discussed. I found myself asking and discussing fascinating questions I had never thought of before. I had many \"Wow, that's really cool!\" moments this semester that can be rare to find in other classes.",
    "This class provides fantastic insight on human morality and the nature of in and outgroups through a lens which focuses on children and infants.",
    "We learned so many interesting things about babies and the surprisingly complex types of processing and thought they're capable of!",
    "This course really taught us about groupism and infant morality."

   "comments": [
    "Strengths -- literally everything. If you can get into this class, take it. Professor Wynn is an expert in her field (she ran like half of the studies we read about because she's so freakin' famous). She's also kind, patient, open, and just wonderful in general. The class was so engaging, so interesting, and everyone seemed to come prepared to really talk. We didn't always talk about babies. We often talked about things that were relevant to our lives or things that extend beyond infancy, and the class felt relevant to me at all times. The readings were never too long, since we mostly read scientific studies, and they were always logically organized so that everything fit nicely together. Reading responses were always met with clear and helpful feedback. Weaknesses -- I guess literally the only weakness I can think of is that there isn't a rubric for the final paper, which I wish there were.",
    "Strengths were that we always had a fascinating discussion. In some of my past classes, there have been painful silences when no one has anything to say (or wants to), but in this class, I loved that everyone always wanted to jump in. One weakness was that we didn't get much feedback on how to improve our writing.",
    "I loved this course. It was interesting, fun and left me with a lot to think about.",
    "I thought this was a wonderful course with great discussions and readings each week."

   "comments": [
    "Absolutely. Take it if you can get in. No doubt in my mind that you'll also consider it one of the best classes you've taken at Yale. You'll learn a lot, you'll be able to interact with one of the most knowledgeable people in the field, and you'll have a great time doing it. I have nothing but good things to say about this class.",
    "Take this course! You'll have the most interesting discussions and touch on topics and questions you have never thought of before. Professor Wynn is amazing - very energetic, thoughtful, kind, and smart.",
    "If you have any interest in social or developmental psychology take this course. You will learn a lot about human nature and have a lot of fun. Professor Wynn is kind, caring and engaging and strikes a perfect balance between talking and letting students speak during class. The readings are interesting and extremely manageable. This was the best seminar I have taken at Yale.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. Not only were the readings always thought-provoking, class discussion was extremely engaging and Professor Wynn facilitated conversations with ideas and questions that I still continue to ponder over even now. It was a great course for developing thinking skills and learning a lot about a topic you'd have little opportunity to learn about elsewhere.",
    "Yes absolutely. Professor Wynn is a wonderful, very knowledgeable professor and I really enjoyed the way she conducted each class.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. It was extremely well-organized and the content was super interesting. The workload is super manageable: there aren't many readings each week and they're really interesting, the weekly papers aren't long or hard to do, and the final paper (20 pages) was long but, as you could choose the topic, it was not that hard or time-consuming. All in all, great class!",
    "TAKE THIS COURSE! Final paper is a lot but the week to week is super manageable. Classes are basically just super interesting group discussions about really fascinating psych topics. Be prepared to be fully engaged and come to discussions with an open mind."
