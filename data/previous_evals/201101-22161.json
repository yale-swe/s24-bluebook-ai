   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this class. It's small, so very intimate and the professor is really nice and approachable. The class itself involves a fair amount of reading out loud in class but not a lot of acting. The workload is manageable; you get to practice your written German with frequent writing assignments and since the class is pretty small, you will be practicing your oral skills as well.",
    "I would say take the class because it is required for the major. You read one play every 1-2 weeks and watch a few films of the plays. Interesting material.",
    "A bit frustrating if you're looking for a seminar-like environment, but fine if you want to practice your German.",
    "Yes, it is an interesting introduction to the historical interactions between politics\/ theater in Germany."
