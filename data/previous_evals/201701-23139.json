    "I learned how to do better archival research and was pushed to write very well. I also learned how to think about biographies in new ways.",
    "Gaddis's high standards for writing pushed me to become a better writer. I also learned about different styles of writing, as it was the first class that assigned papers in a non-academic style.",
    "The final paper was one of the most rewarding projects I've ever undertaken at Yale. I felt like it put me in great position to write a senior essay. that said, I didn't love the class or its contents, so it was certainly a mixed bag.",
    "This course taught me a great deal about writing a biography, and how to pay attention to who each sentence balances writing.",
    "I experienced firsthand the process of writing a biography, which was incredibly rewarding. I also developed a reading habit, something I have wanted to do for a very long time now. I also have come to appreciate biography as an art through the books we've read and the discussions we've had. All in all, the course changed my relationship with books (I no longer dread reading them), with writing (completing my longest piece of writing yet is quite a boost to self-confidence in writing), and with the nature of history itself. For example, I now appreciate the questionability of historical evidence and have adopted a more flexible opinion on accuracy and truth. In reality, there are no facts - only gray areas.",
    "I learned a ton about effective archival research over the course of the semester. I felt like our course readings and seminar discussions taught me a lot about how to craft a good narrative.",
    "I learned different techniques for writing a biography.",
    "I vastly improved my archival research skills and my ability to analyze a human life.",
    "This class is a great introduction to learning how to use the archives to construct a story, which you do while writing the biography. The readings and discussions are also good in that they force you to think not just about writing about life but some of the ways life is questioned and thought of.",
    "How to write a biography and think critically about other biographies. How to interview w\/r\/t biography writing and building stories from paper.",
    "I developed my research skills working with the Yale archives. My writing skills thanks to Gaddis' stringent writing checklist also improved immensely. Overall, I gained a greater appreciation for the art of biography and of narrative in History.",
    "We read a number of great biographies, including Robert Caro's \"Means of Ascent\" (about LBJ), John Williams' \"Augustus,\" and Jeff Hobbs' \"The Short and Tragic Life of Robert Peace.\" The final paper was a satisfying project which you can learn a lot from if you take the initiative and put a lot into it."

   "comments": [
    "This course was strong in having a syllabus of books students actually want to read, assigning a fascinating project, pushing students hard, and holding students to high standards. This course could be improved in three fundamental ways. First, the syllabus should be diversified. Only one biography was about a woman (excluding a novel in which a woman turns into a man), and the professor said that was his least favorite. Second, the craft of biography should be explicitly taught. I felt very disappointed while writing my biography that I hadn't learned in a formal way from a Pulitzer-Prize-winning author how to write biography and had merely discussed books with the class. Third, the discussions about the books should veer away from discussing grand narratives in history and focus instead on discussing the book. I found it very frustrating to read the book but not know enough about grand narratives of classical history to participate.",
    "Gaddis could do a better job of structuring the seminar. Often, his questions seemed trite and had little to do with the readings themselves or the art of biography. He also had a tendency to value contributions of some members of the class more than others. Overall, the classroom experience was unpleasant, uncooperative, and unwelcoming. More than pushing students to develop nuanced, thoughtful opinions, Gaddis at times seemed to search only for what he wanted students to say. The exercise seemed less for our benefit and more for himself. Additionally, the syllabus was pretty focused on white, male authors writing about white men. The course would be stronger if Gaddis offered a wider array of perspectives. That being said, the assignments for the class were unique, and I enjoyed writing them. He gave thoughtful comments on the midterm paper and final proposal.",
    "This course is strong because of professor Gaddis. This course is weakened in that all of the students in it are taking it because of Professor Gaddis and not because of the material presented in the class.",
    "Strengths: reading a book every week made me grow a lot. The writing assignments were also very satisfying and meaningful. Weaknesses: I think the book list should be more diverse. I enjoyed the breadth of biographical techniques we encountered in these books, but it would be valuable to include non-Western biographies, like this year's Pulitzer \"The Return\" or National Book Award winner \"Behind the Beautiful Forevers.\" I also think it would be valuable to create a more diverse class, since people from different cultures bring different life perspectives to the classroom, especially for a class such as this one.",
    "Overall, I thought the quality of the books we read was really good - they were very engaging and for the most part well-written. I also thought discussion was usually well-facilitated, and I particularly appreciated the session we had with Dean Holloway. I would have liked to see more diversity in the texts - we read a couple by or about women and people of color, but I think the number could be increased.",
    "I enjoyed reading a different biography each week, and I liked writing the biography.",
    "The final assignment was demanding and required a high level of intellectual engagement. But we did not receive sufficient training about how to write a biography I wish we had more technical help and guidance during class time.",
    "The strengths of this class mainly lie in how engaging t can beif you really get into the readings and the work, you can get absorbed. There is a lot of work, which can be hard (almost unrealistic) to balance.",
    "The books are mostly interesting, but class time is largely Gaddis' pontification (his own words) and kind of dominating class time. Definitely would be better to let the students do more of the guiding and discussion, instead of everyone sitting uptight waiting for a pause in order to insert a comment. But most of the books were good reads, and the final project was rewarding to finish.",
    "This seminar oftentimes felt less like a History course and more like a creative non-fiction course. It was a refreshing change of focus from the usual History seminar. I would have liked to spend more time focusing on the craft of biography for the works we discussed, especially as we started writing our own biographies. While it was of course interesting to talk about greater historical themes, it would have been helpful to spend more time reflecting on the strengths and weaknesses of the biographies' scopes, styles, and nitty gritty of writing.",
    "Strengths: Interesting and intelligent classmates, and weekly book discussions with thought-provoking questions and wisdom from Professor Gaddis. Professor Gaddis often brought up the questions and dilemmas faced by a biographer in writing about their subjects life. These issues were very interesting to hear about, and Prof Gaddiss comments were informed by his biography of George Kennan. The opportunity to work on a stimulating and intellectual biographical project throughout the semester was great. Weaknesses: Most importantly, Professor Gaddis could teach his students more directly about how to write a biography. It would help if he assigned the How to Do Biography book as an assigned reading. Also, Professor Gaddis often has a particular answers or ways of thinking in mind when he asks questions. The class would be more engaging if his questions were more open ended and drew people into the conversation, rather than encouraging people to guess what answer he has in mind."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "I would tentatively recommend this course, if you really want to write a biography and read a lot of biographies. If you do not have a strong desire to spend most of your semester doing intense, focused research and writing an extremely long paper, do not take this class -- don't take this class just because you want to work with Gaddis. (I ended up enjoying the paper, despite the ways I was disappointed with the class.) I felt frustrated that the craft of biography was not explicitly taught and that discussion about the books was rarely about how biography was crafted and instead was just about lofty historical themes. One thing to note is that the first three seminars (Orlando, Augustine, LBJ) were excellent, but the quality of discussion fell a bit from there, so I felt a little misled based on shopping period.",
    "It's a fairly rigorous and self-directed class. The seminar is a book a week, plus a 40-plus page final paper, so you can't really let things drop. That being said, the actual class discussion rarely stays centered on the books, so you can get by if skimming if need be.",
    "I really struggled with what to write here. This is a great course, don't get me wrong--it is just that the grading is absolutely oppressive. I know that this class attracts a lot of pre-law people, so know that Gaddis expects a 40+ page paper that is \"perfect.\" So if you do not deliver, expect a grade that is a C or B. This is fine, and I think that it is even a good thing, but it really made me consider dropping the course because I suspect that it will be adding another poor grade to my GPA. But, even if bad grades scare you, you should take this course. Professor Gaddis routinely blew my mind, and the literature he selects is positively inspiring.",
    "I wholeheartedly recommend this course. You read a biography a week, and class discussions center around what the biography did well or didn't do well, as well as the more literary themes that each biography touches on. You really need to read the books to get the most out of this class (plus, they're excellent books, many of which are Pulitzer winners or bestsellers). Class discussions can be a bit monologic at times, since John Gaddis has a lot of ideas, so be ready to jump into discussions actively in order to make your voice and ideas heard. There are three assignments, an autobiography, research prospectus, and biography. The autobiography helped me discover something I didn't know about myself, the prospectus was bland as expected, and the biography was an immensely satisfying intellectual challenge that involves many hours of archival research throughout the semester, culminating with a 50-page paper that you can call your first book. Take this course!",
    "It's the definition of a beautifully-run and fulfilling Yale seminar - absolutely take it if you can, and don't be scared to jump in if you're not a History major! Gaddis likes having a few non-history majors in the class. DO NOT TAKE if you're a senior also writing a senior essay, as I was. I did not get to put in nearly enough time to make the final paper as professional as I would have liked. Regardless of whether you take the class, download the syllabus and read all the books - they're incredible, and change every time the class is taught.",
    "One of my favorite courses. Gaddis is a great seminar leader. Engaging discussions that reach good points. The final paper is a thrill to research and write.",
    "Yes - but I would agree with past students who have referred to it more as a book club than a class on biography. The work you do on your biography happens all outside of class time, and the seminar is usually focused on the week's reading.",
    "Yes, absolutely. If you are interested not only in writing biography but also learning about interesting subjects of biographies, take this course. You also get feedback on your writing from Professor Gaddis, which is very valuable.",
    "Take the class if you want to write a 30-40 page biography mostly independently and without much guidance. Seminar discussions each week do not require a profound understanding of the texts, and you won't receive too much instruction about how to write. If you want a challenge, go for it.",
    "Take this course if you want to gain a wide exposure to many biographies, as you'll be reading one a week. The amount of read is a lot. Be prepared. But the reading engages the student with Prof. Gaddis' guidance so they are interesting. Come to the class ready to learn about archival research and have a good ability to structure your time, as both will be needed for the final paper.",
    ".I mean...nah. Gaddis gets a lot of cred because he is experienced and definitely smart, but this class was really frustrating re: discussions and not that intellectually stimulating. You write a long biography at the end, but Gaddis never actually really teaches you how to write one, and doesn't edit any drafts, so writing the paper is kind of like swimming in dark water. A lot of the time when Gaddis is talking to you it seems kind of performative, like he is just waiting for you to finish so he can say something clever, which can be frustratingly pedantic.",
    "This was one of the most rewarding courses I've ever taken in my time at Yale. Researching and writing the final project will take up a good chunk of your semester, so be prepared for the workload, but it will be a historical exercise unlike anything you've (likely) ever done before. You will have the privilege of getting to know someone backwards, immersing yourself in their lives, pulling together the disparate strands of what they left behind in the archives to form a cohesive narrative of their life. It can get rough - 30 - 50 pages, likely closer to 50 ++, so make sure you pick someone whose life you're genuinely interested in. Seminar can get overtaken by people trying to impress him (because he's a superstar History professor) but overall it's pretty enjoyable and feels more like a book club than anything. It's a lot of work but you get out what you put in!",
    "Yes. Art of Biography is best summarized as a biography book club with Professor Gaddis and great classmates. It isnt an English classProf Gaddis doesnt teach his students the mechanics of biography (how to open, conclude, tie together life events, etc.), but he is very available for students to talk with him about any questions. The reading list is well chosen for high quality books, but it is very heavily male. Class discussions are thought provoking, and I found it satisfying and stimulating to write a long biography. By the end of the semester you feel pretty close with your classmates and Professor Gaddis, which is great."
