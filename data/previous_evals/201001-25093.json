    "Yes, but be aware of the workload.",
    "This course is pretty difficult but very well taught. I think that if you only need 151, you should definitely take that instead. You need a very good handle on MATH 115 and 120 for this course. Just because you took them and got by a year ago does not mean that you are prepared to deal with the math in this class. Prof. Grober is a fantastic teacher and his lectures are interesting, but he really enjoys the calculus behind physics and you will struggle if you do not have a very good foundation in math.",
    "I would not recommend it as it is not a good class but should only be taken if you need it for your major.",
    "It covers all the basics, and some things that might not be considered basics. I'm sure that if you're taking it, you probably have to. Sorry, but the fun stuff requires more math.",
    "You are in this because you don't have linear algebra or are worried that Physics 200 is too conceptual, but you are pre-med or a chem major or maybe some other major that requires it. I am sorry that you are going to sit through it as well. Physics 180 was fine, 181 is terrible. Best of luck.",
    "It was a good level for me. I had taken physics B in high school. Phys 151 isn't real physics. If you want to actually learn it a bit better, you have to take at least 181. Phys200 is quite a step up from this class however. I enjoyed the class.",
    "Very difficult. Only take if you intend to use it as a major requirement.",
    "Given an interest in electromagnetism, I would recommend the course to another student. However, if you have any reservations about the material, I would strongly advise against it. It is a classic example of a polarizing science class, where some love it and some hate it.",
    "Solid intro to E&M with a unique, interesting professor. Grober taught the basic ideas well and kept the class's attention, although he's definitely conceptual and makes you *learn* the fundamental concepts. Not a class to memorize formulas for. Would recommend that students have had some exposure to E&M before (even a little) -- as someone who knew literally nothing about E&M, I could do well on the problem sets but had a bit of struggle keeping up on the tests, but would still recommend this class. Also, Grober's Science in the News clips at the beginning of class were extremely interesting since (for once!) a professor was interested in how the coursework is applicable to the real world.",
    "Physics could be fun, but also could be painful. Overall, Grober was a great teacher, alsways providing the link between the subject of the class and the real world, and he approached the class with a good sense of humor. Physics can be a fascinating subject if approached the right way, and I feel like this class did a good job getting as close to that ideal as possible.Grober is a funny guy -- he can he hilarious and brutally caustic. He doesn't take kindly to the premeds who flock to his course, but when he forgets who's taking the class and focuses on the subject matter, he can be brilliantly insightful and interesting. His enthusiasm is infectious -- when he (sometimes rarely) lets it be seen.",
    "PHYS 181 with Professor Grober was excellent. He is a really great lecturer who paces his class very well. His natural ability to explain difficult concepts is amazing. He does not use the terrible \"clicker\" questions nor are there pre-class quizzes. Infinitely better than Professor Easther who taught the first half of the class. After taking this class you will have an understanding and appreciation of electromagnetism. Highly recommended.",
    "Multivariable calculus is a must, if you're taking this class, and having taken Diff. Eq. would be even better. It was enjoyable being able to apply the math I learned in other courses to problems here. Probably moreso than in Phys 151, but I couldn't say for sure.",
    "This class makes you appreciate how straight-forward mechanics was. It's just as fast as Physics 180, but it takes longer to wrap your head around the concepts, especially once you get to magnetism. The ideas are less intuitive, and lectures don't help much when it comes to doing the problem sets. Go to study hall if you want extra help, and do not put off reading the textbook.",
    "I would highly recommend PHYS 181 to a fellow student.",
    "Take this class if Grober teaches it. You will not regret it. I can't say much for it if Grober doesn't teach it.",
    "Yes if you have good previous background in Physics and math, better if you take multi-variable Calc before.",
    "If you think you might be interested in Physics then go for it.",
    "You probably already have to take it. Just go for it--it's a lot of work especially if you aren't good at physics (like me) but it's worth it to take physics with calc instead of 150. Take it with Grober if possible.",
    "Electricity and magnetism is difficult, and I can't imagine that a lot of people would want to take it unless they're really interested or need the class to fulfill a prerequisite. If Professor Grober is teaching, I would definitely recommend the class. If not, maybe not.",
    "Take it if you have to--it's tough. Grober says that lectures aren't necessary, and they aren't, but you'll have a hard time knowing the kind of thing that he'll put on the exam unless you attend.",
    "Physics 181 is a lot harder than physics 180. There is a lot more calculus involved, and the concepts are difficult to visualize. (E&M is harder than mechanics at any school, though)If grober is teaching it, expect a much more difficult semester than you had with 180. He's interesting but you have to teach a lot of it to yourself.",
    "I took the course with Professor Grober, so math featured prominently in the class. Those that didn't do very well on MATh 120 or ENAS 151 will probably have a harder time. Grober also does science in the news -- picking a science topic in the news and explaining the science behind it -- which makes the class more interesting. Professor Grober has messy handwriting, which makes following what's on the board difficult sometimes. I really like science in the news - it's a good thing to have in the course because it helps put the science in context, which Grober is very good at doing. Grober is very good at making the science matter by explaining how we use it in our daily lives. I would recommend putting the links or files of the science in the news stories on the classes server.",
    "I think many people find it much harder than the 180 class. Tests are harder, material is broader and more difficult to grasp, and the material can be a lot less interesting.",
    "This is one of those large introductory science classes that most science majors have to take. If you really like physics, you probably belong in a higher level. Still, the class was not boring, the material was manageable, and the tests were fair.",
    "Most people take it to fulfill a requirement, but if you are one of the few who don't need too, i would still recommend it.",
    "typical premed course, hard curve. basically ap physics c, i didnt go to class at all and i did fine.",
    "A middle-of-the-road difficulty course covering E&M, optics, some relativity, and some quantum. Grober was a great teacher who brought the material to life through all sorts of fun tangents that connected to the rest of the world. That being said, if you read the book and understand it, lecture doesn't add too much additional understanding. The exams were difficult, but there is some curve.",
    "GENERAL PHYSICS 2",
    "Grober is a very down to earth professor, but the material is a lot tougher than 180. There are also many people who drop down from 200 for second semester so the grading curve is very tough.",
    "Take this class if you have to, but prepared to learn a lot of the stuff on your own.",
    "Yes, absolutely. However I would caution one to make sure their calculus skills are strong enough to effectively deal with the course material.",
    "I would recommend it for students who already have a somewhat good background in the material, or at least a general background.",
    "Take it if Grober is teaching it, but be prepared to learn EVERYTHING as the exams are more tests of your ability to mathematically prove physical relations.",
    "This is a good introductory physics course. It covers a lot of different topics but does not go into too much depth. Therefore, I would not recommend this course to someone looking for an easy QR or Sc credit, but it is not a bad course for those of you who need it for your major.",
    "There is no support, the TAs are useless they just let us copy the homework from them. WHY? This is a hard class. I am scared to see my grade.",
    "Take it with Robert Grober. He's fun and interesting and writes fair tests and teaches well. It's a hard class if you're like me and don't know anything about electricity and magnetism going in, but you'll learn all about it if you put in the time.",
    "If you have to.",
    "Almost everyone who takes this class takes it as a requirement. It's challenging especially if you've never done E&M physics before, but manageable.",
    "It's rough. Prepare yourself for a much more difficult semester than 180.",
    "Physics 181 was reasonable with a high school Physics B E and M background. Nothing too onerous, just a problem set a week. Tests were fair.",
    "Difficult class, but interesting if you put in a lot of time to understand the material. Grober is a great professor.",
    "This is probably a pre-med or major requirement if you're taking it. Tough class but fair. Even if you don't like physics, you'll make it out just fine.",
    "Most people take the class to fulfill a requirement.",
    "If you're looking for a physics class which delves a bit into calculus, I would recommend this one. It is advanced, but not too advanced.",
    "quite a few people moved down after PHYS 200, and some also dropped to 151 from this class. it's very well taught (with grober), but also less structured in the use of resources (no previous exams, no calculators, no clickers, no website, etc.). overall somewhat limited treatment of E&M (integral form of maxwell's equations used), but there's always 200 if you want differential form for maxwell's equations. still uses a fair bit of multivariable calc - it is an obvious advantage for students who have already taken it, but if you're taking it as a corequisite, it's still doable. overall recommended, take it, although likely obviously a requirement for many. btw, final harder than two midterms, so study hard for it.",
    "Physics 181 is a good alternative to 200. I would recommend it because it is challenging, but not impossible, and I would recommend especially if Grobers teaching it.",
    "I would take it only if you took calculus based physics. This class seems to go beyond what is taught in AP Physics C making it difficult to catch up if you don't already know the basics.",
    "I heard this class used to be much worse, but this semester it wasn't bad. I wouldn't exactly take this class if you don't have to, unless you are really interested in science. Since I dropped down from 201 earlier in the semester, I can say that the big difference is that the problem sets are significantly more straightforward in this class, the lectures aren't as difficult or important (but still go), and this class is much more practically-oriented. Professor Grober's science in the news at the beginning of class and his constant references to the practical applications of the concepts he is teaching make the subject more bearable.",
    "Take it with Grober if at all possible. Reasonable workload.",
    "Really great lectures. That's one reason to take it.",
    "I would not recommend this, it is not worth the struggle. If you don't have to don't do it.",
    "I would recommend this course only if it is a necessary pre-requisite or a requirement of your major. This class was particularly frustrating to me because I had virtually no previous physics experience, and that is probably why I struggled, and I had to do a lot of self-teaching, which is very hard with an otherwise heavy courseload.",
    "mid-level general physics. 181 is slightly harder than 180. Exams are quite challenging, but curved fairly. Yes I would recommend it because physics is everywhere.",
    "This class is an introduction to E&M. Professor Grober expected his students to know multi-variable calculus so be warned if you haven't taken it or aren't taking it concurrently. The class nicely does not use clickers or have daily quizzes like PHYS 180.",
    "Interesting material but this class doesn't get you excited about it or make it easy for you to understand it.",
    "predictable workload (one pset a week), good help sessions with TA's (though, like at all help sessions, it's really talking to other students that does the most), a solid\/enthusiastic\/knowledgeable professor, and exams that reflect the material. the best you can get from intro physics.go to the help sessions. talk to other students. you get the psets done way faster, you get to know each other, and the material makes a LOT more sense.if you need to take physics, don't think of this one as a burden!",
    "This is a good class to take if you know some physics\/calculus (the name Faraday sounds familiar), but have not learned it well (did not ace the AP C test), and don't care for deeply understanding E&M but just want to get it over with. Grober is an energetic prof who won't make you fall asleep, and he teaches the material well. No emphasis on the derivations... the problem sets are pretty easy and relevant to the tests. He also does a ten-minute science in the news section at the beginning of each class to ease students into work-mode. :)",
    "You really don't learn anything by going to lecture. I think it would be a really hard course for someone who has never seen physics before. If you have the time to devote to the class, take 201 instead.",
    "If Grober is teaching it, be prepared to learn derivations. He doesn't quite care about knowing or applying the equations, but more about how you get it in the first place. I came in expecting a hard semester of E&M, but was absolutely miserable because I didn't care at all for the stuff he taught.",
    "I would recommend this course for any student interested in introductory physics who is willing to put in the time and effort to grasp the material. The course can be rigorous and definitely requires multivariate calculus.",
    "I would only recommend it if you need it for a requirement.",
    "Physics 181 was a good course, reasonable enough that I was able to establish a confidence in my physics problem-solving skills and knowledge, but challenging enough that it was interesting and that I felt like I really learned something and improved my physics ability. The textbook was really great, very understandable and interesting. Overall, the course made me enjoy physics. The TFs were for the most part quite nice and helpful, and Grober is an excellent lecturer. The exams were quite fair, the work fine. I would recommend the class.",
    "if it's grober, take it, no questions asked. you will regret not having grober as your teacher.",
    "I'd recommend you not to take this course unless you need to.",
    "m.",
    "This course is one that you will take if you need it for your major. If you are sincerely interested in the material and want a more engaging course I would go for another physics class.",
    "I would recommend it if you can take it with Professor Grober. He definitely has tough test, but the lectures will make it worth it.",
    "Hard class. Grober is a great professor, though. He has a knack for oversimplifying, though.",
    "Physics 181 was a good foray into E&M, optics, and the beginning of quantum mechanics. As with any other intro physics course, it suffers from a big class with no set section with TAs you can get to know, and premeds\/curve breakers. That said, Prof. Grober was a pretty good teacher though it is doubtful he'll teach again next year. He did go through proofs a bit quickly and doesn't allow a calculator on tests. Also, if you ask for an equation sheet (our class didn't) he makes the exams that much harder. Doesn't correlate well with the PHYS 166L but that can't really be helped."
