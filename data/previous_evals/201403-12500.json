   "comments": [
    "Good class - gave a really good overview of counterpoint! I noticed that I am much more aware of where and how counterpoint is used in music in the different choirs that I sing in.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to a student either confident in their compositional ability or willing to get a lower grade but learn a lot. Professor Harrison is passionate and incredibly knowledgable. It was a pleasure go to his classes, even at 9 am.",
    "Really great class! You will look at and come to understand really great Bach music and write really clever pieces. Professor Harrison is understanding and helpful, and a great teacher. He knows this stuff backwards and forwards.",
    "Yes take it if you are music major or if you are interested in counterpoint music.",
    "Great great class. Take it if you love Bach. There is an assignment due at every class meeting, which can be a lot of work, but Professor Harrison looks closely at each assignment and helps you improve the composition itself and your composing abilities altogether. And he's such an engaging and witty teacher.",
    "This class was a joy to be part of. Every unit pedagogically followed from the previous one, using the analogy of ascending the Gradus ad Parnassum (steps to Parnassus). By the end, I had painlessly become an expert on the basic tenets of counterpoint, which has made me a better classical and jazz musician. This roughly 12-person class was taught as a lecture with plenty of time for comments and some discussion. There were two model composition assignments, which we performed in class and received comments from the instructor. Two assignments each week, usually writing counterpoints in 2 or 3 parts to a given cantus fermus. Professor Harrison is an excellent instructor for this course, and his generosity with his time and geeky sense of humor made for interesting and engaging classes.",
    "Yes, highly recommended. Counterpoint is an essential skill to musicians and composers alike. You cover the various species of counterpoint (in more detail than MUSI210\/211 or Composition seminars), canons, fugues and progress to writing model compositions. Counterpoint is very much like a musical sudoku and through this class you will learn the techniques and structures of how to deploy good counterpoint. Many of the techniques are analyzed through Bach's Well Tempered Klavier and Suites - Bach is a wizard of counterpoint. Many of you may have played these pieces, but have never been shown just what marvelous interlinking of phrases exist in the music. Prof. Harrison is one of my favorite lecturers in the Music department. He devotes so much time and attention to correcting our assignments and I really enjoyed his sense of humor! Assignments at the end of every class and 2 model compositions constitute the work.",
    "A holistic overview of tonal counterpoint, focusing on an analytical and compositional perspective. You start out analyzing and writing continuo as well as first, second, and third-species counterpoint, and then you eventually move into writing two-part inventions and even three-part fugetta's by the end of the class. Professor Harrison gave us assignments every class meeting. The assignments started with a more analytical bent, and then progressed more towards being model compositional tasks by the end of the semester. For me these assignments took about 1-3 hours each, so it added up, but these were really the only work you had to do outside of the class, and it was well worth it! The only way to learn this stuff is to practice relentlessly. I would recommend this class to anyone who thinks the stuff I just described would be a fun challenge - if you're into Bach and you're not afraid of getting creative, this class is for you!!"
