    "I gained knowledge about Roman architecture, the ability to critically analyze buildings and other works of architecture, and knowledge about ancient Roman history.",
    "Clear understanding of how Roman Architecture evolved through the span of republic and empire, as well as the ability to identify important architectural elements even in modern buildings and their significance in the structure.",
    "I gained a basic knowledge of architectural features and Roman history that I lacked before. I developed skills in visual analysis.",
    "Um, i had to memorize a lot of stuff, I guess.",
    "I learned about the big ideas of Roman Architecture from 300BC to 500AD.",
    "You learn so much about Roman architecture and history. I absolutely loved this course.",
    "I learned about Roman architecture through history, and learned why certain buildings were important over the course of Roman architecture. There was also some sculpture and wall painting thrown in there, which I enjoyed thoroughly. I feel much more educated about Roman architecture, and how it has inspired architecture of today!",
    "How to better analyze architecture and use critical thinking skills to deduce their importance and impact on society",
    "I improved my visual analysis skills and general knowledge of art history",
    "I learnt all about Roman Architecture from the early empire, to its fall.",
    "I learned a lot about Roman architecture and Roman monuments, and can now identify many that I had no idea existed before taking the course.",
    "A broad overview of ancient Roman architecture, both specific monuments and general patterns and themes",
    "I feel like I learned everything about ancient Roman architecture in this class. It was really inspiring to see how innovative builders were in the first century B.C. and how that developed to influence architecture today. I also felt it was a great introduction to architectural history and research in general. I learned a lot of architectural terms and about different styles. I also loved the Prof. Kleiner's discussion of ornament and sculptural elements that adorned the architecture. It was also a great overview of the different Roman emperors and their passions and pursuits."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The course is very interesting and manageable. Clear themes emerge throughout the lectures and Professor Kleiner is an engaging lecturer. The course does a good job of introducing you to the Roman world and the context of buildings. It also empowers you to write about architecture and apply the things you've learned in an exciting way. It requires a good deal of memorization, which is manageable if you start on time and make flashcards. However, it might be helpful if instead of having to memorize exact dates for the monument, you instead had to remember the Roman emperor at the time the building was constructed. Moreover, it would be helpful if Professor Kleiner continued to send a vocabulary sheet to students the week before the exam with the exact terms you need to know for the exam.",
    "The course covered a wide array of buildings and monuments in a variety of locations which I really enjoyed learning about. It was very accessible even for a non-humanities major. I'm not a huge fan of having to memorize so many buildings on the monument list for the test even though many are not even tested on..",
    "The lectures did not add anything to the readings. At all. I literally missed half of the classes and did the readings and still got a 90 on the midterm.",
    "The course was pleasant enough and very well organized. It is not particularly challenging nor offers deep insight into architecture; it's a bit like attending discovery channel in person. More assignments would have been good to cement understanding.",
    "I thought this course was extremely interesting, and I loved almost every second of it. It was a 9 am course and I live farther away so it was a bit of a trek in the mornings, but it was worth it.",
    "It was an interesting class. The biggest issue I had with it was the brutal amount of memorization that had to be done before each of the exams. However, the rest of the class was pretty easy. If you attended lecture, there was little point in doing the reading, as it said almost exactly the same thing",
    "The strengths are that you get to look at a lot of monuments in the class, and go in depth about the architectural styles and what makes each unique. Also you learn some history about Rome and the emperors. The final project of making your own Roman City can be very fun for those who have time, but the research paper alternative is not bad. The weaknesses are that it is basically a memorize-and-recite class, and the tests require a lot of memorization.",
    "The strength of the course is the professors expertise with the material, she has taken most of the photos she shows, and has seen nearly every monument many times.",
    "I think the set up of the lectures was great. I loved being able to look at the monument list and have a cheat sheet during lecture while I was listening to their specific important elements and influence. I also really liked the different options for the term paper. There was so much guidance, and the option to create your own Roman city was so creative and fun. I was extremely invested in my Roman city and I am so proud of how it turned out. I really felt like I synthesized the information through this project. I also found the review sessions before the midterms extremely helpful. However, I was not a huge fan of the online sections. I felt that the reading responses were easy to ignore until the end of the semester, so I feel like that was an engagement element that I missed out on. The optional in person sections were incredible! I loved exploring the YUAG and its Roman pieces. I wish that in person section was a requirement because I feel that would have helped me analyze and interpret the material more than a mere memorization of dates and places before the tests."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in Roman history, architecture, or travel.",
    "Yes! If you are looking for an interesting humanities credit I would recommend.",
    "Yes if you are okay with memorization and are interested in architecture and\/ or Roman history.",
    "I mean, if you are an art history student that needs to fulfill that ancient era chronological unit requirement, this is a great way to get that out of the way.",
    "I would recommend if you are looking for an easy fifth class.",
    "I highly recommend this course. It was really the highlight of my semester.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to someone if they want a class that feels like a trip to Rome every morning. Professor Kleiner is passionate about Rome and really makes the material come alive. Tests are fair, especially if you start studying far enough in advance. The paper is fun, especially if you choose to design your own Roman city.",
    "Yes- its a good humanities course especially for a non history of arts student",
    "Absolutely. Its a low stress humanities course which covers cool material and is taught by a great professor!",
    "This is an excellent course if you are interested in any aspect of Roman life, and if you are good with memorization of lots of terms. If you are then this class will be easy, if not, it'll be painful",
    "Yes. I think that Roman architecture is very interesting and has had a significant impact on much of the design we see today, and I think that everyone who has interest in building and design should be aware of that.",
    "This is a light workload but interesting course, and can be rewarding if you are interested in the subject.",
    "It's an amazing class! Totally recommend it!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student! I think it's great as an introductory course to History of Art classes because there is so much guidance and helpful review. I also feel like the course material is so universally fascinating and influential that it is an attractive course to pretty much anyone. I think the term paper prompts were really fun. I felt like there was a lot of freedom to explore creatively in this class as well as research historical architecture which was an incredible combination."
