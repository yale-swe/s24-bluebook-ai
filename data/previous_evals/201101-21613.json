    "The Senior Essay can be a wonderful experience if you\u0092re motivated to do a lot of reading and writing on your own. It helps to come into the semester with a clear idea of what literature you\u0092ll read and a general idea of the area that you\u0092ll write about. I highly recommend this course to anyone who has a real desire to see what it\u0092s like to do real philosophical work, especially if you\u0092re considering graduate study in philosophy."
