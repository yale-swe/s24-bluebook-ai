    "A lot of work, but the amount of french you learn is enough to have actual conversations with French speakers.",
    "It was a difficult class, so I would only recommend it to someone who is very interested in the language.",
    "Yes",
    "Fren 120 is a continuation of Fren 110 and is very similar in style. If you liked the first semester this one just keeps getting more interesting with all the new french you learn. Beware French in Action starts to get old fast.",
    "Solid course, very much the expected follow up to French I. French in Action videos become a little more convoluted and ridiculous, but supplementary material and follow-up exercises make it okay. Helpful in developing different tenses and tones of grammar. The instructor and your classmates make or break the course :)"
