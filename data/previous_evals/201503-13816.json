   "comments": [
    "Take Math 116 over any other math course at Yale. Michael Frame is a great professor. I was very happy i choose this over Math 115. As a pre-med who isnt a fan of the Math requirement this helped me out alot. With only one problem set a week the workload was not very consuming. Practice problems are posted alongside the homework whcih gives you very good guidelines in how to solve the pset questions. Both the midterm and final are open-book, which makes it alot less stressful.",
    "Math 116 is a combination of calculus, linear algebra, and differential equations and uses all of these tools to have a greater understanding of biological processes and population dynamics. I would recommend this class wholeheartedly. Not only is the work manageable, the class engaging, and the material interesting, but Frame is one of the best teachers that one would ever have. This class is truly great and will change one's perceptions of mathematics as a field.",
    "Very different but interesting math course. If you are interested in sciences or medicine I would recommend taking this course, its a lot of fun.",
    "100% recommend this course!!!",
    "I would not recommend this course as it does not help strengthen fundamental calculus skills.",
    "A great calculus course that hones important skills for the next higher math class, and sparks student interest in biological research. i would definitely recommend it to another student.",
    "I would recommend this class if you want to take a QR and are interested in something other than the regular calculus track continuing from high school. This class uses the fundamentals of calculus, and there are some overlaps with 115 with series and integrals, but it does expose you to new concepts that are often used in biosciences, such as population model techniques. There is one problem set a week (usually), and one midterm during class time.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. I have actually recommended it to many peers, already.",
    "I would DEFINITELY recommend this class. Honestly, to anyone, not just Pre-Med students. I think that labelling it as the \"Pre-Med\" math is somewhat of a misnomer since I think more than just Pre-Med students would enjoy an alternative to your typical differential equations and integral calculus class.",
    "I recommend this class for any students who think calculus isn't applicable to any field besides physics and engineering. Its interesting aND Professor Frame is great.",
    "Especially compared to MATH 115 (judging from the comments of friends in both courses), 116 seems much more engaging and I would really recommend it!",
    "MATH 116 is definitely the course for students of biology in need of a math credit, but also is ideal for students who need a calculus credit and are interested in applied math. While the course covers all the essential topics in Math 115, it also gives a generous introduction to linear algebra and higher-level work in differential equations. And of course, the instructor is brilliant; he really makes the class enjoyable. The course work is very interesting but also quite manageable, and I'd definitely recommend it to anyone with the above interests.",
    "I really enjoyed Math 116. It was an extremely interesting class with an amazing professor. The class focused on calculus topics similar to those in Math 115, but we explored biological applications of these methods as well as other biological models. Professor Frame was really what made this class great. Despite being a 9am class, it was one of my favorites and it made math fun again. Professor Frame was always willing to help and it was obvious that he truly cared about his students. I would definitely recommend this course!",
    "If you're wavering between Math 115 and Math 116, definitely take this one. It can take the place of 115 in any prereqs (you can take 120 after this), and it is such an interesting class. If this is still taught by Michael Frame, the professor alone is reason enough to take the course. He tells jokes in the middle of class so you won't drift off, and he really welcomes students to come to office hours, which I've heard is not true of everyone in the math department. He gave everyone online course notes, which are basically the textbook for the class, for free. So that is a perk. The course notes themselves are funny and touching at times, and the introduction and ending might make you tear up. Frame is a genius but also a nice, fuzzy, warm person who actually cares about his students. I seriously recommend this class.",
    "MATH 116 is a very interesting subject. Instead of starting by learning specifically about calculus tools such as integration or separation of variables, you start with the problem at hand and the goal you wish to achieve. Then you start learning why certain tools can help us achieve these goals. This makes the class more meaningful, and in the end, much more rewarding to me. The work load is definitely manageable. Like most classes, staying on top of your homework is the way to go, especially since Professor Frame lines the homework up with the lecture material very effectively. I highly recommend MATH 116.",
    "Math 116 is a math class definitely geared toward the biologically inclined student. Although the class is rather challenging at times, it is possible to perform at a high level with the help of Professor Frame and the course tutor. There are ample opportunities available to improve and hone your mathematical skills.",
    "Math 116 is a great and challenging course.",
    "Yes. Many of my friends were unhappy with the way their math classes were taught\/graded, but I found this class very straightforward and well-designed. Students knew what they had to do if they wanted to succeed.",
    "A wonderful course with an even better professor. Ot counts for premed, I believe, so take this instead of 115!",
    "It's a very good way to refresh one's memory of high school Mathematics without stressing oneself out too much. An exploratory course for anyone who's interested in doing Mathematics but taking a more 'applied' approach to Mathematics. Yes, I'd recommend MATH 116 to another student. It is a fantastic course that I do not regret taking at all."
