   "comments": [
    "I think that a good intro economics course is crucial for every single person, so definitely take it.",
    "To be an educated person in this world, you need to know it.",
    "It sucked and no I wouldn't recommend. I only took it because I needed it for a major.",
    "Even though I have mixed feeling for the class, I would definitely recommend it. Every Yale undergraduate has to have some knowledge in Economics and, even though the material often seems dry and uninteresting, at the end of the course I could see the world through an economics lens.",
    "You'll learn basic economics, which as Professor Berry says, every citizen of this country should know. I definitely recommend it, whether you're a prospective Econ major or not, it applies to everyone.",
    "I recommend this course most enthusiastically.",
    "So I came into intro micro with no background in Econ. This is not the case with many of the fellow students. It's very easy to fall behind. Although it's 40% As and 50% Bs, there are still 10% of people who get the Cs, Ds, and Fs. FML.",
    "Econ 115 is an introductory course that surveys many fundamentals of economics. It is a great class and I would recommend it to any incoming freshman.",
    "Econ 115 is a very good, solid introduction to economics. The most interesting part of the course (I think) was about consumers' and firms' behaviors, why they act the way they do in terms of allocating their resources. I had no previous experience of economics before taking this course, and found it really interesting because it revealed a lot about how the world works.I really feel like economics is a subject that everyone could get something from, whether you plan to major in the sciences, engineering, the humanities, or another social science. The workload isn't that bad at all, and Professor Berry makes the lectures fairly interesting as well.",
    "I would recommend this because the material is relevant to everyday life and to other classes. Sure, it gets dry, and the equations are a pain, but that's going to be true of any Microeconomics course.",
    "I would recommend this class. It's pretty introductory and straightforward.",
    "I thought Econ 115 was a good introduction course to basic economics. If you want a good grade, you'll have to study pretty hard. Go to class.",
    "If you want to be a responsible member of society you MUST know something about economics, and this class certainly helps. The big question I had was whether to take this course or the seminar. This, I think, largely depends on the student's learning style. In retrospect I may have been better off (and more on top of my work) in the seminar, but it was also great to have a large lecture experience with an incredible prof.",
    "I would summarize Economics 115 01 for a fellow student by telling the student to first decide which type of student he\/she is: is the student highly motivated and capable of keeping on top of his\/her schoolwork, or does he\/she need the constant reinforcement of a teacher and an intimate class setting. If the former, take this class, but if the latter, take Econ 110. I would recommend this class to a fellow student,but in retrospect I really wish I took the seminar.",
    "Econ is awesome. It was interesting and not too tough. Berry is great.",
    "Econ 115 covers the most concepts of economics. It is a necessary building block if you plan to continue in econ, but by itself it has minimal \"real-life\" application.",
    "Yes, it's a good class, but you have to do most of the learning by yourself or you'll fall behind.",
    "Kind of a boring course. The material is a bit slow, although Professor Berry tries to make it as interesting as possible. All in all, probably a necessary evil.",
    "A typical intro course, but the lectures are surprisingly enjoyable. The problem sets and exams are manageable.",
    "Yes",
    "Econ 115 is a great class; Professor Berry is a lecturer that everyone should experience.",
    "Yes- Econ is a subject that every student should take at some point in college, and Prof Berry's class is a good experience.",
    "I would recommend it. Basic econ, mostly theory. Good to know for life.",
    "I would definitely recommend taking it. While it might be boring and hard, it's definitely worth it to be able to take more interesting Econ classes later on.",
    "I would recommend it if you are interested in economics.",
    "To be a good person, you have to take this. It's interesting stuff, despite what people say. It is of course worth taking.",
    "If you didn't get into a freshman seminar, take it! Fall Econ with Prof. Barry is a great class!",
    "Dry material, lectures can be boring, but its a prereq for any other higher level econ course, so just bear through it.",
    "Take it, you'll learn the basics well.",
    "Econ 115 is a great starting lecture. If you are not sure whether or not you want to major in Econ take this class to help you decide.",
    "TAKE THE LECTURE WITH BERRY. HE IS AWESOME. Berry is one of the best professors at yale teaching economics. Everyone should be taking an introduction to economics class, and he is the man for the job.",
    "It's a pretty good, basic econ course. Not super interesting.",
    "You should only take this class if you need it for any particular requirements or are planning to major in economics. The material is incredibly monotonous and although Professor Barry is quite good, this is for sure not an interesting course to take",
    "It's an intro econ course and there are a lot of students in the class.",
    "Economics 115 is fun. Take it.",
    "A lot of people taking this course are already very familiar with Economics. It's easy to maintain B+ and above, but it gets harder to get in the A range. There are so many people who already know the material so well that they can ace the exams with barely paying attention to lectures. This is kind of annoying, but after all, this is Yale...so....",
    "Yeah, take it if you need the QR or if you want to take macro. Not that interesting, but useful stuff to know.",
    "It's a requirement. only reason to take it.",
    "I would recommend Economics 115 01 to someone who was marginally interested in economics and how they work in our society. I really liked it because you did not have to come from a very strong math background.",
    "I would recommend it if you want to major in economics. I would say it's a great class, you learn a lot but if you do not understand a concept and don't seek help immediately, you would be lost for the rest of the semester!",
    "Economics 115 01 is a great course for the understanding of the most basic and important concepts of microeconomics. It would be very useful in life. I strongly recommend taking this course, for both the prospective economics majors and non-majors.",
    "Good class, Professor Berry is GREAT. I hadn't taken any AP econ classes before this and thought it was still easy to grasp. You do NOT need a strong math background though you can 'cheat' a little if you do understand calculus (you realize the vocabulary are derivatives of each other). The grading is also very lenient... about 40% get an A.",
    "Great course taught by Steven Berry. Everyone should take this course. It's very easy but learning to live with the concepts requires some personal investment that is very much worth it. Take it but don't take it (too) easy!",
    "Well, it's not like econ majors have a choice anyway :D Nonetheless, yes, take the course, and take it with Prof. Berry . Be careful when you choose a section and a TA!",
    "Good way to test your interest level in economics. More math-focused than you might expect.",
    "If you are able to stay awake in a giant lecture, it is a great course. Bank on 400+ students in your class. Steven Berry has his reputation for a reason. He is a great professor and will work with students. However, he is prone to draw things in his notes that appear phallic.",
    "Yes! Take it! I would make this a required course if I could. Berry is amazing, and it's stuff you need to know. And fascinating. I am not an econ person, just a curious person, and it was great.",
    "I hated it.",
    "Yes, I would recommend Economics 115 to another student, but I think that the strength of this class depends mainly on the lecturer. Professor Berry was an excellent and engaging lecturer, though I think that this class would be rather unbearable and incomprehensible with a bad professor. The problem sets were hard, I thought, but doable; they taught me a lot of information rather then reviewing the topics that Professor Berry covered in lecture. I come away from the class having a slightly better understanding of economics, though I do not think I want to continue with a macroeconomics course.",
    "Econ 115 is a good introduction to economics. Its not too difficult and although boring at times it can be interesting as well. I would recommend it to someone looking to learn about economics, and I think most people should have a good understanding of basic economics.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in economics. The subject material can be a little dry, but Steven Berry is a great professor who makes it bearable. The lectures are long and the notes are endless, but it wasn't that challenging of a course (me being a freshman who had never taken econ before).",
    "I knew I didn't want to go into econ, but this was still a good way to get a basic foundation of economics. Not the most exciting course you'll take, but a decent course.",
    "Definitely take the class with Steven Berry if you've never had any experience with economics.Very interesting class if I say so.You should be ready for the grading curve though.",
    "take it if youre interested",
    "I would recommend this class to others as it serves as a good base for not only other courses, but a general academic experience. Overall I was quite happy with it.",
    "If you want an easy, fun introduction to microeconomics, take this class.",
    "Econ 115 is a great course to take your first semester at Yale. You get interesting material, a great instructor, and a not-too-ridiculous amount of work.",
    "Strengths: Great 1st semester freshman year course because so many people are in it and you get to become better acquainted with your freshman peers as well as meet some upperclassmen; material straight forwardWeaknesses: material doesn't go into as much detail or depth as it probably does in a seminarTip: THE TEXT BOOK IS NOT USEFUL. YOU DON'T NEED TO BUY IT ($136 gone to waste because I NEVER opened the book). The midterm and final are essentially replications of the problem sets\/past exams. To do the weekly problem sets, go to section and look at lecture notes\/graphs. To do the midterm\/final, look at the weekly problem sets\/past exams. YOU DON'T NEED TO WASTE MONEY ON THE TEXT BOOK.Overall: great intro\/gigantic lecture course; don't buy the text book!Another tip: don't let people stress you out. the problem sets are really straightforward and relatively short. the midterm and final are really not that bad. (though the midterm is kind of a time crunch, while the final has \"more than enough\" time)",
    "Econ 115 is your standard introduction to microeconomics. If you took AP Micro, it's the same stuff but a lot more mathematical - you have to actually graph functions and use algebra to find P and Q. It's not particularly difficult material and the curve is great - 40% get A range grades, 50% get B range. So 90% of the class gets a B- or better.",
    "It's a course worth taking--it's not always engaging, sometimes it moves too slowly, and not all the TAs are good. Still, learning to think about the world economically is important, and Berry does a good job.",
    "I would not recommend this course unless you are taking it for the QR or as a major requirement.",
    "take it",
    "Sure, if you've had minimal exposure to economics. It will open up some new horizons.",
    "I took this class because I thought it was something that everyone should take, but it really isn't. If you don't need it for a major and don't find the first few lectures interesting, don't take it. It is a gut though, and you won't have to spend much time on it.",
    "Sure. It's interesting and low stress!",
    "Take it if you have to. No way around that.",
    "Basic econ class... Not much else to say. Giant lecture.",
    "Having never been exposed to economics, I would highly recommend this course. It covers a lot of material, but the instructors do a great job in making sure you understand the material.",
    "A great class. I've heard horror stories from second semester intro micro so I would definitely recommend this class to anyone needing a QR credit or just interested in economics",
    "Get plenty of sleep the night before class, because it's an hour and fifteen minutes of econ. Working on the problems is fun, they're math-oriented, but you don't need to be good at math. Study a lot for the exams.",
    "Take this course no matter what if Professor Berry teaches it. Otherwise, only take it if you like economics. It's not a very difficult class, but the midterm is unfairly long and the final exam counts as fifty percent of your grade, which is too much.",
    "A great course with an extremely coherent curriculum. The material is very accessible but changed the way I think about the world. I feel like I am one step closer to being able to participate in the human feast.Professor Berry is an extremely talented lecturer and explained all of the material clearly and, for the most part, concisely. Some parts of lectures dwelled too long on material that we had already covered at the expense of more difficult, new material - but Professor Berry's wonderful wry wit more than made up for that.",
    "Econ 115 is exactly what you'd expect: a pretty good huge lecture for people who haven't taken econ before. The math is simple and often too basic (it would be so much easier to just use a derivative!), but the material is pretty interesting. Prof. Berry is a good lecturer and a lot of fun, so it's worth going to class. The book is worthless and unnecessary.",
    "A basic introduction to the subject. I would recommend it if somebody had an interest in the subject and needed it to continue, but as a stand-alone course it was probably not worth the time investment for the information we ended up getting out of it.",
    "This is a cursory introduction, covering all the basic principles of microeconomics. I would not enthusiastically recommend it, simply because of the size--I did not think this would be a factor but found it extremely detrimental to my experience in the class.",
    "If they're interested in econ, absolutely. Otherwise, there's no real point to taking it.",
    "I would certainly recommend Econ 115 to anyone with an aptitude for social sciences and algebra.",
    "I would recommend Econ 115 to another student. However, if he or she had the opportunity to take the smaller seminar course, I would encourage him or her to take that instead.",
    "Professor Berry is great! I learned a lot in this class and enjoyed lectures very much.",
    "Basic microeconomics class; heavy on the equations\/math. I'd recommend it if you want to be an economics major.",
    "You should definitely take this course before leaving Yale",
    "Very big lecture, sometimes hard to concentrate. Problem sets are very fair and we are given plenty of material to adequately prepare for both the midterm and the final.",
    "AVOID unless you're truly interested and have prior experience with the subject. Do not, I repeat, DO NOT take this class if (a) you're just looking to fulfill a QR or (b) you're one of those people who thinks \"I should probably learn a little something about econ before I graduate.\" I was both.The \"intro\" in the course title is deceptive. I came into the class with no prior experience with econ, which I do not think was the case for a lot of the people in the 450-person lecture. As a result, I often felt very left behind in the lectures and section, both of which move quickly. I felt like what a lot of Berry teaches assumes at least vague familiarity with microeconomics. The TAs make the same assumption when they try to explain things to you. I resorted to taking a more basic textbook out of the library (not the one the course uses). It helped a little, but of course had none of the formulas that this \"intro\" course demands.This is a course that is that rare combination of boring *and* difficult. I can see how Berry is better than a lot of other professors at other schools, but he can only do so much with the material. All in all, I came out of this course feeling very lost.",
    "Every week there will be a problem set that will probably not take you more than 30 minutes. Every week there will be a section in which a TA covers the material learned during lecture. I would highly recommend this course since the material is not too hard and Professor Berry does more than a nice job teaching it.",
    "I did not enjoy this class, but looking back, I'm glad I took it for one of my QRs. It was very challenging and I had to put in a lot of extra effort to understand the concepts, never having taken an econ course in high school. Also, be warned, it was very difficult for me to stay awake in lecture because the subject matter is very dry at times (really, I had to nap before lectures to help me stay awake). That being said, it is important to understand basic economics, and the actual workload is pretty low. There is also a very generous curve, and most people get an A or a B.",
    "Don't take it unless you need to.",
    "Take it if you have to or if you're really interested in econ. NOT if you just want a QR! Take something else for that. The lecture format is kind of difficult to follow if you like to go over steps slowly. Go to section!",
    "This is not too hard a class, and the material is so important for a basic understanding of our economic system, which is in turn so important to participate responsibly in our democracy. Definitely take this course.",
    "Economics 115 helped me get acquainted with an important set of concepts and helped me better understand the world we live in. I would recommend it, though I would caution people who are interested in the social science side of economics that it contains a lot of graphs and equations.",
    "Yes, everyone should take econ at least once in their life. This class is pretty easy, Prof Berry is really good. He is taking a year off next year but if you have the ability, wait to take it with him! Lecture explains all the concepts very clearly and you don't need to read the textbook, or you could read the book and not go to lecture. Also, this class is very highly curved, and the p-sets are not long at all (4-5 questions each)",
    "Yes, I would recommend it if you have Berry. I would recommend it to any student who is simply understanding the basic concepts which underlie some of the economics issues in the news.",
    "Everyone should take this class. It has minimal work especially if you get a good TA to help with the few hard problems on the psets, and Stephen Berry gives a great lecture. Seriously, I doubt that Intro Micro is better at any other school or with any other professor.",
    "Take it",
    "It's a very basic class, an easy QR credit. Not incredibly interesting, but teaches useful stuff.",
    "If you have to take it, do it. It isn't fun, and the tests are hard, but it is relatively easy to be in. DON'T TAKE THE MIDTERM LIGHTLY",
    "Econ 115 is a great class, not only for econ majors, but for anyone that is interested in personal finance.",
    "You have to take it if you are interested in econ",
    "While it was a huge lecture course (the largest at Yale College this fall), Professor Berry does a tremendous job keeping everyone engaged. The material is dry and there's little application to the 'real world' but it's probably a course that everyone should take. I'm hoping macro has some more obvious applications beyond mastering free-hand graphs.",
    "Take the seminar if you can, though this course is generally nice and Steven Berry is good.",
    "Introductory economics.",
    "I would recommend it to another student because it gives you a general idea about what economics is about. The teacher is fantastic, a big help for such a huge lecture class.",
    "Intro micro is a very difficult course. Be sure to stay on top of the textbook readings, even though they may seem different from lecture. Get help early if you need it (from a tutor, study groups, etc.) The exams are much harder than the problem sets. I do not recommend this class - try to get into a seminar!",
    "Take it if you need it, but if you don't need it for a QR or for your major, it would be a really easy class to take Credit\/D.",
    "Good introduction to microeconomics.Class is pretty simple. One problem set a weak, which forces you to keep up with the class. Midterm and Final were not particularly hard.Steven Berry is a very good professor. His lectures are interesting and fun.",
    "It is what it is, introduction to microeconomics. No calculus needed. Professor Berry does a good job teaching it although I found that the subject isn't my favorite.",
    "Recommend it if you think the field interests you and you are willing to put in time on your own to actually learn the material.",
    "I would recommend this class. If you have the opportunity to take the class with Berry, definitely do it. He made a fairly boring topic very interesting. The workload is very light; only weekly problem sets, a midterm, and a final. The curve is very generous and section is optional.",
    "I really enjoyed this class and I had never taken Econ in highschool. As someone that thinks I'm going to major in Econ, I wish I had taken the seminar though because they cover much more. The lecture is very fulfilling though and Steven Berry is a great lecturer. But if you're interested in the major, take the seminar because it gives you a better foundation.",
    "Microeconomics is a decent class -- it fills a QR, the curve is supposedly generous, and there isn't a terribly heavy workload. As someone who isn't mathematically inclined, I found it challenging and frustrating to work with what I found to be rather woolly assumptions -- but that's a personal issue. I think that the nature of a large lecture like this one means that students have far, far less engagement with the material. People who are already good at math should be fine, but if quantitative reasoning does not come intuitively to you, you're probably better off taking a seminar. You'll get by with a decent grade and a loose understanding of the concepts, but you won't really learn economics in a satisfying way.",
    "Basic Econ. Huge lecture, don't expect too much help unless you go out of your way to look for it.",
    "It's not the best way to get a QR but it's OK. If you spend the time going through your notes regularly - get a tutor if you think it's a little confusing - and remember that the final's better than the midterm, you can get through it.",
    "Overall, this class was a good introduction to economics. It is very theoretical and not as math-based as the seminar but the lecture does not demand as much work as the seminar. I did not find the material I learned very practical but it is an introductory course so I was expecting there to be a lot of theory.",
    "I'd recommend it, Professor Berry is a great professor and the lecture is interesting.",
    "Econ 115 is more interesting than it sounds. The curve in the class is amazing and there is small workload. I would recommend the class.The piece of the advice I give is to pick a good section leader (one that can speak clearly and explain concepts). Try and pick the head TA.",
    "A great, very clear and direct intro to Microecon.",
    "Good intro class to take. covers all the basics. doesn't use calculus which is actually less helpful than you might think",
    "Econ 115 isn't the most thrilling course, nor is it the most difficult. If you keep on top of your work, it should be fine and the course opens the door to many more classes that have Econ 115 as a pre-req.",
    "I have no regrets about taking econ 115 and I'd definitely recommend it to anyone who is even remotely interested in econ. As someone who had never taken econ before, I found some of the thought processes rather foreign. However, Professor Berry is an excellent lecturer whose lectures were always easy to understand and follow, and the coursewas never difficult.",
    "If you're thinking about econ, take the course. If you're not planning to be an econ major, then I would say don't take the course because there are many other interesting, more engaging classes out there.",
    "Introductory Microeconomics is definitely a useful course to take for those who either enjoy economics, are thinking about pursuing an economics major, or have never taken an econ class and want to know what economics is all about. Professor Berry is a good, knowledgable, and entertaining professor, but sometimes the material is boring and lectures drag on for too long. The workload is definitely more than managable, and as long as you study properly for the two exams, it should not be too difficult to do decently well.",
    "I would not recommend this class to anyone except for someone looking for a fairly un-mathy QR or someone who needs the class as a prerequisite to another class. Lectures were boring and section was not very helpful. On the bright side, there is almost no work for the class (one problem set a week that takes about 2 hrs to do) except for before the midterm and final when you need to teach all the material of the class to yourself.",
    "More than a really great course, I'd describe this as a really necessary course. Everyone should take Micro at some point, and as Micro courses go, I feel like this one does pretty well. That being said, be prepared to teach the material to yourself, and don't rely on your TAs for too much support. The problem sets are a breeze, but the final curve becomes scary when you realize that everyone around you (all 400 of them) has already taken econ.",
    "I think econ 115 is a great class to take. It is a bit intimidating, but you learn the basics of microecon such as monopoly, oligopoly, supply, demand, marginal cost, and marginal revenue. I'd definitely recommend it if you have any interest in econ because it could help you decide whether or not you want to pursue it as a major.",
    "It's classic. Everyone should take it. Even though it might not be life changing, I liked it a lot more than I thought I would.",
    "I would recommend it, purely because I would like to be an econ major and I think a basic knowledge of economics is an important thing to have. It just broadens your horizons in terms of what you can do after college.",
    "Absolutely. If you are reasonably quantitative (I'm speaking on a Yale scale and as someone who had no prior economics experience), this course will make an excellent fifth credit. Engaging lecture, interesting material, book reading unnecessary, one midterm and one final, short and easy problem sets. And in the end, 40% As\/A-s. What's not to like??",
    "Good intro class. You're able to learn all you need to know for the exams from Berry's lectures instead if having to focus on the reading. The problems sets are relatively easy. The midterm is pretty difficult due to the time crunch, but the final's not too bad. One of the major drawbacks is the large size of the class (over 400 students). Sometimes it gets very hard to be able to focus. Overall though, I would recommend this class, especially for those interested in majoring in economics.",
    "Yes, I would. It's a very well-taught course.",
    "It's a standard micro econ class. Take for simple QR credit or just to try out econ.",
    "I would recommend Econ 115 to another student. The class is an elemental base for economic thought, and I think that it's a really important class to take to be an informed citizens. Ideas from it crop up everywhere in current events. Steven Berry is an entertaining lecturer, and manages to make even some of the more boring topics within the course interesting. However, it is a HUGE lecture class, with 500 kids. This can be fun at times, but it means that there is really no class participation, which can make it a bit tough to concentrate.",
    "This was an easy class that covered the basics (problem sets were tiny). Even if you haven't taken economics before, you should have no problem keeping up. I would recommend this if you have a passing interest in economics. The class was entertaining (Prof. Berry taught it my semester), and somewhat informative; for more depth you should look elsewhere, though.",
    "Sure, if it is the kind of thing you want to take. Professor Berry is dynamic. Problem Sets are short (think: 2 hours MAX!!!), easy and relevant. Lecture is long but not too painful.I'd recommend shopping around to get a good TA because that can make a HUGE difference in the ease in which you study for exams.Do NOT bother buying the book. You will not need it for problem sets and it isn't useful for studying for exams either. I'm serious, just don't buy it; you'll save a bunch of money.",
    "I would recommend Economics 115 to fellow students. Even if you're not an econ major, the class teaches you the basics of economics that any good citizen should learn.",
    "It is a good introductory course of economics. Since there are only weekly problem sets, it is important for you to stay on top of the material on your own or you will have trouble understanding concepts for the midterm and final.",
    "Yes -- take it. It's boring, but it's good to know the information.",
    "I would recommend Economics 115 01 to anyone who wants to get a better understanding of economics and to those who are thinking of it as a major.",
    "Super boring class that I completely regret taking. I had no concept of economics when I started and thought I'd be interested, but I wasn't. I guess its a class you kind of have to take to discover the for yourself. SO dense, and the hour and fifteen minute lectures feel like forever. I really wouldn't recommend that, but seeing as I read these evaluations saying the same thing and took the class regardless, I guess it might be something you have to figure out for yourself. If you do take it, Stephen berry is the professor to take it with. He's funny and as engaging as is possible with material this boring. I thought it would be like freakonomics, but trust me its not.",
    "Huge, decent lectures, painful sections, decent problem sets, nice curve, annoying midterm and fair final. Take if you don't want to deal with the pressure cooker that is the seminar version.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS! Especially with Professor Berry. This class didn't take up a lot of time (I never took Econ before) and it was a good introduction to micro economic theory. The problem sets were easy. The exams were difficult though, but the curve was really nice. At first I was interested in taking the seminar, but shop both of them to get a feel for what you want. I personally liked the big lecture. I also found out that it's a lot easier than the seminar. (But, you will learn a lot more in the seminar)",
    "If they are interested in economics it a very good class to begin with, regardless of whether you have taken econ in high school or not.",
    "A very good intro class. Steven Berry is a great lecturer who really makes this the best Intro Micro class possible. It's very big, obviously. The seminar is more difficult and more intensive. If you're really interested in the topic, try to get into that. If you're looking for a good survey intro with not a ton of work, take this and you won't be sorry.",
    "this course leaves you with the basic understanding of economics but is quite dry. Yes I would recommend it if they are interested in economics.",
    "People don't take this class because its fun and engaging, they take it because they have to. It's too large and boring to be a joy ride for the ones not using it as a pre-req. Honestly, a lot of people came away from it really hating econ or at least losing any enthusiasm they thought they had for the subject. The only consolation is a generous curve (40% As, 50% Bs), but be warned that lots of kids in there already have microecon experience. Take it if you have to. You'll probably be indifferent towards it.",
    "It is a good intro class, with a good lecturer, but make sure you get a good TA!",
    "Don't take this unless you're interested in Economics.",
    "Everybody needs to take intro econ, and everybody should want to take intro econ if it's with Professor Berry. His lectures were very well-organized and entertaining. The class is not time-consuming--one short p-set\/week, a midterm, and a final. But the best part of the class was TF Eli Schachar. His section is a work of art. And he's awesome.",
    "It is what it is. If you want to take interesting Econ classes, you have to start with this one. As a humanities type who wanted to take a \"useful\" QR, I found the class very dry and not so useful as I had imagined. Berry is great though...you can tell he really tries; it's not his fault that the material is so fucking boring.",
    "People say it's a gut class- not quite. You have pset every week and they get harder and harder. You will need to find a good study group to keep up with the work, and must go to every lecture and take detailed notes! I would recommend it if you need a QR credit and are looking for something that can be helpful and practical in your future life. TAs can be either excellent or terrible - and it's really hard to know who is better before you start going to all the sections.",
    "Econ 115 is a comprehensive and interesting introduction to microeconomics. The course is non-calculus based, making it accessible to a wide range of students. I would recommend Econ 115 to a student who enjoys economic or political theory, and doesn't mind algebra.",
    "Yes, great and interesting class",
    "It is an introduction to the concepts and the functions of the economy, its markets, and the ways it functions and does not function on a level of individual firms and industries.",
    "Economics 115 is a must take at Yale. It teaches basic microeconomic concepts useful to everyone (even those not considering an economics major). If you learn best in an environment where lectures are supplemented by problem sets, then you should definitely take the class. Furthermore, emphasis is placed on core concepts ratherthan technical and mathematical expertise. The lectures are perfectly concise where you can get away by just skimming the textbook.",
    "A very useful class. I felt like I learned a lot, and it gave me a new way to look at the world that I did not have before. Not too much work at all, but enough to make sure you really do know the material. Very good course.",
    "I would recommend ECON 115 because I felt that it was a great overview of all of the material.",
    "If you need a decent QR freshman year, this is a fine class. Its good to have taken AP Micro, but you'll be fine without it.",
    "I do not recommend Econ 115 to students looking to fulfill a QR requirement or thinking \"it'd be nice to learn a little bit about econ.\" I have never left a class with so little an understanding of the material. None of my textbook reading, lecture reviews, or hours spent at office hours made any major improvement on this. The class is set up for students who have taken econ before and was incredibly disappointing for me.",
    "This class was my first QR at Yale so far, and I would definitely recommend it as a QR to people who consider themselves \"not QR people.\" Although it took a few weeks to adjust to the discipline--it's very much a different language--I really enjoyed the class as a new lens with which to look at the world.",
    "I would recommend this course if you are looking for an intro into the economic world. Thankfully, you do not need math to take this course.",
    "This is a great introductory class. It's really interesting material that can be applied to a wide variety of subjects, and Berry does a really great job of delivering that information. Not too much work, and for the finals, it's all about practicing using previous tests and problem sets.",
    "I would recommend Econ 115 to another student as it is an interesting introduction to Econ for someone with no background in it while at the same time having a very easy curve of 40% A's. The problem sets are straightforwardand the class was probably the easiest I've taken at Yale.",
    "It was a well taught lecture class. You need to put in the hours in order to get a good grade but in the end it is worth it",
    "Definitely take Introductory Microeconomics! It's a must in order to be an informed citizen and has given me a completely new (and less biased) view of politics e.g. 'Obamacare' and the cap and trade policy to limit greenhouse gas emissions.",
    "Personally, I believe that every educated individual should have a smattering of economics in order to survive in the modern world. That said, Berry's intro microecon class is probably the best way to go about doing that. An engaging lecturer, he takes an excellent combination of intuitive, example-oriented, and theoretical-mathematical approaches that illustrates very well concepts that are often startlingly counter-intuitive.Everybody should take econ, and they should do it with Steve Berry.",
    "I highly recommend econ 115. It is a huge lecture but I didn't feel at all overwhelmed. Steven Berry is really great. The workload wan't an issue at all. Everything was easy to understand.",
    "This class requires a lot of self-motivation in terms of keeping up with the material and really paying attention in each lecture. Sometimes you may get lost in lecture just make sure to bring up your questions during section.",
    "I would definitely recommend Econ 115. It is an easy class and a great introduction to economics.",
    "Great lecture course that will give you a basic understanding of Micro-economics. Would recommend this class if you are at all interested in economics.",
    "Yes, recommended. Interesting material even for those not really invested in econ.",
    "Take it only if you really need it\/have to.",
    "Steven Berry is a phenomenal lecturer, and it's fun to just sit there in lecture and listen to him talk about economics. I felt like I learned a lot this semester and even though I'll probably never take econ again, I think I've gained a lot of insight into matters of political importance, like cap-and-trade and Pigouvian taxes (although probably not anything practical for my daily life). The problem sets are easy and short, but the midterm and final were a little long (but there's a curve anyway, and a pretty generous oneat that). I'd say that this might be Yale's only must-take course.",
    "recommend if want to be econ major.",
    "Econ 115 with Berry was good. Inevitably it will be a dry class, but Berry keeps it humorous, and the structure of the class is straight forward. His problem sets prepare you for the exam, and he does a great job of providing review material. As long as you attend section and take notes you should be fine in getting a good grade.",
    "I would recommend Econ 115 to another student if he or she is interested in microeconomics. I know students who took the seminar and found it very difficult with the curve and the assessments. They wished that they had not taken the class or had taken the lecture. The class teaches you beyond what you may have learned in AP Microeconomics and for that reason, it might be wise to take it first rather than skip into Intermediate Microeconomics. What I disliked most about the class is that it a 75 minute straight lecture, which made it difficult to pay attention the entire time and not zone out. If you need the class for a QR or major or are simply interested in econ, I recommend the class.",
    "Economics 115 is an comprehensive introduction to microeconomics. If you took AP Micro in highschool and did well, then the first half of the course is essentially review with a few new graphing concepts thrown in. A large part of the material after the midterm is new, minus one or two sections. I recommend this course if you are interested in pursuing economics, or are want to find out whether you enjoy the field of economics. The time obligation is not too big.",
    "This being one of the most popular classes at Yale, it is very competitive. The material is manageable if you don't let it build up.",
    "Yes. It was pretty easy - definitely my easiest class of the semester. The problem sets are minimal work if you go to section. I didn't find the exams too difficult, but I also had very good high school preparation in econ, and other students definitely found the class very challenging. The curve is generous, although the grading was pretty picky when it came to defining key terms. Definitely go over the old exams (more than once, if at all possible) before the midterm and final. The lectures were okay - not that interesting but not excruciatingly painful. Our class was huge, so getting a good seat (I have bad eyesight) was tough if you show up late.",
    "An understanding of economics is important for any educated person, although macro is much more applicable to real life\/reading the paper than micro, so take this class to be able to take macro later. Steven Berry is wonderful, but be sure to get a good TA (ELI SCHACHAR) in order to understand all the material as the lecture often rushes things.",
    "I would recommend this class for anyone interested in economics. However, they should know that it is extremely theoretical and not exactly math based as you might expect. Microeconomics is definitely a class you need to stay on top of and really make an effort if you do not understand it, because it is a subject very different from others.",
    "Yes. A very good introductory class toward economic pursuits, with a good balance between easier and more difficult parts.",
    "This class is okay. The workload isn't very heavy (1 problem set a week), but it wasn't particularly interesting either. I took it with DS, which was a nice change of pace to all the reading.",
    "Its a solid social science credit if you need one.",
    "Take it if you want a decently easy QR.",
    "A good introduction to microeconomics. It was a little too conceptual and could have had more applications to real life. However, it is a must take course for everyone. As Prof. Berry notes, if you are going to vote you should have at least some knowledge of economics. Make sure you not only attend lectures but PAY ATTENTION in them. If not, you will fall behind. It is very easy to just finish the problem sets without really understanding what's going on. Also, make sure you attend section as they can be very helpful. If you don't do these things you will have to cram for the midterm and final which is not a pleasant process. But if you do the work and learn the material as it is being taught, it is a straightforward and easy course. 40% get As and 50% get Bs so it is not too hard to get a good grade.",
    "It's like any other lecture class. But Steven Berry is a really great lecturer. If you can though, take ECON108 with Tolga.",
    "Econ 115 is a great intro course. It covers a lot of material, but by the end you really feel you have learned a lot of economy and that you start to understand what is happening in the world around you. No more living in ignorance. Prof. Berry is fantastic at making the material interesting and easy to understand, so I highly recommend taking this course.",
    "Professor Berry is a great lecturer. He is engaging and explains the material very well. It's not the most challenging class, especially if you're decent at math, but it is a great introduction to economics.",
    "Although Economics 115 was a huge class, I genuinely felt like there were plenty of opportunities to grasp and understand the material. It was refreshing to go to microeconomics class because I didn't have to fell pressured to participate and I could just sit back and absorb the material. I recommend this class to students who have not had any economics background and want a general outline of how the microeconomic world functions.",
    "Econ 115 provides a solid introduction to the world of economics. After having taken the class, I feel like a much more informed person who thinks about things differently. In my three semesters at Yale, I have never taken a course with a lighter workload. I spent no more than 1-2 hours on the class per week. The midterm and final exam are not too difficult because Prof. Berry posts old problem sets, midterms, and exams, and the questions are very, very similar. Lectures are extremely well organized and very easy to follow. I would definitely recommend Econ 115, especially as a 5th credit.",
    "An introductory course that courses a broad range of topics. I would recommend it to another student because it shows you what econ is all about.",
    "Intro to Microeconomics will help you to improve your knowledge about supply and demand. Trust me, there is more to know about the market that a simple supply and demand model. I may not end up being an economics or EP&E major, but I still think that this is stuff that someone should know a little about. Take the course.",
    "This is an interesting class on a dry topic. The lectures are interesting, but the homework is not. Overall it is a fairly light work load. I would recommend this class to another student because it is a good introduction to the field of economics.",
    "This is a general overview of microeconomics, and covers all of the introductory concepts. It is a large lecture.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course for a fellow student. I found it really interesting. Compared to the seminar, it is a bit less intense (especially math wise), but you really learn a lot in the lecture too.",
    "Economics 115 05 is an introductory econ class that everyone, regardless of major, should take at some point. I highly recommend it.",
    "Not a super easy gut. Soo hard to pay attention to. If you do pay attention, you shouldn't do too badly. Amazing curve (40% A, 50% B), but I think I ended up at the bottom of that curve.. besides the D-Fs..",
    "I would recommend this class only if you can't get into the seminar. Professor Berry keeps the class going, but at times, it goes too quickly. The fact that the lecture has 500 students in it makes it impossible for students to ask questions (other than the once a week section), and as Prof. Berry tends to write\/draw graphs as he speaks, it's hard to pay attention to what he is teaching while also taking notes. That said, if you do take the class, make sure you don't just mindlessly take notes, make an effort to listen and if necessary, get the notes later. The only reason I would recommend this class is because I had a great TF - Eli. Try to get into his section no matter what. Additionally, keep up with problem sets and remember that they're much easier than the midterm or final.",
    "Yes, I would recommend it - its very engaging and the material is interesting. Curve is forgiving.",
    "Yes. Take it. Not much of a workload and pretty interesting. Midterm's tougher than you might think. Final's not too bad.",
    "Take it. It's one of those classes that covers things worth knowing and is a necessary stepping stone.",
    "Take it if it's a prereq, never 'just for fun'",
    "It's a good intro to econ but can be boring at times. The text book is totally useless, don't read it. The workload isn't bad and the curve is really nice although the concepts can be difficult to understand.",
    "Econ 115 is one of the required classes to major in economics. It is a bit daunting since there were roughly 400 students in class, but Professor Berry did a great job to make the material interesting and keep the class engaged.",
    "I would definitely recommend taking a micro Econ course however the seminar may be better",
    "While I personally considered taking the seminar, I'm glad that I ended up doing the lecture. The workload is a lot easier, and I felt like I was still able to learn a ton of stuff about Econ that would be relevant in later courses. Be warned - the grading isn't \"easy\" though, you have to work if you want that A.",
    "Everyone should have a basic understanding of economics. This is a nice, stress-free class.",
    "Yes, solid class, although only having two exams does make it stressful.",
    "ECON 115 is a class that though boring at times, does teach very useful concepts and skills for understanding and participating in the market. You can either apply yourself and do the textbook reading and learn more, or just attend the lectures, it depends on your own motivation.",
    "Great introduction to Econ - take it, especially because you'll need it later for a lot of majors or interesting classes. It's not too difficult if you do the problem sets and put in the time to study. Go to section - it's hard to stay focused in a huge lecture, and section is a good review of most of the key topics.",
    "Yes, if you must take it. Definitely it is not a course you need for life, as some might make you believe. There is actually very little information that will help you at all in life, except again, fulfilling requirments",
    "Yes, it is a fairly easy intro to economics.",
    "This is a class you can do really well in - all you have to do work on it and not slump away. That isn't as easy as it sounds. Its the largest class at Yale but that really doesn't matter in the end. The material is insightful and definitely higher than Intro level. Take it as a mild gut.",
    "Yeah, this course is interesting and the work load isn't that bad.",
    "Econ 115 is a solid class for a huge lecture. If you can pay attention in such a large classroom, it's a good way to get an econ requirement out of the way.",
    "Yeah it's a good class that is quite interesting.",
    "Yes! its not a great class but its a good and relatively easy class which I assume helps lay the foundation for harder classes. also be regular and look over your notes. it will really help in the long run because there is no regular testing and you may get lost without doing so.",
    "Great class if you like puzzles and problem solving but you have to make sure you keep up with the work and review lectures otherwise you'll fall behind and you wont understand new topics making the class very boring.",
    "take a seminar instead. people come out of the seminar loving econ but the lecture is hell. lots of boring information confusingly presented by a professor who does his best with a terrible subject. the exams are impossible, definitions of words have to be memorized from the textbook or points are deducted, everything has to painstakingly labeled and explained or points are deducted. psets every week and 2 exams are all you get for grading obviously.",
    "I would only reccommend it if you are going into economics, or if you need a relatively easy QR.",
    "I would summarize as an introductory course which is not challenging in its understanding but challenging because of the abundance of formulas and concepts one has to master by the end of the semester. I would say t is a course worth taking only if one is ready to put effort in it.",
    "See over all assessment of the course. It is what it is, probably can't get better. But it's not that bad.",
    "Regarding material, probably typical for a large introductory econ lecture, but Professor Berry does a great job of making it interesting and teaching in a clear manner.",
    "A large lecture course that covers the basics of Microeconomics - pretty much what you would expect.",
    "Introductory Microeconomics is an interesting and relatively easy course. I would definitely recommend it if you are good at learning on your own and have an understanding of calculus concepts. However, if you need someone to teach you everything and are terrible at math, don't take this course.",
    "Good intro micro course, with a great professor.Recommended to all.",
    "The only reason I'm glad I took this course because now I can take macro. I did not find that I learned very much in econ 115. It's easy to feel lost in any large lecture, but a good section can help. Unfortunately, the TAs for this course were not very good at explaining concepts so the section was not a good supplement to the course. I was never able to see the \"big picture\" and that was very frustrating to me. It was hard for me to understand concepts because the course did not put those concepts in a larger context. The curve in this course is generous, but everyone still ends up stressing because no one feels like they truly grasp many concepts by the end of the semester. Steven Berry is helpful if you make an appointment and take with him one on one, but don't expect much help from your section.",
    "This is an interesting course that is not too hard. Yes, I would recommend this course to others.",
    "I would not recommend this class to someone who is looking for an easy way to fulfill a QR requirement. It is very fast paced and is much easier for those who have taken economics in high school.",
    "I think that the Economics 115 lecture was truly a wonderful class. Professor Berry is a great instructor who really knows his stuff. Furthermore the problem sets are short and the course material is easy to understand (as long as you dont open the textbook and stick to the notes). With a very generous curve to add to that, there is very little reason not to take the class, if you have the slightest interest in Economics",
    "Yes, the course is a good introduction to economics for people looking to understand the basics. It has been taught forever, so it is a well-oiled machine and I get the sense that Professor Berry knows what approaches work and what approaches don't work. The book was pretty useless--the class is almost entirely based off of his lectures. Sections are optional, but I would go because they were generally very helpful in preparing for the weekly problem sets. Sometimes the questions were unclear as to how much detail was needed, and this resulted in some issues on the midterm, which is taken under a bit of a time crunch.",
    "This is a good course to take if you have never studied microeconomics before.",
    "Not the most thrilling class, but necessary for taking higher level econ courses. Professor Berry does his best to make the class interesting. The book is useless for the course - best way to learn is going to class, paying attention, and taking good notes.",
    "Yes, recommended. This is stuff you need to know, and the class won't kill ya.",
    "It is what it is says it is. An ok class. Certainly not great, but not as horrible as expected.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who has doubts about being an economics major. Although I liked the course, I found that the economics major was not really for me. Also one thing to keep in mind is that the course changes a lot throughout the semester in terms of the context, so it is hard to conclude how the course is like just by shopping it the first week.",
    "This is probably the last time this class will be offered in this form. But I thought it was okay - I took it as a PoliSci major wanting to know a bit about Econ, and didn't feel like I came away with any knowledge. The class had a lot of (easy) math - preparation for Intermediate, I guess - and very few real-life examples, which is what I wanted. So in that respected, I found it frustrating.",
    "A basic overview of Microeconomics.",
    "I would not recommend this course for a student in need of a QR. There are easier courses out there. Problem sets and studying for the midterm and final caused me a great deal of unnecessary stress. I don't feel as if I know substantially more about economics than I began with. Upper level economics courses probably offer what I wanted to learn.",
    "Professor Berry is great and if you want to take an introductory economics course I couldn't think of a more enjoyable way.",
    "Yes, because he will learn some basic principles of economics.",
    "Yes. If you need to take micro for a requirement, take it with Professor Berry!",
    "Take it. Berry is the man... not too much work... not too difficult... a good class to take at Yale.",
    "I definitely would. Even someone not interested in majoring in Econ should still take this class to be an educated voter and citizen.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone with little or no experience with economics. It is a good intro course taught by an excellent professor (Berry). It moves at a fair pace, and even if you don't keep up during the semester you can make up the time lost and cover a lot of ground in preparation for the final exam. If a different professor were teaching it, I might not recommend it as highly. Professor Berry is the primary reason you should take this class--he's engaging and interesting to listen to, and he makes the material accessible and applicable to real life.",
    "Intro Micro Econ is a good course if you want to understand the basic principles of micro economics. It is also a QR course that actually has practical applications in the real world.",
    "Yes! A worthwhile introduction to the subject. Micro is dull at times, but Berry is great and makes the class about as good as it could be.",
    "Yes i would definitely recommend intro micro to anyone",
    "Econ 115 is an excellent introduction to microeconomics. The course provides an interesting overview of a very important subject, and really should be required for all Yale students. Highly recommended.",
    "It's a huge class and for me that made learning hard. I think I would have liked econ better if I could have worked in smaller groups. Reach out to your TA and shop around until you get a good one! That said, I think Prof. Berry does a good introductory job.",
    "I thought the teacher was funny and effective, and I thought the course did its job. I personally found that Econ is not my thing, but I think taking this class was good for learning more about how the world works.",
    "If you want to learn about economics, take this. I would say that I learned a lot that I hadn't known before but not as much as I wanted.",
    "A good survey of micro econ; Berry is a fine lecturer, and the workload is light. Be prepared for lots of repetition in lecture, however; good if you need the reinforcement, but can be boring if you don't.",
    "It's Econ. There are better classes to take. BUT if you have to take intro econ, I'm not sure anyone could do it better than Prof. Berry.",
    "I would recommend Microeconomics 115 only to a person who feels that they may be interested in having an economics major or are interested in going into economics.",
    "A good intro course. Not too hard, just make sure you work. Great prof, but really big class.",
    "Considering that it\u0092s a huge introductory class with over 500 students, Professor Berry has done a tremendous job. The class is clearly organized, with the first half covering the conditions of perfect market and the second half explaining why it might fail. He always goes through the previous class\u0092 concepts at the start of the class, ensuring we go through the same material twice. I particularly liked how he relates concepts we learned in class to real-life situations such as for example linking adverse selection problem with the current health care bill. All in all, I think he has made what would have been a boring huge lecture class pretty interesting and engaging. He might not be teaching next year, but if he is, take it. However, I do have to note that I\u0092ve heard really great feedback from my friends who took the seminar with Prof. Koker, but I can\u0092t comment on that as I was never enrolled in that class.",
    "I would say that it's an important class to take in order to gain a better understanding of the economy.",
    "Your basic Microeconomics class, boring and informative.",
    "Solid intro to microeconomics; take the models with a grain of salt (the prof repeatedly stresses that they do not hold very well in reality); not a heavy workload; probably a better choice than the seminar if you're a freshman and a self-starter",
    "Econ 115 is a large lecture class. It is also an introductory class, so it goes slowly and the math is not hard at all. Professor Berry is quite good at explaining the concepts, so if you show up to all the lectures, you should be fine. If you have not had econ before, I would recommend it. (And it's hard to get the econ dept to let you jump ahead anyway)",
    "You won't be thrilled by the subject matter in this class, but Steven Berry does a great job of making what would otherwise be boring material interesting and relevant. The first 20 minutes of every lecture is usually review, the problem sets don't take very long, and the sections aren't required, so if you have to take this course, take heart!",
    "I would summarize this course as a rigorous introductory to the topic, which requires a good deal of intuitiveness for a A grade. I would recommend the course to any that would enter into a vaguely similar field as it seems very necessary to begin further economics course at Yale, and provides many basic skills.",
    "I found the lectures a little frustrating - it was hard to stay focused enough for the entire 75 minutes to really latch on to the concepts, and it is easy to fall behind and not be held accountable for the information until the midterm or final. That being said, the concepts are not really all that difficult to understand and the tests are pretty fair. And, the problem sets do not take long and are very straightforward.",
    "Great introduction to economics at Yale College.",
    "This class, as taught by Steven Berry, is an interesting introduction to microeconomics. Berry is a great lecturer and he illustrates the material in a way that is easy to understand. I would recommend this class to another student because the workload is not very heavy and the material is very useful.",
    "The class is not too challenging if you take good notes and work hard on the problem sets. The lecture format can make it difficult to engage in lectures. Good news is that you have your TA to help and can transfer to another if the one you were given isn't very good.",
    "I would mostly recommend this course. It's an enormous lecture, but Prof. Berry is clear and entertaining. The work isn't bad, and the material is pretty interesting.",
    "Yes, I would absolutely recommend this course. It gives important information that everyone should know, whether or not you plan to be an econ major.",
    "I would recommend Economics 115 01 to a fellow student because it really transforms relevant complicated economic principles into something accessible.",
    "I would recommend the class, because it's a good introduction to Economics regardless of major.",
    "If you've needed guidance before in your math classes etc. then the seminar might suit you better. I still would recommend the class to those who want a basic understanding of microeconomics.",
    "It's a good course. I would recommend it to another student.",
    "Yes, if you aren't sure whether or not you want to go further in Econ, I think its a great idea to take this class. The workload isn't horrible and its nice to have a large lecture at times.",
    "An intro to microeconomics! YES! Everyone needs to take an econ class",
    "I would recommend this course to other students regardless of their majors. The topics covered in the class include basic models for understanding a lot of simple cases in life, and concepts and ideas that will guide us through many different subjects. Professor Berry does a good job of making the class lively and engaging through his enthusiasm displayed in the lectures. The structure of the course is good and the amount of work is decent. The old midterms and finals are very useful for studying for the exams, and be sure to study the way that questions are graded so that you don\u0092t lose points for formatting and phrasing problems."
