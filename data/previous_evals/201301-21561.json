    "I would recommend--I think teachers further understanding of material very well",
    "This class in INTENSE. If you really want to learn Mandarin and speak it well, this class is perfect. Just keep in mind that you have a quiz every morning and a test at least every other week. Also, you're required to go to a 30 minute tutorial every week. It often felt difficult to keep up in this class. The professors are all very helpful and understanding though. Be prepared to get a private tutor if you want to be really good."
