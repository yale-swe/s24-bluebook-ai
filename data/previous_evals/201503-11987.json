   "comments": [
    "I would absolutely recommend the course if you are interested in issues of forced migration, more from a legal perspective than a comprehensive policy one.",
    "If this course or anything like it is offered again, take it. You learn a ton in this course and it's easily one of my top 5 Yale courses. Workload may seem intimidating initially but is certainly manageable.",
    "Best class I've ever taken. It felt like all of our previous seminar experiences were just a dress rehearsal for this. If you ever get a chance to take a class with Professor Dufresne again, do it. If you are trying to figure out if you have time in your schedule for it (because it is a lot of work) make it fit.",
    "If this class is ever taught again, it's a sign from a higher being for you reconsider your major or career choices. It's one of those life-changing classes that will influence the way you see the world, and absolutely the best class I've taken at Yale.",
    "The greatest class at Yale! Unfortunately, Prof. Dufresne is leaving next semester, but if she ever comes back - take a class with her! It will transform your perspective!",
    "This class was amazing. It was intense and a lot of work, but so rewarding. It is a law focused class but was a great balance between strictly law related material and the human, political and ethical questions related to refugee issues. I loved it, and would recommend it to anyone if it is taught again.",
    "Of course I would recommend this course. I am sad for my fellow students as they will never have a chance to take it with Professor Dufresne unless by some miracle she chooses to come back.",
    "Amazing class! Please take! It's a lot of work but it's worth it! The subject matter is so incredibly relevant and you'll really get a feel as to what law school will be like!",
    "Greatest class at Yale! Take it if you want to find a way to make the world a better place and get motivations and skills to do it.",
    "Fantastic class with a fantastic professor. The assignments are nuanced and interesting, the reading is heavy, the expectations are high-- but in the end, you feel like a true master of the field. (Will say that the workload, if you have any law experience, is somewhat lower than past evals make it out to be. It's a fair bit of work, but not soooo much more than other courses. Maybe this is true just because it seemed like we had fewer written assignments this year than in the past.) This is as in-depth an examination of any one topic as is taught at Yale. Yale will sorely miss Professor Dufresne, but, if she ever comes back to teach this course again, I recommend it wholeheartedly.",
    "Amazing intro to refugee issues and legal reasoning",
    "Refugee Law with Alexandra Dufresne was the perfect class for those interested in refugee law and policy and worthwhile for anyone interested in law and in finding a fantastic advisor. Between the case law, the oral arguments, and the essays, the course was always challenging, enlightening and exciting. Despite the Friday morning classes, there was not a week when I did not look forward to class time. Sadly, this was Dufresne's last semester at Yale, but if this class is offered again in the future with a different instructor, I would still recommend. Dufresne may have brought irreplaceable knowledge and inspiration, but the content of the class remains important and urgent nonetheless. If you're interested in refugee studies, take this class."
