    "HIGHLY recommend. Ambassador Carson is a fantastic teacher and mentor. He truly cares about his students and the topics he teaches about. The class was like 75% lecture and 25% discussion which was perfect as he is so knowledgable about the class topic. But students were constantly asking questions and challenging his statements which made for a great class atmosphere. Not too much work, just a 6-8 page midterm paper and a 6-8 page final paper on a topic of your choosing.",
    "Yes if you are looking for a broad, overview course and have not taken anything on Africa before. No if you know a lot already, because this course will likely be repetitive for you.",
    "Ambassador Carson is the strength of the course. He is jovial, excited and interesting. Although he runs a small class more like an interactive lecture, he is extremely well informed and capable in his felid. Carson is accessible nearly all of the time despite the fact that he spends most of his time outside of New Haven.",
    "This class is a great overview of current political issues in Sub-Saharan Africa. I would recommend it to students interested in increasing their knowledge, either as someone who knows nothing and wants to learn or as someone with a lot of background understanding who wants to take advantage of the opportunity to ask Ambassador Carson more in-depth questions. It's only two papers, although they're pretty harshly graded -- I would go over topics and outlines with Ambassador Carson before turning in papers. Overall though I'd recommend the class! Lots of reading that you should do so you can participate (only once a week class, though) and two mid-length papers, but nothing else.",
    "This is a course that anyone interested in Africa, as a continent often misunderstood, should take. The course provides a different perspective of Africa, which is far from what many hear from public medias.",
    "If you don't know much about Africa in general, this is a great course. If you do, you may get a bit frustrated as a lot of it is fairly basic knowledge. Nonetheless, Ambassador Carson is a fascinating man who clearly very knowledgeable and passionate about the topic, and you'll get a real insight into how the State Department operates with respect to foreign policy in Africa.",
    "Good survey of US foreign policy toward Africa, but not a true seminar format. Very lecture-based."
