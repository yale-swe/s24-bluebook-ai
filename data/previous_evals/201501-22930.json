   "comments": [
    "Take this course, but also take out a loan for printing. It's not covered by the materials fee and it'll cost you AT LEAST an arm and a leg.",
    "This class is a solid introduction to the principles of design. You do not need any prior graphic design experience to get a lot out of this course, and I think the things you learn could go on to be beneficial in many fields. There is a good balance of hands on and computer work, and you will be taught how to use the necessary software.",
    "Yes, recommended",
    "Yes - it is a challenging course though and requires a substantial time commitment.",
    "Highly recommend! Whether or not you want to be a graphic designer, learning to communicate visually is an important skill to have. Course starts with cut\/paste paper projects, then moves to digital work (culminating in an InDesign designed book project).",
    "GD required less work and was less stressful than I expected. The non-digital projects weren't my thing and the daily critiques (especially the marathon \"final review\" during reading period) could get tiresome. But overall it was a good way to gain a first exposure to serious design work.",
    "If you're thinking about taking this class, take it! You'll really become more conscious as a designer, and think about the choices you are making in each project you do. You will get out of the course what you put into it, however.",
    "If you are interested in design and have little background in foundational concepts, take this course. Though projects can be time-consuming, if you are interested in the material it will not seem like work. You will learn great fundamental theories and practical skills. Do not take this course if you already have design fundamentals but are primarily interested in learning specific computer skills.",
    "As a preface, I took graphic design as an engineering major looking to branch out. This class is not just some gut humanities and should not be treated as such. However, this class teaches you to look at the world around you in a new light, better understand the choices made in the design that constantly surrounds you. I highly recommend taking this class, just because it is so relevant. Moreover, it is quite fun to be producing art rather than problem sets or essays. Keep in mind though, this can average about ten or more hours a week depending on the assignments. I would recommend Yeju, but I don't know much about Julian.",
    "Intro to Graphic Design gives students an understanding to begin to communicate thoughts and ideas into a clear visual format. This course is very self driven; therefore students must want to push themselves to edit their work several times (so individual assignments might require quite a bit of time). The more time you are willing to put into this course, the better the outcome.",
    "I couldn't figure out what I was learning at first. I love that we practiced a lot of theory, but I don't feel like I could do a graphic design project if I needed to for a client."
