   "comments": [
    "I definitely would. You are constantly learning and things you do in class actually change your perspective outside of class. You interact with your classmates all the time and you learn from their work as well.",
    "No. Not worth the time and energy you spend.",
    "This is a class where you're going to have to work hard if you want to produce something that you're proud of. Be prepared to go back to the drawing board several times (even if you knock it out of the park on the first try, you'll be surprised to see how much a few more drafts can send your project into the stratosphere).The final project was extremely rewarding and it was also cool to see everyone's work up on the wall at the final review. It was very clear that everyone had grown throughout the course -- it was also clear, by the end, how close the class had become.Definitely would recommend for art majors, regardless of medium. Graphic design has its own unique challenges, but somehow they all relate back to some general principles that are always useful to be reminded of.",
    "This class was pretty awesome. It taught me to look at visual communication in a new way, and to see how design elements, including composition, color, typography, line, and image, all conspire to create an intended (or even unintended!) meaning. I loved the thoughtful inclusionof readings - both philosophical\/theoretical (i.e. Barthes' \"Death of the Author\" and Dondis' \"Primer of Visual Literacy\") and instructional\/informative (i.e. Hofmann's \"Graphic Design Manual\") - as well as the professor's tendency to steer class critiques in a highly analytical direction. I also really appreciated that we only began to use computer programs such as InDesign and Photoshop toward the middle-end of the semester; I think that, while cutting and pasting and xeroxing was time-consuming and often a little frustrating, limiting ourselves (at least initially) to analog processes of design more effectively ingrained in us the important concepts behind each assignment. The final book project was incredibly fulfilling and was a great way to synthesize all of the techniques and theoretical perspectives of the class. The only criticism I have of Art 132 02 is that I wish I had produced a more extensive body of work by the end, although I completely understand the educational import of systematically working and reworking our projects with the input of the professor and other students.",
    "Sure! You'll definitely improve your graphic design skills, and the worldload is pretty average for an art class.",
    "It teaches graphic design and how to communicate thoughts and feelings through a 2d medium. I would only recommend this class to those serious about putting in the time to get better and better. You either have some talent or you dont, and I think most people do not have that talent so it will take hard work to understand the principles needed to effectively communicate.",
    "It is a good introductory course, though it is tailored for undergraduate schedule so make sure you allow plenty of time for it if you are a grad student",
    "I would recommend. I took this course i lieu of a marketing course as I wanted to get tangible communication experience."
