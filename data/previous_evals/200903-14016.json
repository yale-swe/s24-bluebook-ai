    "Good survey of topics but no interaction during class. The professor just reads slides",
    "The course was a good introduction to how molecular biology is applied to epidemiology, and reviews some important points from the introductory epidemiology classes.",
    "Dr. Yu made a great effort explaining complicated biology and epidemiology concepts.",
    "The topics covered over the course of the semester were very interesting and applicable to my field of study. Unfortunately, lectures were not very useful and since there is no textbook is was difficult to gauge what we were being taught and what the purpose of the course was. Overall, looking back, I did learn interesting aspects of molecular epidemiology and this can definitely be applied to my field of study.",
    "The course was not what I expected and I was disappointed by how technical it turned out to be in that so much of what comprised the lectures was laboratory technique details instead of real life applications of molecular epi.I understand why there is no text for the class. However, I wish there were at least recommended resources to read each week. The professor's slides often had a lot of information on them, but lacked details that would help clarify concepts (e.g., key definitions).I enjoyed the broad overview that the class provided.",
    "This course presented a lot of scientific material in a very short amount of time. In a way it feels like we tried to learned too many molecular techniques and how to apply them. The material kind of came together by the end of the course, but in the middle of the course, I began to feel overwhelmed with the amount of detail and material that was presented.",
    "Strength - Interesting material.Weaknesses - Poorly taught. The instructor produced an outline at the end of the course which might be more effective if the outline was shown at the beginning of the course. This would allow a better understanding of where the different parts of molecular epi come together.",
    "strengths - very elaborativeweaknesses - very difficult to understand the professor",
    "I did not learn anything from this course except for some lab techniques which I already knew from my undergraduate molecular biology class. The exams were not reflective of the course. The professor was teaching us from wikipedia."

    "Instructor: Herbert Yu \u00a0Very informative lectures, however did not provide much feedback.",
    "Instructor: Herbert Yu \u00a0Excellent!! As a person and as a teacher!!",
    "Instructor: Herbert Yu \u00a0Dr. Yu is very smart and knows much about molecular epidemiology.",
    "Instructor: Herbert Yu \u00a0Herbert was very easy to talk to and he is clearly very passionate about his work, which in very important when teaching to students who are not professionals (yet!).However, he was often unclear about his expectations of us (e.g., the \"one hour final\" turned into a two-plus houred exam for EVERYONE in the class).I wish more guidance had been provided each week about the key take home messages, or if Herbert had given us areas to look into after lecture that he had presented in class (whether brief write ups or mini quizzes) to make sure we understand his lectures.He is a very reasonable professor though and I really liked that he took the time to very thoroughly go through the mid-term exam.",
    "Instructor: Herbert Yu \u00a0Dr. Yu was a very knowledgeable prof who was always willing to answer questions and explain any concepts we had trouble with. However, it was sometimes difficult to interpret the specific \"take-home\" messages that he was trying to instill. In a way this made studying for the exams difficult because we were unsure what to focus on. I appreciate that he tried to integrate the basic molecular techniques with the epidemiology methods but I feel that some of this was lost on us when we would focus on the specifics of each method in class.",
    "Instructor: Herbert Yu \u00a0Strengths - Dr. Yu has a strong understanding of the topic. He not only teaches molecular epidemiology but also is a real time practitioner.Weaknesses - Unfortunately he does not teach the subject well. In particular improvements in the teaching of the basis behind the subject and focusing on the epidemiology more would be helpful.",
    "Instructor: Herbert Yu \u00a0Very nice person.",
    "Instructor: Herbert Yu \u00a0I do not believe Dr. Yu understands epidemiology because half the time he seems unsure of the material he teaches and on our midterm he was arguing with us about effect modification terminology. The entire class was arguing the terms he used on the midterm is not what is used in literature and what is taught at Yale. The midterm and final questions were not comprehendable at times because there were things that were not taught to us or he just could not get the question across. In addition, he bases his lecture notes off Wikipedia. Some of his terminology is copied directly from Wikipedia. Hence, I doubt his ability to teach and his knowledge in this subject. He is a nice professor in general because he is very approachable but I do not believe he can teach this course."
