   "comments": [
    "I think it would be better if this class was about Polymer Chemistry instead of Polymer Physics. I think the class would be much more applicable to additional students. Biggest weakness: Time of class. Having class in the middle of lunch time made it difficult to concentrate and I had to miss meetings that were only held at lunch time.",
    "Without tests I was not forced to try to retain the information being taught. At the same time I still learned a good amount and the class was more an overview course of polymers for graduate level research.",
    "The free flowing nature of this course was both a strength and weakness. I was interested in a lot of the material, but I would often question why I was learning it and where it was useful. More real life examples would be useful to motivate learning in this less structured course.",
    "I thought that this course was excellent. All of the subject matter was very interesting and covered in a very understandable way, even for undergraduates. My only criticism would be that the course is probably better suited to be covered in two semesters instead of one, so the topics can be covered in more depth.",
    "Course lectures and topics are well organized. The pace of the course is rather fast and it can be easy to get lost in the math at times."

    "Yes, but only if really interested in materials science or polymers.",
    "Yes, it was quite interesting and not very stressful. Generally quite enjoyable.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course if you have any interest in polymers. The course provides a comprehensive overview of the field of polymer physics, and you get to learn about a lot of interesting topics that you probably have never seen before. Also, Professor Zhong is awesome!",
    "Yes, it is an important course to take to gain fundamental understanding of polymer physics and is taught by a very knowledgeable instructor."
