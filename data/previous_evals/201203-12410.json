   "comments": [
    "I recommend. Its a good class to take to explore a subject that is relevant now and was at all points in history. The work is interesting and not too difficult: just read and comment in a few words and write one paper. It made the class stress-free and enjoyeable!",
    "This class is really as a junior seminar. There is a lot of reading every week, but the books are really interesting and engaging. I would definitely recommend this class to anyone, especially because of Professor Rasmussen. She is absolutely awesome, really engaging and fun.",
    "An eye-opening class, beginning with a colonial narrative that was the first national best-seller& ending with a viewing of Rise of the Planet of the Apes starring James Franco. Those two may seeming unrelated, but are actually inextricably linked through themes taught throughout the course.If you're down with understanding the intricacies of oppressive structures in the United States and if you see the merit in deconstructing and critiquing those systems, definitely take it.",
    "I would very highly recommend this class. It is a truly interesting topic that causes you to reconsider the concept of captivity and therefore of who the \"captive\" is. It opens your mind to many possibilities and is very relevant to today's events. This is one of my top 3 favorite classes at Yale.",
    "This was a really great, unique course (with a pretty light work and reading load) that I would definitely recommend. It draws very interesting parallels between captivity narratives from the colonial age to today--and gives you an appreciation for the importance of the captivity narrative, a genre I'd never heard of before this class.",
    "Absolutely take it. It's interesting and low stress. The readings start with early captivity narratives between native americans and colonists and the readings move all the way through reading about Guantanamo. Everything seems relevant. You have to do a weekly reading response, but it is very low key and only a page or two long. Then you go to class and have an interesting discussion. At the end there is a 10 to 15 page paper on a topic of your choice. I feel like I learned a lot and didn't stress a lot it was great. Professor Rasmussen was extremely knowledgable and a great discussion leader. Sometimes she ends up doing a lot of the talking, but she's really interesting so it was fine.",
    "Absolutely! It's a class with a relatively low work investment, and I learned a lot in just 2 hours a week.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. The theme of the class might seem very one dimensional, but as it continues I think the class was really able to engage with the topic in many ways. The workload is manageable, yet it an extremely rewarding class.",
    "AWESOME TAKE IT. Had never really thought of captivity as a literary or historical genre, but am very much interested in in now. Professor Rasmussen is really excellent. She leads discussion beautifully and is very helpful with papers etc towards the end of the semester. Readings were interesting and weekly responses were very doable. Take it."
