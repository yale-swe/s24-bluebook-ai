   "comments": [
    "I would summarize it as a broad sweep of architectural theory, history, and design, and I would definitely recommend it.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course. Not at all because it's the best course I've taken, but because it's material that more people should know, is generally enjoyable and relatable no matter what your field, and because so many students never actually use their own hands to do anything, the way you get to with design projects and sketchbook assignments. Do be warned that TAs (pretentious architecture grad students) probably won't be very helpful. Have fun with it regardless!",
    "This is a great class, although if you're stressing about grades and such, this might not be for you because you don't get feedback at all. Took about 3-4 hours sketching for the first half of the semester. THe design projects are fun.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class. You get as much out of it as you want, as in you don't have to really do any of the readings if you don't want but they were interesting when I would have time to sit down with them. The final project is honestly one of the coolest things I've ever done at Yale, after 5 semesters. The lampshade project ended in absolutely incredible results from a lot of people, so it was inspiring to see how creative and brilliant my peers are. The projects were beautiful.",
    "DEFINITELY DEFINITELY TAKE THIS COURSE. It's amazing and lots of fun. It's so different from other classes at Yale, and though some classes profess that it will \"change how you see the world,\" this class DEFINITELY does. I would recommend it whether or not you think you'll be majoring in architecture. Be forewarned, even though it's an \"intro\" course it's a fair amount of work, especially drawing. However, if you're into that kind of thing, it's so much fun and you learn a lot from not only Alex and your TFs but also your peers.",
    "This class is great to figure out how much you might love architecture. The downside is that if you end up not loving architecture that much, this class will likely bore you and the assignments will likely annoy you. I love that I was able to make a sketchbook that shows my improvement throughout the semester; having a solid showing of the work I did in this class will be a great resource in the future, since I'll always have it to look back upon. It also makes for a great start to an architecture portfolio, even if you're not doing the major, but might do something further with it in the future. Shop the class if you're considering, and if drawing and building assignments sound like fun, definitely take it. Also, don't let the drawing scare you; I had little drawing experience before this class and got much better throughout! Even my lame drawings at the beginning of the semester had their merits, and helped me improve to what I have today.",
    "Arch 150 is a great introduction to an architectural way of understanding the world. That, I think, is its best quality: that it will change the way in which you see the landscape around you. Professor Purves is a strong lecturer, and has structured the course very well. It includes weekly drawing assignments, two design projects, and one essay. The workload is very manageable - especially if you start days in advance - as well as enjoyable. I would certainly recommend this class, both to those interested in architecture and those who are looking for a fun class.",
    "Great class take it if you're interested in architecture and actually do the design problems. dont half ass them.",
    "It is a course for everyone. It's true that no prior experience in the field is required. I think it would broaden your thoughts into a wholly another world. Mind-blowing. Really! You should take it! I think it would be a really good part of your liberal arts education.",
    "You get out of it what you put in it",
    "A great introduction to architecture. I learned so much and loved doing drawings once a week - a nice break from papers and psets. Take it! Very fun and teaches you a lot.",
    "Really engaging class. The lectures were always incredibly fascinating. Professor Purves is a wonderful lecturer and truly got me interesting in architecture. The assignments and the section were much more questionable. My TAs mostly just told everyone to redo their drawings and a lot of the assignments felt only vaguely related to architecture, but if you want a drawing class that's not too rigorous this is a great choice. The amount of work you put into the class is mostly up to you, but you could either put in some work (you'll need to work hard on several of the assignments no matter what) up to a ton of work. There are a lot of optional readings that most people feel like they won't have time for, but most of the readings are really fascinating.",

    "Take it! It's fun and it helps you look at buildings in a whole other perspective - just another way to enjoy Yale more.",
    "ARCH 150 will teach you an architectural vocabulary, how to communicate graphically, and so much more. Take it!",
    "GREAT class, prof Perves is an awesome lecturer, cr\/d\/f if you're not artistic as you have sketchbook assignments every week and tfs vary on grading",
    "I really enjoyed this class. Weekly drawing assignments help you analyze and understand the different architectural techniques and theories discussed in lecture. There is a lot of emphasis on sketching in lecture, getting in the habit of drawing what you see (but you don't have to be a great artist to enjoy\/do well in this class). Overall it is a very informative and enjoyable class, and even though I am not an architecture major, I am glad I took it. I would suggest this class for anyone who either likes to draw or would like to learn more about the ways in which buildings are conceptualized and constructed.",
    "A great class that anyone should take. It really makes you look at the architecture around campus (and everywhere) in a new light",
    "It is a great introductory course. I would recommend it if you like drawing and want to see buildings and the way they relate to each other in new and different ways.",
    "Even if you're not intending to major in architecture, arch 150 is an amazing course you should take. ITS SO FUN and such a nice change of type of work. You'll do a weekly assignment (sketching or modeling) and talk about your work with your section at the end of the week. The lectures are awesome and I felt that every minute in this course was well spent. And really not that much work.",
    "Yes! But only if you're willing and interested to put a lot of time into drawing",
    "I would highly recommend ARCH 150 to everyone. For non-majors, this is a super chill and engaging class: you turn in one set of sketches per week, one paper and two design problems. that's it. For people intending to major in architecture, this course might be slightly frustrating. It is very much a survey course that accommodates the many non-majors who take it. this can mean that you don't really dive into any one architectural topic, which for someone who wants to be equipped with tangible skills for success in the major and beyond, is cumbersome.",
    "Take it if you want to find out if architecture is the right major for you. If you already know that you are not that into architecture, then it's not worth it.",
    "Excellent lectures w professor purves. In my opinion, the guest lectures were less good but still interesting. Weekly sketchbook assignments, design project, and a final project or paper. No grades until end of term, which is kind of nice. Would recommend to discover a new way of seeing the world. The TFs were great in my case.",
    "Great intro class. I really enjoyed it and j recommend it regardless of what your major is.",
    "ARCH 150 is a fantastic class for any students with even a superficial interest in architecture. The course is required for architecture majors, but many (most?) students in the class are in it because they thought it'd be fun (which it is). Professor Purves is thoughtful, smart, and kind, and lecture is consistently really interesting. Class assignments include weekly sketches (really fun\/relaxing to do, and an excellent way to procrastinate on your reading or psets), two models, a short paper, and weekly readings (which you can get away with not doing). Section generally consists of discussing your sketches from that week. No drawing experience required, which is great - everyone gets a lot better. Also, grades aren't really a thing - I still don't know what I have in this course - so it feels really laid back. I took this class because I wanted to appreciate Yale's architecture more, and I wanted to look up more as I walked. ARCH150 provides students with at least that much, as well as some basic understanding of architecture and a consistently enjoyable semester. I repeatedly recommended this class to my friends throughout the semester - definitely shop it!",
    "I would recommend, but not necessarily a gut.",
    "Intro Architecture with Purves is a great class. Lectures, sections, and crits were all amazingly fun; it feels like there is very little grade pressure, just pressure on putting as much effort in as you can. The workload is whatever you want to put into it-- an easy class to Cr\/D but one definitely worth taking for a grade, since I think you'll train your eye and mind best if you take it seriously. Don't take this class if you want a technical course in drawing, but do take this class if you are interested in building\/buildings and you want to get a little more hands-on.",
    "An absolutely lovely class that I cannot recommend enough. The lectures, alone, are inspirational and will make you look at the built world (and especially Yale) in a new light. I am not at all an architecture major, and I took this as a fun extra class, but beware that it is meant for architecture students (or, really, people trying to figure out if architecture is for them) so it's a fair amount of work. They say that \"you don't need to know how to draw,\" but this is not completely true. A lot of effort is expected for the weekly assignments - so either be prepared to put in a *lot* of work, or credit\/D, or even (I sort of wish I had done this) just audit the class. Professor Purves is one of those rare people who adores his subject, adores teaching, and can express difficult concepts in beautiful language. The TFs are fantastic architects and happy to share their experience. They are also very, very good at running critiques and care a lot about their students.",
    "No I would not unless you have to take the course for the major.",
    "Arch 150 is a good lecture class, fairly easy workload, and you learn a lot of technical skills when drawing plans\/sections\/buildings. I would highly recommend the course",
    "Would definitely recommend, whether for a grade or for Cr\/D. Its was a mind clearer to be able to draw\/make something once a week rather than write essays or do problem sets. Just don't leave the problem sets until last minute - some are long!",
    "A well-rounded and well-taught course in terms of material covered and methods used to do so; more emphasis on other architectures besides those of the West would be welcome; if that's less of a consideration for you, I would recommend the course hands down.",
    "Really awesome introduction to architecture for majors and non-majors. Would suggest having some official drawing or art class experience to get the most out of this course (it won't be hard to keep up with the drawing, more like you will get more out of the critiques if you know what to ask and how to understand them).",
    "Great class! Basis for understanding the fundamentals of architecture, which is valuable regardless of whether or not you plan on majoring. Very interesting lectures and assignments. Really fun and informative.",
    "Definitely take Architecture 150 if you're at all interested in architecture! Lectures are fantastic, so don't miss them."
