   "comments": [
    "You'll learn a lot about the development of science - in every discipline - and in the process encounter some of the foundational issues in modern scientific methodology and epistemology in their formative stages. Lots of interesting and useful historical insights, too. Kind of a broad survey - mostly primary sources, though, which is for me a plus - but you learn a lot about where to look next if you're interested in any given topic. Excellent course. Two papers, reading can be a little long sometimes. But an excellent course overall!",
    "Everyone should take this class or a class like it - really contributes to a more healthy understanding of the sciences and I very much enjoyed it. The readings were generally very interesting and so was class conversation. Sometimes, they were much too long, but sometimes short as well. Prof. Watson gave great feedback and was very helpful and accessible.",
    "It's a great course that covers a lot of questions, though none in particular depth, unless they happen to reoccur across readings. You'll get out of it what you choose to get out of it - so if you take this as a 5th class, beware the temptation to skimp on the readings. Good professor, interesting and fun class.",
    "Readings in Western Science is a survey History of Science course that explores the works of scientists in a multitude of different scientific fields from the Greeks to current day. The course forces a student to wonder what exactly science is and what motivates scientific pursuits. I'd recommend this class to any student who has ever been interested in looking at science as a mode of thought--the class doesn't require much scientific prowess, though it's incredibly helpful in providing insight into many of the readings. By the end of the course a student will have a much greater appreciation for scientific exploration and the way that scientific experimentation has changed and become largely standardized. The class will also introduce students to the mode of writing of many different scientific disciplines and make students a bit more comfortable when handling scientific texts and more aware of what goes on in the background of those scientific texts--even science happens in a historical context."
