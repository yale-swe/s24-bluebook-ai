    "It's a difficult class. Take it if you need a CS elective or if you're interested in AI, which is a cool subject. If all you have as prerequisites are 201 and 202, and maybe just a bit more programming experience, you will need to work really hard in this class to do as well as the grad students. The problem sets take TIME and no one will help you unless you seek it out actively, so START EARLY.",
    "It is a great overview of the theory and history of AI",
    "It's not an easy course, so don't take it if you're not prepared to handle some serious work. But you will learn some new and interesting things about AI. Be prepared for a challenge. And, of course, take it if you have an interest in AI.",
    "CPSC470 is a good class for those curious about AI. With a few exceptions, you won't get an in-depth look into the topics, but you will get a general overview of the field, the current state, and the challenges. It's not particularly difficult, but as with any CS class, the time it takes you to do a problem set has an exponential distribution. Scaz is an excellent and clear professor.",
    "As a Mechanical Engineering Major, this class was tough at times, but still manageable. I would recommend a fairly strong background in programming. CS223 was a helpful prereq, but only from the programming practice. I had not taken CS202 or discrete math but this wasn't too much of a problem for me. It was definitely a worthwhile class to take, as a lot of AI topics apply directly to MechE. It also counts as an elective for the ABET program.",
    "This course touches on many different topics in AI without going extremely in depth into any. Having taken this course, I feel like I would be extremely interesting at a cocktail party but not very useful in a lab (though not entirely useless).",
    "A.I. was a so-so course. Scaz is pretty good, and the information covered is interesting. We don't really learn too much about any one thing though. Pull up a wikipedia page on any one topic we cover in class, and you'll probably get just as much, if not more, information than you learn that day in lecture."
