   "comments": [
    "Take it! It's a great course with great novels and Professor Yeazell is fabulous!",
    "This class is great if you are at all interested in the literature; it can be really tedious at times, but you have to just push through it. Professor Yeazell's lectures are usually stimulating and helpful, and one of the best things about the class is the optional paper schedule; you can turn in a paper at the beginning of the course, revise it, and you'll receive the higher grade! I also would say that it isn't too much reading at all; there are just enough books to give an accurate picture of the period without being overwhelming.",
    "YES. This was a fantastic course. Professor Yeazell is a real gem -- I frequently left lecture in pure disbelief that one woman could draw so many fascinating analyses and connections from these texts. She has a wonderful sense of humor and a charming modesty -- also a great pair of pleather pants, which she can definitely rock. Do beware: if you're a slow reader (like me), it's very easy to fall behind in readings. Once you figure out your reading pace for each book (and believe me, your reading pace for \"North and South\"=TORTURE will be different for your reading pace for \"Tess of the D'Urbervilles\"=MAD EXCITING DRAMA), you've gotta make yourself a reading schedule and stick to it.",
    "Interesting course with good books to read. Don't take it if you are a fast reader or don't like Victorian fiction, but if you are\/do then a good course for you! The final is kind of mean, but I think as a whole it's a decent choice. Professor Yeazell is rather adorable.",
    "YES!! Absolutely!! You read amazing novels all for credit. Lecture is really enjoyable, Professor Yeazell is a wonderful professor and she makes her material really interesting. Her wit will amuse you.Workload is quite a lot, Read MiddleMarch over spring break, you will be happy you did. There is a chance to revise one of your papers and resubmit it for a better grade so thats ok. Also TA will look at as many drafts as you want. so go for it!!",
    "This class was such a delight. I really loved reading these novels and talking about them once a week. Yeazell is a wonderful lecturer and always had something new and interesting to say.This would be a great introduction to Victorian lit; for me, it was a great way to revisit familiar novels. The assignments are interesting and not too much work--two 5-7 page papers, a midterm, and a final exam. I took it alongside other English classes, and it was a relief to have a nice novels course without a 10-12 page paper requirement at the end. Accessible to non-English majors too. Very satisfying; a good class to round out your schedule.",
    "The Victorian Novel is a class about the Victorian novel. You read six novels over the course of the semester, basically in chronological order. Although six books doesn't sound like too many, they are quite lengthy (Middlemarch is about 800 pages), so there's still a decent amount of reading. The reading list is WONDERFUL and I would recommend it for that alone; but the lectures are good too and I even found my section to be enjoyable. So I would recommend this class to anyone who knows they want to read the books on the syllabus, to anyone who likes a good courtship narrative, or to anyone with good taste in literature.",
    "I went into the class simply wanting to fulfill the pre-1900 requirement and it turned out to be my favorite class of the semester. I loved the books for the most part, and I truly appreciate having read them. Prof. Yeazell's lectures are great, very informative, and never feel tedious.",
    "This is a fantastic course. I'm an Econ major and I enjoyed it thoroughly. The book selection is great, and Professor Yeazell's lectures are some of the best I've had at Yale. Highly recommended to anyone!",
    "Great course for satisfying the pre-1900 English requirement that covers canonical works no English major should leave Yale without reading. There aren't many novels (only 6), but there's still a lot of reading due to the size of each novel (especially Middlemarch), which can be painful for ID's.",
    "English 265 is a lovely guided tour through six truly enjoyable landmarks of the British canon. Ruth Yeazell gives engaging lectures which bring out important details of the novels, and the books themselves are genuinely fun to work through between classes. This isn't the most rigorous English class I've taken at Yale, but I would confidently recommend it to almost anyone willing to take a critical look at some be old favorites or develop some new favorites by looking at them critically.",
    "I loved this course! If you like Victorian novels, you should definitely take it. If you don't know whether you like Victorian novels or not, this course will place you firmly in the \"like\" camp. Professor Yeazell is fantastic, and the homework is mostly just reading good books!",
    "Stay on top of the reading! The quote IDs on the tests are hard if you try to learn via sparknotes. Staying on top of your reading isn't too much of a burden.",
    "This is a great class. The only thing to be forewarned about is the immense amount of reading. That being said these are books that everyone should read and the Professor Yeazell's lectures are really fantastic.",
    "This was overall a very good course-- and it gives you a chance to read novels, something I miss terribly when I'm at school! Yeazell is an extremely compelling and likable lecturer, although she manages to infuse some sort of feminist 'women-in-bondage' reference into every class (relevant, but gets a little old). Graded workload is very reasonable-- 2 6-page papers and fair midterms and finals. The books are all great except for \"North and South\" and \"Middlemarch\"-- Middlemarch in particular was terrible, and I didn't get through it. Other than that, I found myself constantly engaged in whatever we were learning and and definitely recommend it to someone else!",
    "I enjoyed this course. However, I thought the best novels by far were the first three, so the course kind of went downhill for me. I liked the lectures and although there is a lot of reading the workload isn't too intense (two short papers, a midterm, and a final.)",
    "Heavy reading. I like all of the novels and still didn't have time to get it all done. The final and midterm are a pain, but are still reasonable depending on which TA you are assigned to. Maybe a gamble, but not a terrible class.",
    "Great class especially if you're not an English major. It's good reading and interesting.",
    "It was awesome.",
    "A good lecture course...fun books. It's hard to show up for lecture, though, because they seem peripherally related to section, the assignments, and sometimes appreciation of the novels.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course if you're at all interested in reading these books. The lectures are really fun and engaging, and gave me a much deeper understanding of the books than I would have gotten just from reading them on my own.",
    "Sort of a typical English class -- definitely good but only take it if you're interested in the books to begin with. If you are, it'll be reallly enjoyable, but if not you might be bored.",
    "A lot of reading! It doesn't really feel like much until you get to Middlemarch (which you should definitely start over Spring Break). It's a great class though. Do the reading!",
    "great class, take it credit\/d and its much less stressful"
