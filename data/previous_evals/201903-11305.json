   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "We covered a good variety of material and I genuinely learned the topics we covered while enjoying myself; a true rarity in engineering classes. This was a gem of a class mostly due to Professor Tsai. Definitely felt like the focus was on learning rather than grades and as a result the class was very collaborative and an overall positive learning environment.",
    "The class followed the textbook extremely well which made it much easier to understand compared to other engineering classes I have taken.",
    "This course had great lectures (Alex Tsai is fantastic at explaining concepts) and was designed clearly with the textbook in mind. A weakness is that it felt almost too casual at times.",
    "Alex Tsai transformed this course! He added in several matlab\/simulink tutorials to showcase the real world use of our materials. Dynamics is a fairly easy engineering class which is usually taught as a bit of a joke, but Alex took the freedom to make the class better.",
    "I thought this class was well organized and well-taught. I wish there were more options for office hours - I know there was always the option to schedule something but I often wouldn't do that until I knew whether or not I would need help, and then by then it was sometimes too late to schedule something before the pset was due.. maybe that's just a lack of initiative on my part though. I think that it would have been cool to do a tiny bit more integration of simulink to challenge us to apply it to the homework problems - I enjoyed doing and seeing the projects at the end of the semester, I think that was a good idea. I also enjoyed how Professor Tsai sprinkled in explaining where this stuff will be relevant in the real world. I think it would have been cool to have a weekly problem session where we worked through especially challenging problems together, just to give us an idea of the further limits of how these equations can be applied.",
    "This was a great course that taught me a lot of applicable skills and knowledge within mechanical engineering. Throughout the course, we were abe to often see how what we were learning applies directly to problems in the real world.",
    "The course was very well taught by Professor Tsai. It was one of the most engaging classes that I have taken in the Mech Eng major. I found the teaching style very engaging and constructive."

   "comments": [
    "This course varies widely depending on who is teaching it, but my experience with Professor Tsai was fabulous and I would highly recommend. We learned a strong foundational basis with a little sprinkle of Matlab and other useful applications and I enjoyed myself throughout the course.",
    "If Professor Tsai is teaching it, I definitely would! He made the class very fun, engaging, and flexible to accommodate students.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student. If you are ABET, you need to take it, but if you aren't, I'd say that it is one of the better engineering classes at yale and that it is very much applied physics material if that is something you are interested in.",
    "Of course.",
    "If it's Alex Tsai teaching it, absolutely.",
    "This is usually required but I would recommend it because I think it's a really good survey of how physics applies in a range of engineering problems. I also really enjoyed physics so I liked the material and enjoyed learning in this course.",
    "I would highly recommend the class as taught by Professor Tsai. It is well structured to allow for student engagement and growth."
