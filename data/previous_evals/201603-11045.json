    "I learned a classical version of grand power politics and of military history. Though I can't say my writing skills developed very much, my knowledge base certainly did.",
    "I got a broad and wide understanding of the trends and the factors that lead to the rise or fall of some powers\/ continents, since te 1500's.",
    "A good course for broadening one's perspective on modern day IR challenges. I appreciated the \"big history\" approach.",
    "I learned so much about military strategies, technologies, and wars. You cover over 500 years of material, and I am very happy that I took this class.",
    "I learned to think more about grand strategy and its implications in history.",
    "This class provided me with a very broad, yet informative view of the western world from 1500 through the Vietnam war.",
    "Greater understanding of various military powers, the rise of powers, the fall of powers, and just general global trends.",
    "Very intriguing class. A lot of time is covered but you fly through the decades and learn about the most important information.",
    "Evaluating \"big picture\" history, analyzing historical statistics, and noticing trends that would influence future historical events.",
    "I developed note taking skills for classes heavy on reading, as I had not been in a class like that before. I also gained a plethora of knowledge involving the focus of the class of course. Particularly in pre-20th century events of Europe.",
    "This is a \"big history\" course that offers insight into major events and developments from the 1500s-present day.",
    "A general knowledge of many of the major changes and events since 1500.",
    "This course really teaches you to absorb, filter and then analyse a huge amount of information, over a very long period of time.",
    "how to read quickly",
    "I think that this History course really helped me to think about the big picture or as Professor Kennedy would say \"the broad sweeps of History.\" It is amazing to consider how quickly our world has changed in the last 500 years in terms of technology and organization.",
    "I love that Professor Kennedy makes it clear at the beginning of the class that it is a military history, not a history of wars--it's just a different lens through which to view history that you've probably learned in other, more generalized ways. I learned so much about how and why militaries have been organized and have functioned over time, and the class sparked a renewed interest for me in current international affairs and the intelligence community as it is involved with defense. I have a new respect for the institution of the military, and am thankful for the class.",
    "I gained ample knowledge regarding the history of world military history.",
    "I got a big picture of the History of Western Europe! I now know what countries were super powers when and why they no longer are.",
    "This class teaches the students to look through the lens of \"big history,\"looking at the macro politics of nations and events which had extreme influence on western history. The sections in this course also instructed how to write proper history papers.",
    "good class summarizing the wars of the last 500 years",
    "I got out so much from this class in terms of learning about military history and the nature of war in general. This is a broad survey course, covering important topics from 1500 to present, so it really depends on how much efforts you want to put into learning about the materials and how much you want get out of it.",
    "Very informative class on military history, mainly focusing on Europe.",
    "This course is not designed to build any skills. But I learned a lot about military history and how it shaped the general history of the world (beyond just the West even though the course is focused on the West). This is an extremely interesting course and I enjoyed learning about the way different forces (land, sea, air) interact and what their strengths\/weaknesses are.",
    "Learned about how finances and technology have shaped warfare and the rise and fall of nations since 1500s.",
    "This course provided me with a new perspective and insight from which to view modern day military and political affairs by providing a broad overview of the major, key events since 1500 in the western world. I thought that the course was very effective in this regard.",
    "I learned so much about the history of military. This course was so interesting.",
    "In this course I learned about the broad trends of military history.",
    "A macro-view of history, the military perspective of history",
    "Great",
    "You learn a lot about world adn general history over time with emphasis on the military, it is really interesting if you like Western history, politics and war. It is mainly review if you have already taken AP U.S. History or European History in high school.",
    "I learned a lot about understanding the broad trends in history and just how important it is to know how technology ran a lot of history's course.",
    "A broad overview of world history from 1500.",

    "A broad overview of military history",
    "I was able to learn about big systems in the world. I thought this was outstanding.",
    "I better understanding of western development, including economic, social, and cultural factors that played key roles in the war plagued continent.",
    "I learned a great deal from this course. It was enlightening and very interesting.",
    "Knowledge about the interplay of the economies and militaries of the major world players of the western world from the year 1500 and beyond with insight about the forces and reactions and policies that led to\/caused\/correlate to this interplay.",
    "I gained a wealth of knowledge of the past 500 years of military history.",
    "Great overview of world history since 1500, demonstrated through the lens of warfare and shifting power alliances. Professor Kennedy is one of Yale's best professors.",
    "A fundamental understanding of mercantilism, weapon technology revolution, and modern military development.",
    "I learned a lot about military history, and how to break down and grasp huge amounts of information",
    "This was a wonderful course that helped me to develop a greater understanding of world history. Although the main concentration is on military history the course does a great job of providing the background of events and fleshing out the people who have shaped world events.",
    "I developed much greater knowledge of history on a broad scale, the rise and fall of the great powers, and the influence of economic, technological, and diplomatic factors on military history. I feel like I finally have a good grasp on the large-scale history of the western world. I better understand how countries achieved the relative power statuses that they hold today.",
    "great class",
    "This course was remarkable. I learned all the various methods of warfare dating back to the 1500's to present day. It was very interesting to learn and discuss tactics, weapons and key battles",
    "Gained knowledge about European history, and learned how military technologies played a huge role in Europe"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Paul Kennedy is an amazing lecturer, and his knowledge base carries this course. There are no weaknesses to think of.",
    "A major weakness of the course is that the TA's teach and grade to wildly different standards.",
    "It's a great course, and Professor Kennedy is amazing.",
    "All good things to say about this class. Engaging material, taught by an awesome professor, and there is only a midterm and a final. This is a must-take class at Yale.",
    "This course needs to have less readings so that students can keep up. This course was very good in subject material and broadening new perspectives on military history.",
    "It's a big class, but a lot of information is being thrown at you, so I don't really think the setup could be changed much? A strength was just the vast knowledge professor kennedy had, but a weakness would be sometime's I feel like he would ramble on about topics not really related.",
    "The end of the course got blended together because of time so I wasn't fully aware when the class stopped in terms of historical events",
    "Strengths - interesting lectures with unique insights from an incredibly experienced professor, provided take-aways to be remembered beyond just names or dates, and allowed for personalized level of engagement with the class and the material without too many repercussions. Weaknesses - very high level covered in lectures so readings (or the internet) are important for fully understanding combatants, names, dates, and technologies.",
    "I found a lot of the readings very interesting, however some were a tad redundant. The second half of the course is very detail focused and chronologically in order, whereas the first half jumps around between the centuries a bit, paying closer attention to themes.",
    "Lectures were tedious to stay in sometimes. Readings repeated material covered often, with the same information and facts stated multiple times in different readings assigned on the same day.",
    "Strength: Professor Kennedy is a Yale institution and sprinkles his British humor into a lecture that provides an in-depth introduction to a wide-ranging class. I also like the ban on laptops in the course, as I could truly focus on the material being presented rather than being distracted by my neighbor surfing Facebook.",
    "Lectures were often not very focused, and it was often difficult to see what the main ideas were. Would have been better if they were better organized, rather than what seemed just like a stream of consciousness for Prof. Kennedy.",
    "Kennedy is a unique professor, teaching a well-know array of topics in a very interesting way.",
    "the lectures were lovely to attend, but I felt very little was learned from them. Most of the learning comes from the reading.",
    "The lectures were generally unhelpful. The readings were really good, but there was way too much.",
    "Strengths included engaging lectures and invested TAs. Although I wish I had the time to complete all the reading I simply didn't. Perhaps a slightly slimmed down reading list would have made me feel less discouraged when I wasn't able to complete it most weeks.",
    "Honestly, I wouldn't change anything about the course. The lectures are comprehensive and are told with a coherent and fascinating narrative, and section fills in all the contextual gaps that Professor Kennedy can't possibly get to in 50 minutes. I think Professor Kennedy has designed a wonderful survey course, and it was a pleasure to hear him speak twice a week.",
    "I believe the implementation of a second midterm would keep students in this class engaged.",
    "The lectures aren't the most interesting but the readings are solid.",
    "I thought this was an outstanding course overall. The only improvement would be more text on slides, as many of them only contained a title and an image depicting the title.",
    "The readings are VERY heavy, and is the main approach that you learn materials of this class. Lectures are nice but they cannot help you learn things and figure out connections between historical events. I wish there could be more guidances and discussions for teasing out the most important themes from readings at weekly discussions.",
    "The strength of this course is Professor Kennedy. He is such a military history giant and clearly loves the subject very much. The syllabus is organized well. The only fault that some might find with the course is that it can be hard to tell what is important outside of the main themes of the course. I liked Professor Kennedy's lecture style, but some might (wrongfully) criticize it because it doesn't neatly create little capsules of knowledge that you can consume and is instead broader in focus, leaving the student to determine what they think is important.",
    "More text on lecture slides, as it is tough to follow lectures.",
    "The strength of the course is certainly in Paul Kennedy's lectures. The readings seem to overlap a little at times and can discourage a student from completing them.",
    "Strengths: Paul Kennedy Subject material guest lecturers my TA: Russ midterm and final are only assingments Weaknesses: reading load- this course requires a ridiculous amount of reading each week, yet does not test you on ANY OF IT. If the reading were cut in half, perhaps some people would do it, but as it is now, perhaps 1 out of 10 do all of the reading. Luce Hall is kind of far- SSS would be better",
    "There should be more seats and people should sit on the inside first so when people come late they don't need to climb over other students.",
    "great class, covers a lot of material but does so well",
    "The course was well-organized and the readings were all enlightening.",
    "Great course overall",
    "Strength was that the class was interesting, and it required little work outside of the readings, which didn't really need to be done. Weakness is that because of the little work, the midterm and final are heavily graded, but they aren't too difficult and very straight forward.",
    "Strengths: Professor Kennedy's lectures were very engaging and his topics were relevant to the whole course. His passion for his lectures always made me excited to go to class. Weaknesses: Section was not always very focused and the other students in section tended to not have a reason to be engaged.",
    "Loved my TA Flynn Cratty. Professor Kennedy is a legend.",
    "Covers a lot of time, but without much specificity as expected.",
    "There was a *lot* of reading, and not a whole lot of feedback as to how I was doing. While an exam-only class seems nice, it means a lot is hinging on a final that's on material I haven't been tested on. The lectures were excellent, and we had great guest lecturers as well.",
    "Too much readin and the lectures are vague and lack concrete facts.however, the class is great because it gives you an opportunity to interact with the information through the reading and understand broad concepts and events. I like the emphasis on technology.",
    "Far too much reading was assigned, which detracted from the direction and approachability of the class.",
    "The class has countless strengths. From the professors, to the readings, to the pace, I really have nothing negative to say about this course.",
    "The course covers a vast span of time, but does a great job of picking out important events and creates a nice story of history over 500 years.",
    "WAY TO MANY READINGS. He doesnt allow computers, so if you do not write fast, you are going to have a really hard time in this class",
    "The main strength was Professor Kennedy's ability to draw broad themes and convey the ideas behind the history. It's weakness was the lack of specificity over what material was central to the course and what was tangential.",
    "Professor Kennedy made the lectures very exciting. There was a lack of assignments (midterm and final) which can be good and bad. There was lots of reading involved. I definitely enjoyed the course and the material overall.",
    "Great and interesting lectures and sections however a ton of reading and much of it is very very repetitive.",
    "Distribute grading more. The final holds too much weight.",
    "Professor Paul Kennedy is definitely the best person to teach some of the famous theories introduced by himself on the topic of western military history. Most of the readings are very interesting and Kennedy's lectures are brilliant. However the course covers too much material and sacrifice the depth of understanding on specific events. Also this course does not offer a variety of perspectives of the topic, but follows the mainstream understanding of western history.",
    "The course was very good, but the syllabus was changed almost weekly which made it hard to do readings in advance and keep updated with the constant changes.",
    "I think there should be more assignments along the way, not just the midterm and final.",
    "There is an overwhelming amount of reading and not all of it can be done. Also all the books are really expensive and hard to get ahold of if you decide not to bye from the Yale bookstore.",
    "Strengths: It covers 500 years of history while still managing to achieve depth. It emphasizes not just brute military might, but how various other factors contributed to howe powerful certain countries were at certain times. The material was extremely interesting and relevant, and the class was well-organized and well-taught. Weaknesses: The readings were far too long to reasonably do all of them, and the readings were also far too varied (more than 6 books and many online book chapters or pdfs as well). While they were all interesting, it might be helpful to consolidate the readings to provide more structure.",
    "great professor and TA",
    "There are many strengths to this course. The professor is amazing and full of knowledge. He makes the audience engaged and lecture is very interesting. The only weakness is that the final weighs a lot on the total of your grade so need to prepare heavily for that.",
    "It was a great course, I dont think it should be changed"

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course to any other student. I think that everyone should take a history lecture course, and that this one is perfect. It isn't too difficult, but it is interesting.",
    "Yes, definetly recommend.",
    "Yes.",
    "100% yes. Regardless of your major, I'd recommend this class to anyone.",
    "I would recommend this course, because it is very eye-opening and applies well to current affairs.",
    "ABSOLUTELY YES! YOU MUST TAKE THIS COURSE (especially with Paul Kennedy!). Nowadays, courses in military history are becoming obsolete around the nation. Why? It \"seems\" irrelevant in today's world; however, it's more relevant than ever with other nations militarizing (like in Asia--China especially). This course explains how militaries developed and what caused some to fail and some to thrive.",
    "This is a classic Yale course. You take this course for Paul Kennedy. There is an enormous amount of reading and material covered, but the lectures are generally entertaining and you'll leave with a better understanding of the general themes of conflict and the relationship between war and economics.",
    "Yeah, Kennedy is so fun.",
    "Yes, if you are interested in military history of the west -- covers that well No, if you are not.",
    "For someone who did not know much about history going in, I thought it was a great class.",
    "Yes I would recommend this course because it was very interesting, Professor Kennedy was an excellent professor to learn from, it was relatively stress-free and allowed for as much engagement as you wanted.",
    "This course was very interesting if you enjoy history of course. I learned a lot, and a lot of details in subjects I only had a vague understanding of previously. Makes for good braggy dinner table facts and what not. It's a pretty good class overall I'd say if you like reading.",
    "Absolutely take this course. Prof. Kennedy is incredible and provides a great opportunity to study military history, something that is rarely touched upon at Yale.",
    "No, the readings were redundant and while many label it as a gut course, I firmly believe that if you actually do the readings as is requested you are doing more work than is reasonable.",
    "Yes, especially if you're into \"big history\" and would like to take one of the few military history courses left in the United States.",
    "Decent choice for a humanities credit-- not incredibly interesting, but low workload and reasonable assessments.",
    "Take this course while Kennedy is still around. He is a God.",
    "Take it. Don't think about it. Just take it.",
    "I would recommend this course. Professor Kennedy is a fabulous lecturer and the material was very interesting. It is amazing how the military history of the 17th and 18th centuries can have relevance today. Also with only a midterm and a final the workload was less than many other classes.",
    "I would definitely recommend the class to another non-history major like myself. Hearing Paul Kennedy lecture is a Yale must, and the topic is one that is under-taught at so many other universities. Not too much work or stress, since doing every page of the reading is far from mandatory. Also a great credit\/d because you can do very little work while still gaining new insight and understanding.",
    "A true gut.",
    "Take this course if you want a comprehensive overview in Western European history. You could probably put little effort into this class, do well, and learn some cool things about military history. Or you could put in a lot of effort, do all the reading, learn a lot about trends in military history, and do very well. The class is really about how much effort you put in to do and understand the reading. Lectures are great and interesting. Prof. Kennedy has really funny remarks that keep the lectures lively.",
    "I would recommend this class to any student in need of a humanities credit.",
    "Yeah! Take this class! Super interesting material that gives you a great overview of the history of Western Europe! Also, pretty easy to do well!",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to other students. The readings were manageable and extremely interesting (focusing on major military and political events and their consequences), and the course workload is also very manageable. Students will come out of this class knowing how to write a history style of paper.",
    "No, although Professor Kennedy is amazing, he doesn't have much to do with the way the essays are implemented or how sections are structured. It's all about what randomly assigned TF you get. Plus the ROTC kids get it easy, and get good grades from their officers.",
    "One of my favorite classes at Yale. Kennedy is a great lecturer.",
    "Great class - you definitely get out what you put in.",
    "Would absolutely recommend to anyone with any interest in history and in the rise of the past, current, and even future global powers that have dominated the rest. Not limited to those interested in military history but in economics\/finance, industry\/technology, and great historical figures.",
    "A good class. It is not much work at all (midterm, final). I find it hard to believe that anyone who went to at least three classes before the midterm would do poorly because it just asks about vague themes of the class. The final was not terribly difficult but it was long. You will be asked to prepare questions for one section based on the reading (or lectures...), which was not hard. Many people take this class because it isn't a lot of work and one can miss the lectures and still do fine. I implore you to go to the lectures. Professor Kennedy, in addition to being a giant in his field, is actually really funny. If you feel like his voice will put you to sleep, drink a coffee before class or something. Even if you come away from the lecture thinking \"what was I supposed to get out of that,\" keep going. You're bound to learn something at every lecture. He does NOT arrange his slides so that all important information is arranged in neat little bullet points for you to copy as you half listen. Pay attention and it will be clear what you need to know. There are only like two or three central themes to the course, so use your brain.",
    "Would recommend to anyone who would like a broad overview of military history since 1500.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to another teacher. Professor Kennedy is a phenomenal teacher, and his lectures are extremely entertaining and insightful. The course provides an interesting perspective from which to view modern day issues.",
    "Kennedy is brilliant and funny- take this class before he retires! This might have been my favorite class this semester! There are too many required readings that almost no one does, but if you do do it, I'd suggest Kennedy's Rise and Fall. Also, Boot's book is pretty interesting as well. The guest lecturers for this course are actually pretty good. The workload is pretty light: one midterm, one final, and required section. I found the material itself very interesting, even though it focused less on battles, like I anticipated, and more on the rise and fall of military powers.",
    "Yes. I loved going to class to all the lectures.",
    "definitely! really insightful and fantastic course, learned a lot and thought about world history in a new way",
    "Suitable for anyone who wants an interesting history class without a crushing workload. That being said, the readings provide a lot of insight into the class and buttressed the lectures.",
    "Yes",
    "Definitely take this class. I took it cr\/d, which was a great move. Professor Kennedy's lectures are super interesting and it was lovely to go listen without the pressure of having to memorize every single detail.",
    "Yes, this course is interesting and not very time consuming, it is good to take if you are interesting in the material, it is straight forward and not very hard.",
    "This course is good for a broad view of history. You can learn a lot with a reasonable workload.",
    "Yes. Super cool class, easy workload, and awesome TA's\/Professor.",
    "Yes. This was on my list of \"courses to take during my 4 years,\" and it was definitely a good decision to take it. There are surprisingly few broad overviews I've wanted to take, but this course handles the broad overview very well. One concern: There is a *lot* of reading, and no intermediate assignments (your grade is test-based). That means it takes discipline to keep up.",
    "Yes. Professor Kennedy is amazing. Please take.",
    "Absolutely. Even though \"military\" was in the course title, and could be seen as a major turn off to most students, it was not just a class about wars. It was a well crafted history of a war plagued era and how \"the west\" evolved into what it did today.",
    "This course is not two things that you'd think it might be: 1. It is not a military history course in which you learn lots of specifics, like battles and dates and kinds of plane and ship. It's broader than that. 2. It's not a Western history course with a military bent, so you won't learn European history this way. It's more specific than that. The way I'd explain it is that you won't learn what battles and weapons were used under Louis XIV, and you won't learn really who Louis XIV was and why the wars he fought were fought, instead you'll learn about bureaucratic development during the 18th century. I didn't have much European history in high school, and I took this class to make up for that gap, which it didn't for the reasons above; however, if you like European history and good lectures (Kennedy is fantastic), certainly try it.",
    "I would recommend this course, as it provided a great timeline of history. More than that, I learned greatly about the how in history, on top of the what.",
    "Taking this class teaches you about how the military factors into the standing and relative power of a nation and its importance in driving technology, economy, and policy.",
    "Yes",
    "Yes! Any student interested in history, regardless of major, should take this course.",
    "Definitely take it if you are a fan of military history. Kennedy covers a lot of weapons and battle tactics.",
    "Yes, definitely. A very interesting course about the history of military development and why countries rise to the top and fall. There is a ton of reading but it is often repetitive, so if you can be smart about it you don't have to spend a crushing amount of time on it.",
    "Yes- I think it is great information for any history major.",
    "I would strongly recommend this course to other students. It is absolutely fascinating and you learn a ton about the rise of the West and the transformation of military techniques!!!",
    "I loved this course. I feel like I finally have a good grasp on the large-scale history of the western world. I better understand how countries achieved the relative power statuses that they hold today. Kennedy is extremely knowledgeable and also hilarious. I enjoyed my time in this course, and felt like I learned a lot. I was always excited to do the readings and go to lecture.",
    "it's ok",
    "Yes i would highly recommend. One of the main reasons i took this class is because Professor Kennedy is widely known and is a very great historian. The class material itself was very intriguing",
    "I'd definitely recommend taking this course if you're interested in military history, but the material is very introductory. The readings are interesting, but a lot of them are not necessary for success in the course.",
    "Yes, it was a great course"
