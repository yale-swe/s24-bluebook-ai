    "DS, without the BS.",
    "This is an amazing course that will take you through time and around the Western world to help you understand the characteristics and importance of Epic and of literature. If you are interested in this course, there is nothing stopping you from taking it. Just make sure to choose a professor who you really want to work with.",
    "Not only would I recommend it, I would say it's a must take. I took it my senior year, and am so happy that I didn't leave Yale without reading these texts.",
    "Yes I recommend it, you read several fantastic books and some that are sub-fantastic but still good.",
    "I would recommend this course. The readings are fascinating, and the papers are fun to write.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. I would never have read The Aeneid, The Inferno, Don Quixote, or Ulysses if it weren't for Epic. It does take considerable time and effort, but it is such a rewarding and enjoyable experience. Very very highly recommend!",
    "Extensive but wonderful syllabus. It will be incredibly rewarding.",
    "Epic was an excellent literature-based course to fulfil the English distro. req. The relatively easy workload consisted primarily of reading and 4-6 essays (best of four picked, with an optional rewrite of one). For the most part, the in-class discussion was very engaging, and Prof. Currell's accent makes it so much better! Definitely a class to take if you're interested in reading several of the major epics of history."
