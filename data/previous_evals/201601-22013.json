    "Gyaarrr. Pirates are pretty cool, you can't deny that. This course does a good job with debunking and confirming some of your favorite pirate myths. The problem is that the material can get a bit repetitive, which is a shame cause there are so many great pirates out there. Some of the famous pirates that you want to learn about aren't covered in depth, which is a bit of a shame, but at the same time gives you a lot of open space to explore in your essay. A good course that is still finding its sea legs.",
    "I will 100% recommend the class to other students. The readings were great and I learned a great deal about piracy in the colonial atlantic world.",
    "An amazing class. Be warned, although the name of the class suggests that it is probably a gut, it is not. There is a lot of reading, although it is very interesting. The final paper at the end is long, but quite manageable if you have been keeping up with the material. Overall, I would definitely recommend this class to anyone, you will learn a ton and have a lot of fun doing it.",
    "Pirates is a basic overview of the pirate in the 17th and 18th centuries. We looked at what it meant to be a pirate, how pirate organizations operated, and how they interacted with non-pirates. I would recommend the course as a good PI history credit, and as a fun class with a decent amount of work. Especially if you're already into pirates, take this class.",
    "I would recommend the course. By no means is this an easy class though. It is a very rigorous history seminar with a lot of reading, and a lot of difficult readings. If you are interested in pirates, by all means go for it. You will learn a lot about why people chose to become pirates, who pirates actually were, their codes, their prosecutors, and dispel many myths about all of these questions. Dubcovsky is a good professor and leads a solid discussion. I enjoyed being in class and for the most part the readings were doable. The course will not blow your mind, but it is overall a good history seminar, especially if you are interested in the topic. And even if you aren't interested in the topic, you will be by the end if you take it on a whim. With that being said, don't think that this is the \"vikings\" of the history seminars. Not a gut.",
    "Great course that will allow you to work on your research paper writing skills and reinforce good habits for such. A lot of reading though.",
    "If you are interested at all in pirates, this is your class"
