   "comments": [
    "Would definitely recommend this. The class is relaxed and not intimidating while still having a strong focus on speaking and listening, which are both so important.",
    "The course was useful in that it focused primarily on vocabulary that would be useful for reading the news. Its weaknesses were that it had no grammar component, the first part of the course (in al-Kitaab III) was completely unrelated to to the rest of it and was grounded in a series of highly difficult translations that virtually no one could do, there was a lot of busywork, and there were no writing assignments with the exception of response questions from the textbook. Prof. Elbousty was very friendly, knowledgeable, and flexible. However, he was difficult to reach by email, deviated from the syllabus, had no office hours posted, and left immediately after class. He also seemed to be difficult to pin down for a recommendation. Overall, I'm glad I took the class to keep up my Arabic, but it was a bit of a disappointment.",
    "The course is mostly reading texts and answering questions. There are weekly vocabulary quizzes and weekly presentations on news articles. The class was a good way to review and work on reading skills. There is not very much focus on grammar and writing. I would recommend it for someone who wants to continue Arabic study. It is not too difficult and you will get out of it what you put in."
