   "comments": [
    "Strengths: ---the course introduced me to several multivariate methods, I now have a better idea of what the methods I encounter in literature are. ---I can implement several methods as well. Weaknesses: --the lectures were not well-prepared at the level of other instructors at Yale. They were often somewhat confusing or less than optimally organized. --the relative balance of lab work and practical experience needs to be re-calibrated. It is less useful to learn how to actually do each method in a statistical program. It would be more useful to understand the inter-relationships between methods, their advantages\/disadvantages. --I felt that we covered too many topics for an advanced course. Spending 2 classes\/topic would have been better. --the feedback on each lab\/our interpretations of the statistical outputs was more limited than it needed to be to make doing the assignments worthwhile. Conclusions: Regardless of the balance of strengths and weaknesses above, please keep this course in the future. We need additional stats courses and this represents progress toward that goal.",
    "Professor mostly lectured without gauging the interest or experience level of the students. Often provided examples using statistical software that students did not have or did not want to use (most people would have preferred using R). Class material was usually over the students head, and we were not following.",
    "As advertised, this course gave a broad overview of multivariate statistical analyses and made students aware of options that they may not have known about before, with minimal work load outside of the class period. For students who expressly wanted this, this setup worked ok. For students who wanted a deeper understanding of how to use these approaches or the details of running these types of analyses, this setup was less satisfying. It was somewhat unclear which of the two approaches Matthias was going for. For example, we started out the semester by spending time in class on exercises in SPSS, whereas class time was less and less devoted to that as time went on (in part because the analyses became too difficult to practice together in class, which is fair). Unfortunately,trying to cut across both approach made it feel like class time was not particularly useful or used efficiently, and it was challenging to stay engaged or learn much. For the next iteration of this course, it would be helpful to clarify if the course is designed to be a broad overview and leave it at that (so less technical examples and just focusing on theory, types of questions it can answer, types of data that can be used, etc) or really delve in to a few approaches and spend more time on that.",
    "Strengths: Introduced statistical analyses and techniques not taught in other courses offered within the psychology department. Weaknesses: It seemed to be geared towards clinical students, who were also taking a Research Methods class. (I was not). It was often unclear exactly what we were supposed to be doing (i.g., individual\/group work or following along with the professor). The lectures were sometimes difficult to follow, and overall it wasn't particularly engaging (though I know that is a challenge that comes along with teaching a stats course!). I *really* think the psychology department would benefit from having an *official* stats curriculum - moving from intro to regression to multivariate stats to multilevel modeling and SEM - with each course clearly building upon the previous course so that the material is accessible to all students."

   "comments": [
    "In the current form, no. However, I understand that this was a first try at the course and hope that it will improve for next year.",
    "No, only offered a broad overview of possible statistical analyses without any context or practical skills in how to implement the analyses.",
    "Opportunities to learn advanced statistical approaches are incredibly valuable for students, and we appreciate the efforts put forth by faculty to meet this need for students. However, I would not recommend this course to students in this current form. Unfortunately, the setup of the course and teaching style led the course to feel inefficient and unhelpful. However, changes could be made to better meet t he needs of students, and something like this course should definitely be offered yearly. One option would be to offer intensive workshops in particular statistical approaches, so students could participate in the ones that are most helpful to them without committing to a full course. Summer would be a great time for this, if possible, and I bet more students would participate because the time commitment is lower and the practical suggestions on how to run these analyses be more helpful than spending hours on Google trying to teach ourselves these approaches. Another option would be to offer day-long overview workshops such as \"Different multivariate modeling approaches\" or \"Approaches for analyzing longitudinal data.\" Comparing and contrasting multiple approaches in the same time period may be more helpful than trying to keep different methods in mind across class periods, and would be a more efficient use of time. I'm not sure how to reframe the course to use the time most efficiently and helpfully for students, but this would also be an option.",
    "This course provided some useful skills that I was able to apply to my research. However, the latter part of the course was particularly difficult to follow and not particularly useful (especially given that we did not have access to AMOS and therefore could not actually apply the skills being taught.)"
