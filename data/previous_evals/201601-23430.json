   "comments": [
    "This course is a course that can be molded into whatever you want it to be. If you are looking for any credit with little work, this course could be it. Attendance, a personal project, and a group project are what constitute the grade and they are fairly easy to accomplish and do well on. I believe that you can do well in the course with very limited effort, but at the same time putting in the effort to do the readings, participate in class, and challenge yourself in thinking of innovative ways to deal with crises as a health worker are extremely rewarding, and I believe a great skill for YSPH graduates looking to become leaders in the international NGO world. The Professor is one of the greatest humans I've ever met. He is friendly, responsive to emails, open to feedback, and makes it obvious that he is invested in his students. If anything, take the course to get to know Dr. Khoshnood.",
    "Strengths: Provides the opportunity to hear from experts in the field. Weakness: Sometimes the conversations do not allow for those with little background to contribute entirely. In addition, the professor and TF are not always informed about the group dynamics. Perhaps having reflections on each assignment that is turned in would be a good way to monitor team dynamics and individual efforts.",
    "Strengths: Dr. Khoshnood is very knowledgeable about this area and brings in experts from the field. The readings were excellent and the course was well structured. Weaknesses: The course would benefit from more practical skills teaching. We learn a lot of general topical knowledge but limited knowledge about how to address these issues. The course on epidemiology in refugee contexts was fantastic as well as the case study and module. It would be excellent to learn more about core interventions for issues related to displacement and health (i.e., how to address\/ensure WASH, nutrition, vaccination).",
    "Interesting course - would rather have assigned mentors for each project from the beginning of the term to actually get the best out of the projects we personally develop.",
    "See below",
    "This course added great variety to my education at YSPH. Super interesting to learn how to apply epi to violent conflicts and even just less structured or challenging settings. There were a lot of disparate pieces to the course that could have been pulled together more.",
    "Strength: the projects -- both individual and group -- could actually be possible, so it was a great opportunity to get some evaluated experience; the guest speakers",
    "Strengths: The project was an amazing opportunity Weaknesses: The group and independent project were a lot together",
    "The course was interesting as a seminar but was sadly did not provide me with any new skills or perspectives. The professor and TA were also very inconsiderate in giving us so much work to do but not being able to stick to their own timelines. While they pushed back deadlines for us, it was still difficult because we had planned our workloads ahead of time.",
    "This was my favorite class this semester. I enjoyed learning about a topic that I really had no framework for before taking the course. Thought the ethical discussions, focus on research methodology, guest speakers, and readings (when I could do them) were really thought-provoking. I thought the approach to teaching allowed discussion and exchange of ideas. I also really enjoyed the assignments. Both the individual proposal and the group research project were really great opportunities to learn more and dive into the material. Really appreciated being stretched to consider how one might address the needs of protracted crises victims via public health. Don't recommend increasing the work-load, however. Especially considering second year students in the thick of their theses.",
    "Course offers flexibility in what a student eventually pursues. I enjoyed the group projects and thought the groups were effectively picked."

    "Instructor: Kaveh Khoshnood \u00a0Provides great feedback and always available for questions\/advice\/etc.",
    "Instructor: Kaveh Khoshnood \u00a0Professor designed the class to give exposure to a wide variety of topics involved in violent conflicts and health. Really a wonderful class. However, the timing of each component of class was bizarre as some student presentations were cut short while others were longer. I understand the limitation behind this in terms of organizing the great speakers and guests who came into class but if the structure was more regimented, I believe that it would be excellent.",
    "Instructor: Kaveh Khoshnood \u00a0Excellent. Poured so much into us as students and into the course. Could tell he had great rapport with guest speakers and was really willing to lend himself to people's questions, interests, and feedback. Would certainly take another course with Dr. Khoshnood.",
    "Instructor: Kaveh Khoshnood \u00a0A wonderful man, with a passion for the subject and put efforts to expand our discussions by sharing news articles and inviting guest speakers."

   "comments": [
    "Wonderful class! Highly recommended for those who either have no background in conflict or are very interested in conflict - caters to all backgrounds!",
    "Good class for students interested in armed conflict and health. Would recommend to both MPH and outside students.",
    "A wonderful course and a much needed addition to the YSPH curriculum",
    "This class has some real strengths -- it's an awesome topic, my classmates were super cool, and the guest speakers were, on the whole, awesome. I looked forward to coming to class every week and having interesting discussions about conflict and health. However, there is a lot of room for improvement -- the course is not at all structured or cohesive. Kaveh relies heavily on students and guest speakers to lead discussion, which gave the class the feeling of a lecture series with minimal connections between the lectures. Though it's listed as an epi class, there were maybe 2 sessions on epi total, and I do not feel like I'm coming out of this class with any new epi knowledge. (I'm not concentrating in epi, so this is a bummer.) The assignments were fairly lackluster. For the group project, in particular, though we were promised that we'd be connected to an agency to work with, that never really happened; and it was frustrating to work on a project throughout the semester that was clearly going nowhere. (Though I will say, Kaveh and Kirsty went out of their way to give everyone a ton of feedback on the assignments, which was great.) Also, 8:30am is a rough start time. Overall would recommend, but know what you're getting in to.",
    "This course is a valuable experience to learn about the use of epi and humanitarian work in diverse settings. You will build understanding and skill through class discussions and by working on actual international projects that are well supported and enhanced by the instructor.",
    "My favorite course of the year at YSPH.",
    "Fantastic class, lots of work, great new insights into health and peace! Thanks for a great semester!",
    "Excellent opportunity to be stretched in a new direction in terms of public health practice. Doesn't necessarily cover some of the root causes of war in much detail due to time constraints. But is great not only for epidemiology of microbial disease students, but really students from any tract at YSPH."
