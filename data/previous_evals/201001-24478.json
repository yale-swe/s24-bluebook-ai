    "YES. TAKE IT. Even if you don't consider yourself a \"writer,\" Anne will prove you wrong.",
    "Learn to write personal essays! Take this class of you get in!! Drop anything else and take it.",
    "This is an unbelievably good class: it puts almost every other class I've taken in three years at Yale to shame. I'm sure the other evaluations you read will say this too, but the bottom line is that if you get in, you must take this class.If you remain agnostic, here are a couple things to consider:1) The group of 12 is almost always amazing. These are some of the most interesting, talented, writers on campus. The virtue of the fact that it's hard to get in is that the people who make it (Anne chooses well) are stellar. And you get to know them really well. It's almost like a mini-version of a senior society.2) Anne thinks very hard about the syllabus. It is a masterwork of care and thought... what I really appreciate is that there's never any ambiguity about what is expected of you... the readings are always clearly delineated, as are your assignments. This sounds basic, but actually, it's so, so helpful.3) The readings Anne chooses are all great. You really want to do the reading every week.4) You just will become a better writer by virtue of being in this class. You have biweekly hour-long conferences with Anne, and the things she says in class are so insightful and useful. It was amazing to see the progress people in the class made over the course of a semester.It's very hard to get in, is the thing. But really, if you do, take it. If you don't, apply again. You won't regret it!",
    "You would be stupid not to.",
    "ABSOLUTELY YES. Best class I have taken at Yale. Just be prepared for lots of work and be ready to learn and enjoy.",
    "\"Writing about Oneself.\" Where to begin. To begin, you should take this class if you have any desire to (1) write, (2) try writing, (3) explore yourself. For if you take this class, your fruits will be multiplied sevenfold in at least two ways: (1) Writing, and I'm not just talking about stylistics. As in, your subject matter will become more mature, your revision process will become extant, your conception of writing will develop and your confidence in yourself as a writer will solidify. (2) About yourself. You will learn about yourself by slicing tiny narratives out of your life and discerning their greater implications.",
    "I recommend this course without reservation. It was, hands down, the richest course experience I've had at Yale: Beyond terrific class sessions and assignments (alternating between essays and critiques of other students' essays), students benefit from incredible visiting writers (Christopher Buckley, Calvin Trillin, George Howe Colt, Elizabeth Wurtzel this term) and more importantly, weekly one-on-one conference with the instructor, Anne Fadiman, one of the greatest writers of non-fiction in America.I realize this is a very hard course to get in to. I was rejected three or so times from Anne's courses prior to this term. But as someone said on the course eval a couple of years ago, apply early and apply often. It's very much worth a shot.",
    "THIS IS THE BEST COURSE I HAVE EVER TAKEN. IN MY LIFE.I do not say that lightly. I cannot offer a stronger recommendation for Writing About Oneself. It is an incredible experience.The class is a substantial amount of work - 1000 word essay every other week. You spend 1 hour every other week in a private conference with Anne, who is not only an extraordinary writer, but a deeply caring person. She is like a mother.You owe it to yourself to apply to this class. It will make both your writing and your life so much better.",
    "As I wrote in my overall assessment, this is arguably the best class I have taken and certainly the most influential. Even if first-person writing isn't your thing (I'm still not convinced that it's mine), this class is worth taking for the sake of Anne's mentoring, the amazing group of people she is likely to assemble for the class, and, last but not least, learning the difference between restrictive and non-restrictive uses of the comma. I found that my academic writing improved immensely under Anne's tutelage. The one-on-one editing sessions with her (another reason to take the class: in no other context, besides a shrink's couch, will you receive such individualized care) were probably the highlight of my weeks throughout the semester. While the workload can get heavy at times (on some weeks, an entire novel plus a thousand word essay), you'll find yourself prioritizing your WaO assignments even if you are taking the class Cr\/D. It really is that engaging.WaO expanded my horizons, both personal and intellectual. If you take it, it'll probably do the same for you."
