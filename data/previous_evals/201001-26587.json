   "comments": [
    "This studio was particularly suited for integration of all the various disciplines that the school has to offer. Since it was taught from three perspectives, Tim, Andy and Patrick we were exposed to differing yet integrated design techniques and ideas. At times it was a bit challenging to be able to juggle the differing perspectives but in the end it lead to much stronger projects that clearly had had levels of influence and depth.",
    "This studio encouraged me to learn overall design skills which are not only architecture design, but also master plan, sustainability, and landscape.",
    "The studio was amazingly organized, resulting in the success of each student's individual design ambitions. Definitely the most well organized and even studio I have ever taken at Yale.Tim Newton was always present for critique and skills tutorials, while honoring Andy Bow and Patrick Bellew's primary role as instructors.No doubt a difficult task coordinating two visiting professors and their own professional schedules, Tim Newton did an outstanding job keeping the momentum and morale of the studio up and consistent. And pushing us to efficiently manage our work flow. No one was running around like crazy in the last 24 hours before midterm or finals -- and I attribute this to the excellent coordination of Tim Newton and Andy Bow.",
    "extremely well coordinated with environmental design",
    "This studio was definitely focused on landscape and planning, however, on a somewhat superficial level. Criticism of our landscape schemes was from the viewpoint that landscape was an amenity to the ecoresort program and not an integrated part of the functioning of a site. I wish that there had been more emphasis on the actual architecture (as well as structures) of our hotel buildings.",
    "It would have been great if the studio trip included a meeting with the local experts such as environmentalists, geologists, structural engineer etc. It was hard to collect the information just by visiting the sites without the help of such collaborators."

   "question_text": "Comment on the most and least valuable aspects of the studio",
   "comments": [
    "This studio clearly had a variety of outside influences including experts, friends, colleagues that interacted with us on a variety of levels, desk-crits, pin-ups, video conferences, etc etc. It seemed daunting at times how many people seemed involved but in the end the projects succeeded along all fronts. The technical support we had was inspirational to say the least and the outside crits were motivational on all fronts. The involvement of so many influences made the students work that much harder and the quality of the projects represented this.",
    "The most valuable aspect was the presentation skill since this studio was very organized toward mid and final presentation including aspects of schedule and presentation space.",
    "The most valuable components of the course were certainly the desk-crits and small pin-ups. I greatly aprpeciated the tendency towards smaller group\/individual conversations and critiques.",
    "pin ups within studio time were never very helpful. Desk crits and group conversations were the most helpful.",
    "most valuable: access to three great instructorsout of all my studio courses, this has been my most valuable experience.",
    "Definitely desk crits and outside experts, especially Narinder. I wish that we had more experts from Atelier Ten to help better integrate the 'sustainable' aspects of the studio."

   "comments": [
    "The studio at times felt a bit too 'first year' oriented, namely that there was an increased level of shear production, at times to no particular end. When presenting to new critics\/ outside help on a weekly basis can be a bit restrictive\/ disorganizing to the students. It seemed on us to organize their efforts when at times we just needed the time to organize ourselves.",
    "Because the studio was organized as I wrote forlast question, students could concentrated on our own works entire semester. That was the main strength.",
    "This studio was very clearly conceived and realized. The agenda was set forth directly from the start and our professors held true to those initial inspirations and desires. All in all it was one of the most coherant and well-taught studios that I have been involved in. Personal agenda were left at the door, as much as they ever can be, and each person was pushed to explore their design for what they saw\/wished it to be. In my opinion, an incredibly successful studio in terms of the pedagogy of teaching at Yale.",
    "This was profoundly the most professional studio I have taken at Yale. As a pedagogy, it will greatly benefit all students in their professional careers as architects as the studio not only taught design, but also presentation work flow, and model making skills.",
    "The opportunity to experience a \"corporate style\" presentation was great. The intensity and the way everything was presented gave agood lesson on the importance of the format of the presentation."

   "comments": [
    "I was looking forward to challenging sustainability as a concept and the studio delivered on all fronts. I was able to approach a project that very much differed from my peers and was constantly supported (somewhat unheard of in this environment) Confidence was built from the support and critiques of all the critics. I was very pleased with how the studio ended up, resulting in a project that was uniquely my own.",
    "In the unique site, Marrakesh, to design including various aspects such as locality and sustainability was my expectation. Since I was able to concentrate on dealing with site-specific architecture design, my expectation was met very well.",
    "My expectations were profoundly exceeded. Due to the three instructors -- their professionalism, seasoned experienced, great investment in teaching and mentoring, and incredibly singular but complimentary skill sets -- this was the best studio I have ever taken at Yale.",
    "I thought this studio was very valuable, but I found that the stance taken on sustainability was somewhat superficial. While we were encouraged to incorporate all of the 'features' that are currently considered 'sustainable'-- solar farms, wind turbines, aquaponics, water recycling, sustainable agriculture, etc. etc. I felt like there was no actual integration or discussion of what 'sustainability' actually means. Furthermore, I felt like the way we were taught to look at sustainability was purely from an engineering viewpoint, which misses 90% of what creating a sustainable system actually entails (what about social sustainability? economic sustainability? ecological sustainability?) Furthermore, a \"sustainable studio\" needs to teach students how to deal with the tradeoffs of creating sustainable systems-- water consumption vs. renewable energy generation, drinking water vs. water used for irrigation, etc. etc. etc."

   "comments": [
    "Patrick and Andy we great. Despite their limited physical influence (no less than any other critic: Ghery, etc) they were constantly involved though emails, video conferences, and any other means that were possible. They sacrificed time and money for the studio as well as provided us with an abundance of support\/ influence form their colleagues. They seemed to genuinely care about the success of the projects and did everything in their power to push them all in a positive direction. Tim too was a great asset, knowing when to help and especially when not to, allowing himself to be utilized on a need basis that allowed the students the time and space to work when they needed it as well as organize the numerous guests from abroad that helped guide the studio.",
    "I appreciate that they took so much energy and time for us to support. Their ambition always created great atmosphere.",
    "Patrick Bellew and Any Bow- Both professors are incredibly intelligent and incredibly knowledgable in their respective fields. As an architect and an engineer, they played off each other very well, encouraging us to examine what they saw as the strengths in our projects without undermining either the architecture or sustainability agenda of the studio. The level of engagement and dedication to the studio was amazing and is evidenced in the energy and effort that went into all 10 schemes. I feel lucky to have been taught by these two professors and I hope they continue to teach together- Yale is lucky to have them.Similarly, Tim Newton was a wonderful assistant teacher. His insights into the working process were critical to our success and his ability to synthesize what was conveyed during desk crits\/pin-ups is unparalled.In my opinion, this studio is an example of what studios at Yale should strive to be.",
    "All three were amazing instructors -- and with their own highly specific but complementary skill sets.The main strength overall, was a willingness to teach students through hand drawing and model making. This allowed students to have their own hand while iterating their design intent.I strongly recommend this teaching trio again for other studios. I really felt that it was the most successful learning experience here at Yale.All students were treated like they had potential. Unlike all other studios, I did not feel like their was a quick summing up of student's capabilities within the first 2 days, never to change this hierarchy of assumptions. Through this equitable pedagogy, I grew the most and finally felt like I got my money's worth through the education.Specifically, I want to praise Timothy Newton as a assistant teacher and his availability to help students learn and become more proficient. It was clear he was well respected and appreciated by the two main instructors.",
    "Both Patrick and Andy were very passionate and energetic. The ambient created by them was very helpful for the students to be excited about their projects."
