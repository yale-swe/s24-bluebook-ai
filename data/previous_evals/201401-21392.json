    "If you are doing the senior essay in linguistics, you ought to take this course, of course. Seniors of generations past have walked this road. You will survive. Tip: work a little bit each week, and support your fellow seniors... Raffaella has been a great instructor for this course - encouraging and accommodating, and she gives helpful feedback. A lot of help actually came from classmates - your feedback to each other is useful, even if you're all doing different topics."
