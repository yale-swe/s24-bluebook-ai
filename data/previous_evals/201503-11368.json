    "I would definitely recommend Historical and Political Thought to another student, especially one who is interested in political science. In H&P you really get to see how the way that we view history and how certain ideas that we hold are based in an incredibly extensive cultural tradition, you also get to examine how these views and ideas have changed over time.",
    "An exploration of the progression of Western thought on the topics of politics, government and how to preserve and implement the lessons of history. I would recommend this course because I thought the class did a good job of fulfilling this previously stated purpose and improved my abilities to interpret texts and argue both orally and in writing.",
    "Absolutely. Do it, Professor Thompson will blow your mind and you will discover history and its authors in new light. These were my favorite readings of the term. They are long, but fascinating.",
    "H&P is the most difficult DS section because it isn't as straightforward a subject as Lit or Phil. Still, the texts are definitely worth the read. Lectures will be hit or miss, but when they're hits, they'll remind you of why DS is such a great program. Prof Thompson was also a great section leader and is really knowledgeable about the material. Not a huge fan of the whole \"starter\" thing though.",
    "I wouldn't say that this is a class everyone should take.",
    "A survey in political thought from Ancient Greece until the Middle Ages, this course will change the way you view history and make you think about large-scale political and societal issues in new ways.",
    "I would highly recommend this course because it helps illuminate so much of Western culture.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course: these are some of the great texts, and seeing them together teaches not just history, but a history of histories and historical thought.",
    "I would recommend it to anyone. The content of the course is very useful for the education of a person, and it greatly improved my writing skills."
