    "A class where you will study literature from the ancient near east and look at the ways it affected other areas and works of literature. TAKE IT, even if you think you are not interested in the material. Professor Slanski (and your fellow students) will make the class incredibly worthwhile.",
    "This is an excellent class. As someone in the Humanities major but much more focused on modernity, I was afraid it might be too esoteric, but the lessons I learned about civilization and its effect on human life were invaluable. Professor Slanski is great so long as you're willing to work fairly hard."
