    "Professor Butler is an excellent teacher and really makes an effort to know his students. Too bad he's leaving Yale - I think many Yalies would have loved this class.",
    "Not entirely sure how because I've never taken political science before, so I don't have a comparative reference",
    "PLSC 207 01 was a course that looked at US political institutions. This is a political science course that heavily relies on regressions and qualitative data experiments. Do not take this course unless you want to analyze politics in this way. This is not a political history course. It is specifically about research designs. I repeat, the course is primarily focused on research designs."
