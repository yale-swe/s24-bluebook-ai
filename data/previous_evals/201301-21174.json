    "I would summarize History 988 as a class that examines different aspects of war--for example guilt, memory, etc.--across geographical borders and eras in history. I would definitely recommend the class to other students. I think it is valuable to have historical discussions with historians whom you would normally not have class with.",
    "Exploration of different themes in warfare, with an emphasis on WWI.",
    "History 988 is recommended for students interested in the social history of war, particularly in modern period and in the US and Europe. Students who work on earlier periods or different geographic regions may want to audit the class, rather than take it for credit.",
    "I would recommend this class. It covers the history of war from prehistoric times to the present, which may seem broad but in fact gave a good base for the discussion, especially since the students study a wide range of historic periods and regions. I feel that I really benefited from it. The readings were interesting and useful for me."

   "comments": [
    "This course deepened my knowledge of the profession in many ways. I think most importantly it allowed me to explore war in a continuous, rather than finite manner. It allowed me to see history as a totality, rather than as a specialty. Furthermore, I simply learned very much by studying new eras of history.",
    "It greatly improved my insight into areas of history I haven't studied before. Studying war was useful to me because it plays a role in all areas of history",
    "This course exposed me to fantastic books in the genre. I have a better grip on the material now.",
    "The course broadened my knowledge of the history of war, which was useful for my research. Professor Cabanes allowed us to write papers that fit into our research (of course provided that they were connected to the topic of the course), which was helpful for my own research. I feel that I gained much from his class. He is a great professor."
