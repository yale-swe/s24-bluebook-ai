    "I learned about the relationship between art and intellectual development. I learned to look beyond the surface of buildings or cultural changes to explore the implicit assumptions embedded in them and the possibilities for lessons that they might teach. I learned new vocabulary for examining and analyzing art and architecture.",
    "My partaking in this class most improved my knowledge in the area of a very nuanced art history period in terms of raw knowledge; however, in terms of most meaningful engagement, it gave me a space where there could be a conversation concerning the sacred, the Christian ethos, and the philosophy of art through the original discussion of an art period. This is an area I'm highly involved in, and the questions introduced by Harries turned what are commonly \"deep\" topics into areas of renewed interest.",
    "Awesome course with a great deal of information that I appreciated learning.",
    "A richer understanding of the Rococo period of art, a period of art that I had previously discounted. I gained a great number of ideas and concepts that will help guide my research for years to come."
