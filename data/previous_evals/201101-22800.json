    "Arabic 151 is the continuation of L5 Arabic. It is generally a really small class but it is actually really good for practicing conversations.",
    "No.Just no.I put up with Arabic for three years, hoping that it would improve. But there was no emphasis on Arabic writing style (though we were graded on it) and there was half of one class about grammar. I've forgotten 3\/4 of the grammar and vocab I knew at the end of L4. Don't do Modern Standard Arabic at Yale until something changes.",
    "No, I would not recommend taking ARBC 151 unless there is a major overhaul. Not a productive use of time. You're better off making your own curriculum and working independently, unless you are really unmotivated to work on your own.",
    "If you want to learn Arabic, take it, however the work-load is certainly not for the faint of heart.",
    "I don't even know what to say. I've taken L1-L5 Arabic at Yale. I've seen countless people drop theclass. The inane vocabulary lists and bizarre, borderline incomprehensible listening exercises have been a constant fixture of my Yale experience. If you've gotten this far, I imagine you probably already have well-entrenched opinions on the Arabic department at Yale, and I'd say, go with your gut in deciding whether or not to take this class. It will probably be exactly what you think it will be.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student interested specifically in improving their modern standard arabic skills."
