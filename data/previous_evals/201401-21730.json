   "comments": [
    "I would recommend it! Great intro art class!",
    "Take it! You'll be surprised by just how much you've learned and grown by the end of the class.",
    "The experience completely relies on the professor, which is why shopping period can get very competitive. I was absolutely blessed to get into Sam Messer's class with Aaron as the TA. The two anomalies of Yale Art - laid back, creative minds who are open to EVERYTHING. The \"midterm\" and \"finals\" were up to interpretation, and it was amazing how diverse the work was. I did wish there was a little more formal instruction (not just frontloaded, but also towards the end as I improved as an artist). I was glad he didn't believe in assigning homework for the sake of giving us more work to do. It was nice to not feel \"forced\" to make.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course! One of the best courses I've taken at Yale, and a really nice change of pace from writing essays, taking tests, etc. I learned a lot, created work I'm proud of, and was fortunate enough to take the class with Sam Messer and our TA Aaron, both of whom are awesome. The work we did was both fun and rewarding. Couldn't have asked for more in a drawing class!",
    "Take it, and take it with Sam. Homework was very manageable (and frequently non-existent), Sam is pretty easy-going, and the classtime is just plain fun. I have never taken a drawing class before so I was a little bit intimidated by all the 'prospective art major' types in the class, but I think it was okay.",
    "You will not learn how to draw a dog or a simple method for drawing a face. The pint of this class is to teach you how to put your ideas on paper, and how to communicate a 3d world on a 2d plane. I would recommend it, but take it seriously. Sam does not gone much work outside of class, so take it seriously when he does and take class seriously.",
    "Intense, but an incredible escape.",
    "The class takes wherever you are in art ability and extends it through looking at how you draw and the decisions that you make regarding drawing.",
    "Amazing. Whether you're a beginner and you just want to learn how to draw or if you consider yourself advanced, this course has something for you. Sam is a phenomenal teacher and has so much knowledge that he is willing to give. This course will undoubtedly make you a better artist if not a better person.",
    "If you're interested in a loosely structured, but tons of fun art class, definitely consider basic drawing with Sam Messer. You won't refine your technical skills, but it's an opportunity to have fun and push boundaries and relax with charcoal and sometimes a paintbrush 4ish hours every week. If you have a lot of art experience going over perspective again, or shading again, can be frustrating, but practice makes perfect, as they sometimes say, and as the semester progresses assignments get looser and you get more opportunity to make art that is interesting to you.",
    "Even if you have had little experience with art, do consider taking this course, especially the section taught by Professor Samuel Messer. We had students with varying levels of artistic experience in our class, and he was great at making everyone feel comfortable to learn at their own pace. The name of the class \"Basic Drawing\" really seems like an oversimplification of what we learnt in class. Yes, we did learn about the formal elements of drawing, like line, shape and space, but the class did a lot to inspire dialogues (through both words and art) about things that were important to us beyond the classroom.",
    "I would recommend the class to someone who either already has the skills that should be taught in a basic drawing class or is interested in a more theoretical compositional and art historical approach. Art history majors will find that Sam helps them see and assess art in a different way. If you're looking for a class that will teach you the basics, maybe a different class will be more to your liking."
