   "comments": [
    "I would recommend SPAN 523 to another student because it is useful for understanding some of the principal Golden Age comedias and the historical and intellectual contexts which informed their composition.",
    "Great course. The Comedia is an excellent topic, and it is a privilege to study works by the major Spanish playwrights, such is Lope de Vega, Caldern, and Tirso de Molina. Professor Byrne does a great job presenting these works and encouraging students to think critically about them."

    "This course has enabled me to understand the structure and theory of Golden Age theater, whose individual works\/authors and\/or principles are frequently referenced in other literary works of the era. My knowledge of the intellectual context of the Golden Age has greatly increased and will enable me to make connections with other works and eras.",
    "In addition to including many of the works on the exam reading list, this course deepened my knowledge of Early Modern Spanish literature as well as the history of the 16th and 17th centuries of Spain. I expect this course to have a direct effect on my dissertation\/research."
