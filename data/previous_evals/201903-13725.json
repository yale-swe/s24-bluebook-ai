    "The course has enabled me to have a more holistic perspective of ecologic systems. An understanding of the importance of them.",
    "This course provides an appropriate background in a variety of ecology and conservation topics for students interested in pursuing these topics in the context of tropical forests. I became more familiar with the relevant literature of this subject, and developed a stronger sense of the methodologies and contemporary issues in the field.",
    "How to analyze tropical restoration literature with a more aware eye.",
    "I gained basic and novice ecological knowledge, thought critically about how to conduct field research, and wrote a term paper in a nuanced way that allowed for more critical thinking and exploration.",
    "Learned about tropical forests",
    "Excellent introduction to ecology in general and tropical ecology in particular",
    "Presentation, writing, reading and synthesizing scientific papers.",
    "Overview of ecological principles and debates, specifically related to tropical forests. Good integration of recent\/new literature.",
    "A general understanding of tropical forest ecology, dynamics and challenges of tropical forest conservation, climate change and tropical forests. I now have a better understanding of tropical forest dynamics, which I will be using to guide my career.",
    "This course was very engaging, talking about of the ecological principles surrounding tropical forests and how they relate to current threats. These included direct threats of logging, deforestation, and hunting, as well as indirect threats such as climate change."

   "comments": [
    "Exceeded my expectations",
    "I may have expected a slightly stronger baseline level of ecology knowledge or background in this course. I felt very satisfied with the choice of content covered in this course and enjoyed the literature we read as well. In addition, the final project enabled us to develop a strong familiarity with subjects of our choice. However, I felt that there were certain subjects on which we only scratched the surface, and occasionally wished for more depth and deeper engagement with the material. It seemed that a select few students without an ecology background reacted with resentment to technical vocabulary and peer-reviewed articles, dismissing relevant and important vocabulary as jargon and demanding that we dwell on relatively straightforward elements of the material. I think I speak for many of my classmates when I say that this stifled my enjoyment of the course content. While I appreciate the importance of a diversity of academic interests and backgrounds that extends beyond a classical scientific training, I feel that this course would strongly benefit from an ecology prerequisite that would have enabled us to cover the material in a more sophisticated manner.",
    "Very well! I'm very happy with what I learned in this course.",
    "This class matched\/exceeded my expectations. The high engagement with the material reiterated concepts and made it easy to retain information. Each posed theoretical concept was backed by empirical studies and experience from the professor.",
    "Better than expected",
    "About equal",
    "Very well.",
    "The material of the class met my expectations but the teaching quality far exceeded my expectations.",
    "The class very strongly matched my expectations if not exceeded them. The discussion of various case studies also increased the insight to specific topics such as carbon impacts on tropical forest structure and the extent to which palm oil threatens tropical forests."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of the course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: various tools were used to educate: textbook, journals, weekly assignments, videos, presentations. In the end it lead to more learning.",
    "Liza is a wonderful, brilliant instructor who did an excellent job of conveying the current ecological and conservation issues regarding tropical forests. This course was consistently enjoyable, and not at all stressful -- the mandatory article responses ensured that we kept up with the material in a refreshingly straightforward way, and I found the exams and projects to be quite reasonable. This course seems to largely lay the groundwork for the second semester of tropical field ecology -- while I'm not sure that I engaged with the material in as deep a manner as I'd have hoped, I feel as though I have a strong background to enable me to conduct my own research project in Panama next semester. My primary criticism is that the lack of mandatory ecology prerequisites sometimes forced us to rehash basic ecology principles; a couple students dominated the proceedings, and their resistance to learning advanced ecology topics made the material feel rather surface-level at times.",
    "Strengths: High level of engagement with material, real-world examples of theoretical concepts via empirical studies and professor and TA field experiences, guest lecturers, a book reiterating concepts discussed in class, student presentations.",
    "Strengths - weekly assignments ensured students read regularly, well structured course, a good mix of easier and more difficult readings Weaknesses - There was some confusion with the timetable, which is a minor issue",
    "The group discussions about research papers aren't very informative because some people don't do the readings and it ends up being one person explaining the papers to the others in the groups.",
    "S: good structure of class, great lectures, good materials. Prof Comita is very knowledgeable but still approachable. W: some of the in-class group work could have been shortened. Perhaps split time between half lecture and half discussion.",
    "Strengths: - Combination of lecture, readings (scientific articles), and debates were useful in ensuring we took ownership of our learning and pushed us to engage with the material in a variety of ways (that simulate real life Weaknesses: n\/a",
    "The course was a combination of lectures and discussions which I believe is the most effective way to learn, especially since discussions were divided into smaller groups as well as whole class. This enabled students to solidify their understanding of the material and learn from each others' experiences. The evaluation through exams and individual projects was incredibly fair and did not rely on obscure facts to trip students up.",
    "The course was well organized. I really like the mixed form of lecture and paper reading."

   "comments": [
    "Be ready to learn !",
    "I would definitely recommend taking this class if you have interest in conducting a followup project in Panama. I very much enjoyed this course, despite sometimes hoping for slightly more rigor; I feel that the background should serve me well, both next semester and hopefully in future research experiences. The course is not challenging, nor is it stressful, but if you engage at a slightly deeper level than is mandated, you should get a lot out of this course. Liza and Thomas are both fantastic!",
    "I would recommend this course to students. I would inform them that the information is fairly basic depending on their background, but the material is useful and may be widely applied to their future research and career.",
    "It is helpful to have at least a basic biology or ecology background before taking this class.",
    "One of the best classes I took in my first semester. Liza is an excellent instructor and professor, who understands and can communicate not just the scientific information, but the real-world implications of tropical forest ecology. I would highly recommend this class to anyone interested in the tropics.",
    "Invest time into reading the details of the articles assigned as they offer interesting insight to how studies are carried out.",
    "The course will be less helpful if you have taken ecology or advanced and applied ecology before. But it is helpful if you want to work in the tropical region in the future. I really like how Liza used a lot of examples from journal articles to convey ideas and how she assigned the article questions as regular assignments."
