   "comments": [
    "The course is a 'must-take' for anyone studying political economy and institutions. I highly recommend it.",
    "Yes, but only if they had a good foundation in game theory\/formal modeling.",
    "It is a very difficult class and students should be aware that it is an immense time commitment. However, if you're interested in doing formal theory, there is no better course.",
    "I would recommend this class to students who are more fluid in mathematical modeling and game theory. The class would be quite challenging for people not coming from this background as it is one of the core features of the course.",
    "Do NOT take it if you are not very good in game theory. Definitely not for the uninitiated.",
    "Econ 792 is a very interesting course on the political economy of institutional development. It's a great mix of rational choice\/game theory and political economy.",
    "Acemoglu-style political economy",
    "Only if they are into game theory",
    "Yes, definitely a must-do for any student who intends to work on modeling political economy.",
    "I strongly recommend this class! This class goes through various kinds of models so that you can learn how to build a model by yourself. On top of that, the topics covered by the class are very interesting substantively! It is one of the best classes I've taken here."

    "The course offered great context to the topics I am studying and the introduction to the field's major scholars, theories and arguments in was extremeley helpful.",
    "Helped me develop at least one potentially decent research idea and exposed me to broader uses of game theory such that I might want to use it in my research going forward. Doing the topic reviews was great, and ex post, I'm glad we had the problem sets, since it helped a lot in learning theconcepts.",
