   "comments": [
    "I learned the very basics of how to solve problems in linear algebra. There weren't any skills or insights that I found necessarily useful. I also don't think that the course helped me to learn any skill that could be used later in life.",
    "The course description is accurate: I picked up a good foundation in linear algebra, including: Matrix representation of linear equations. Gauss elimination. Vector spaces. Linear independence, basis, and dimension. Orthogonality, projection, least squares approximation; orthogonalization and orthogonal bases. Extension to function spaces. Determinants. Eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Diagonalization. Difference equations and matrix differential equations. Symmetric and Hermitian matrices. Orthogonal and unitary transformations; similarity transformations.",
    "I learned about matrices and linear algebra, and then at the end got to see a few applications of linear algebra.",
    "Math 222 was great! I think the scope of the course is focused on providing a solid foundation of techniques in linear algebra and it accomplished that task beautifully.",
    "I feel like I know the fundamentals of linear algebra and I know how to look at matrices.",
    "Very good introduction to linear algebra. Disappointing that we did not cover the whole book.",
    "Linear Algebra & applications to it.",
    "Linear algebra. It was very practical. The applications were scattered here and there, though they were not the focus of the course.",
    "I learned a lot of fundamental math concepts that engineers need. This class will make anyone comfortable in dealing with matrices and their applications. Many of these ideas learned in this class form the basis of computer coding with systems such as Matlab.",
    "I learned so much about linear algebra. Before this course I thought matrices were scary, and now I realize they are so convenient and make math so much easier!! Who would have known?",
    "Skills of linear algebra to break down matrices that has applications to a lot of areas in science.",
    "I learned most of the important introductory concepts in Linear algebra.",
    "I now have a background in linear algebra which is just what I set out to get. There's nothing too exciting about this class because you only really get to applications in the last week if you get to them at all.",
    "This course was a great introduction to Linear, professor Magee was a very cabapble and clear instructor, he did a great job of conveying the material in a way that made it understandable. This course was a great opportunity to learn to think quantitatively and analytically",
    "None. This course did not impart any knowledge, skills, or insights on me and I taught myself the curriculum of the course.",
    "Basic understanding of Linear Algebra. Materials are very very dry, and the class only becomes mildly exciting when he talks about some cool application in Google's Page Rank, mp3 compression or navigation. Yet, with the very superficial understanding of linear algebra, you would not fully comprehend this application anyway.",
    "I learned about what linear algebra can be used for in the real world. I was particularly fascinated by fourier transforms.",
    "Linear algebra teaches and requires the ability to quickly integrate new terms and concepts in problem solving. This course also definitely encourages clever thinking to break down complicated new questions and find new and better ways of solving familiar ones. There is also something to be said for the unique sort of thinking that the subject requires as it is entirely based on presenting information in new and useful ways.",
    "I learned what the aim of linear algebra was, the nature of matrices, and how to manipulate them with various algorithms.",
    "How to solve linear algebra problems",
    "Basic linear algebra course. Nothing more, nothing less.",
    "Good survey of linear, hard to follow at times even when going to all the lectures, hard to see applications, but still solid class.",
    "I learned how to do a wide variety of calculations but did not necessarily understand what their significance was.",
    "I learned introductory linear algebra and its applications. In comparing the contents of the course with my friends at other schools I realized that we were quite thorough, and learned far more applications than other schools. By the end, I felt I had learned quite a lot.",
    "This class teaches students about many real world applications for linear algebra. It also teaches the basics about manipulating matrices.",
    "I think that overall, this course made me more in tune with the function and application of matrices within the context of linear algebra, which could lead to a greater understanding in broader contexts. The concepts learned in this course seem to be very bland, although the applications are very interesting; these include search algorithms, image compression, and Fourier transformsall of which are very important in engineering contexts. Other than that, the processes of this class come of as very mechanical.",
    "I learned how to carry out most of the calculations necessary for linear algebra applications. I also learned decent skills regarding vector spaces.",
    "Great linear algebra course. Learned fundamentals of a very cool mathematics subject. Applications were interesting to all the engineers in the room. Most of us were engineers.",
    "I learned a lot about linear algebra and developed a way better understanding of linear algebra and the concepts taught in this class.",
    "Besides linear algebra (which as advertised by the course title, I did in fact learn), this course helped me be more logical in problem solving. When faced with an unknown, I learned to systematically brainstorm what properties I knew to be true and what other truths could be deduced, to narrow down facts that are relevant to the problem, and to test conclusions by searching for counterexamples. This course also inspired in me an amazement and curiosity about the many useful applications of linear algebra from PageRank, to image compression, and Fourier Transforms.",
    "I learned how to work with matrices and use them in order to solve complex systems of linear equations."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This class definitely needs a better textbook. Strang's book fails to provide good examples, and it's difficult to follow. Also, the lectures for this course were pretty useless. I ended up watching lectures from MIT online in order to learn the material. The lectures had no clear purpose or outline. The course is called Linear Algebra and its Applications, but we didn't do a single application in our homework. The biggest weakness was the professor. Magee is not a bad person, but he should not be a professor at this university.",
    "I really liked how the course followed the textbook to the letter. This made it easy to follow along and to read back if I had to miss class or did not understand something. One big problem was the sparseness of exams. I felt like there were not enough opportunities to check my understanding of the material, or to make up for simple mistakes on the 1 midterm.",
    "This course was not at all well organized to facilitate student learning. I felt that I was constantly trying to teach myself, and every time I did, we moved on to a new topic; I was constantly playing catch-up because it was impossible to learn anything in class, and the textbook was not exactly written to be used on its own. There was a huge gap between what students understand and what the professor thought we understood. Besides this, the course did not at all foster interest in linear algebra. You would assume that we'd learn applications of linear algebra in this course, but mostly it was teaching us how to memorize procedures without really allowing us to understand the significance of them. As for the applications - we did touch on a few during the last few weeks, but by then, I was so lost that I could not follow anything. Maybe it's just me...",
    "One strength of the course was the pace, how the lectures matched up with the homework (especially when the professor shifted the problem sets back a little so we had more time after the material was covered in class). Another strength was the peer tutor and the professor's willingness to hear feedback and help struggling students. The midterm was very fair and it was great that we could earn points back . The in-class review was also super awesome, and when the professor asked for feedback towards the beginning of class that was amazing and the changes he made after that were awesome. One weakness might be that the end of the class got confusing and rushed.",
    "Maybe the only weakness of the class is the number of students taking it who clearly have taken linear algebra before. There's nothing really to be done about it, but it is discouraging when on day one you're trying to wrap your head around what a matrix is and somebody else is talking about FFT.",
    "I think this a good, solid course. The only thing is that I don't think Professor Magee doesn't know about Slader, which is a website that has the answers to almost every problem in almost every math textbook. He said he intentionally chose homework problems whose answers weren't in the back of the book, which makes me think that he didn't know that literally everybody was using it. (Here's the link: http:\/\/www.slader.com\/textbook\/9780980232714-introduction-to-linear-algebra-4th-edition\/) I think that the ideal homework setup for a class like this is to have more limited conceptual homework assignments that the professor writes themselves, and then grades with an option to correct for partial credit. You also have to change up the numbers every year on psets and exams (for the future) because athletics, fraternities, and sororities keep exam\/pset answers. Just thinking about a way to have homework reflect real understanding and not access to answers.",
    "Strengths: did not have proofs, usually Weaknesses: when there were proofs in the course",
    "I think the responsibility falls more on the student to really understand the material.",
    "I thought Jedidiah Thompson was one of the best TAs I've ever had. Resources such as Jed and meeting with Professor Magee were the highlights of this class. The weakness of this class were sometimes weak explanations of complex and abstract ideas in linear algebra in some lectures.",
    "Very fair exams.",
    "The teaching was great. I learned so much in lecture. The problem sets were fair and taught you all that you would need for exams. They were also not too long. The exams were fair and you were never tested on something you hadn't learned. The practice finals gave you a very solid idea of what you should know, so you were never surprised on the final.",
    "This is an interesting course but difficult to change as it is a basic introduction to the material. I really enjoyed getting to see applications of the math in the class.",
    "This course was quite well structured and the professor taught it somewhat clearly, though some topics require a better explanation, particularly the fundamental concepts. Moreover the midterm exam was on the last day of the midterm, so students could not receive their scores before the drop deadline. This was a structural flaw in the course.",
    "I would have loved longer or more exams. By the end of the class I think 75% of my grade was based on 8 calculation questions and 8 T\/F questions.",
    "This course was the WORST class I have taken at Yale, not because Linear Algebra on its own is bad but because the professor was completely inept. There were no strengths. The class was poorly organized, the textbook was confusing, half the class failed the midterm, and the substitute TA showed up 15 minutes late to the final because the professor was traveling. I had to buy a separate textbook and watch all of the MIT OpenCourseware videos on Linear Algebra in order to teach myself the material, something which Professor Magee completely failed to do. The class could be improved by getting a teacher who has the ability to teach and knows Linear Algebra well enough to communicate it to the students.",
    "Maybe something could be done to make it more exciting, but I doubt that is the case. Unless you have a genuine appreciation for mathematics, you will never feel engaged with the sort of conceptual and computational problems in 222. But then, if you love math as much, maybe you should have taken 225.",
    "The office hour sessions and peer tutor were quite helpful. Review psets were helpful as well. One thing that might additionally help is a class forum online where we could post and see other students questions as well as the professors answers.",
    "Strengths: The topics are fairly graspable, and the assignments were not too demanding. Weaknesses: there was a lack of fluidity in how the topics were taught. After studying with other students, and speaking with Jed a lot, I was able to get a mental picture of the subject in general, but that was not something that was done in lecture.",
    "This course is well structured to work up to complicated ideas, and I felt that the professor did a good job in class of clarifying difficult concepts. I appreciate that the exams were close in material tested to the practice exams, as this made the class feel very fair. I did not find the textbook particularly useful or especially good at clarifying my questions, and I tended to prefer the professors explanations over the books when the two differed.",
    "I believe this is a good course, but I feel like we did our first application of linear algebra a bit late in the course. I know we had to learn the fundamentals first, but if there were some way to even just introduce some applications in a more nuanced manner towards the start of the semester, it would entice a lot more people.",
    "I'm grateful that the course material followed Gilbert Strang almost exactly. The instructor did a good job of making sure the expectations were very clear- thank you!",
    "Not enough applications, taught by a pure theoretical mathematician, which is good, but I don't learn best with abstractions.",
    "more worked out problems instead of theory",
    "The professor was not helpful in the slightest and poor at explaining the material.",
    "The strength of the course is that it is straightforward: what we learned in class, from the homeworks, and from the practice exams was what was tested. Professor Magee was not out to trick us, and obviously cared about us doing well as well as understanding the subject matter. A weakness would just be that sometimes the lectures felt disorganized, and I would occasionally feel aimless.",
    "I really enjoyed the clicker questions on friday because they gave me a better understanding of the conceptual questions. I only wish we could have done more of them",
    "I think that this course has a subpar textbook. This really makes the rest of the course much more difficult. Prof. Magee clearly tried his best to teach us the material, but the material was not well presented in the text. I think that a better textbook would make the rest of the course much better.",
    "Strengths: good intro to Linear Algebra. Not sure if there are any weaknesses. It was well organized, and both psets and exams were straightforward and fair. The TA was maybe the one weakness - he had no idea how\/what we learned in lecture, and thus wasn't very helpful in review sessions, etc.",
    "The course did a great job of integrating the applications of Page Rank, Image Compression and Signal Processing. However, in an applications focused class you do not really find the reason for why a lot of concepts happen. You are given a fact and are expected to believe it. I think that more intuition could have been given for the why part.",
    "I enjoyed the subject of linear algebra, but we weren't tested on any applications. Also, I think Yale needs to step up and hire one really strong lecturer to teach Linear Algebra instead of constantly rotating through different professors. We had one lecture given by the 225 Professor that was infinitely better. However, Professor Magee did try to improve the course at the end. Overall though, I would say definitely take the class! Linear algebra is super useful.",
    "This class is pretty well structured.",
    "Especially considering how tricky it is to teach a large entry level math course (where you have students with a wide range of math backgrounds, many are probably motivated mostly by the fact that it's required for their major, and the class typically has a reputation for being easy and mechanical), I think this course was extremely well taught. The lectures were very organized and engaging - a good mix of derivations\/abstract concepts and \"this is how you solve the problem\". The real-world examples were very interesting and directly relevant to what we were learning. I thought the course was well-paced and gave people the flexibility of deciding how in-depth they wanted to go and how much effort to put in. The exams were very fair (just the right amount of challenge) and with the practice exams, I felt well-prepared. I can't really think of any weaknesses of the course...I'm sure something can be improved, but nothing comes to mind at the moment...",
    "This was my favorite math class so far at Yale! The class was really well organized, the midterm and final were very reasonable, the workload was predictable and consistent throughout the term, and we covered a lot of applications that were not covered in the book but were really interesting!",
    "The material was straight forward but I felt like at times we lacked practice, and one problem set a week was not sufficient to really hone our skills. Maybe the professor should have gone over more applications in class. Finally, the course is supposed to be \"Linear Algebra and Applications\", but the applications we covered were not very well conducted nor covered in depth. In the end it is hard to assess how much I got out of this course."

    "Do not take this course with Professor Magee. He is not a mean person, but he should simply not be teaching at Yale. His lectures were confusing and messy, and sometimes students in the class had to explain things to the class because he couldn't. The workload is not bad or difficult, but I ended up watching MIT videos every week in order to teach myself the material. The course is fine if you need to take Linear Algebra, but you will be better off not taking it if Magee is teaching.",
    "Very straightforward class for learning the basics of linear algebra. Would recommend for someone who needs this foundation, but is not planning on much further in-depth study of mathematics.",
    "Yes",
    "No. I don't feel like I learned very much in this course, and would probably forget the little I did learn because it was taught in a way that encouraged mindless memorization. It was also thoroughly uninteresting and not at all engaging.",
    "I would definitely recommend Math 222 with Michael Magee. Of course linear algebra is hard but the applied (rather than theoretical) version definitely made it better. I think this topic will come up a lot in science classes I plan to take in the future, and so far I have seen overlap with engineering and computer science, so that's great. Prof. Magee is an alright lecturer but he is a really great person and he tries to improve the class, taking feedback and making changes and leading review classes when he didn't have to. I also found it easier to pay attention in class because of his accent haha.",
    "Linear algebra is probably one of the unsung hero's of modern society. Calculus gets all the attention because its taught first, but algorithms developed by people working in linear algebra are used everyday, all the time. Absolutely take it, even if you hate calculus (I didn't see an integral the entire semester).",
    "I didn't take this class for my major or for distributional requirements because I like applied math, and I was a little disappointed that there weren't many applications, but overall linear algebra is super cool and meditative, if that's what you're interested in.",
    "Great class.",
    "Yes, if you are interested in the topics covered by the course.",
    "I would recommend 222 to anybody who wants to learn linear algebra because they encounter it in their other classwork or research.",
    "I think the subject of linear algebra is extremely interesting and important to engineering and computer application, but this was also a difficult class conceptually, so I wouldn't probably recommend this class except to STEM majors (who probably have to take it anyways).",
    "Yes - the professor gives very fair exams, genuinely wants to improve his teaching and wants his students to do well.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. Go to lecture every day, because Prof. Magee does an amazing job explaining things so that they make sense to everyone. He doesn't assume any background knowledge and doesn't want to make things too difficult for people, which is great if you're just getting back into math! Do all of the problem sets thoroughly, as they are worth just as much as your midterm, and a great place to get back points you may have missed. That being said, I think most people did really well on the midterm, because he does a great job of teaching you exactly what you need to know. The practice finals are VERY indicative of what will be on the final itself so ABSOLUTELY do the practice finals, and then practice other types of problems similar to those.",
    "yes, the course is fun and interesting to those looking to advance their math skills.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. Linear algebra is a very approachable form of math and studying will nearly guarantee success. It is a very useful tool for nearly any quantitative subject, so quant students need to take this course. There are little to no proofs, so the course is even more so approachable.",
    "You're probably just taking it because you have to. There's nothing particularly thrilling about 222, but it is generally helpful as a STEM major to have some background on linear. Even if you don't need to know everything, a basic understanding is good. It's also helpful for BMEs even though not technically required. It'll give you a little background for your work in Matlab.",
    "I would definitely recommend. The material is challenging but manageable even if calculus isn't your forte. This class reignited my math love",
    "NO! Do NOT take this class, especially with Michael Magee, unless you want to spend additional hours outside of class teaching yourself what you should've been taught in lecture.",
    "A solid introduction to linear algebra. The math itself is interesting and Michael Magee was a passionate instructor. W",
    "Not really, maybe 225 is a better option. An applied math major, I feel wholly dismayed with the cursory conceptual understanding that I get from the course. Yup, I know how to compute eigenvalues, eigenvectors, determinants, SVD, Jordan blocks, etc. but I never understand why these things matter and how they relate to each other in a bigger scheme of things.",
    "Yes, it is a very useful topic for many different applications.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student, as I found myself interested by the new ideas and applications of linear algebra. The class is very fair, and you will learn quite a bit if you stay up to date with the material. Attending class definitely helps with this, as the book tends not to be the best at explaining.",
    "I would recommend this course. There aren't really any proofs, so if you're there to learn the algorithms that can be applied to other fields in Engineering, economics, Computer Science, etc., then definitely take this course. There's one problem set a week; just make sure to do it and you'll be fine!",
    "If you're curious about how the world works, this course has the most interesting applications of basic linear algebra: image compressions, google's page rank algorithm, etc. Course is paced very well and the psets are not difficult. Exams very straight forward -- basically what's on the practice exams.",
    "Take it if you need to take it. It's useful for many other classes.",
    "yes, linear is important to learn and 222 is probably the best way to go about it",
    "Only if there was a different instructor.",
    "If a student is interested in mathematics and wants to understand linear algebra in how it applies to the real world, I would recommend this class. If a student has no interest in pursuing mathematics, engineering, or comp sci, I would not.",
    "I would recommend this class because the material becomes a lot more interesting at the end of the semester.",
    "I would recommend this course to nearly every STEM major only based on the content of the course, rather than my engagement in it. Linear algebra is an important branch of math to grasp before continuing on to other applications, and therefore is probably pretty important to whatever STEM field that student might be in.",
    "I think that this course provides very important background information for those seeking knowledge in linear algebra. However, the course is not well presented or well taught.",
    "Definitely recommend it. Decent workload (one pset a week, a midterm, and final), but everything is straightforward and Magee does a great job of modeling the psets to reflect what we should be learning, and then making sure we know exactly what is expected of us on the exam. Take it! Easier than Math 120\/ENAS 150. If you're an Engineering major, you have to take Linear. 222 was probably a little easier than 225, less theory and more procedural math.",
    "Overall I would recommend this class because Linear Algebra is incredibly useful. The workload consists of one problem set a week and if necessary one could finish it in one long night. But I would recommend for the best understanding to start early. The exams were very similar to the practice exams. Michael Magee overall is a little bit of a dry teacher but made his best efforts to teach well. He asked for feedback and implemented it well. He also did a great job of integrating the applications of Page Rank, Image Compression and Signal Processing. However, in an applications focused class you do not really find the reason for why a lot of concepts happen. You are given a fact and are expected to believe it. I think that more intuition could have been given for the why part.",
    "Definitely recommend 222, I'm an economics and global affairs major my only math background is math 118, I took this class because I'm considering grad school. It was very easy to learn from and interesting.",
    "Admittedly the quality of this class will probably vary a lot depending on who is teaching it, but when it was taught by Prof. Magee it was amazing and one of the best classes I have taken in my 7 semesters at Yale. If you like the idea of applying math to do useful things, I highly recommend this class, whether or not it's required for your major. In the beginning it's a little slow as you cover the basics (e.g. matrix multiplication, elimination - straightforward but necessary stuff, make sure you are solid on this!), but don't be fooled, you will have to read the textbook several times and work harder later on (unless you've taken linear algebra before or are above average with math). Prof. Magee does a fantastic job making linear algebra interesting and like a fun game. He also really cares about his students and is willing to try different things to help us learn.",
    "Linear Algebra is a subject every student interested in quantitative reasoning should take. That being said, I think there are other classes that are more rewarding than this one, such as 225. On the other hand, if you have a heavy course load and need to take Linear Algebra, you should take 222."
