    "1. There were a lot of readings. Some of them were very hard to understand with no previous knowledge. However, with the heavy workload it was really difficult to do a lot of background research to help understand the readings assigned.4. The workload for this class was probably about half of my total workload for the semester. However, I worked really hard for the class because I truly wanted to. I didn't mind all the work required for the class...most of the time.5. What I most appreciated about Professor Dove was how carefully he considered every single thing students said in class.6. I liked how the class was broken up each week, but within some of the lectures, it was hard to keep pace with Professor Dove's analysis. This was only a problem during the weeks about development and governmentality, which were the hardest for me to understand from the readings.",
    "I enjoyed this class very much and thought Professor Dove did an excellent job of conveying information. Certain topics were more interesting to me than others, but on the whole I got a lot out of the class in terms of material. The TAs were helpful for the paper writing process as well. Some of the readings were very long and dry and I much preferred the articles to some of the books.",
    "I feel like I got more out of the small group sections that the TAs \/ professor were more active in directing. When it's left up to the discussants only, the discussions can sometimes go in random directions that are not super related to the readings. Also, encouraging students to back up their statements with references to the text(s) would push us to clarify our understanding of the materials.",
    "The course is reading-intense.",
    "This was my favorite class of the semester. The readings and discussions were challenging, but professor Dove and the TAs set up a very comfortable atmosphere in which everyone could share and question material. Lectures were fascinating, thought provoking. Discussion groups were well structured with student leaders each week. Having to write commentaries and lead discussion throughout the semester was an integral part of the learning experience and helped to bring all students into active participation.",
    "1. The course readings were unrealistically dense in comparison with other course loads",
    "Sometimes the required readings were so long, that it was impossible to get to the recommended readings, which often illustrated the intended message from the readings. Perhaps only specific sections of the books could be assigned in addition to the recommended readings. The TAs were very responsive and helpful; always willing to spend time talking about questions."

    "Professor Dove's lectures. I would like more of them! Or longer lectures. I actually was NOT a fan of our discussion time. I thought the conversations were all over the place, and particularly in the first half of the course, highly theoretical (though, to be fair, much of the reading material struck me as theoretical to boot).",
    "Professor Dove is an excellent professor. He actually listened to and considered what students had to ask and say. He is also one of the nicest people I've ever met.",
    "Read a lot of interesting books!Tough paper though!",
    "The discussions were interesting and it was great to hear my classmates opinions on the readings. Professor Dove's lectures were insightful and engaging.",
    "How structured the reading material was, and the fact that the Professor had so much field experience. I only wish there had been a way I could have pushed myself to read all the \"Recommended\" readings as well.",
    "the small group sections",
    "Professor Dove and readings.",
    "Professor Dove truly listens to students and thinks carefully before he speaks. With these simple yet revolutionary habits, I believe he can really change the way people think and act.",
    "1. The instructor's teaching style builds student confidence in development work2. The breakout sessions were a great venue for brain storming ideas3. The concept of guest lectures and the dynamic contribution that it brought to the overall experience4. The concept of leading some commentaries and break out session coordination",
    "The material, the lectures and the class discussions.",
    "I was amazed by the wonderful and thoughtful comments given by the instructor and TAs for every written assignment. Not only were they helpful, but they were very insightful and imparted the feeling that my work had actually been read and contemplated... which is both entirely welcome and reassuring for a beginning masters student.",
    "The best thing about this course was Professor Dove's insightful remarks and his advice on environmental development in rural communities.Unlike other courses in F&ES, Prof. Dove's course provided us with discussions that truly challenged our views. The diverse group of students present in the class, along with their varied experiences, gave us much to talk about and learn about each other and the readings.The readings gave me a strong base I can support myself on for as long as I wish to participate or organize an ethical and well analyzed program. Carefully picked, this courses readings must be taken in slowly and with passion. I assure you will take much more than you expected from this class.",
    "The best parts of the course were Professor Dove's thoughtful and insightful lectures and the chance to discuss class topics in small groups after the lectures.",
    "Dove's lectures are great.",
    "The subject matter of the course, the knowledge that the professor had, the level of engagement he has with the students during class (as well as his enthusiasm with students throughout the semester), and certainly the guest lecture we had by Ann Armbrecht and the dinner afterwards with her (it was great to read her book, watch her speak, and then have dinner with her... moreover, the introduction of a spiritual side to anthropology was certainly for me a great, and perhaps the best, part of the course!)."

   "comments": [
    "Please give the paper guidelines to students around the midterm time. 10 days before is not sufficient time--people are already into the thick of papers, and will have been flying blind in advance of that. Same with guidelines for facilitating a discussion group. I went the first week and it was awful--confusing, the TA stepped in and told us we weren't structuring it well, and we had no example of how to do it well. The two TAs and Dove should lead the first week, so we can have an example, or at least lay out some preparatory guidelines.Also, Professor Dove arrives late and starts class late regularly (just a few minutes), and sometimes seems a bit unprepared (for example--students asked him to provide the paper guidelines a week before the paper was due. We ended up getting an extension, but the reality is it would look more professional and be more comforting for Professor Dove to instigate getting us the tools we need--not having to ask for them!)",
    "I felt like I needed a better base of understanding on some topics (development and governmentality) before I could participate meaningfully in the class discussions. I wish the course had provided this base.",
    "The three hour time frame is a bit hard week after week. It was good to break up half the time for discussion but often lectures went into part of the discussion time. Also pictures and visuals were helpful in keeping the class more engaged during the longer lectures.",
    "While student-led discussions were beneficial, I think that the discussions could have gone to a deeper level of analysis had there been slightly more guidance or input from the instructor and TAs.",
    "- the guest lectures were just ok- the room was too small- it might be helpful to offer a TA section before the commentaries are due so that commentators have a chance to discuss \/ seek clarity on the materials before having to write the responses.- in terms of the final paper, i found that, because I didn't have time to read before submitting the outline, my final paper diverged a lot from what I thought I was going to write. It might be helpful to offer a mid-semester week to read for the final paper, with a detailed outline as the product.",
    "The classroom was not big enough.",
    "1. The structure of the syllabus is great as is but I believe it will be helpful if it is revised to include some basic fundamentals at the inception to help students without \"development\" background and work experience2.",
    "Balance between readings on topics related to agrarian studies versus other topics. For example, Atreyee's lecture on urban spaces was fascinating, and a wonderful chance to explore the classes' topics through the lens of urbanization and myths\/discourses surrounding the urban poor.",
    "Discussions should be better structured. TAs should work more on this section.Discussion tended to be a bit too philosophical and deep for me. Although I enjoy this conversation, I rather have a more practical and experienced based discussion. I feel that we should focus more on the study cases and really break them down into its pieces instead of trying to understand the basic concept and venture into the wild world of abstract and subjectivism. This did give intersting insight, but was most of the time a long pause during discussion",
    "The class seemed to really improve when we moved into a smaller room, out of Burke. If it's possible to keep the class to a size that fits into the smaller rooms, it would be very beneficial. Additionally, I think the length of the readings were often overwhelming. Perhaps the small group discussions would be better if the readings were more manageable. Also, I felt that having a whole lecture and book on swidden agriculture was overly specific. Although they were very interesting, and provided excellent examples of anthropological insight into environmental practices and myths about indigenous practices, the valuable class time could have been spent on a topic more applicable to more students.",
    "Though the professor shared with us great insight, the reading off of notes throughout the lecture rather than speaking directly was, for the lack of a better word, boring. Though, it should be said that the professor is certainly an asset to FES and his great knowledge on the subject should not be easily dismissed."

The midnight emails announcing office hours the night beforehand were entertaining and not a problem whatsoever. Anyone who says otherwise is just whining and should be cheerfully ignored.",
    "It was very hard to find open office-hours for the instructor. Nevertheless, he was very good about returning emails and keeping in contact with the TAs, with whom I tended to communicate with the most.",

    "I was intimidated to talk to Dove and his office hours were very limited. Alder was very available, approachable and helpful.",

    "Yes, great part of the FES experience.",

    "At first I took this course because I had never taken an environmental course with an anthropological perspective. As I prepare my program for the following years, I realize that the readings, discussions and the lectures given in this class will help me in any course that I take.The readings in this class provide students with frameworks. Theoretical lenses useful to analyze project implementation and environmental - human society interactions. My goal is to work in South America, with rural community development through different conservation tools; PES, REDD, etc. This class widened my view on the unintended consequences we, as environmental managers, can have on the communities and ecosystems we work in.",
    "Aside from being a foundational course, this class also is an introductory course for further social ecology study at the school. As I am interested in the linkages between people and the environment, it provided a nice introduction into that field.",

It was really nice to discuss the reading in a small group of people who had all done all of the reading (which was not always the case for people who were not leading the discussion...some weeks it was just too much work on top of the other classes). This allowed for me to get a lot more out of the lecture and the small discussion groups.",
    "group session is more like people utter their own opinion without really synergy",
    "We worked in groups when leading discussions. These were not that helpful but are still important for the discussions. It depended on who else was in your group. I would advise for next year having fewer discussion leaders and some of the groups were quite large this year.",
