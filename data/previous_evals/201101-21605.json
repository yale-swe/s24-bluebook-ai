    "A great opportunity to do something you love. Pick an engaging adviser and just go with an idea you've always wanted to pursue.",

    "You should choose a supervisor who is good at time management and can point you in the right direction when you are stuck with something. You only have a semester, so use your time wisely. It is really up to you (and to some luck) to make your project successful. Choosing a good topic for the project can make this an extremely rewarding experience, and choosing a bad topic can make it a very frustrating one.",
    "they have to take it. so yes.",
    "Senior projects are fun, if you have a good adviser and like your project. Don't know why you're looking at the evaluation, since it depends a lot on those things - but a semester is plenty time to work on a good project, if you work on it.",
    "1) Choose a project that interests you.2) Choose an advisor that is interested in your project \/ that you like.",
    "Required course for MENG major. It's cool to take ownership of your own project, but a lot of work and stress."
