    "Chaucer: critical debates and themes.",
    "I would wholeheartedly recommend this course to a fellow student, provided that they were willing to enter into it, body and soul.",
    "I would highly recommend ENG 546 to anyone interested in learning more about late medieval literature, even those who feel that they have a solid background to Chaucer's major work The Canterbury Tales. The course is designed to be so expansive and to consider so many more texts, particularly the sources and analogues of Chaucer's work, that it can be made relevant to anyone working in the medieval and early modern periods and would be interesting to those working in later periods as well."

   "comments": [
    "Alastair is very flexible about shaping Chaucer topics to individual research interests.",
    "This course opened my eyes to nuances of Chaucer and his sources in ways of which I had hitherto been ignorant. Professor Minnis covered a great number of poems in almost eye-watering detail, where what was at stake was almost constantly in flux. This not only reawakened the dormant literary critic in me, but helped me to see how well a graduate seminar could be run.",
    "This course deepened my knowledge enormously, both of Chaucer and his cultural milieu. ENG 546 will no doubt prove one of the most important courses I will take as a graduate student, and has carried me further in my preparation for a dissertation prospectus than any other course."
