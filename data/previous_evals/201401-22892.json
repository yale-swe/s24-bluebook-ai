   "comments": [
    "This course simultaneously requires much self-motivation and teamwork. It can be a big time commitment, and easy to fall behind in doing one's share of the notekeeping, data entry, etc.It's one of those courses where you really get what you put into it. Great experience for those interested in fieldwork, and even for those who aren't, it's a great experience in learning to appreciate what kind of work field linguists do.",
    "You try to piece together how one person's language works based on talking with and recording a language consultant who is fluent in it. I recommend it to any student in Linguistics, or any student interested in language learning as an adult, since it is a good reminder of the challenges required in acquiring a new language.",
    "You get to work on a lesser-studied language (which is always interesting for linguists), with an actual speaker, and work on whatever topic(s) interest you. I would definitely recommend to another student. Even if they wouldn't ordinarily be interested in fieldwork, it's a good thing to do because it gives you an appreciation of the vagaries of linguistic data, when elicited from a non-linguist. Also, it gets you into a real-life situation in which you have to form, test and refine hypotheses week after week, helping you bridge the gap between your theoretical and 'practical' linguistic knowledge.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone interested in learning a non Indo European language. However, you need to take into account that this is NOT a language class, it is a class in which you need to take the initiative to explore a new language and learn from your mistakes. However, it is a really nice experience.",
    "I would certainly recommend this class for other students, especially if it were taught by Claire or Ryan. I would mention my feelings about the style of teaching as I discussed in the first section."

   "comments": [
    "It helped prepare me for doing real fieldwork, for thinking about the logistical, academic, and ethical issues involved. Drilled into me the importance of keeping on top of metadata, proper data handling, etc.Really good course and really useful for me.",
    "It showed me to be wary of data. Given our consultant's sometimes erratic judgments of the same sentence, it made me reflect on how the task of judging grammaticality\/acceptability is an unusual, acquired skill. Given that so much theorising in subdisciplines like syntax is done on the basis of marginally-acceptable sentences, it made me realise that if those judgments are not corroborated by native-speaker linguists, they should be treated with caution.",
    "I liked how field methods is a class where one can apply the knowledge learned in other classes. I also enjoyed that we could choose the topics we wanted to for our sketches\/final paper so that we can tailor them to fit our interests. In that way, I could use them in a way that could contribute to my research.",
    "It was very useful for me to work through issues I encountered in a language that is so different from others that I've worked on. It broadens my understanding of what's out there. And this course has given me some preparation and strategies for fieldwork that I will conduct in the future."
