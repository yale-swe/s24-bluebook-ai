   "comments": [
    "I feel as though the material presented in this class was interesting but the fashion in which it was presented was near the opposite of what it should have been. The saving grace to all of this was the case studies we took on, but even these lacked a quantitative aspect or forced us to make specific forecasts at to the impact of our interventions.Lectures started off discussing aspects of the global health system, relief vs. development debates and funding issues. This part was interesting as it was a bit more tangible to us and could weave its way into other coursework or conversations we had. Class participation was also much greater (still not great) during this portion, approximately the first third, of the course.Unfortunately things devolved into a literature review from here. We were asked to read papers and then the context, methodology and results were presented to us via the lecture often with far too much emphasis placed on the specific numbers observed. This information is important but could have been covered in 15 minutes instead of 45. From here I would have hoped for a class discussion around impacts to development and health policies implicated by the findings of this paper. \"How do you expect this to impact existing policies? How would you change them or write new policies to compensate for these issues? How might implementation of these policies be changed prior to any changes exterior to your specific organization?\" These questions, I believe, are the important applications to the theory we learn in class and would have allowed the knowledge sharing that is supposed to occur at this level of education. Instead I have a rudimentary knowledge of some of the difficulties faced in health focused activities in developing nations. In terms of solutions for these issues or how to develop them? I do not have much.",
    "Course covers all the right topics, but could be better moderated. This course NOT be about peer experiences in developing countries but instead a holistic look at the systems that shape health care systems around the world.Case-studies are a good way to teach this course, but I would make the case studies more based in reality and less basic. The ones we used were unrealistic and didn't help us develop assessment or policy analysis skills as much as they could have.The guest speakers in this class were random.",
    "I really enjoyed this course. For a second year, it was a really good \"refresher\" to see regression modeling again, as well as to have it applied in a new way.Every public health professional should realize at some point that our practice depends heavily on available financial resources (and the willingness to spend those resources on different problems). This course did a nice job of ingraining this idea.Weakness: the papers chosen for class and the final assignment were dry and could have a stronger epidemiology dynamic, if possible.",
    "If you do not have much experience with global health issues, this is a good class to take. It provides a nice basic framework for approaching global health problems from a policy perspective.",
    "Strengths: I learnt a lot about health systems in the developing countries and how they could be improved. The guest lectures were pertinent and the assignments were interesting.Weaknesses: The final assignment was not as productive because we did not learn anything in addition to what we had already learnt. It may have been helpful to have a shorter (shorter than the mid-term) written assignment.",
    "i'd say the content was good, but perhaps framing the studies first in a general sense, providing context of the studies and why they were done, would be helpful in being able to analyze them in the scope of public health. also, maybe two classes on basic economics and metrics would be helpful rather than just the one.",
    "None.",
    "I had high hopes going into this class because I thought it would provide a useful introduction to Global Public Health. I was wrong. I have walked away from this class feeling like I know little more than user fee structures in Tanzania. I also felt frustrated by the lack of feedback on case studies and the midterm paper. I will say that the case studies were interesting and useful assignments, and helped keep us engaged in class--made the concepts seem more tangible.",
    "The good:I thought the articles were well chosenI thought the guest speakers were excellent! (esp. Snow)The bad:The timing of the midterm paper left some people frustrated since it overlapped spring break a little too closely. (I liked getting the main project out of the way early, but not at the expense of spring break!)",
    "A paper assignment early in the semester was a good idea. The heaviest bulk of work was completed when students had the time, energy, background and interest to think analytically and thoroughly. Large paper assignments due at the end of the semester tend to be rushed and not as well thought-out or researched. The class really enjoyed final project presentations by student groups. I felt that the content of these studies was better absorbed by student presentation than instructor presentation which begs the question whether more student presentations should be scattered throughout the semester.",
    "This course had a lot of potential for being a great class, however, I was very disappointed by the way it turned out. I feel like the entire focus was on bed nets and Tanzania, and I think that the curriculum could be expanded to evaluate health systems and policies in many other countries as well.",
    "There was a focus on a very specific health system. The course objectives were a little unclear. The paper topic and case studies were a little too broad, while the lectures tended to harp on very specific details.",
    "terrible, THE WORST class i've taken and i want my time\/money back. didn't talk about how to hell to write policy! i understand Ach is new, so his lack of teaching prowess is forgivable, but not the lack of course content.next year, he cannot be allowed to just assign readings and dicuss them in class. we know how to read dude, teach us what we don't alreayd know, teach us what you know! for g-d's sake! ask yourself why no one responds to questions in class? no one did thew readings b\/c they'd be covered in class. i don't want to see any more overview classes or classes that don't impart any practical skills.",
    "This course has several major problems that need to be fixed to make it a valuable learning experience for it students.The first thing it needs to do is decide what kind of course it is. The assignments ranged from embarrassingly easy (equivalent of a grade school book report on a journal article) to well beyond the scope of the lectures (designing global policies). The case studies were the only assignments that felt right in the course as far as being compatible with the level of content and difficulty with the lectures. For policy students, or anyone with prior global health policy experience, this class won't present any new material. For non-policy students, this class could have provided an interesting experience if the teacher took a more active role in discussion and guidance of the students. The teacher seemed wholly unaware of the background of the students knowledge and too unwilling to challenge student ideas making the class a limited learning experience for everyone.The lectures, to put it frankly, looked lazy. The lecture slides looked like they were prepared the night before. Too many were focused onanalyzing specific papers and not on looking at the different concepts involved and how they compliment and contrast with one another. I understand that the professor's interest is in economics, but this is not an economics course, and a cursory evaluation of a few tables in a few papers isn't valuable to anyone. Frankly, more teaching needed to be done. The last lecture was simply the retelling of a short story from the first lecture. We did not pay such a large tuition for this.The value of the assignments were pretty much worthless, even the case studies. This is primarily because they were never returned. Two weeks after the course has ended, more than half of th assignments have not been returned to students, including the mid-terms. This is horrible. Evaluations of assignments are key for students to rate their progress and understanding. The two assignments that were returned were evaluated by a TA. Unfortunately, an MPH student was chosen to TA this course. A course that the TA had never taken before. The comments from the TA were often not helpful. As this is a new course, the professor should have been evaluating more assignments to get an idea of where his students were and what he expected of them. At minimum the TA should have been a doctoral student in policy to compensate that no one had taken this class before.This class needs to become more focused. The professor needs to begin to take the class seriously.",
    "This was an excellent course for global health introduction and I really enjoyed the health economics and the issues that were covered.",
    "The readings were great and the professor was interesting but the lectures did not add to the readings, but recapped them.",
    "The course was excellent in in getting us to consider how different strategies effect people on a much more in depth scale, such as considering health externalities and opportunity cost.",
    "The course was too oriented towards papers and was too Tanzania heavy. Reading the papers only to discuss them in class was a waste of time. I felt that the pace was too slow, and I wished I learned more. On the other hand, the professor tried to make the assignments interesting.",
    "Strengths: Interesting topic, interesting readings, professor with clearly a large amount of expertise in the area.Weaknesses: 8:30 am!awkward imbalance between discussion and lecture - too large for good discussions and I would have preferred more in depth lectures (also; the review of ANOVA was ok despite the fact that everyone should've come in with that baseline knowledge, but at least expand on to some micro-econ; it felt like a wasted lecture);the emphasis on group projects took away from the ability to really interact with the material and receive good feedback from the professor. Assignments were middle-school-esq in that sense. The individual paper assignment also could've been improved possibly with a broader ability to select topics.",
    "Good global health class. It deals more with the health management and policy aspect of the health, so it gives a well rounded knowledge of health management for those not taking other courses in health management."

    "Instructor: Achyuta Rasendra Adhvaryu \u00a0This was Ach's first class to my knowledge, and it showed. He appeared timid and did not really interact with students during lecture, I never felt overly stimulated by his lectures or that he challenged anything we put forth in class. I do feel that he is knowledgeable and personable but this was not conveyed by his lectern delivered speeches. The small class size should have resulted in more interaction.",
    "Instructor: Achyuta Rasendra Adhvaryu \u00a0Strengths: strong knowledge and background in economics and regression analysis.Weaknesses: needs practice in moderation of class.",
    "Instructor: Achyuta Rasendra Adhvaryu \u00a0As a new professor, I can already tell that Ach has a lot of potential to be an incredible teacher. He is dynamic and connects well with the class.He consistently answered our questions (e.g. in class, or regarding the case studies) effectively.Biggest complaint: not getting assignments back. If I'm going to write a 20 page paper as a midterm assignment, I expect that a professor will have planned on grading it and getting it back with feedback. That paper was turned in over a month ago and I'm really disappointed to not have heard anything since I respect his opinions. That's a big teaching faux pas that no student will appreciate.Otherwise, I think he did a really good job. Choosing more health-oriented papers might be helpful in terms of bringing more epidemiology into the course. However, perhaps that just is not the nature of economics papers. If that is the case, having a course that's an \"economics overview\" would have been helpful. For example, the concepts of \"Pareto optimal\" and \"30% deadweight loss\" didn't make complete sense until the end of the course.",
    "Instructor: Achyuta Rasendra Adhvaryu \u00a0The instructor was great. Ach is very receptive and creates a very comfortable environment in which to carry class discussions.",
    "Instructor: Achyuta Rasendra Adhvaryu \u00a0Ach has potential to become a really good professor. His classes were very engaging and I enjoyed most of the papers we read for the class. In future years, however, it may be helpful to assign papers with less econometrics. It would have been helpful to receive our mid-terms a few weeks after turning them in, in order to know how we were doing in the class. We still have not received our mid-term grade.",
    "Instructor: Achyuta Rasendra Adhvaryu \u00a0very sexy beast.",
    "Instructor: Achyuta Rasendra Adhvaryu \u00a0Clear explanation of complicated theory. With a lot of cases and examples overall the world.I enjoyed very much the speakers that our instructor brought to the class",
    "Instructor: Achyuta Rasendra Adhvaryu \u00a0I think Ach was a good instructor, just clearly new to the game. I think that in a year or two he will turn into a much better instructor who better facilitates class discussion and engages students...practice makes perfect! And really, more feedback in a more timely manner would b helpful. I really do think that after a few years Ach will make a much better lecturer, so I don't want to harp on him- the good intent was there!",
    "Instructor: Achyuta Rasendra Adhvaryu \u00a0Ach is a great guy and obviously cares about students, but it's obvious he's new to teaching a course like this. He did a good job planning it out and organizing it (with the exception of the bad timing of the midterm paper).Class discussions did not go very well... there were often long awkward silences where you could practically hear crickets chirping. Sometimes it was due to the fact that the question wasn't really clear. Other times, it seemed like the discussions were dominated by the wrong people and Ach maybe could have done more to reign them in.",
    "Instructor: Achyuta Rasendra Adhvaryu \u00a0Lecturer was amazing. (Ach) presented well-thought, refined lectures. His answers to class questions were as poised and diplomatic which indicates high quality teaching overall. Ach sets a new, higher bar for other teachers.",
    "Instructor: Achyuta Rasendra Adhvaryu \u00a0Dr. Adhvaryu is a great person and I think that this class will be really great in the future. However, I think that this semester was a challenge, probably because it was his first semester teaching. I felt that there was poor classroom management - Students would go on tangents and it was easy for the class to get off track. It was also impossible to know whether or not we were actually learning in the class. By the end of the semester we had turned in 4 case studies and a 20 page midterm paper, and had only received grades back on the first 2 case studies. I think that the class could have been managed much better, and the content could have been much better as well.",
    "Instructor: Achyuta Rasendra Adhvaryu \u00a0Very nice and approachable.",
    "Instructor: Achyuta Rasendra Adhvaryu \u00a0fine for a newbee, but would be much better with revised coruse content and format. i did think thouhg that he did a fair job of asking for student feedback over the semester, but it was obvious he didnt integrate any of those suggestions. being about the same age as some of our older classmates, he's in a unique position to relate closely to us, have a relaxed and approachable teaching style,but failed.",
    "Instructor: Achyuta Rasendra Adhvaryu \u00a0Generally seemed completely uninterested in the class or the topic. Everything felt like an afterthought.",
    "Instructor: Achyuta Rasendra Adhvaryu \u00a0The instructor was well prepared and engaged the class well in discussion and sharing personal experiences to make the lectures interactive and to problem solve more effectively.",
    "Instructor: Achyuta Rasendra Adhvaryu \u00a0He was good, especially as a first-time professor. He had good classroom discussion and allowed it to flow very well. I would like it if he had of returned our grades for work throughout the semester.",
    "Instructor: Achyuta Rasendra Adhvaryu \u00a0Very personable, clearly very smart. It just didn't feel like there was a lot of thought behind the class lectures and assignments. I would've also appreciated a bit more instruction in economic theory as that is the professor's background.",
    "Instructor: Achyuta Rasendra Adhvaryu \u00a0Very good. nice and approachable. May need to better structure the course though. His questions are also usually long and there may be difficulty determining what his actual question is at completion."
