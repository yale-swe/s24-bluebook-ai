    "Do not take it with smart physics",
    "I think this is a good standard physics class. I like the interactive clicker questions, and online pre-lectures that we have to do before each class. It's definitely a novel way of learning.",
    "Basic of physics, helps to have a good math background\/understanding of vector notation. I would recommend it because its an intro course that is not TOO time consuming and also isn't a waste of time.",
    "I took Physics 181 before this and I can easily say that this was much more comprehensible. The smartphysics website that is used in teaching the course is not perfect, but it keeps you practicing enough to not forget the material entirely. This class was one of my less heavy classes, it did not prove to be too difficult at any point in the semester, which really helped with the fact that I was taking it along with 4 other classes. Take this class with Rona Ramos. She really tries to take all the students' concerns into account when starting her lectures.",
    "Physics 180 02 is definitely a challenge, but not one you can't handle. There are some interesting demos and you'll learn a lot. Rona Ramos was a good professor, Especially if you like to come in for office hours. She will schedule an appointment with you any time.",
    "Yes- not super challenging, you will learn basic physics very well",
    "This is a great, comprehensive introduction to physics. There is more work than I would have expected for the course, but it was definitely worth it and I felt like I had a good grasp on the material. The in-class clicker questions made class engaging and enjoyable, and it was always a class I was excited to attend. While the professor sometimes had trouble explaining the material, there were enough resources (office hours, class study halls, sections, online videos, and textbooks) to understand the material. I would definitely recommend taking advantage of these resources, because there was a good amount of graded homework for the class, and if you got lost it could become time consuming.",
    "Good course, standard physics, not too difficult. Ramos' section is enjoyable but make sure you review the old midterms because tests seem geared towards Sean Barrett's teaching focuses.",
    "Fair amount of work, with nightly online Psets, weekly written Psets and 2 midterms. Of the intro physics classes though, this one seemed pretty manageable.",
    "It's a simple class if You've ever taken physics before - a lot of the information at the beginning of the class is review then and the class goes pretty slowly. The only annoying thing was the smartphysics website because You had to do physics literally everyday. Also, it was confusing when they made You do multiple lectures on the same day, and this wasn't always communicated effectively. The clicker questions made You pay attention in class, which was good for me.",
    "PHYS 180 is a calculus-based course that goes more in-depth into topics introduced in high school. This year, the course added SmartPhysics, which is an online system that teaches you the bulk of the physics material through videos. For example, we'd watch a 20 min. Prelecture and complete a short Checkpoint assignment (usually 2-3 multiple choice + explain questions ) as homework due by 8 am on the day of the next lecture. The assignments have optional questions to comment about any particularly difficult material, which our instructor would address in class. Class, then, became more of a time for clarifying the points which were highlighted in the student comments, as well as a general review of what the Prelecture covered. A good part of lecture was spent doing derivations, as well. Some class time was used for demos. Also there is a SmartPhysics book available, but it's pretty much the same as what is said in the Prelecture, so if you'd like a physical copy to follow along in, you might find one helpful. If you feel like this format would fit you learning style, try out the class!",
    "Yes if you need it. It's not difficult to understand but the exams are going to be a surprise and difficult if this is your first time learning physics. The curve was also very high.",
    "If you like physics but aren't ready for the work and intensity of 200 or 260 then this is the class to take.",
    "Most of the course this fall was online-based with the addition of the SmartPhysics system, which had its pros and cons. It definitely prepared us for lectures beforehand and let us better utilize class time. But the online homework stressed correct numerical answers, which the written homework sometime did, and the midterms and tests completely relied on conceptual knowledge and presented questions using variables rather than numbers. In short, there was very little consistency in the skills expected from students. Ultimately, there were no clear lessons learned in the ways in which students should be expected to attack problem-solving in physics.",
    "They completely revamped Physics 180 this year, as they are now using the online SmartPhysics curriculum which requires students to complete pre-lectures (basically a 20 minute slideshow with audio that you click through), checkpoint problems, and online homework. There were both advantages and disadvantages to this system, but overall I feel like it helped me to absorb the material more effectively. I liked the emphasis on clicker questions in class as opposed to long, dry lectures. Of course, the professor did offer short lectures to either expand on the pre-lecture material or clarify common points of confusion. There is a task due most days of the week (either pre-lecture + checkpoint, online homework, or a separate written p-set). However, I never felt overwhelmed. In fact, the frequent due dates ensured that I never fell behind, which I am wont to do in most other courses. Incidentally, the exams in this course are a bit different from what you might expect based on the p-sets, so make sure you look at the practice exams they provide.I also want to say that Professor Ramos is great - funny, personable, engaging, well-prepared and always willing to take extra time to help her students. I really liked having a smaller lecture class (~40-45 students). I definitely recommend her section if it is offered again.",
    "Physics 180 introduces students to the kinematics and dynamics of linear and rotational systems, simple harmonic motion, waves, and fluid statics and dynamics. If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re considering this class, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s probably because you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re required to take an introductory physics class for your major or to satisfy pre-med requirements. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d recommend this course to you only if you have some background in physics because the SmartPhysics program doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do a great job presenting the material. In terms of your math background, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d suggest taking Physics 180 after or concurrently with Math 115. You don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t need to know a lot of calculus to succeed in this class, but you must know how to take dot products and cross products. If you have the time, math background, and enthusiasm, you should shop Physics 200 or Physics 260 instead of Physics 180. If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a pre-med and have a limited background in physics, take Physics 170.",
    "Seemed like a better experience than the larger section (01) if you have to take a physics course.",
    "This physics section is an introductory class that teaches you the basics of Classical Mechanics. I would highly recommend this class to anyone looking for a good teacher and good material.",
    "Not great. Felt like I did 2 times more work than necessary and learned 1\/2 of what I would have learned in a Physics class anywhere else. Professor Ramos is nice and an okay teacher, but the curriculum is not well worked out. We were the smartPhysics guinea pigs, and so hopefully the class will get better (if they keep smartPhysics).The class this year had some sort of dissociative identity disorders. The four components of the class: smartPhysics, lectures, problem sets and tests lack any congruence. The TAs are writing the homework, Rona was teaching lecture, Sean Barrett was writing the tests, and smartPhysics is by another author. All of them had different ideas of what was important, so you never what to expect. The material on the tests was just completely random at times and didn't seem to be geared towards anything we emphasized on class. This was super frustrating, especially since we were doing physics pretty much EVERYDAY because of the prelectures and homework.If you're taking it though, it's probably required for your major. I would shop around the other Physics intro classes though, as I did not really find this class rewarding.",
    "It's standard intro Physics. Nothing too exciting.",
    "Yes. I really did not enjoy physics in high school. Maybe it's because I'm relearning these concepts (and the lack of E&M), but I actually enjoyed the class. While SmartPhysics and psets get tedious (2 online HW and 1 written PSET every week and a pre-lecture video+checkpoint questions twice a week), it really helps with keeping me from falling behind the class. As long as you went to study hall to do the written psets, they could be done within 3 hrs. The workload wasn't that bad. The midterms were very similar to the practice midterms that Rona and Professor Barrett handed out.The final, however, was really different and I think caught us all off guard.",
    "Take it if you have to -- smartphysics is a pain so get ready to do a lot more work than you anticipated for an intro level physics course.",
    "yes",
    "YES",
    "Overview of newtonian mechanics. Used smartphysics which was okay and required a lot of out of class work."
