   "comments": [
    "Take this class. Great intro to India and the rest of the world in a comparative perspective!",
    "Interesting class -- this is a seminar, not a lecture. The readings use India as a case study for broader themes, so it is not just South Asia-specific. Professor Thachil is fantastic. Low stress grading system (based on three reading response papers and class discussion). If you have not taken a seminar before, this is a great one to take because Professor Thachil is a great discussion leader.Take this class, or definitely one taught by Professor Thachil.",
    "Good course. There is a lot to learn about the functioning of democracy even if you have no prior interest in India.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course. India is a fascinating country to study because everything you learn about it can be applied somewhere else. The syllabus had a great blend of political theory and current event analysis. The reading load was painless and, for the most part, interesting. The course is very well-designed, discussions were lively, and Professor Thachil was awesome. Grade based on three response papers and participation.",
    "If you're interested in Indian politics, this is a very good overview class. The readings aren't too much of a pain, and you only have to write 3 5-page reading response papers. Class discussions can get kind of dull though. Professor Thachil is clear and helpful, although you probably don't want to be late to class (it's a 9 am class). I would recommend this class to all those interested in area studies in general.",
    "This was a great course - it was nice to see how many of the ideas of democracy fit into a practical context. Professor Thachil is also a great professor and he always had interesting insight on the material. However, bear in mind that most of the course is about India, and although we did a lot of comparative learning, India was still the main focus - do not worry about taking it without much background in the subject matter, although background will truly help with the grounding \/ understanding of the material and its context",
    "Yes! Professor Thachil is one of the best teachers at Yale. He's funny, youthful, clear, concise, and challenging; though he isn't an easy grader, he's fair and reasonable, and he will give you a lot of feedback to improve on your assignments throughout the semester and will make time for your questions during office hours. Take the class just to have a great seminar experience if nothing else.Though the class is very good too: it is essentially a broad introduction to many different topics about India's politics, including middle-class activism, Hindu nationalist parties, politics of the poor, caste-based political parties, and others. It runs like other seminars: you will have reading (though Professor Thachil assigns a very reasonable load, which means that you should do it because he will thoroughly talk about it in class and it'll be obvious if you didn't), you will have discussions during which Prof. Thachil will help guide you through the theories and themes in the readings, and you will write 3 five-page essays critiquing the readings. Though this could mean less work than other seminars, Prof. Thachil isn't an easy grader, so you will really have to refine your essays, and participation is also worth a lot. But the class is a worthwhile experience, helped by Prof. Thachil's great teaching style, I strongly recommend it!"
