    "I am now able to sight-read some poems and riddles in Old English! And I learned a lot about Anglo Saxon history, literature, and culture.",
    "Learned how to read Old English and a lot about pre-Norman conquest English culture and literature.",
    "A crash course in beginner's Old English",
    "I learned how to read Old English (with heavy dictionary help), and now understand a bit better where the English language came from. I also got a better sense of Anglo-Saxon history and culture and the ways that the Middle Ages are being re-understood today.",
    "A working knowledge of Old English, a deeper appreciation of medieval history and culture, and increased confidence in my ability to try new things :)",
    "That Shakespeare did not speak Old English. I still have no idea when to use the nominative case though, but thats on me.",
    "This is much more a language class than a literature class. Its a lot of vocab and grammar, but you also learn a lot about Old English customs and history, literary or otherwise.",
    "the foundations of old english language as well as anglo-saxon culture; basic linguistics; understanding of the predecessors of early english literature",
    "A general familiarity with Old English vocabulary and grammar, plus interesting background information on Anglo-Saxon cultures.",
    "Through this class, I not only learned how to read Old English texts in translation, I also learned about the historical context of medieval England and learned skills for thinking historically."

   "comments": [
    "The course combines the fun of language learning with the fascination of old literature. It's a great complement to other courses in the English major. The regular quizzes proved to be very useful for the learning process. One weakness of the course was the repetitiveness of the class meetings. A lot of time in class was spent just going over translations. I wonder if it would have been possible to just go over part of them, or post answer keys. I think it would have been helpful to use some of that time to discuss grammar patterns and rules in more depth, or spend more time discussing the literary elements of the texts, or talk about the linguistic history of words in Modern English and Old English.",
    "Prof. Reider is great and made taking the medieval requirement engaging. A weakness is that I would've liked to read more Old English literature and spend less time going over the readings in class at the beginning.",
    "Its strength is the class atmosphere. It is relatively inviting and non-intimidating. Its weakness is the mode of learning; especially at the beginning of the course, there were critically important foundational concepts that we spent very little time practicing in class, and there was very little direct instruction (aside from the textbook readings) that explained these concepts in depth. Unfortunately, this made it difficult to feel proficient in even the basics of the language for pretty much the entire term.",
    "Wonderful, encouraging professor and supportive class environment!",
    "The pace of the course was great, because just as we were learning more grammar concepts, the texts became more and more challenging so that we could learn how to apply them. I also thought the quizzes were a great way of keeping us accountable and assessing our progress (perhaps weekly would be even better). The presentation assignment was fun and gave us some freedom to focus on any area of our interest. My only suggestion would be more variety in the structured activities from class to class.",
    "Strengths: lots of practice work, you can shape the presentation assignment according to your personal interests, you learn so many fun facts about Old English and the medieval times Weaknesses: none come to mind",
    "I think this course is well-organized. I think a major strength is that the professor is pretty good at assessing how students are picking up translations, or not picking up translations. So the course was challenging, but also Professor Reider was good at preparing us for assessments throughout the course that made me not want to give up just because the translations were so hard.",
    "The day to day routine of this class was very good. Homework was never overwhelming, but I always felt like it was a real, worthwhile assignment.",
    "strengths: BOMB professor that made the class so much more enjoyable than it would've been with likely anyone else; well-structured; balance of speaking and reading skills; small-ish, manageable class size",
    "A more detailed explanation of complex grammar concepts (especially cases) would have been helpful, but otherwise the class was fun and well-taught.",
    "I loved the seminar structure of this class, especially the structure of classes that revolved around individual presentations and discussing translations."

   "comments": [
    "I definitely would, if you enjoy learning languages. It's fascinating to trace some of the quirks of our language today back to Old English and to be able to read in a language that's so similar to Modern English yet mostly incomprehensible to Modern English speakers.",
    "Yes, it's interesting and a refreshing change to take an English course that is exam-based instead of writing papers all the time. It is a linguistics class more than it is about analyzing literature though, so unless you like learning languages or are interested in the time period, perhaps consider another class.",
    "It's certainly important to spend time thinking about how Old English figures into the foundational texts of English literature, but unless the teaching methods of the course change, I'd hesitate to recommend it.",
    "Yes!",
    "I would recommend Old English, especially for those looking to fulfill their medieval requirement. I was skeptical at first, and the learning curve was steep (probably less so for people who have some Latin experience), but throughout the semester it became more fun once I got more comfortable. The workload is never overwhelming, and the vibe of the class was fun and relaxed (everyone is in the same boat). The fact that it's a seminar forces you to engage with the material that most people ignore until they fulfill this requirement. And reading Old English is kind of a cool skill - you're always learning something new!",
    "Yes! Being able to read exciting texts in their original language is such a cool experience, and Professor Reider is amazing.",
    "Yes, it ended up surprising me. I was just taking it for the English major, but it isnt bad especially with Professor Reider.",
    "Absolutely. I enjoyed this class a ton.",
    "yes! especially if you're interested in medieval history or fulfilling your medieval english requirement",
    "Yes.",
    "I would highly recommend this class to anyone interested in medieval studies, linguistics, or learning a more obscure classical language."
