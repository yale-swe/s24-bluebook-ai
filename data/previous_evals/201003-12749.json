    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. The novels we read are great and I also really liked the film analysis part of the class. Doing the reading is the main work load of the class, the two book reports aren't really worth much and then there is a 10 page final paper.",
    "The course is brief overview of minority discourse in literature as it pertains to Chinese diaspora. We focus mainly on the Americas (North and South).I would definitely recommend it because the readings (for the most part) are really entertaining but still educational. There are a lot of issues of minority discourse and identity that you've thought about before but never really understood until you have to write a paper on it.",
    "A lot of reading, but you gain a lot of knowledge and better understanding of the topic. I would certainly recommend it.",
    "Take it. Even if you know nothing of China. Take it.",
    "I think this class changes a lot as Professor Tsu explores the topics that interest her, but you should definitely take it if you are looking for a more challenging, engaging seminar experience. Reading is fair, film selection is awesome, and there's not beside the final paper.",
    "Take it.",
    "You should take this class if you have any interest in the Chinese Diaspora, Chinese American history, or anything Chinese-related! We learned about many different topics including Chinese food, Chinatown, Kongfu films, etc. The novels and films are all very interesting. Class is laid-back but thought provoking, and Professor Tsu is very engaging.",
    "I would recommend the course to any student who is interested in Asian American culture."
