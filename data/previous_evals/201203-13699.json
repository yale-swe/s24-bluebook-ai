    "1. The handouts were extremely valuable for students (such as myself) with no prior experience in GIS. Iappreciated the fact that specific worksheets were referenced in the agenda, so that I could put together concepts more easily.9. The instructor responded quickly to student questions through e-mail, and shared individual student questions with the class. Despite the fact that he was not on campus during the week, I never felt like I lacked support when struggling with an issue.12. I found this course to be extremely valuable to future work and it has important applications for FES students with a broad range of interests. Having a GIS course in the school is essential for building necessary career skills.",
    "Awfully heavy work load; I spent more time working for this class than for all my other classes put together and I still feel like a complete beginner with ArcMap. This being said, I learned a lot and Professor Tomlin is an amazing instructor - responsive though sadistic. I think that the class could have been less painful but it's part of its charm. Looking forward to taking raster in the Spring.",
    "LOVED this class. Absolutely great. Lots of work but fun and presented well.",
    "3: The weekly homework assignments were extremely time-consuming. Completing the assignment required knowledge and skill that were not covered in the previous class, leaving students spending hours figuring out the trick. The teaching was not memorable for me to remember much immediately after class even having spent so much time on the homework.",

    "Assignments built on each other in a useful way. The complexity of the assignments required many hours in the lab each week, and this made it necessary for students to put in the time necessary to learn a new program.",
    "The feeling of power and satisfaction when a seemingly random and terribly intricate series of steps leads to the completion of a very pretty map after 6 hours of misery.",
    "Homeworks were very interesting!",
    "Dana - he is one of the best teachers I have ever had. His ability to break down the concepts in order to get the theory across was fantastic.",
    "The homework assignments, while time-consuming, are ultimately where all of your learning takes place. Dana works hard to craft intricate yet solvable puzzles.",
    "One learnt to finish the homework with the help from TA, sometimes the GIS specialist, and classwork.",
    "Dana Tomlin is a real credit to his profession. He is clear and enthusiastic in lecture. He is uncommonly accessible by email which makes doing the assignments so much less stressful.",
    "Prof. Tomlin and all that he has to offer--both written and verbal.",
    "Very helpful; GIS is a must skill; the course is very practical and provides opportunities for learning and practice.",
    "The course is very applied. The homework is hard, but forces you to wrestle with the GIS program and effectively learn the material. The final project was left open to creativity, which I found incredibly useful for my thesis.",
    "learning skills",
    "dana tomlin is the man. very good at demistifying GIS.",
    "Dana is anincredible teacher. I loved how he gives you an introduction to the tools at your disposal each week, but leaves it up to you to implement them. In my opinion, his teaching style leads to a very deep understanding of the material.",

    "Additional GIS help during the week would have been very useful. Stacey Maples and the course TA were valuable resources, but they were often inundated with students looking for help. An additional TA with office hours in the sage lab would have been helpful in completing assignments while using time more effectively.",
    "Joins are such a tricky tool that I'd like to see 2 classes on them rather than one.",
    "In-class addressing of personal problems sometimes took up a little too much time at the start of class.",
    "None that I can think of. The workload is heavy but Dana gives fair warning during the first class.",
    "Lecture can at times drag on, and could benefit from the ability to follow along. For students without GIS installed on a laptop, this would mean conducting class in a computer lab.",
    "More coverage of the homework during the class, at least basic operations to streamline operations.",
    "My only strong suggestion about the course is that the grading structure (point values) for our assignments could be made more explicit at the time they are assigned (rather than after they are graded). I always felt like I was meeting and exceeding what was asked in the assignment but without fail I fell short of getting full credit.Dan",

    "more exploration of the tools instead of just applying tools to homeworks - often I forgot I was trying to learn GIS for life because I was so consumed with just finishing the week's assignment and getting a good grade."

    "I'm currently taking courses in urban policy, economics, and natural sciences. This course was one of two that provided hard skills useful to my career, rather than more theoretical knowledge.",
    "Essential for so many reasons. Before taking this class and despite several courses in geography and cartography (my background is in regional and urban planning), I had no idea of the way maps were actually produced. Following the full path from data mining to analysis and representation has been fascinating. I no longer depend on somebody else's data - I can produce my own for a series of topics that I'm interested in, from landscape sensitivity analysis to tracking ancient forest cores using historical information. This class opened countless possibilities for me. Should be a prerequisite for anyone wishing to work with space - land management, disaster mitigation, ecology, geographic economy, political science... this was reflected in the number of students exterior to FES who were attending the course.",
