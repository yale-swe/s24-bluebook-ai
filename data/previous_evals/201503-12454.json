   "comments": [
    "It's a good way to learn immunobiology! The class could be a little disjointed at times because so many different professors teach, but it also is cool to be taught by people at the forefront of the topics you're learning about. MWF 9:25 at the top of KBT literally could not be any worse, though.",
    "Interesting course overall! It was impressive how each professor could give an entire lecture without ever referencing their notes, reflecting the extent of their knowledge in the subject. There was also SO much material in each lecture-it was quite intimidating. The only thing I would say is that the lectures themselves are somewhat disjointed. For example, we learned about T cell differentiation in three separate lectures, taught by three separate professors. More coordination and better organization of the lectures would help.",
    "Immuno gives a really good background on immunobiology (duh). drawbacks: it's taught by many (~10) professors, and in my opinion, maybe 2 were really good, 4 were average, and 4 were pretty mediocre. so that means that your understanding will vary based on who is teaching what, but the good news is that class notes are provided for each lecture which will help standardize your studying. the other drawback for this class is there's no real big picture learning for immuno like ever, so you need to sit down after the lectures are over and really work through how to put the immuno puzzle pieces together until you get a clear picture of how immunobiology really works. hopefully they'll change this in the future and add some lectures at the end that help do this, but I can't say for sure. the midterms are fair and the homeworks are graded hard but it's for the best since you learn. my advice is to read lecture notes beforehand and always try to keep on top of how what you're learning fits into immunobiology as a whole. i found this the trickiest part during class... for example, we learned innate immunity in a few lectures, and it took me a few more weeks to realize that I already had been taught all of innate and that was all I needed to know. I had that feeling many times during the class because it doesn't do a good job of showing you how what you're learning fits into the big immuno picture, but the lectures themselves are very informative and for the most part, interesting. the class is really cool when you finally put everything together and get it",
    "Waking up Monday, Wednesday, Friday for a 9am senior year was struggles to the extreme. Lectures were hot and cold but if really want to get a good overview into how something nature took millions of years to evolve works, this course is great! Midterm and final were exceptionally easy, given the amount of material taught in this class.",
    "Classic immunology. Cool materials but not cohesively taught.",
    "It is a lot of work and a lot of memorization. That being said it has been the best MCDB course I have taken at Yale so if you are an MCDB looking for a >350 elective this is a pretty solid choice.",
    "Pretty standard MCDB class. There's a ton of material to learn and you just have to learn it. The major advantage of this class is that all of the lectures are recorded so you don't actually have to attend--I didn't attend a single lecture and I did fine.",
    "Very important course for any student interested in graduate or medical school. Learned more than I signed up for, to be honest, but it was an incredible ride. The majority of professors are amazing (ie Prof Schatz, Prof Kaech, Prof Rothlin) but some are lacking in clarity and depth of material. In any case, good course to Credit D if you are unsure of your standing in the class, as 50% of your peers are immunology graduate students quite invested in this field. Had a stellar TA and went to lectures for sheer enjoyment of the material.",
    "Content-wise: very interesting course. Course-wise: very disjointed due to the team-teach approach and lack of context and connections provided in lecture by many of the lecturers. Grade-wise: no clue what will happen. Class-wise: this course should not be in KBT 1214 because over half in attendance can't see the board and the material is only scribbled on a chalkboard and promptly erased so if you miss it, good luck. Not to mention the slow elevator. Honestly, if they changed the room and used powerpoints instead of scribbling on a chalkboard, the class would be so much better. And then maybe the lecturers could glance through a powerpoint and see what students have already been taught so the lecture isn't filled with comments along the lines of \"I don't know if you've had a lecture on x yet, or heard the term y yet, but anyways...\" All these negatives aside, this is easily some of the most interesting material I've covered in my MCDB career and you're not going to find a better selection of immuno lecturers for undergrads.",
    "This course is very difficult and doesn't have much continuity. It is a really great class, however. The review sessions were very helpful, as was the course packet.",
    "I would recommend this class on two conditions. One: have you taken cell bio? If you have, you are automatically better prepared to take this class. Two: do you have a lot of free time on your hands to memorize stuff? Because this class requires A LOT of memorization. Also the one and only midterm can make or break or break your grade, just a warning.",
    "MCDB 430 is one of the most integrative classes in the MCDB department, calling upon information gained from earlier classes from the major, and putting them into action in the explanation of one of the most interesting biological systems. I would suggest this to anybody interested in medicine or immunobiology in general. Having known very little about the functional mechanics, before this class, I am surprised at how much I learned and how fluent that information feels after taking this course. One of the coolest parts of the course was learning from professors who have made major strides in immunobiology, some of whom will likely be recognized in the near future for their contributions. Evaluations are pretty relaxed: 4 one-page responses, a midterm, and a final. There's also a fantastic outline provided for the class from which you will learn 95% of the information needed for the exams. If anyone is on the fence about taking this class, go ahead and take it! You'll thank yourself for doing so.",
    "Best survey course of immunology you'll take anywhere. It's the same course that is required of first year immunology graduate students at Yale. A lot of information, but they generally focus on key principles and not minute details in writing homework and exams.",
    "The class is very interesting and can be enjoyable, but I would HIGHLY recommend taking it Credit\/D. Otherwise, it is very stressful because there are only 2 exams that are both very difficult and it's easy to fall behind and not be able to appreciate the fact that you are hearing from real scientists who are frequently pioneers in the fields they are lecturing about. If I could do this semester over again, I would either take the class credit\/D OR just audit.",
    "Interesting but very difficult",
    "It's a great class. A lot of material, but definitely worth it if you put in the time.",
    "MCDB430 provides a solid overview of immunology, which I think is a crucial area for all science students (particularly those interested in medicine or biomedical research) to study. The course is taught by a rotating series of professors who give lectures on topics (typically) aligned with their area of research - most of them, especially David Schatz and Carla Rothlin, are very good. The problem sets (4 of them, each with 2 questions) and exams (1 midterm, 1 final, each one hour and consisting of true\/false, multiple choice, short answer, and an essay from each professor) are very fair and reasonable.",
    "MCDB 430 is a rigorous, interesting class that educates students on various topics related to immunology, including mechanism of immune response, diseases of the immune system, and current research regarding immunology. The class is team-taught, which I thought worked well because each professor was an expert in his\/her respective field. That said, with any class that is team taught, different teaching styles may be difficult to adjust to when they change so frequently. I think the class was ultimately successful and I learned a lot. Janeway is a great resource but I would focus most of my attention on the notes in the course packet, as it provides the most comprehensive and focused outlines on what should be known for the exams. A must take for anyone interested in how your body prepares itself against infection!",
    "I would highly recommend. This class is well taught, and the diversity of professors makes the course even more amazing. Each professor comes in with their expertise, and all of them showed the enthusiasm with teaching their portion of the course. Grading and exams were fair - it's a lot of material, but I believe it was fairly tested.",
    "A wonderful course - the immune system is incredibly fascinating, and the professors are at the top of the field.",
    "Not a lot of work on a regular basis, but there's a lot of material in each lecture and it can get overwhelming to catch up. Overall, it was a good course for understanding the field of immunology, which is still a relatively new field and therefore hard to get exposed to in depth in lower level biology courses."
