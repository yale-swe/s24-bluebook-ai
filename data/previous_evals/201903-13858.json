    "equilibria of games, preference ranking, auction\/mechanism design, a bit of the prof's research area, and an exploration of bitcoin",
    "I learned a lot of interesting content on auction theory and thought it was extremely cool that we were able to learn about Professor Cai's research area first-hand. It was neat to be able to apply mathematical theory behind a lot of intuitive concepts as well.",
    "Learned about a lot of topics in game theory, mechanism design, etc.",
    "Nash equilibria, mechanism design, auctions, voting, etc. A lot of cool economic concepts viewed from a computational\/analytical standpoint",
    "I learned the basics of online learning algorithms, auctions, and game theory. There was lots of emphasis on proof-based algorithms and math.",
    "I learned about mechanism design, auctions, and several other economics \/ computation topics at a very theoretical level."

   "comments": [
    "only 3 psets and a final - psets are very long and challenging (20+ hours), though fairly interesting problems to think through. material is very interesting, though keep in mind the focus of the course is fairly theoretical",
    "I enjoyed a lot about the course, and particularly enjoyed the organized lectures and notes that were provided. I learned most going to class, and felt that the problem sets were very challenging and had a fun time working through those.",
    "Class was well taught and class notes were very good as well. Lecture tended to go fast.",
    "The class content is quite niche and so it is hard to find online resources covering the content. However, the content was very interesting despite being quite difficult",
    "Strengths: professor is decently engaging and clearly knows his shit. Weaknesses: definitely way harder than advertised, moves way quicker than I think most CS or Econ majors can reasonably follow, and is less focused on real-world applications than expected.",
    "Honestly, this is a very hard class and it would be easier to learn if it we covered slightly less material and spent more time on each subject. It would be helpful if we reviewed concepts as we learned them because the concepts themselves were pretty complicated and built on earlier concepts. Also, if Professor Yang explained the notation a little bit more clearly, that would have been really helpful.",
    "The course was much more theory heavy than I had expected. Don't expect a lot of hand holding because there won't be any. It seems like this class is adapted from a McGill class Yang Cai previously taught, though that class had a few practical examples of auctions that were successfully implemented. This class had almost zero real world examples - all math. For a class that's a required part of a joint major, I think it should tack a little more toward the application side."

   "comments": [
    "This course gets pretty difficult right from the get go. I would probably have some more game theory and econ experience under my belt before taking.",
    "Yes. This class is very hard conceptually and the problem sets definitely required a deep understanding of the material, but I really enjoyed being able to synthesize all the material and piece it all together while working on problem sets. The concepts are intuitive and have a lot of real-world applications I never thought of. Really cool how much auction theory appears in our everyday lives.",
    "Recommend if you are very comfortable with math\/proofs and are looking for a challenge.",
    "I would recommend this course to someone who is interested in (or thinks they may be interested in) auctions, mechanism design, revenue maximization, etc",
    "No, I think it was too difficult for the level.",
    "Yes, but only if you are either up for a huge challenge or have experience with proof-based math at Yale. The class is less work than a typical CS class but it is much more challenging (but also very interesting). The students in the class are among the smartest students doing Computer Science at Yale. Half the class is phd or grad students. Honestly, I think this is the hardest class conceptually that I have ever taken at Yale, and I do think that I became somewhat smarter as a result but it was very difficult. Also, if you do choose to take this class, please start the psets at least two weeks early and please spend lots of time reviewing for the final exam.",
    "If you are interested in auctions, matching, and other mechanism design problems and also plan to do research in theoretical CS, then go for it. Otherwise, the class is probably not worth the large amount of time expended, and you will not gain as much practical knowledge as you had hoped."
