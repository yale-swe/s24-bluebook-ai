    "This is a good class for someone with a little background in analytic philosophy, although if you have no such background, take Philosophy of Language or a similar course first. It would be a more fulfilling second or third such class. A difficult transition for someone with more experience in the continental tradition, but it was nevertheless rewarding and informative.",
    "This is a good course for learning about current trends in philosophy of mind, and also for understanding the proper methods of philosophic argumentation more generally. The course itself does not offer much in the way of feedback, and the grade is dependent upon a midterm, final, and final paper. The readings are interesting as are lectures, though the later tend to last for quite a while.",
    "Prof. Bealer is one of the smartest professors I've ever had, and one of the more careful and open thinkers. In that sense, he's an inspiring teacher. In some more practical senses, his teaching could improve substantially. We only got through about half of the syllabus, partially because every lecture Prof. Bealer insisted on repeating virtually everything he had said in the last three lectures, including drawing the same diagrams on the board. He also does a poor job of giving students a sense of the overall philosophical landscape; his interest is in primarily presenting the arguments he thinks most important to refute, and then refuting them using his own arguments. in this sense, the class is quite partisan: Prof. Bealer has an agenda (anti-materialism), and he's trying to validate it. This is fine, I suppose, but it gets a bit strange when he puts questions on the exams that try to get you to repeat his own views.the exams were also fairly poorly organized. We had a ridiculously long take-home midterm, 55 questions, which required four outside-of-class review sessions during which Prof. Bealer would tell us the answers, which we then had to rephrase in our own words. Prof. Bealer did an admirably careful job grading these exams, but we didn't get them back until after the final exam period had officially ended, giving us very little time to make the revisions he promised us. we also had a similarly structured take-home final, which served to replace an in-class final which Prof. Bealer cancelled. He also cancelled the in-class midterm.All of that said, I am really glad to have taken this class, simply for the opportunity to get to know Prof. Bealer. he has a sense of what philosophy is and why it is important that few professional philosophers share, and it was a pleasure to be exposed to his way of thinking.",
    "Thorough and interesting study of the Philosophy of Mind, with a unique, brilliant, and pretty eccentric professor. It can get slow at times, and Bealer is not the most organized, but worth it I think if you're interested in the topic."
