   "comments": [
    "It's great. Lots of time but enjoyable if you want it to be.",
    "This course is TIIME CONSUMING, especially if you take the required 35 rolls of film (I took it Credit\/D so I didn't and it was okay). It's really fun though and you learn a lot and will become friends with the people in your class. Being in the darkroom is great, but if you want to get good prints you'll have to take a ton of pictures and then print a ton. I liked being able to go chill out in the darkroom, but it took forever and was stressful before crits. If you have the time, take it.",
    "Intro Photo teaches you about the black and white film process from shooting and composing to developing and displaying. The professor's and the other students' feedback help you improve over the course of the semester, and by the end, you feel much better about understanding your own style in photography and art. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to try something new, learn a process, or learn about making and critiquing art.",
    "Yes absolutely take it. Great into into photography and Lisa is fantastic. It's a good bit of work, but manageable and the work is a fun change from papers and exams",
    "Definitely worth it! A few caveats: try to take only four classes for the semester, and be prepared to shell out money for a camera, paper, film, and the lab fee. You WILL need to spend a lot of time in the darkroom both developing film and making prints.",
    "Intro Photo is quite time consuming -- I would spend an average of 12 hours a week working in the dark room every week. It is completely worth the time if you like photo, though. I would DEFINITELY recommend taking this class if you think you'd like it.",
    "Take the class if you are willing to put in the time, otherwise you are just short-changing yourself. Take all 35 rolls of film, go to the darkroom every (other) day. The results will definitely pay off."
