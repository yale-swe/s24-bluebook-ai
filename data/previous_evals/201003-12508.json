    "If you're interested in it, take it. It's in B-20 in the film center which is depressing especially when it starts getting dark so early, and believe me, this plays a role. The movies are good but I got bored with them after awhile.",
    "Worthwhile only if the student has a strong interest in film studies and is willing to attend all of the screenings. These films are certainly enjoyable and incredibly relevant to the development of film language, but may not gel with the expectations of a casual filmgoer."
