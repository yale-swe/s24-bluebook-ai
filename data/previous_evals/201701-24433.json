   "comments": [
    "I learned to compare different literary styles and to analyze a novel",
    "They really taught us to \"read against the grain,\" so to speak, giving us the tools to be confident as a reader.",
    "Gained an amazing introduction to the French cannon. Count me gratefulI'll carry the lessons of these wonderful novels always.",
    "Good overview of French literature since the French revolution. Great course to work on literary analysis and to see larger literary trends. Also helped me understand some of the considerations surrounding translation",
    "Learned a lot about the french literary cannon and greatly improved my confidence in my analytical writing skills.",
    "Writing papers with a strong thesis, analyzing literature, comparing novels.",
    "I really developed a critical and deep understanding of the claim that novels are situated in history and one could not write a Balzacian novel today. I also understood the relation of literary movements to each other, and of novels to the creeds (philosophical declarations) of these movements. I also gained more insight into approaching novels which seemed inscrutable or difficult, largely because of understanding their relation to history and what came before. I also took away the value of a pastiche and trying others' writing styles as a way to understand them deeper and find yourself more deeply.",
    "I learned to analyze literature historically and in context and to more deftly analyze style as central to writing",
    "Great exposure to French canons and modern novels. The lectures are amazing.",
    "I definitely got a good overview of the French canon, and I certainly think my writing improved. It was a great literature class to take as a lecture.",
    "I gained exposure to a variety of French novels that I'd never read before as well as a deeper appreciation for the historical context and how history and other authors influenced these French writers something I hadn't known much about before the course. I also gained some practice with literary analysis through the essays and feedback.",
    "I definitely gained a new appreciation for many of the movements influential to modern literature as well as the opportunity to read many excellent novels. I had heard of many of these authors and texts in previous French classes, but now I finally got around to actually reading them. Beyond that, this course definitely allowed me to improve on my writing and, beyond that, my ability to analyze literature.",
    "French canon, intellectual and literary movements",
    "This course was a delightful survey of major french novelists and the literary history and context of France in the 19th and 20th centuries. Many of these books would have been inaccessible or at least daunting on their own, and reading them in this course was greatly helpful.",
    "Great French class!",
    "I learned broadly about how French literature evolved over the 19th and 20th centuries, about some specific authors, and about particular works of literature.",
    "This course covers the greatest French novels from the 19th and 20th century. This will give you incredible insight into French literature, and its evolution throughout these two centuries.",
    "I learned a lot about the French novel traditions, which seems at first very applicable in only specific situations. The novels and their messages however were very relevant to current events and aspects of modern life. The discussions about the development of the novel and the way novelists play off of each other were fascinating in a modern context. The comparisons were interesting and made me think about their modern context."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Novels are not very enjoyable except Old Goriot and the Lover.",
    "It's a lot of reading and to be honest I didn't ever get a chance to do all of it - I feel like a summer reading list may have been helpful for some of the slower readers in the class.",
    "Strengths: amazing reading list (really, what could be changed?); amazing professors; an amazing TF in Vanessa Gubbins; and an all-around good time Weakness: the WR assignments were a bit tough. 5 pages to compare and contrast two of the most important novels in world literature?!? Having more space would have been nice. Also, I don't exactly understand why we had a draft due for the second essay but not the first? Having the comments, and time, on the first would have been more useful than on the second. Also, I sorta would object to having prompts at all (or, at a minimum, no prompts on the third essay). Most English classes I've taken at Yale don't have prompts, which can be tricky at first but allows for lots of freedom, which is awesome.",
    "Great reading list, really coherent arc to the semester. All the lectures were very thought-out and interesting. The TAs seemed like they were all really great as well.",
    "Strengths are the unique and engaging professorial style. Weaknesses is perhaps the amount of reading required, but it is a literature course after all. I feel i would've enjoyed the class more had we been asked to read at a more reasonable pace.",
    "Profs. Kaplan and Samuels, as well as my TF, did a really excellent job of explaining the context of each novel and leading the class (through lecture or discussion) to formulate its own opinions of the themes.",
    "Great lectures, though I wish they focused more on the text and less on history of literature. Co-teaching aspect was cool",
    "I thought the strengths were the lectures which were amazing and the weaknesses were the quality of discussion in section",
    "The class is structured well.",
    "The lecture and section complement each other well and are very well run. I think the class may benefit from more interaction in lecture. The only change I would really want to see is a more diverse syllabus.",
    "I thought this was a wonderful class overall. Professor Samuels' and Professor Kaplan's lectures were always very engaging and thought-provoking, and I enjoyed learning the historical context of these novels and the biographies of their authors, something I hadn't had much opportunity for reading some of the books in high school. If anything, I would have perhaps liked hearing more about the content of the novels during lecture and looking closely at more passages; some of the lectures were very history\/biography focused, which was interesting, but I would have liked to hear some interpretations of the text.",
    "The reading list of this course is excellent with hardly any exceptions, and the lectures given in this course were excellent, truly without any exceptions. The professors are both very knowledgeable and skilled at presenting their arguments on the many texts. I do sometimes wish that a bit more time were reserved at the end of each class for the other professor to comment on the lecture, although I understand that time is short.",
    "Strong on all fronts!",
    "I really appreciated the ability to see how the novel in France evolved over the decades and in response to sociopolitical and literary pressures. I think more time for Proust would have been better, even just reading-wise, because he is so dense. 5-7 pages for a comparative essay also felt extremely restrictive. In order to address both texts, I felt I had to make my analysis somewhat surface level.",
    "Professor Kaplan and Professor Samuels are great lecturers with great ideas. That being said, I found it slightly odd that they were just reading from pre-written lectures, and that the Q & A was also scripted. I don't mean to be too harsh, but Samuels' accent when reading quotations was dubious to say the least. For such a distinguished figure in the field of French literature, I would at least expect him to sound like he really spoke it. It contributed to a slight loss in credibility.",
    "I took the class in French, and it moved at an absurdly fast pace that rivaled DS...but all readings were in French. It made it hard to keep up and appreciate the great works we had the chance to read and learn about. That being said, the amount that we read was also a strength. It was a fantastic experience to move through the progression of the modern French novel and see how it developed and how the different authors engaged with one another. I really love the idea of Profs Samuels and Kaplan engaging with each other in QandA at the end of each lecture. Keep it up!",
    "I really liked the coteaching aspect and the mini-discussions at the end of class, as well as the integration of French current events and the lives of the authors and their respective literary movements into the lectures. Very interesting and varied books, which was nice. Three suggestions. Firstly, it would be useful to make the lecture slides more comprehensive. Oftentimes, quotes (not from the books) would be read and it would be very useful to have them up on the screen. Essentially just putting more of what is said on the slides. Secondly, I would appreciate additional commentary on alternate interpretations of the texts, with which the professors do not necessarily agree. Thirdly, I really did not enjoy having to write comparison essays for the first two papers, especially given the quite short time limit. It would be nice to have at least one prompt per each essay that allows for analysis of a single text, allowing for closer reading (as was desired I believe on the final essay).",
    "The lectures are very well paced - we never get too much reading (except for the first book which was the longest). I liked how Professor Kaplan and Professor Samuels divided up the canon into two centuries and took care of one each.",
    "The most unique, and wonderful, part about this course is the way Professor Kaplan and Professor Samuels interact with each other. Their ten minute discussions at the end of every lecture are not only entertaining, but also sometimes the most informative part of lecture. They really help put the information in context and connect different points. One of the weakness that they note and discuss frequently, is that often not enough time can be devoted to each novel, and sometimes we don't have the time to read the novel in full."

   "comments": [
    "Read one of the novels in this class before taking the class. I would recommend Old Goriot or the Plague. Take this course if you enjoy that novel.",
    "I absolutely loved this class. Even as a more STEM-minded student, I found it enthralling and super entertaining.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. Amazing professors, incredible lectures, brilliant TFs, and a reading list so exceptional in its quality that you'd be remiss to skip out. The syllabus is a list of books everyone says you need to read but, more than likely, you've never actually read. Here's your chance to be walked through them by two absolutely brilliant professors. Like any literature class, reading load can be heavy (~12 books over the semester). You don't need to read every single one, but you'll have to read most, probably 9 or 10. But don't let the workload deter you. You'll want to read them. Really. Most read easily, too, and make for a great pre-bed ritual. In short, TAKE TAKE TAKE",
    "This class offers a sweeping look at French literature since the French revolution, beginning in realism before bounding forward through modernism, surrealism, structuralism, post-structuralism, etc. I took the WR section and it wasn't too much work: read the books and write three 4-5pp papers. Professor Kaplan and Professor Samuels are great lecturers and have a hilarious shared dynamic.",
    "I would! It's a relatively painless WR credit. But you should definitely do the reading to get the most out of it. My ability to keep up with the readings certainly flagged by the end of the semester, which was greatly detrimental to my learning experience.",
    "DEFINITELY take this class!!! Professor Kaplan and Professor Samuels are both SO wonderful, and the class is very engaging. If you like reading at ALL you will love it. Every lecture was interesting, and both professors make the class very fun to be in as well.",
    "This was among the best classes I've ever taken at Yale. Lecture is incredible, and the novels are manageable and you haven't read most of them before but will immediately understand their relevance to your understanding of history and the world.",
    "Yes! It's a fantastic introduction to modern French literature, which is important on a global scale as well, and it's superbly well-taught.",
    "Fantastic class with great professors. You'll read some of greatest novels of all time.",
    "This is an amazing class. Professor Kaplan and samuels have such clear passion for what they teach and have amazing rapport. The lectures were always engaging and thoughtfully formed and were amazing to give insight to people who have studied a lot or no literature. An amazing survey class.",
    "Definitely. Especially for people who would otherwise not have read these books.",
    "Yes",
    "Absolutely!! This class was very interesting and informative. The professors are wonderfully passionate and knowledgeable about the texts.",
    "I'd definitely recommend this class, basically to anyone who loves novels! Professor Kaplan and Professor Samuels are really nice and have really interesting, engaging lectures. I enjoyed reading (almost) all of the novels and being introduced to some authors I'd never heard of before. If you need a WR credit, the writing workload isn't so bad, and you get a lot of feedback\/advice from your TA on ways to improve your writing.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student, regardless of whether they have any significant background in French literature. As with other literature classes, I would recommend taking this course WR for the privilege of writing papers rather than having to take exams. The reading is at times a bit long but always worthwhile, as the novels are truly some of the best.",
    "Absolutely! One of the best classes I've taken at stake for sure.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course if you are interested in big French names like Proust or Camus but, like me, are intimidated to tackle them on your own! The course provides close reading\/analysis as well as historical and literary context, which I found both helpful and engaging.",
    "I would recommend this class, simply because the syllabus is wonderful. I found it harder to appreciate some of the 20th century novels, but the trajectory of the syllabus reflects the Modern French novel fairly well, I think. Professors Samuels and Kaplan are both wonderful lecturers. I was in the French section, which was led by a very good TA, but I think if you want a class that will keep up your spoken French, this is not the right one. My writing and reading improved, but my spoken French declined simply because a 50 minute section a week was not enough.",
    "Good French class; lots of reading; opportunity to get lots out of it if you do the reading.",
    "Take if you're looking for a chill, interesting introduction to French literature and\/or a very manageable writing credit. Interesting lectures, interesting novels, a solid course.",
    "If you are interested in French literature (even if you know nothing about France or literature) take it ! It's a wonderful course for the soul and you will remember the books you'll read in this course your whole life !",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. It leaves you curious for more about French novels and culture. It is dynamic; the pace never allows you to get bored and lets you constantly be shocked by the next novel. The course readings are for the most part very engaging and fun to read despite the fast schedule. With the right pace, the readings are easy to stay on top of, and definitely easy to talk about in section.",
    "Yes, these texts are necessary to read for French majors or Literature lovers in general."
