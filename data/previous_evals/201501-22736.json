    "Yes, I would.",
    "Considering the development and dynamics of current Post-Soviet protest movements with an emphasis on the avant-garde in 20th century Russia, using film, literature, visual and performance art, and web media.",
    "Absolutely take this class, if you can. It's one of the best I've taken at Yale, and although I am a Russian studies major, you absolutely don't need to be to get the most out of it. It offers a really amazing multi-disciplinary approach to understanding the contemporary Russian state and forms of protest, ranging from visual art to literature to film -- and Marijeta's a joy.",
    "Although class discussion was a little difficult given the size of the seminar this year (about 20 people total), the interest and energy of the students -- as well as the number of them in the first place -- was a testament to how awesome this class is. Take this course regardless of your background or interests. You'll leave with a cool niche knowledge and a new perspective on one of the most important countries, geopolitically.",
    "Amazing course with an eclectic syllabustake it, Marijeta is the best!",
    "If you are considering taking this class, you should do so. Prof. Bozovic is excellent, the material could not be any more relevant, and the opportunity to look at primary source documents without an established critical reading is a rewarding opportunity anywhere in the humanities.",
    "DO TAKE THE CLASS IF YOU GET IN. It was amazing, and has something to interest everyone, even if they know nothing about Russia.",
    "An amazing course about contemporary Russia after the fall of the Soviet Union and the various manifestation of protest culture. Half of our classes were held in YUAG, which was so exciting and unique for a class, and we really got to discover artwork hidden away in the gallery and compare them to our Russian stories. We both read books and watched films, which made the work really well balanced. In spite of it being a pretty large seminar (maybe 40 people showed up on the first day!), we formed a fun and tight-knit community. Take this course -- Marijeta is great and always supportive and helpful as a professor too!",
    "Absolutely take this class! If you're interested in contemporary Russia, you owe it to yourself to learn about the political and cultural environment that gave rise to Vladimir Putin's presidency. Professor Bozovic studies this for a living, and she is incredibly passionate about the work done in this class. The workload is completely manageable (usually a book or a film per week with a companion reading response) and then 2 papers during the semester and a final paper. The class met in YUAG and HGS, so you will be able to see some amazing Soviet and contemporary art.",
    "Really cool class; kind of a hodge-podge of what the professor is interested in, but overall a very valuable run-through of contemporary Russian culture, with history, politics, and everything else mixed in. You get to watch some odd and fascinating films, read interesting books, and look at cool art at the gallery. Overall, thumbs up."
