    "I would definitely recommend ENGL 127 to another student who is interested in English.",
    "A great course. Fair amount of work and reading, so long as you make sure to read a little every night. Discussions were interesting and the selection was great.",
    "The texts read in this course are important, and I think all readers should read them. I recommend this course to every English-speaking person with eyes and a heart to read.",
    "The class was very similar to my high school English class, with a major focus on close reading. As a first semester freshman, I cannot say how it compares to other english classes at Yale. But in general the readings were diverse and captivating. How good the class is depends on both the professor and section. Each one is different.",
    "Yes I would recommend ENGL 127 to another student. I thought the class was a manageable load for incoming freshman students, but it also provided a strong instruction in many invaluable pieces of American literature.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student either from the US or an international student since I do think that it gives a good sense of American literature as a whole. It was challenging but not overwhelming.",
    "It's a good class. I didn't love all the readings but that's personal preference. Overall, I'd recommend it.",
    "If you are prepared to do a lot of reading and usually enjoy English classes, then you should take this course. There were weekly reading responses that you had to post by 5pm the day before, and this got a little annoying, especially because you had to fly through the readings to keep up. There were two shorter papers (4-6 pages) and one final paper (8 pages). Come to class each day ready to participate in discussions as it accounts for 20% of your grade!",
    "Recommended to students who want to explore diverse works from American classics to contemporary works."
