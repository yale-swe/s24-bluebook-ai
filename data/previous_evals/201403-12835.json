    "It's a brutal workload, but that's just French here. You learn it well and Skorupa will catch you up if you are coming in behind from previous knowledge of French. Taking French at Yale, be prepared for mountains upon mountains of homework. If you take it, Skorupa is fantastic. Grading is harsh, but she makes you learn.",
    "I would definitely recommend FREN 121 to any student. The immersion course is simply the right way to learn French, you are going to learn so much during this course. Your speaking, writing, and grammar will all improve during this one semester. Of course, this course is challenging, and there is a lot of work involved. French grammar is never easy to learn, and especially when you must learn all of the tenses.",
    "A great class that really brings your French from beginning to intermediate. I went in knowing just the present tense and now I know like 8, all the way through the subjunctive. If possible, take it with Mme. Skorupa!!!!!! She's the best teacher I've ever had at Yale. She's so understanding and loving and will support you through it all. Walking in everyday put a smile on my face. Our whole class became really close too. It's a ton of work, so don't take it unless you're ready for at least 30 mins of hw a night, and usually more than that. But, you get out what you put in and I am completely happy I put in the work!!",
    "Fren 121 is an excellent course. While the course load can be demanding, it's a rewarding course - your French will improve greatly throughout the semester.",
