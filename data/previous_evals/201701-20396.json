   "comments": [
    "I learned basic laboratory techniques that will aid in future laboratory work.",
    "Some basic things loosely related to Organic Chemistry I, and some very fundamental techniques in experimentation for organic chemistry.",
    "I gained a lot of laboratory skills that I did not have before",
    "I learned a lot of different techniques that seemed difficult of complicated at first, but by the end of the semester, felt very natural and easy to use.",
    "I learned basic organic chemistry laboratory techniques and was introduced to and guided through the process of writing a report.",
    "Comfort in working in lab environment, conducting organic synthesis and other reactions and using a variety of analytic techniques",
    "I learned many different bench techniques that were crucial in conducting synthesis experiments.",
    "As a result of this course, I feel far more comfortable in the lab than ever before. I also have a better idea of what must be done to prepare for any experiment: the special qualities of each reagent must be known, the characteristics of each apparatus must be well understood, and familiarity with the procedure must be attained before performing any work. In addition to these insights, I have learned various new lab techniques, such as IR and TLC. I am not sure how often I'll use these specific techniques in my future career, but the practice of learning a technique and applying it to lab work will most certainly come up again.",
    "I think it was very useful to me to see organic chemistry concepts in practice. The organic chemistry lectures are very theoretical and molecular - you have to predict how molecules will react under different conditions. But the lab was much more \"macro\" in that you were mixing quantifiable amounts of reagents in the hope that you would produce a good yield. Ultimately, it was very nice to see the practical side of organic chemistry.",
    "I learned basic organic chemistry lab skills as well as how to approach issues in lab as a scientist.",
    "General Organic Lab skills",
    "I gained a lot of experience with working with organic lab equipment.",
    "How to perform chemical procedures related to to organic chemistry."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: I think this course has really improved by teaching students chemistry skills more concisely than it did in previous semesters based on what I've heard. Weaknesses: the grading is very nitpicky and the work is somewhat tedious, rather than testing understanding etc. But overall way better than gen chem labs!",
    "Strengths: Learned some very fundamental things about how to do organic chemistry experiments, which were definitely very relevant and important. Weaknesses: Very boring...",
    "Could do more about answering the exam study questions and making sure everyone knows those answers",
    "One improvement i would suggest is that it should follow a bit more closely to the lecture course that most of us are taking at the same time. For example, it might be nice to do some of the reactions that we learned that week in class in lab, as well.",
    "The course is a very appropriate amount of work, and the work we do is purposeful (not superfluous\/busy work). I did not feel the terrifying time-crunch that I did in general chemistry lab. The course manual is informative and helpful, as well as the supplementary materials we were directed to occasionally for more information (you tube videos, textbook). It would be helpful to have a more detailed rubric for lab reports, because it seemed to me that there were often questions about why a certain number of points were deducted for a given aspect of a report.",
    "Good overall",
    "This was a great course. Every week was based off the bench techniques of the previous week, so it was great to continue practicing those to prepare for synthesis experiments at the end of the semester. One weakness though is the grading of the post lab assignments. You will get hammered for seemingly trivial things. Study the format, and answer questions in detail.",
    "Strengths: - Very engaging - Does a great job of helping students apply theoretical concepts in a practical, hands-on manner - Made sure students understood whatever work they were doing - Allows students to learn from their mistakes in a non-judgmental, instructive atmosphere - Great feedback on work - Very open, free space Weaknesses: - Can't really think of any; it was a marvelous course.",
    "I thought that the course was graded quite harshly and I sometimes got points off for reasons not particularly related to organic chemistry. For example, I got points taken off for having one word's font be one point size larger than the rest of the text. That was very frustrating, when I had walked into the course expecting the grading to be more related to how I performed in the lab, not to how correct my formatting was on reports. I understand that being a clear and consistent communicator is important, but I felt that points were taken off on minute details.",
    "The class is very well organized and expectations are clearly stated at the beginning.",
    "Overall, this was a strong course. My only complaint was that it did not line up with the lecture course as general chem lab had. As a result, we often were performing reactions that we had not yet learned but were assumed to know.",
    "One strength of the course is that Dr. Dimeglio is extremely nice and highly approachable for questions. One weakness is that the course packet is not 100% up to date with the labs being performed, which can be confusing.",
    "Very organized and straightforward.",
    "I thought this class was very strong. I was the best lab I have taken and it helped to teach me a lot of techniques with out being overwhelming or boring."

    "It's practical if you want to go into laboratory research and necessary for various majors\/premed but I wouldn't recommend taking it for fun. Chemistry lecture gives you a much better understanding of chemistry.",
    "Um, don't take unless you have to, but Dr. DiMeglio makes it about as good as she can. She really is fantastic. It's just, a really boring class...",
    "Yes, I think it teaches a lot of vital organic lab skills.",
    "This class is a lot better than Gen Chem lab. Don't despair.",
    "Yes, a good introductory lab course",
    "Yes! This is a MUCH better lab than any of the Gen Chem ones. It actually feels like you're putting in the work for a 0.5 credit course, not a 1 credit course. The expectations are clear, and the workload is manageable.",
    "I would recommend taking this. So much better than general chemistry lab. The lab are also entertaining and there's only 3 lab reports.",
    "This course is a marvelous way to further improve one's lab skills after taking general chemistry lab. It gets one further invested in the world of lab work and, although it is not \"true,\" independent work yet, it helps the student get closer to the stage of doing such work.",
    "This course is definitely good to take with organic chemistry, as you get a much more realistic application of all of those mechanisms you draw out.",
    "Yes! Ochem lab is much better than gen-chem lab.",
    "I gained a lot of skills working with equipment in the lab that are not pipettes. If this is what you want, you should take this course!",
    "Most people taking this will have to do so because of pre-med or major requirements. Overall I'd recommend it."
