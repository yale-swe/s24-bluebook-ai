    "Really interesting subject and really manageable workload. Prof. Conekin is great, too. The discussions are fun and never feel forced or artificial.",
    "I would recommend the course. Professor Conekin is an incredibly engaging, devoted professor and the material is quite fascinating. The course essentially pulls together a number of cultural phenomena of the twentieth century--working class jewish establishments, early bar culture, the rise of consumerism, post-WW2 reconstruction of London, mod culture, and post-colonial race relations--and places them in conversation in a really neat way. I think its socio-cultural emphasis is a really great complement to the history departments' other more \"bread and butter\" British history courses.",
    "If you are interested in minority or marginal communities within London society. However, like the title and syllabus state this course is not meant to cover all topics within the time period."
