    "It's hard squeezing all of the course material into a two-day workshop. It would be great if it were a small portion of a larger forest measurements and modeling course.",
    "Strengths: good thing to get exposed to Weaknesses: not very much time to actually engage with material",
    "This workshop was a GREAT improvement from the course that was taught last year, and gave us some technical understanding of using growth and yield in forest management activities. Yet, it didn't really dive deep into the practical use of the software. If the same content, and the same instructor, were to teach a semester long course with more technical, computer lab time, the class would be just what students need."
