   "comments": [
    "Some of the lessons felt a little repetitive and I could have used more background on a few methods before the ethical discussions.",
    "The course was composed of a majority PhD students which made it hard to follow as an undergraduate student. I was definitely challenged.",
    "Strengths: discussions, feedback, and office hours are all very in-depth and helpful. Morgan and Professor Nugent are both amazing--two of the best I have had at Yale!! It might have been helpful to spend a little more time on how to apply mixed methods techniques, as opposed to focusing on the theory, but there was so much critical information packed into one term."
