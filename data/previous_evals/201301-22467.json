    "Math 300 covers a lot of really interesting and fundamental material, but the quality of this course largely depends on the professor. I found Fresen to be a rather frustrating and confusing professor, so I didn't have the best experience. Hopefully he will be better if teaching the course again. It's less intense than 301 and it's a spring course so take it if it fits in your schedule. Ultimately, I enjoyed the material we covered and will need it for future classes as well. I'm glad I took it, but could have had a better time with another professor.",
    "Take Math 300 if you have any interest in analysis at all. It is a wonderful introduction to this diverse subject.",
    "This is a great class. This class is great for anyone with limited experience in analysis (and a small amount of experience in proof-writing) who wishes to learn more. (Apparently, however, the class can vary significantly from one year to the next. With Fresen, the workload isn't bad, the tests are straightforward, and the lectures are great.)",
    "It's not unreasonably difficult. There were only five problem sets and two exams, and Fresen makes pretty clear what to expect on them. Fresen's a good lecturer, but can be kind of strict in his grading. Don't let that deter you from exposing yourself to this material, though.",
    "Definitely take MATH 300 with Prof. Fresen! It's a great introduction to the modern rigorous treatment of number systems, sequences and limits, functions and continuity, and topology. Probably the main ideas of the class are the Bolzano-Weierstrauss Theorem, the Banach Fixed Point Theorem, the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, and equivalence of compactness and sequential compactness in metric spaces. The class started really slowly, but then picked up to a reasonable pace. Prof. Fresen is a good, clear teacher.",
    "If you need it for your major, well, good luck. Otherwise, it'd be an OK class to credit\/D\/F.",
    "Do not take this class unless you need it for your major. That being said if you do need it for your major Professor Fresen teaches it quite well. In general, the class is hard and fast-paced, so stay on top of the work and plan ahead when doing problem sets. I strongly advise that anyone considering taking this class takes MATH 250 first.",
    "Really only take this if you have to. There are, and will always be, a few students who are in the class just to bust the curve and get an A when they could've taken 301. As an applied math major, I took this CrDF, but it still required some work.",
    "Definitely take this at some point. Math 300 introduces you to a different kind of math, focused on why theorems are true rather than how to apply them. It really improved my critical thinking skills, and the material is surprisingly interesting.",
    "Take this class! This is as easy, painless, and fun as analysis gets. There may be a learning curve to the whole \"prove everything\" mindset, and you may be intimidated by the definitions that include lots and lots of symbols and letters, but stick with it and it will be rewarding.",
    "Math 300 with Fresen is really, really awesome. If he's teaching it again, definitely take it. Most of the people in the class were taking it after Math 250, which was harder than Math 300, and prepared us very well. However there seemed to be a few people who didn't take 250 and were fine (this might annoy you if you went through 250 first, but whatcha gonna do). This semester's class was a very strong overview of real analysis, definitely covering all the topics in 301 and probably in a more clear and structured way than Jones. Fresen is extremely clear and a great new young professor. The exams are rather long and you don't have much time so be prepared to write quickly.",
    "Yes, definitely. The first 2\/3 of the course are more interesting (to me) than the latter 1\/3 but it's a very interesting first look at higher mathematics. Professor Fresen was a very good teacher and incredibly helpful with uploading notes, resources, etc., and that definitely made for a more positive experience> Idon't think I did particularly well, but I am still glad that i took this course.",
    "Yes.",
    "Yes",
    "I would highly recommend this course to anyone looking to gain an excellent understanding and overview of mathematical analysis. Professor Fresen does an excellent job communicating the material and the course is quite reasonable and fun. Overall, I recommend this course and think this a great way for non-math majors to be exposed to analysis.",
    "I would not recommend this class with Daniel Fresen; it was very disorganized and confusing. You probably have to take this class anyways, but if you can, try to take it with somebody else.",
    "MATH300 is a difficult class but you learn so much from it. You learn to appreciate the beauty of mathematics and feel adequately prepared to tackle harder classes in analysis. It was my favorite classes this semester and I am so glad I took it. The material is explained extremely thoroughly and clearly and some truly remarkable results are derived. The problem sets are challenging and informative without being overbearing and the tests are very reasonable. Grading is slightly harsh but Professor Fresen applies the same standard to everyone so, in the end, it makes no difference. If you work hard, you will get a good grade."
