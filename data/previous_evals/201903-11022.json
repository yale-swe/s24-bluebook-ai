    "I would have liked to stick to more of a syllabus schedule, as it was not always clear when tests and assignments were occurring.",

In retrospect, I do think that I would have benefitted more from taking the online summer program in French, so that I could have dedicated more attention and effort to the class. That being said, I did learn a lot and the professor was excellent.",
