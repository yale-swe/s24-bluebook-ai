   "comments": [
    "This is a good course for students looking to improve grammar and start studying interesting texts and films. Candace Skorupa is a great professor, she's into the material and wants each of her students to do well.",
    "This class is boring and your french does not improve. Try to take another class, or perhaps with another teacher. Mme Skorupa is a really sweet and nice person but your french will not improve and the classes will be painful to sit through.",
    "L5 French course with an emphasis on discussion, but lots of readings to direct the class. The readings are pretty varied, some more interesting than others, but I was never out-of-my-mind bored with anything we were studying. Some of the films were just totally bizarre and seemed pointless.... but they're French, so what do you expect.",
    "Good class although it is not as well structures as the L1 or L2 courses. what you get out of the class is very much dependent on your teacher.",
    "FREN 150 is an excellent course for improving your reading and writing skills. However, the amount of work far outweighs the progress you will make, and the course probably will not drastically improve your speaking skills."
