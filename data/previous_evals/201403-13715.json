   "comments": [
    "THe reading was a bit heavy handed but I loved the book so most of the time I didn't mind.",
    "I found the work load appropriate for this course.",
    "I think some of the readings were so long that it was hard to get through all of it in time for class, and there were so many different theaters to read about for each class period that we simply didn't have enough time to talk about all of them. It might be interesting to have groups read about different theaters and then lead discussions about them in small groups to help everyone get a chance to delve into something in more depth.",
    "The workload for this course was extremely manageable, with a fair amount of readings and assignments that took time and thought to complete. Loved the integration of reading and video.",
    "This course has a significant reading load each week given that the professional nature of the curriculum at YSD is not conducive to focused reading time. However, barring a couple weeks with an unusually high number of pages, it was a pleasure to make time for the reading. The presentation work in this course allowed students to manage their time in arcs longer than a single week, a gift in a program that is otherwise consistently full in smaller increments.",
    "Loved this class. Maybe my favorite of the whole semester. Great topics- reverent discussions- loved the reading material- projects were challenging but fun and fulfilling.",
    "I thought the workload was very reasonable."

   "comments": [
    "I think a major timeline would be useful to sort all the plays.",
    "This class was organized effectively for a well covered timeline of theater foundations.",
    "I liked how we went through time mostly chronologically. That helped me to wrap my head around the evolution of theaters. I also really liked how we used the presentations to bridge the discussions with real life application.",
    "I enjoyed the materials for this class a great deal, particularly reading the founding documents of theaters. The assignments were interesting but not directly related to the readings; perhaps writing a founding document or mandate for a theater would be a useful takeaway? Perhaps discussing what makes a theater have greater longevity? Perhaps some sort of research project looking at particular kinds of theaters or interviews with founders? A paper comparing and contrasting two-three theaters of varying ideologies?",
    "The grouping of the readings each week made sense and presented useful frames with which to approach the companies in question. The supplementary videos and other materials in class helped give human character to the readings. The discussion portion of this course could be more directed. Our best classes grew out of specific questions raised by the readings that were attacked by the students. While lecture was sometimes useful in learning more recent history, there is so much exposition already in the reading that sometimes I wished there was more time for discussion.",
    "I think the trajectory of the class through London's book and through time was helpful. I also appreciated the recap and timeline that Joan provided in the final weeks as well as how the presentations were spaced out."

    "Wonderful discussions and the visuals such as the movies were extremely helpful in furthering discussion.",
    "This instructor was always open to discussions and I found her teaching of this course to be incredibly useful and effective.",
    "I value Joan as an instructor. She cares about her students and about the material, and is accessible, available, responsive and thoughtful. She also seeks to improve the course and regularly solicits feedback. She integrates personal expertise into lecture and asks probing questions. It is a pleasure coming to her classes.",
    "Professor Channick did a great job teaching this course for the first time. As noted above, I think the area it could be improved the most is through more time for more directed discussion. In many ways the material speaks for itself, but sometimes it is so broad it is difficult to have a proactive response (rather than general awe and inspiration). This course is invaluable as a history course in a field that often does not know itself. However, in a professional program, more tools to help discussion of how to apply ideas from the texts would improve the course.",
    "-Always available for questions. -Clearly very passionate and knowledgable about the topics."

    "I truly gained a great deal about theater history in America from this course and also felt extremely inspired by the visions of some of these theaters. I hope to revisit my copy of Ideal Theater in the future. I would have loved to spend more time analyzing why the theater in America evolved the way it did and why each different movement was necessary or what it was adding to society."

    "I would love to have more discussions of situations of theaters that the instructor has worked with and present questions about how we (classmates) would adapt to help a company succeed.",
    "I think we could have had much more indepth discussions by making us responsible for bringing in discussion questions or doing a jigsaw discussion where different groups are in charge of a specific theater and have to \"teach\" it to their discussion group. I also think transitions could have used work in class. We would often jump from video to discussion, to lecture and then transfer back. Before the final project, it would have been really nice to discuss our ideas and get feedback about it too. This is such an inspiring class and we do such powerful readings; it would be so beneficial to feed off of that energy to put all of our minds into something together.",
    "Better integration\/alignment between the assignments and the content, with assignments that require analytical thinking or critique of the material in the readings.",
    "I know there was discussion about changing the midterm and final projects, but I actually really enjoyed both of them. The final project specifically I really loved and thought was a great culmination of the course. To me, it seemed like the perfect way to take all we'd talked about and learned from studying other theatres and then using that knowledge in a practical way to build, or in my case, take over and change, a theatre to fit your own vision, was a fun and appropriate end to the class. Please keep that project!!!",
    "As Joan had alluded to towards the end of the class, it might be worth considering bringing in more case-studies of founding visions shifting over time. I also think spreading the final projects out more evenly to provide for more feedback time would be great."
