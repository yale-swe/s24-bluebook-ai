    "It was a great course for intro into occupational epidemiology. The concepts are not necessarily straight forward so there was a lot of thinking and speculation involved. Something I did not like was that at the beginning of the semester we were told that the slides would be available on Classes V2 after the lectures so we would not have to sit there and copy all the slides, we could sit back and pay attention to what the lecturer was saying and take our own notes to add to the slides; then at the end of the semester we were told the slides would NOT be made available. It was extremely disappointing and confusing. I cannot remember the last class I had that refused to provide slides to the students.",
    "could have involved more activity based\/ case based learning in the class to get people to engage during certain lectures",
    "I really enjoyed this course. It is very relaxed - There are no assignments, just a few readings each week, guest lecturers, and a take-home final. It is mainly participatory. Both professors were wonderful.",
    "Excellent course for anyone interested in environmental\/occupational medicine. Interactive course discussions based on clinically relevant articles. Final exam only-take home.",
    "I loved this class. Both of the professors are amazing intellectuals and very knowledgeable in their fields. It was a pleasure to attend and I really hope to take classes with them in the future.",
    "Class was very informative and engaging. Would make power points available in the future.",
    "I really enjoyed the variety of subjects covered in the course. I especially loved the first hand anecdotes from the professors.",
    "Great instructors. The guest lecturers were good. I really enjoyed this (elective) course.It would be nice to have access to lecture slides."
