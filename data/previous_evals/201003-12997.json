   "comments": [
    "This class is wonderful. James Scott is brilliant, very respected in his field, and a very kind teacher. The material is interesting and diverse. Your classmates are likely to have their own passions for different aspects of the class, which makes for good discussion. Sometimes the views presented by the reading are a little one-sided (there's nothing serious in its support of development and opposition to environmentalism), but that's bound to happen. You're kind of on your own with the final paper, which I didn't like but some people might.",
    "Brilliant professor, draws brilliant students--only problem is everything rides on the last paper (as far as you can see) and you have no idea where you stand all semester. If grades aren't your be-all end-all, however, go ahead and take it--it gets a little repetitive toward the end, but discussion is SO good.",
    "So if you're considering taking Rivers you probably already know that James Scott is a brilliant scholar with incredibly wide-ranging interests. The cool thing about taking a class on Rivers from James Scott is that it's a broad topic that lets him cover lots of fascinatng ground; the downside is that it's very, very unfocused. The problem is that EVERYTHING is interesting to James Scott, so when the class discussion starts drifting in directions that I find boring, he doesn't get them back to the main theme--because there isn't really a main theme. As a result, we spent a lot of time discussing things like why salmon are charismatic and beloved and why rivers make good metaphors. It was still a fun course--we read some fascinating books and did have some genuinely interesting discussions punctuated with Scott's insights. But it could have been much better had it been more focused.",
    "This class is definitely worth taking. The course opens gray areas of academia which might otherwise slip through the cracks in more rigidly defined classes. Dr. Scott extends the study of rivers across boundaries of science and political forces in order to better recreate a broader picture, where all elements are considered and analyzed.The reading is extensive and time consuming, however the books are interesting and after reading them you will most likely have more to comment on in class than time allows.",
    "The books were very interesting, but our discussion suffered from lack of direction and structure. The danger of this topic is that, since few of us are experts in the details of ecology or hydrology, the conversation tends to revert to the same basic few ideas, i.e. man's right to modify nature, the value of periodic floods, and the relationship between upstream and downstream peoples. I had never taken an environmental studies class before, so I enjoyed the chance to have these conversations; but, if you have, I would imagine it gets quite old. Professor Scott is very nice, but you have to make the effort to connect with him and\/or teach him your name.",
    "Take it! An amazing interdisciplinary discussion. You learn a ton about rivers, from the environmental effects of dams to Mark Twain to Maori myths about eels (really cool). Some dragging readings, but mostly great. And a truly engaging discussion. I think I looked at my watch maybe once the whole semester, even though it was a long class in the late afternoon.",
    "Definitely a great seminar, Professor Scott is a good person to get to know. You can also write the term paper on anything related to water pretty much, which is cool but can also drive you crazy picking a topic.",
    "If you have an interest in rivers or in the politics of water, go for this course if you can get in. If not, I feel like this is not a course to take; while I thought the class and professor were wonderful, I cannot imagine reading 17 books on rivers if I did not have a strong interest in the subject.",
    "Good seminar, with very different subject matter. But be warned that he has a policy of calling on you to lead on any given day, so the bar is set high for readings and participation.And you learn a lot about man and nature and the tensions between them.",
    "Really great opportunity to learn about a subject matter most people have never considered in depth, let alone appreciated the relevance of. Professor Scott is a pleasure to learn from and puts in the effort during discussion to keep the class interesting. Material does get a bit repetitive though before the end of the course.",
    "Yes!",
    "YES YES YES. You'll learn really interesting facts about eels, dams, rivers and everything to do with the environment concerning them! This is a gem of class and isn't all that much work. The readings are a lot but you can always skim and still have enough to say in class. I loved it. The final paper was a lot of work but it gives you the chance to find a new passion if you don't already have one in this field."
