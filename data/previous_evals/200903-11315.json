    "This is probably the best class you will ever take.",
    "Take it if you like to sing.",
    "I would absolutely recommend the class to another student becuase it provides an opportunity to work with incredibly talented musicians and awesome music.",
    "It's an evening class in which you spend two hours learning about song literature and listening to your peers sing it. If you take singing seriously at all, the experience is invaluable, because not only do you learn new repertoire, but you are exposed to all the repertoire that your fellow students are working on. Also, watching other people sing is one of the best ways to actively engage with your understanding of technique and think of ways to help that person on a particular piece. Sometimes it moves pretty slow, that's my only complaint. I wish more were expected from us in terms of memorization of new repertoire so that we might get more accomplished.",
    "I would recommend it. Definitely not a easy class-- however, if you distribute your work out over the semester it's very manageable.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone who wants to learn about singing, diction, and opera. It was a lot of fun and was very informative at the same time.",
    "I would most definitely recommend this class. It is a great deal of fun, and also quite enlightening."
