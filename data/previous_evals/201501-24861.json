    "it was a lovely class and nice way to sum up the education studies curriculum. essentially you develop your own course of study or independent project to pursue, and lizzy supports you over the course of the semester as you work to complete a thesis on it. you meet in small groups with like-minded peers and to provide one another with a second source of support. on reflection the students who thrived the most in this class were a) true self-starters and b) very much engaged with and excited abut their project of choice. so my advice would be to select a project you can really throw yourself into for a few months and enjoy! it can really be that simple.",
    "It was a valuable and enriching experience to spend a full semester on a project of my own choosing. I really enjoyed thinking about education together with the other Ed. Studies seniors and I would certainly recommend the course (and the Ed. Studies Program) to anyone thinking about it!",
    "Very hands offmaybe too much so. But does a good job in expecting seniors to behave like seniors, get their own stuff together, and do a presentation in front of peers, teachers, and friends at the end. Still unclear what the Education Studies program gives in terms of concrete certification...",
    "I think by the end of senior year, being able to design and execute your own project feels like a necessary piece to get out of college. If you have a project or general subject area that you'd like to pursue, then this is a great opportunity to do it. Maybe doesn't make as much sense to do alongside a senior thesis.",
    "This was the first time the class happened, so there are some wrinkles to adjust or iron out still. If the program fleshes out as planned, then this will probably be a required class. It was already fairly enjoyable now, so I don't doubt that the second time around it will be even better.",
    "Senior requirement for ESDT scholars, so you will need to be in it! It's not a structured class though, more like a forum to discuss and keep up with our research, but it's great to have this kind of environment and space to share with your peers what you are working on, and get motivated!"
