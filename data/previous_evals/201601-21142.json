   "comments": [
    "YES you should take this course. One of the best I've taken in 4 years at Yale. You'll learn so much about anti-poverty policy in the US, both at the national and local levels. It can be a lot of work with the weekly reading responses, but you get just as much as you put in. The readings are varied and all really interesting. This course is a must for anyone interested in this subject matter. I just wish more people knew how great Horan's classes are... although she does have quite a loyal following among those in-the-know. Seriously, take this class. And her other class, Urban Politics and Policy. You will be a better person for it!",
    "Poverty, Politics, and Policy in the American City is an incredibly informative and thought-provoking class. You learn a lot about the nature of American poverty and about the pitfalls, opportunities, and dilemmas of designing policy. Its a great introduction to policy analysis, but also includes reading ethnography. Professor Horan is very well-versed, smart, and eager to share her knowledge. Shes hard to read if you dont know her and her assignments are often unclear, but youll appreciate her style by the end. Not an easy class, by far, but one of the most worthwhile ones in the department.",
    "I would recommend this to another student they're interested in urban politics understanding in equity in America",
    "This is a hard course, and it raises more questions than it gives answers, but if you have a serious interest in understanding the challenges or contemporary urban poverty, this course is critical. Professor Horan expects a lot out of you, but you learn more and understand more because of it.",
    "Weekly responses and two big essays. This course will enrich the conversations you have had about poverty. You will leave with a good foundation upon which to engage in poverty scholarship. The readings are wonderful and span across disciplines. Cynthia Horan is also a wonderful professor that always makes seminar exciting with her intellect and wit.",
    "Amazing. You will learn so much more about poverty than you thought there was to it. You will be an expert by the end of class.",
    "I would summarize PLSC 280 in terms of its title: its a course about poverty and politics in U.S cities. The course goes into the various causes\/factors that produce poverty, definitions of poverty, the people that poverty affects, and their relation to the urban environment. I would say that a lot of the students in the class already came in with a background in poverty work. And perhaps because of that, we were able to dive into pretty specific and detailed discussions surrounding poverty. I would say, however, to not feel intimidated if you don't have an extensive background in poverty. Professor Horan's syllabus covers a wide arc of topics from which everyone can learn something new.",
    "If you're interested in looking at poverty policy since the War on Poverty, take this class. A great overview that raises more problems than answers, and teaches you to be critical of the arguments and information we both espouse and hear everyday.",
    "Amazing course! Really eye-opening about poverty and poverty policy. You gain a lot of poverty knowledge reading cool ethnographies and journal articles (in sociology, political science, and policy), as well as a strong conceptual understanding of the issue. It's a substantial amount of work -- at least 100 pages of reading each week, 1-2 page weekly reading responses, mid-term paper, and final paper -- but so so worth it. Professor Horan is an incredible discussion leader and also gives very helpful feedback on written work. She always wants to help you do better -- I submitted a paper draft for her to review the day it was due and she still was willing to give substantive comments within a couple of hours. I was one of the few non-EPE or political science majors in the class and it felt totally doable as my first actual political science seminar. I would absolutely recommend this class. I believe next year is the last time Professor Horan is teaching it, so take advantage of any opportunity to study with this legendary pedagogue.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. I think it is the better of the two horan classes. Horan is a wonderful professor who doesn't take any bs but will really push your ideas and engage with you. You will learn a lot about poverty in america (which I think everyone should know about). The class is pretty policy focused but you don't need a background in it to understand the language. This is also one of the only policy classes in the department. Its definitely hard but also definitely worth it.",
    "Very rigorous lecture, and ample weekly homework but do not let that scare you away."
