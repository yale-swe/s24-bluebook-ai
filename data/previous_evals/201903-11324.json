    "Strengths: Aruna is very sweet, and so is our TA. I also felt that the course was comprehensive in providing a foundation for laboratory techniques in the field. Furthermore, I felt that there were ample opportunities to ask questions. Weaknesses: The class felt somewhat disorganized, and unfortunately this was reflected in the grading. Expectations for lab reports were often not very clear (the lab manual says to do one set of things, but then the rubric says to do another).",
    "Very interesting concepts, but some labs could be organized better\/clearer",
    "The heavy concentration of our grade on the first lab report was a bit distressing. Breaking it up into three or four reports total would have helped reduce stress levels."

    "It's kind of fun, but also more work than one might expect for a 0.5 credit lab class.",
    "Yes, day to day labs are fun, but sometimes it can get frustrating with the lab reports and lack of clear feedback.",
    "not exactly. if its required i guess you have to take it but for MB&B majors doing research for credit and having your PI sign-off on the lab skills checklist seems a lot easier. the labs themselves were sort of interesting but the class felt very disorganized and high-school like. many times it was unclear what we should be doing and everyone was running around and no one knew were any of the reagents were and the column was leaking and it was kinda a mess. but if you take it with a friend it could be a fun mess especially since a lot of the labs are done with a partner. prof pawashe and prof konigsberg are very sweet and helpful and knowledgable. the lab manual is also a lifesaver and mostly very thorough but kinda dated and filled with errrors - i kinda wish we kept a lab notebook. lab reports are also a PAIN and don't leave them until the last minute (even though everyone does lol). grading on lab reports and problem sets also felt kinda arbitrary....you will learn PCR and some other biochemistry but there are probably better ways to do so. (but the profs are very nice!!!)",
    "I would recommend this class to another student who plans to work in a biology lab.",
    "I would recommend this course. I thought it was the most interesting lab I have taken because the experiments we were doing were much more applicable and felt more real.",
    "Yes I would recommend the course. Learned a TON."
