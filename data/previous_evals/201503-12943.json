    "This is an exploration of the history and culture of Sacred Harp singing, which is a type of traditional folk-hymn-gospel-a Capella type of music. I would recommend this class to anyone that is interested in music and would like to explore a non-Western genre.",
    "I absolutely would, to anyone who would be remotely interested in the bizarre phenomenon that is Sacred Harp singing. The course was a great introduction for the uninitiated, and a really great low-stress way to start off my Yale career!",
    "Yes, I would recommend it. You will be introduced to a really interesting music culture, and it will cause you to get out of your comfort zone. My favorite part of the class was that we not only studied Sacred Harp, but we engaged in the culture through weekly singings, conventions, etc. However, engaging in the culture necessitates that you enjoy doing so. Therefore, you should make sure that listening\/singing\/discussing Sacred Harp music is something you'd like to do before you jump into the course.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. Not only do you get to take a class with a lighter workload, you also learn about this amazing subject and meet such kind people."
