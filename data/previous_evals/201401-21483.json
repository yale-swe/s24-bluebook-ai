    "TAKE THE CLASS. Great teacher! Interesting readings! Not a large writing work load.",
    "I would recommend this class to a student who is interested in learning some of the basics of philosophy. The amount of graded work is manageable, making a good class for introductory students who are just exploring the subject. You can get away without doing every single reading and just write papers on the topics that interest you.",
    "Philosophy 260 was an outstanding survey of American philosophy. Although I had previous exposure to philosophy with DS, it is accessible to people who are new at philosophy. The readings, which ranged from Jonathan Edwards to Emerson and Thoreau to Dewey and King, gave a comprehensive portrait of the breadth and depth of thought in our country, and they were all very interesting and thematically cohesive. Professor Winkler was a truly magnificent lecturer and gave wonderfully charitable and vibrant interpretations of the reading's relevance and meaning. He is also a fabulous raconteur and told us lots of great stories about Yale history, American history, and New England. Every class was a pleasure. I strongly recommend this class if you are at all interested in the landscape of American thought and history.",
    "Fantastic class overall, it's good for philosophy and non-philosophy majors. Prof. Winkler is really good at explaining difficult concepts and he's very available outside the class. Classroom conversation did digress from time to time, but I enjoyed this class immensely.",
    "I would recommend it to anyone who wants a serious but very enjoyable philosophy course. The workload is pretty manageable. The grading is tough, but it's not impossible to do well, especially if you take advantage of office hours to discuss your paper ideas beforehand.",
    "American Philosophy is a great small lecture class which is a survey of american philosophical thought in the fields of metaphysics and epistemology from Berkley (1700s) to modern thinkers such as MLK. The highlight of the course is Winkler who is an enormously energetic, kind, and intelligent professor. He brings a lot of passion to the classroom and seems genuinely interested in what students' personal opinions\/views on the substance of the week's readings. The class isn't too reading-heavy (maybe 30 pages a week), a take-home midterm (3 3-page essays) a short paper (7-8 pages) and a take-home final (3 3-page essays). The semester starts out with Winkler lecturing more during class, but after a few weeks the balance shifts and the class becomes essentially half-lecture, half-seminar with Lots of students participating and in many ways directing the course of the conversation.",
    "Overview of American Phil. Mainly about pragmatism",
    "Take this class! I didn't have a philosophy background, but my classmates who did also had a good experience. The reading can be difficult but it's often really enjoyable, and if it wasn't immediately, then lecture will make it so. This is a lecture without section, but with in-class discussion. Prof. Winkler has mastered this format -- he takes every idea seriously while keeping the lesson moving.",
    "It is a class on the history and content of thought in America since the 18th century. It provides context for the ideas that have shaped our country. I would and have recommend the class.",
    "An interactive conversation with the history of American philosophy. Great for any liberal arts minded guy or gal.",
    "One of the best classes I've taken at Yale, in an underhanded way. It doesn't make a big deal about itself, but Winkler chooses the texts well and knows a ton about the subject matter. The class format, which functions as something mysterious between a lecture and a seminar, is perfect. There is a good amount of writing in the class, but the assignments are satisfying.",
    "Yes! It won't hurt if you have a philosophical writing or debate(aka laying out arguments clearly and responding to them), but if you don't, go to office hours and you will learn fast. A great class for near everyone to take.",
    "Yes."
