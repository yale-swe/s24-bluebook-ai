   "comments": [
    "This is a fantastic class to explore how and why we translate poetry. It moves beyond the phrase \"lost in translation,\" (in fact, never say that ever again) and pushes the conversation to really get at what drives translation. This class wasn't much work, but the conversations were satisfying and I really learned a lot.",
    "Take this class!! I will never think about poetry or works in translation the same way again.",
    "Yes. An interesting course that gets one to rethink the poetics and politics of translation. The course helps undo the misconception \/ less productive position that things get 'lost in translation', and reveals along the way particular poetics and politics that enable one to look at translation in a more generative manner.The nature of the course is well structured, the weekly readings and assignments thematized. At the same time there's a great sense of latitude in the course. While there are parameters for the translation assignments, they aren't rigid by any means. Prof Jacobs is also a lot more invested in the process behind the translation so don't worry if the translated 'product' appears crude. Also there is no particular language requirement to take this class.",
    "This is an awesome class, and I would recommend it to everyone. It teaches you a lot about different ways to read literature. You also get to explore different languages, how one differs from another, and how culture, literature, and language are all interconnected. I learned so much. The sections were always enjoyable and so were the readings.",
    "Literature 306 01 is a class on translation - what it means and how it manifests itself. More specifically it is a class on the translation of poetry. It considers how poetry can be translated, what defines a faithful translation, and even whether poetry can truly be translated at all. I would certainly recommend it, whether or not you have put any thought into translation. It is a small class where you get to know your classmates well and share your work comfortably. The topic is mind boggling and wonderful.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. It was very interesting and unlike other literature courses I had ever taken. It changed my view of translation significantly and I never felt like it was a chore to do the readings and assignments."
