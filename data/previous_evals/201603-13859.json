    "Only suggestion would be to ask Harry to pace his feedback in actual class sessions so that he could actually get to discussing everybody's assignment during class. Some classmates only got 1-2 sessions of personal feedback in the 7-week course, while others got 6-7. And if he doesn't do in-class feedback, it would be extremely helpful to have more robust written feedback.",
