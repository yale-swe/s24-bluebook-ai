   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this class to someone who is looking for a challenge. You need a very good set of German language skills to master the assigned readings, but when you do the discussions are always amazing.",
    "GMAN 172 is an awesome course! The theater pieces we studied are fascinating and diverse, and class discussions were engaging. Jason is a great instructor who is always willing to meet with you regarding assignments. The workload is manageable and I really enjoyed the material and structure of the course, even as someone who isn't a big theater fan.",
    "A great option for literature majors interested in German literature to take care of the drama\/theatre requirement. In any case, take it if you want to get an interesting overview of some of the best known works of drama in the German tradition.",
    "GMAN 172 is a nice survey of German theater. I would recommend it to people who are interested both in the German language as well as theater\/literature in general.",
    "Take it! This course provides a great overview of renowned works of German literature and is accommodating to those with all different levels of experience with the subject. If you've never taken an L5 class before, this course will be challenging at the beginning but unbelievably rewarding in the end. The workload entails a substantial amount of reading and several papers, but it is all manageable. I would recommend this course without reservation.",
    "Interesting and a fun class. Would recommend any class with Herr Kavett.",
    "I would recommend GMAN 172 to a fellow student who is interested in language practice (rather than acquiring new grammar and skills)."
