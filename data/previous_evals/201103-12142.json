    "A fun and interactive course on paleoclimature. Very interesting material. Great graduate student presentations. Yes, highly recommend. Definitely take this course if you are interested in global climate change and the human response throughout history.",
    "Great prof, relaxed course and interesting material. Loved going to class even if some of the material went over my head, just to listen to Rod speak. Light workload but the readings are boring sometimes.",
    "A nighttime lecture by Rod McIntosh on how humans have responded to climate crises in the past, and what kind of patterns\/forces govern climate now. Through the grad student presentations, you hear about a lot of interesting individual projects and the methods they use to carry them out. No classroom discussion, though (except the very last class)."
