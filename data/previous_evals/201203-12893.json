   "comments": [
    "not as easy as a science credit as everyone thinks but still pretty good. interesting material and good teacher. lots of (small) assignments make up your grade so you can do well",
    "YES. It's a fascinating class with material that touches our every day lives, with material relating to psychology, biology, genetics, economics. The professor is wonderful, the workload was just right, and the material you learn is diverse and always interesting.",
    "This is not an easy science credit, but it is probably one of the more interesting and relevant science credits for a non-science major. I would only recommend it to students who are willing to do the work necessary to understand the material pretty perfectly in order to do well on the midterm and final. Professor Bradley and Tim, the TF, are both excellent teachers. Lectures are clear and pretty interesting, and there is work outside the tests, but it isn't tedious. The book we had to read was also interesting.",
    "For a non-science major I do not recommend the class.",
    "I just took the final two hours ago, and it went pretty well, so I'm writing a haiku to commemorate how much I enjoyed the course: \"Anthropology \/ Bradley is the best teacher \/ Take this awesome course\". I came into this class just wanting to take a fulfilling science credit to fulfill my Sc requirement, but after taking this course I actually have an interest in anthropology, and that's weird, and surprising, but also pretty groovy. I shopped a metric ton of science courses this semester (I got both out of the way this semester) and Bradley was by far the most interesting lecturer. She also ended up being very easy to talk to and get help from. I know in past reviews, people say to take this for a gut science credit, but I felt that there was a good amount of reading involved and if you take the time to do all of the work possible, this course will be very fulfilling as opposed to just an easy pass. The midterm and final were both very doable, and I feel like the 8 page paper was doable too. No surprises, just make sure to do all of the readings and you're good.",
    "This is a class that combines natural sciences and social sciences to study how genetics affects human behavior, diversity, migration, and evolution. Fascinating!",
    "I would recommend this course if you are looking for a doable science credit, but it is going to be more than you would expect (which ends up being fine for non science majors). Nothing requires extensive math or sciency problems and computing, it's more memorization.",
    "A simple science course, but with more reading and writing.",
    "I would recommend ANTH 204. I understand that it is a science class for non science majors and that attracts a certain person, but the science was interesting and I found it to be informative. I also feel like I have learned a lot about human genetic make up and our origins.",
    "Great science class for people who know nothing about bio. I really liked taking this class. I had zero bio knowledge coming in, and I feel like I actually learned a lot while also not having to stress out at all about my grade in the class. You don't really have to do the reading if you just pay attention in class and study the lecture slides. Professor Bradley gives (pretty frequent) ungraded pop quizzes that are really helpful foractually making learn the material without stressing out about your grade, but they do mean you need to actually go to class every day. If you need a science credit, definitely take it! If you're a science major, I definitely would not take it though.",
    "Yes, this is a great science credit.",
    "This is a very chill class that presents interesting material in the fields of genetics and anthropology, and the professor is great. It is not much work and as long as you attend lectures and study for the two exams, you will do fine. I can actually see this class becoming a large, popular lecture class in the future as the demand increases. I would definitely recommend Anthropology 204 to another student.",
    "The course was very accessible for a science course, and even pretty interesting.",
    "This was a great course for someone who finds science interesting but doesn't want the intensity of a designed-for-majors course. Prof. Bradley is really nice and does a great job of explaining things clearly, and you get to learn not only about genetics\/genomics and evolution, but how they matter to issues like healthcare and forensics - with interesting class discussions. The workload is light most of the time, but the exams definitely require thorough understanding of the material. Also, the relative value of different assignments was odd. We read a book, discussed it, and wrote a 10-12 page \"mock chapter,\" all counting as only 10%, while the two problem sets that maybe took an hour apiece counted together as 10%. Overall, a great science class, especially for a social science person, provided you actually want to be engaged.",
    "This is a good class to take if you're interested in genomics and primates and need a science credit. It's not as easy as some people might say it is. The material can be complicated. But the way the course forces you to figure out the material coincides with popular discussion is really edifying.",
    "I would recommend this class for students who are genuinely interested in biology and\/or human evolution. While the work load is very light, I would discourage students from simply taking this for an \"easy A\" because the exams can be difficult if work isn't put in. Overall, it is a completely manageable science credit.",
    "Yes, take it! Very interesting material. Tests are a bit tricky - I don't like the format of them.",
    "Wonderful class! It's a great intro course to molecular anthropology and Professor Bradley is a lovely professor. I think the fact that she capped it at 30 helped contribute to a more discussion based nature than most lecture classes. The topics explored throughout the semester are super relevant to the genetic age that we live in, and Professor Bradley breaks down complicated topics really well. There isn't too much work, and I like how there are several smaller (and interesting) assignments scattered throughout the semester, rather than having just a midterm and final. As long as your keep up with all of the readings, come to class (there are often pop quizzes!), and engage with the material,you'll have a great time.",
    "An interesting class and not much work during the semester- however, the exams are much more difficult and tricky."
