    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student, especially one interested in learning about the perks and limitations of dealing with economists when studying natural resource management. HOWEVER I would strongly encourage people to take what is taught with a grain of salt, and compliment the course with one taught in a science class like General Ecology",
    "This is a pretty good class actually. It may say it's 3 days a week but it really is only 2, you kind of have to go to class and pay attention because he doesn't have slides but the material is honestly super easy, if you want to get a good grade in an econ class this is the one to take if you don't mind showing up twice a week and putting in very very minimal work. The problem sets take an hour max, most not even. And Mendelson is a pretty good teacher.",
    "Decent Econ elective, not as easy as advertised because of some strict and not very lenient grading. Psets once a week were a pain too.",
    "I think the strength of this class is that it is very practical and policy-oriented. For each topic, the professor presents the issues elegantly and propose corresponding policies with analysis of the underlying economic models. But sometimes it is a little boring. Overall this is a good class that teaches how to save the world.",
    "Definitely take this class! It's one of the more interesting ones I've taken at Yale, and if you pay attention in lecture then it is easy. Problem sets are very easy. There are only two midterms and a final. Very manageable and engaging class that covers all sides of issues surrounding the management of natural resources.",
    "Great economics elective; easy problem sets, 2 midterms, final, and a weekly section. Grading was rough, since there is essentially no curve, but you'll definitely learn a lot during the semester.",
    "It's a great easy Econ class. Not very mathematically rigorous, but fascinating material, and provides a good framework for thinking about environmental issues. Not too much work, either.",
    "This was a pretty easy course that solidified my understanding of the concepts of pollution and resource management. I would recommend this course if you want something easy for your schedule, since it doesn't require that much work.",
    "Don't even bother - yes the exams are easy, but you'd rather take a well organised tough course.",
    "Dr. Mendeloshn terrifically confronts the century's most salient economic debate. His near mockingly-conservative style is perfect to cull the talents and economic arguments from his students. That said, Dr. Mendelsohn himself is a very finite resource. His voice can only carry so far in a lecture hall to one hundred, without a powerpoint and using only chalk. Most of the effort in this class goes to understanding the assumptions that Dr. Mendelsohn's TA's make in order to use simple maths for foot-wetting in complex environmental issues. That, I think, was a small beauty of the class. A class that gets more fascinating with greater economic acumen, even if one could know only the basics for a B-. TAs arm students with the methods and skills to solve the general issues and highly-debated formulas presented in class. Therefore, choose TAs carefully.",
    "Take this course if you are interested in the environment. It is really interesting and has a manageable work load.",
    "Definitely take if you have any interest in the material. Micro will help you. It was great because Professor Mendelsohn's lectures were very focused on social sciences and more engaging than a quantitative lecture, while we still had quantitative applications on the problem sets of issues discussed in class. This class will change the way you think about environmental and economic issues. At times it is disorganized (confusing homeworks, other miscommunications), but it's not that much work and will be worth it.",
    "yes!!! take this course, especially if you're an econ major. One of the best and most interesting econ courses I've taken at Yale.",
    "I really enjoyed this as one of my econ credits. It was not a very difficult course overall, but I did have to study quite a bit for the midterm and final. The problem sets were not difficult, but they definitely made you consider the material from a mathematical perspective. I came into this class knowing nothing, so I learned many things throughout this semester. In addition, Professor Mendelsohn was a wonderful instructor - very clear and effective. The sections for this class were mandatory but were extremely helpful in reviewing and clarifying every lecture.",
    "A solid class. Not too much work but interesting lectures and material.",
    "I would definitely recommend. The topic is extremely interesting and extremely important today, and I came out feeling like I learned a very substantial amount.",
    "Take this class if you're interested in environmental economics or just need an econ credit. There's not a lot of structure, but overall it isn't too difficult and you'll learn some interesting theories.",
    "No. If you're an econ major, please don't waste your time taking this class. If you're not and you're interested in environmental\/economic resource management, there are far, far better courses out there. Don't waste a credit.",
    "Cool",
    "As a non-major with basic econ knowledge, this was interesting and quite easy. Recommended",
    "Easy gut. Interesting readings and material but lectures are boring. No textbook, so you should take notes or at least pay attention. Get Avi as a TA cause he'll teach you how to solve the problem set - lectures don't involve in math or problem solving.",
    "Take it! Pretty chill econ credit with a very low time commitment.",
    "Yes. No reason not to. Interesting, inspiring and easy.",
    "Very easy Econ class that has a harsh curve (because everyone does so well). You learn a few interesting things, but it is a gut.",
    "Take it if you want to look at simple economics from an environmental prospective.",
    "Very easy class. Not too interesting if you're not into environmental economics. The prof. tries to make the class accessible to everyone, which it is. If you put in the minimal amount of time, you will do well.",
    "Great class.",
    "A straightforward Econ field class that is interesting and relevant to today's world. Workload is light, weekly psets and sections, 2 midterms and a final. I would definitely recommend.",
    "I would recommend you take this class if you want a good fundamental knowledge of the economics involved in environmental issues - which is something that is very good to be informed about. The class is very well-taught; I followed it all and had never taken econ before. It was very interesting too! I would definitely recommend it.",
    "Very easy social science credit: attend and pay attention in class and section, and you never have to touch the readings. Exams are fairly straightforward so the curve is essentially nonexistant.",
    "Would definitely recommend this course! The topics are great and give you an interesting perspective on environmental topics. Mendelsohn is also an engaging lecturer. The psets and exams are straightforward too.",
    "I'd recommend this course as a fairly easy econ credit. If you're really passionate about pollution and natural resource management you'll probably be put off by the professor's sweeping generalizations about the 'right' solution to environmental problems, but overall the class is interesting without too much work. I personally would have had a harder time in this class if I weren't already an econ major, so if you haven't already taking intermediate econ be ready to do some catching up.",
    "Don't take this class -- it's not worth it. The material is horribly presented in class and inaccurately taught in section. The entire course was poorly organized, and it was never clear why points were taken off on exams or why certain answers were acceptable and others weren't. This is coming from an econ major who cares about the environment -- I had high hopes for this class, and it completely failed to meet them. Every single question just boiled down to MB=MC; I guess that means the material's easy, but it's also very unsatisfying. The numerical questions on the exams were complete jokes: all the answers were physically impossible, because the professor and TAs couldn't be bothered to check that the answers even came out positive. Take Econ 412 if you want a real econ class about the environment; even if you just want an easy econ class, stay away from this one, because the aggravation isn't worth it.",
    "Interesting, and fairly easy econ course. Mendelsohn is very knowledgeable. The only problem is, you can't miss any lecture because there are no lecture slides or textbook. Also, the curve is horrible, so make sure you actually work hard. Apart from that, great course. I learned a lot.",
    "An overview of different aspects of the economics of natural resources. I would not recommend it unless lecture notes are posted, as Mendelsohn can be hard to follow at times.",
    "I would definitely recommend the class. The workload is completely manageable for an Econ major, and the lectures were often actually very interesting - a welcome change from the required economics courses.",
    "Not a hard class, but very disorganized. Nobody seems to know what's going on, even the TAs. Your grade will probably get nickeled and dimed away with section participation and stuff.",
    "Great class! Lots of excellent econ to learn, taught very well by Prof Mendelsohn; he teaches on the black board (no slides), but that's quite effective. Workload: weekly short psets, 2 midterms, and 1 final--all quite straightforward. Mandatory attendance at section.",
    "Do not take this class. You may have heard good things but it's basically curved to a B+.",
    "good!",
    "This course is really interesting and a great opportunity to better grasp some misconceived concepts about the environmental preservation vs economics. It's pretty much micro Econ with respect to environmental issues. Might be a little frustrating at times if you are coming in as an EVST student rather than an ECON major since it's hard to put a value on some aspects of the environment, but the point of view presented in class certainly benefits both types of students.",
    "Good class.",
    "Great course for environmentalists looking for an economist's perspective",
    "Absolutely take this course.",
    "Take it. Decent Econ credit with manageable workload.",
    "I'm a geology major and went into this class with no, and I mean literally no, experience with economics. It took me two classes to figure out the whole P and Q thing and then I was totally fine. I actually think I understood some of the math better than the econ majors (maybe because it's really different from their normal econ problems). It was definitely easy, but also enjoyable and interesting material that offers a very important perspective on environmental issues. I did find some of Professor Mendelsohn's statements on climate change science to be somewhat questionable. There are two midterms and a final, and section attendance counts for your grade. Definitely go to section, you'll learn exactly how to do the weekly problem set!",
    "Very doable even for a non-econ major with NO experience whatsoever.",
    "Take it as a good, easy, straightforward Econ elective. Lectures are fairly straightforward and tests and assignments are okay. Be sure to take notes in lecture because that's the only study material.",
    "great course, tests kinda weird, section quallity really depends",
    "An introductory level course on the economic theory behind the management of various natural resources. It had very good breadth (Keep in mind that natural resources does not just mean fossil fuels), but lacks a lot of depth (read: mathematical rigor), and so explanations in section often come down to \"calculate the area of this triangle\" as opposed to the logical explanation behind it. That being said, it shouldn't be a reason to avoid this class if you are interested in the topic--it's a good first course for the material.",
    "Take this if you are interested in resource management\/economics\/politics of natural resources.",
    "NO",
    "If your interested in environmentalism and its applications\/practicality, it is a good class. Just be prepared for Mendelsohn to say some controversial things.",
    "This is a great course and it really exceeded my expectations. I really felt like I didn't just learn a bunch of facts or case studies but I actually gained a lot of knowledge about environmental management taking this course.",
    "Very interesting material, a bit slow if you are an economics students (most models are MC=MB).",
    "I loved this class! This course is an incredibly interesting application of economics. It explains the latest economic theory surrounding many natural resource issues, making sure students do not misunderstand these issues as so many people including environmentalists do. This class shows the power of economic theory to understand real world issues, and it shows that interference in markets for environmental issues is not always the optimal choice! It's a survey course so don't expect to go into too much depth.",
    "I thought Econ of Natural Resources was an ok class. It wasn't the most interesting class, and the pace could be pretty slow. Some of the material was nice though. It's a good class to take if you are an econ major.",
    "I would not highly recommend this course: it involves primarily rote memorization for the exams, with little problem solving. Moreover, this memorization is based entirely on individual class notes, which have no supplement in the form of a PowerPoint.",
    "A great course for an easy social science credit. I'm not an econ major, but if you can stand the other econ majors in the class (who argue over half points), then it's a fine class. Take good notes though because NOTHING is posted online!",
    "I would say the material is very interesting but not enough is asked of students, particularly on the tests, so the grading does not accurately reflect how well you know the material but rather how many details you memorized and how well you know how to tailor answers to what they want. Overall, I'd recommend, but be weary of that.",
    "This class is good and pretty easy. If you're interesting in energy or the environment in any way, you should definitely take it.",
    "Economics of Natural Resources is a great class for both econ and non-econ majors. The lectures are interesting and allow you to create an educated and open-minded perspective regarding the valuation and use of natural materials. Mendelsohn is a great lecturer, and the ta's are organized and helpful. Great course!",
    "A great overview of the field of environmental economics and management and the current debates within it. As someone who had never had any exposure to the field before, it was a great introductory course that got me thoroughly interested in the material. Problem sets are manageable, as are exams, and lectures are intriguing and engaging. Since Mendelsohn doesn't post lecture notes online, you'll need to attend every lecture or else find someone to give you notes for classes you miss.",
    "I wouldn't take it if I didn't have to, though I did learn a good bit about the economics of natural resources. I had never taken economics before, and still found this course much too easy. There is little out of class work, and I found myself wishing it was a bit more rigorous. The lectures are clear, if at times slow. The material is interesting, and made me want to know more about economics. Mendelsohn does seem like a nice guy who cares about teaching and his subject, even though I feel ambivalent about this class.",
    "ECON 330 is an interesting and surprisingly easy yet very interesting class about how to economically value natural resources such as fossil fuels, water, and clean air. It does not require a lot of previous economics knowledge (all you need is intro micro) and it does not get particularly technical or difficult until the last week or two of the course. However, the relative ease of the class does make for a pretty difficult curve, so make sure to be prepared for the tests. The problem sets are very short and easy because the profess usually directly gives the theory or formula needed to solve every problem in lecture. For all of these reasons I would recommend this class to another student, be they an econ major or not.",
    "This is a pretty good class with a light workload. I'm not an econ or EVST major- just took it for fun and still liked it!"
