   "comments": [
    "For the most part, the course was well organized. I would however like to see a little bit more useful feedback on our essays.",
    "Professor Bloch is wonderful. He is a great professor. His teaching and his material (the fabliaux) were definitely the strength of the course. Professor Butterfield is not engaging. She was the weakness.",
    "The syllabus was a little uneven in levels of interest and length of reading assignments throughout the semester -- a greater degree of consistency would have been nice, particularly when assignments consisted of a large number of short shorts (poetry, for example) one day and a single romance the next.",
    "Only strengths--my two professors made for an excellent team. Readings were engaging and chosen thoughtfully. The structure of evaluation was also very well-planned.",
    "The class was very interesting in the beginning when we were analyzing the stories themselves, but then when we started getting more into the comparative literature aspect of it and looking at the spread of a kind of literature by geography and culture that things started getting a little boring.",
    "The syllabus was kind of unclear. The readings were of manageable length and both professors are clearly knowledgeable about the material with very interesting input."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "It gets a lot less interesting after the fabliaux, but it's still a good enough class.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student interested in learning about the medieval period. Not too much work for a writing credit and you learn a lot.",
    "NO. If Professor Bloch were the only professor, absolutely. If the class continues to be co-taught, I definitely would not recommend it.",
    "Yes, with the understanding that it's sort of a niche course. It can be frustrating reading medieval texts due to the sheer lack of written information about them or their authors, so background information on the texts was often nonexistent or consisted of \"we don't really know.\" The middle ages were a quirky time to say the least, and most of the syllabus was enjoyable for the portrait it provided of that era. A fairly painless pre-1800 credit, if you're looking for one.",
    "Yes!!!! Professor Bloch and Professor Butterfield make for the best team of teachers. The readings are very engaging an discussion is fun and enlightening. You will learn how to read, write and think differently--I highly recommend it."
