    "Overview of the controversial topics in aid- tied aid, aid efficiency, aid post-disaster and in failed states, changes in aid throughout history, the Peace Corps, NGOs, religiously-affiliated aid. Discussions are lively and thought-provoking and real world applications are very interesting. Definitely take it if you are considering working in aid, development, or NGOs or if you want a different perspective on US foreign policy.",
    "The material is very interesting, and Prof. Simon is very friendly. Classes were sometimes a bit disorganized and lacked focus. Some of the articles that we read for class were barely relevant and not discussed in class. I would have preferred to focus more on the books, particularly Easterly.",
    "A well-taught course that gives an extremely interesting overview of the issues and actors of development assistance. I would recommend this course to anyone who has even a passing interest in issues of poverty, global health, or development. It was definitely the highlight of my course schedule.",
    "Seminar style",
    "Yes, take it! It can get a little boring, but the readings are worth it!"
