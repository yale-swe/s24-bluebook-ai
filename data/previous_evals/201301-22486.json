   "comments": [
    "No, unless you think it will be particularly helpful for your senior essay, grad school application, or career prospects. Molleen is dedicated and enthusiastic but not a good professor. If you are not totally obsessed with minimal or conceptual art, a lot of the discussions will be painful.",
    "If you're interested in the material, absolutely - unbelievable opportunities, fascinating material and discussion.",
    "Yes, if you are interested in American art from the second half of the twentieth century, this is a good course to take. If you don't know much about the topic beforehand, it might not be as rewarding for you-- though this is the problem (tradeoff) with seminars in general. Molleen made the course very interesting and fun, though!",
    "Yes, I would. I think that this was a fun class, though the friday afternoon was difficult sometimes, and I learned a lot. The readings were great. I do wish that we had discussed the readings in more depth. I feel like I only got a surface takeaway. But Molleen is great, really down to earth but also smart and knowledgeable. And so few classes in the art history department seem to be about post-modern art that this was a breath of fresh air.",
    "Great class, one of the few classes on contemporary art at yale. You read a lot of artists texts and really interesting critical texts on the art, and write one short paper and one long research paper on a topic of your choice."
