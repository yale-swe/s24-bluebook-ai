    "I learned a great deal about female writers throughout Chinese history, as well as broader matters of literary theory and Chinese writing. It was very exciting to read many works to which I otherwise would have had no exposure.",
    "I learned about women's literary tradition in China, which stretches back thousands of years. Through the poetry, we learned about the daily lives and social status of women (mainly from the elite class) in traditional China. I also learned how to analyze poetry in translation. In my previous English classes, analyzing poetry always involved dissecting a poem and examining very technical components like its form, word choice, meter, etc. But you can't really do that when the poem is translated, so I had to prioritize different elements, like imagery and details.",
    "we focused on the history and analysis of women in literature and traditional China and developed analysis skills and forming arguments in papers.",
    "i learned to analyze poems in a completely different way than that taught in standard English classes, allowing me to enjoy and appreciate literature more."

   "comments": [
    "The thematic organization of readings had both advantages and disadvantages, but was generally valuable. Sometimes I felt that a bit more chronology could be interesting, to facilitate connections between authors who were roughly contemporaries; but the thematic organization was great for discussing themes and issues and seeing how they were addressed across time, and I enjoyed having a specific, interesting topic for each class period. I might have enjoyed some more chronological comparison and context, which did become increasingly relevant over the course of the semester. I also think the structure of the course was valuable, as Professor Chang's lecturing offered necessary insight into our readings, and discussion enabled everyone to engage with the texts and ideas.",
    "I think that the topics of this course were super interesting and the papers were super fun to write! I also loved the format of the class--part lecture and part seminar. My only complaint is that the reading might have been a little too heavy.",
    "Professor Chang is very enthusiastic and able to keep the class engaged. Her 40 minute lectures were a delight, and I always looked forward to them.",
    "Professor Chang is really a true expert in the field and clearly deeply loves and understands the subject. I'd never studied anything like this before, but she made every class really interesting and engaging."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course to a student who is interested in Chinese or women's literature (or both), as the topic is certainly interesting and the course is quite well-run.",
    "Yes, I would! Professor Chang is so knowledgeable about this field, and it was maybe my first in-depth exposure to a non-Western literary tradition.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to English majors because it doesn't focus on Western writing and gives you a different perspective on literature.",
    "yes, this is a great course if you need a humanities credit. readings are interesting and you don't have to read all of them (if you're short on time that week) to engage in the class discussion.",
    "Yes, very much so. The readings are engaging and Professor Chang is a wonderful professor with so much knowledge of and passion for the subject."
