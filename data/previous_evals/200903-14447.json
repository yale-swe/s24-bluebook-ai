    "I'd definitely recommend it to anyone interested in looking at colonization in terms of econ\/statistics as well as history. It does a good job of providing multiple theories, though at the end of the day you leave convinced that no one variable will ever explain the effects of colonization. That's probably a good thing.",
    "I would recommend the seminar if you are interested and willing to do a lot of reading.",
    "I would recommend it if you are interested in the subject matter. However, it is important to note that there is a significant economic focus to a lot of the readings that you should be aware of in advance.",
    "PLSC is an overview of colonialism and postcolonial studies. The first half of the class is reading-heavy, providing general background on mainly British and French colonization. The second half of the course provides an introduction to literature about colonialism. This reading is really interesting. There is an in-class midterm, five page paper, and twenty-page final paper. It is a great class for getting a good grounding in colonialism. Discussion lags somewhat during the first half (with the history emphasis), but it really picks up in the second half."
