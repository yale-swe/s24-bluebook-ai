   "comments": [
    "A great introductory course for primate evolution and osteology. Great for non-science students who are dedicated to learning about it.",
    "Eric Sargis is a lot of fun, and the class is very intimate, something that allows for more in-depth coverage of whatever the students find interesting or engaging. The class is basically half-seminar half-lab, allowing for both discussion and hands-on learning.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to just about anyone interested in primates and\/or anthropology. As a science major, the beginning was a bit repetitive for me, however, after the intro classes it's definitely a class anyone can take, regardless of their background in science, and learn a lot from.",
    "Take it! It's a wonderful class, great classmates, and an awesome professor. You get to handle skulls and actually learn a lot about primates even if you're not an EEB major.",
    "I would take it again if I had the chance. It was a tiny class with hands-on labs every week which was awesome. Really interesting course material too!",
    "This was an excellent overview of primate evolutionary history and morphology. As a student, you will present one of the topics (3-4 readings from scientific literature), but it is not stressful and all and is formatted more like a seminar discussion where Eric Sargis is happy to step in and provide extra information \/ clarification. Eric is hilarious, knowledgeable, always willing to help, and sets up realy interesting labs for us for every class period; you get to actualy look at, touch, and hold specimens of sncient extinct primates! The final paper is not stressful. Without even realizing it, after taking this course, you will know all about anatomy and evolutionary history!I highly recommend this course, and any other taught by Eric Sargis!!",
    "An excellent course for major and non-majors alike. Professor Sargis takes the respective interests and previous academic experiences of his students into account in a practical way , making this class neither a gut nor a torture - one of the best science professors I've encountered at Yale. Thoughtfully taught and enjoyable, even for someone who only took this class for an SC credit."
