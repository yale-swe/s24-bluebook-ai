    "I would recommend this course to any student interested in neuroscience. I'm not particularly a big fan of only memorizing facts, and some of the details tested on the tests were quite specific.",
    "Here's the deal. PSYC 160 is an awesome class no matter what your major. You will come to realize that we're not as high-level as we think, that our brains are machines that execute complex processes on the boundary of sentient thought and mechanistic determinism. There are these incredible findings of neuroscience and psychology, like \"the interpreter,\" the underlying systems in play in Huntington's and Parkinson's diseases, or long-term potentiation as a critical mechanism of memory. You can't escape the fact that your brain will determine almost all facets of your life. This is a difficult and demanding class, has no BS homework or reading assignments, but you will learn a ton of applicable information. Changes the way you think about how you think... Think about that one.",
    "It is a hard course, and takes a lot of reviewing\/memorizing to get a good grade, but definitely doable.",
    "If you have any interest in neuroscience and abnormal brain functioning and have found the absence of a Neuroscience major at Yale more than annoying, but all means take this class. The lectures were so interesting and packed with information on structural anatomy. Although some social neuroscience and psychological experiments were covered, this is definitely a class aimed at structural anatomy and structural disorders. Some I personally did not mind putting in hours of studying for the midterms because the material was so interesting. Some case studies will actually blow your mind and Professor McCarthy makes it very engaging by incorporating patient videos. He is additionally much more available than I expected. Most students did not take advantage of his office-hours every week which is unfortunate. I took this class first-semester of freshman year and although it was difficult to keep up with peers who had taken multiple psychology classes, but I ended up scoring very high so don't let this discourage you from taking the class.",
    "Typical Psych lecture. Study your notes and pay attention! You'll be just fine. Good way to get the \"Science\" requirement for the Psychology major.",
    "Take note of this quote on the syllabus, \"I HAVE AN AMBITIOUS AGENDA.\" Do not take this lightly. If you are ready to be bombarded with ridiculous amounts of information about the brain and then be expected to know ALL of it on exams, please take this course. Warning: it is a highly accelerated introductory course. It hardly feels introductory by how much information is expected to be known. I personally loved what we learned, but when it came down to the exams, it was a disaster because I am not good at rote memorization. Take this class with a grain of salt friends... be very careful.",
    "If you need to take it, then take it. If not I'll advise you to audit the class.",
    "The material is interesting. But be ready to memorize a lot of stuff.",
    "Super hard. Way too much information & I would only take if super interested in the topic, if you have background, or if you absolutely have to. Take Cog Sci instead if you can",
    "I recommend this course to those interested in psychology, because it's good, and to those looking for a science credit that is not a gut, because it's also difficult.",
    "Great class to take if you're interesting in psychology, the brain, or want an interesting science credit.",
    "It's a science class. It's a hard class. It doesn't have the reputation it has for no reason. If you're willing to put in the work and you like the brain, it can be a really cool class. I would recommend this class to people interested in psychology, but there are better, less stressful classes for someone just looking for a science credit.",
    "Human Brain is a very content heavy course, which means you should count on 5-10 hours of studying for each midterm and a bit more than that for the final. But if you commit that kind of time, it's not hard to do well -- the exams are almost entirely memorization. McCarthy is a solid teacher, and though you cover a huge amount of material, it's usually explained in sufficient depth such that all the experimental findings make sense. Not life-changing, but if you're interested in neuroscience, it's a good course to take.",
    "It's a very interesting course if you are interested in learning about the technicalities of the brain. It's definitely not easy nor is it a gut, and you will need to put in a considerable amount of studying to do well in the course. But in the end it is very rewarding and fascinating.",
    "Brain is a great class if you want a science credit and you're willing to work a bit. It's super interesting material, and you can get a ton out of the class. Very easy to do well in too if you put in the work.",
    "Great introduction with engaging lectures. I took the course because it was required for my major, but ultimately became my favorite course of the semester. It's a good amount of work going into the tests. If you use Professor McCarthy's notes that he uploads and start early, you'll do wellthe material on the tests is straightforward. Ended feeling like I learned a lot from the course.",
    "Maybe I shouldve looked at the syllabus more closely, but this class was not what I expected. McCarthys focus is heavily experimental, and the course content is based much more on psychology than biology\/physiology (perhaps this is why its listed in the PSYC department). While experimental methods and studies are interesting to most people, it felt like less of a cohesive, comprehensive introduction to the physiological basis of human behavior and more of a haphazard collection of esoteric psych studies that we had to cram-memorize before every test. (That may just be the nature of neuroscience, though, since the brain is such an enigma.) Grade-wise, you need either a good memory or a healthy dose of interest in the subject to do well (or both). You dont have to do any work for this class except during the days leading up to the two midterms and the final (the weekly reading responses are an easy 15% of your grade). Its possible that I didnt like the way Prof. McCarthy structured the class because I knew coming into the semester that academic research was squarely outside the realm of possibility, so the emphasis on past and contemporary research was just annoying to me. But if youre interested in psych research, this is probably a fantastic course for you to get an idea of different routes you can take. Prof. McCarthy isnt the most organized in terms of lecture slides or notes, but I cant complain too much because he posted all of his lecture notes online, which are basically the only things I studied (i.e., I didnt take notes in class). As someone who prefers the hard sciences to the soft sciences, I felt like my time couldve been better spent taking a more legitimate SC credit, but I know people who would disagree. On the other hand, Im glad I took this class in the end because it helped me cross out neuroscience from my list of potential majors. So, I recommend this class with caution know yourself and your interests before committing.",
    "If you're willing to attend lecture and to study, you can do well in this course. Absolutely do not take this course if you're expecting it to be a gut. Use Professor McCarthy's notes to study!!",
    "If you are not good at memorizing things, this class is not for you. You need to remember a lot of details, mostly of case studies. We study a lot of different areas of the brain, and then look at symptoms resulting from lesions in these areas. Professor McCarthy is a great lecturer and put in a lot of effort into the lecture notes -which are primordial. Sometimes the material can be very dry, but you'll most probably learn a lot. Just be ready to stay on top of the material and put in a lot of hours to study for each exam!",
    "If you're a nonmajor looking for an SC but don't want a \"gut\" and actually want to learn something important and applicable, THIS IS THE CLASS. It's not too much work other than studying for the three exams - and the lecture material is really eye-opening, fascinating and important.",
    "This class was awesome. Grueling, yes, but I never walked away from an exam feeling like it was unfair or that it was testing the wrong type of knowledge. Professor McCarthy really makes an effort to transmit an understanding of the brain and its systems, not just detailed memorization of different pathways. I worked extremely hard, but I learned enormous amounts, and I am so glad I took the class. That said, if you're on the fence, start it CR\/D. It's a good amount of work, and preparation for the exams is fairly intense. Undoubtedly worth it though, especially if you are interested in the brain. But it is DEFINITELY a neuroscience class, so even though it's in the Psych department, there's a ton of detailed science involved.",
    "The course content is very interesting, but that is often easy to overlook because the lectures are very long and lack hierarchical organization. It is a good introduction to neuroscience, but you'll learn more studying for the exams than from attending lecture. The exams are hard, but doable and the out of class reading required is minimal.",
    "Not an easy science credit. But you learn a lot.",
    "This class has a ton of information and is a good overview of neuroscience. The tests are challenging but fair.",
    "This is not a \"science class for non-science majors.\" It's one of the hardest courses I have taken at Yale so far. The exams are incredibly hard and the final is unnecessarily hard to the point that it's just kind of rude. Take this Credit\/D, even if you're a psych major, because the stress is not worth it.",
    "Amazing! This was the most thought-provoking class I have taken at Yale in 5 semesters. Studying the nuances of the operations of the human brain changes the way you look at yourself and other people as you go about your daily life. I highly recommend this class to anyone who's interested in putting in the work necessary to really excel in this class. Professor McCarthy has taught this class enough that he has it down to a pretty exact science - there are no 'bad' lectures, no readings or studies that feel irrelevant. He's really engaging, and quite funny. Dude also has like 40,000 citations. He da man. You've gotta be willing to memorize a lot of stuff, though, if you want to do well! Exams are pretty comprehensive and detail-oriented, and it can be hard to keep all of the lobes and pathways and everything straight. If you like neuroscience, though, you won't find it too burdensome.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student interested in learning more about the brain as well as the reasons behind why humans exhibit some behaviors and preferences; this course is extremely interesting and the lectures are always backed with notes that summarize the material covered during class. The class is fast paced, but it is definitely worth it for the type and amount of information learned.",
    "This was the best class I've taken at Yale. The workload is never an issue, and the class is never unnecessarily difficult. The focus is simply on learning the material, without any unnecessary challenges thrown in. It covers a large amount of material about the human brain, which warrants a fair amount of studying for the midterms and final, but the material is genuinely very interesting. Professor McCarthy is a fantastic lecturer, and is extremely supportive and helpful if you ever need anything. I absolutely would recommend this course, especially if you're interested in the brain, or how the mind works. The course covers a lot of lower level details about the brain and how it works, but also uses this information as a jumping-off point for larger discussions about the mind, and the implications of neuroscience with regard to our mental lives and capacities.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to a student looking for a really thorough, interesting, and challenging intro to the brain. It's a GREAT way to get a rigorous and interesting science credit for non-science majors. It's definitely not a gut, and probably dipped my GPA a lot more than something like Issues Approach would have, but I learned a ton about the brain and scientific method and genuinely really enjoyed this class.",
    "It was a boring course that taught a lot of the important fundamentals that are required to understand Neuroscience. McCarthy is a boss, but the course suffered from overwhelming amounts of material and rather unstructured lectures. Reviewing for the exams was difficult, but it was a course that you should definitely take if you want to obtain a basic grasp of how the field of neuroscience has progressed.",
    "Really great course for a student interested in the different parts of the brain and how they contribute to our behavior\/emotions\/cognition, etc. Students will enjoy the course more and do better in it if they are very good at memorizing a lot of facts.",
    "Overview of our understanding of the human brain. Mixes neuroscience with psychology. Not easy, but very rewarding if you put in the time. Definitely amenable to those without a scientific background. I highly recommend if!",
    "I would only recommend it to someone who is a psych major.",
    "Absolutely! This class was fairly difficult, but it was certainly worth the time. I learned so much through just a semester, and all the lectures were extremely engaging. I really enjoyed this class!",
    "If you are interested in neuroscience, I would definitely recommend the class to another student because the content was useful in learning more about the field and I feel as though I learned a great amount. I'm now more confident that I wish to pursue the field of neuroscience since I'm passionate about the brain.",
    "Best class I've taken at Yale. Yes, it's hard. The exams are hard. But professor McCarthy makes himself available every week to answer questions and is an incredibly interesting teacher. I talk about neuroscience all the time now because he made it fascinating.",
    "I liked this class. It's not easy so don't take it expecting it to be an gut science credit. I'm a psych neuroscience major, so I am already interested in the material the class covers, so I knew that I would like it. The professor is a good lecturer, it's a 1pm class in a dark room, and i never once felt like i would fall asleep, because the lectures were engaging.",
    "Psych 160 is a detailed look into the anatomy and neurological function of the brain, examined from many perspectives, from historical to research-based. I would highly recommend it to anyone interested in the neurological aspects of psychology.",
    "This shouldn't be a 100s level PSYC class, because there are higher level psych classes far easier than this one. I took this because I wanted a challenge, I wanted to learn about the brain, and the professor is amazing. I loved the class throughout, except the few nights before each midterm and the final. Horrible horrible times studying and memorizing the countless details McCarthy holds you responsible for. The final is cumulative, which means you're responsible for 1500+ slides for the final. Great class though.",
    "This course was fine. I 'learned' a lot of information but the course was less about human behavior than I thought. It was more, this part of the brain lights up when... and this one when... and this one when... and dorsamedial frontal, and ventrolateral gyri, and angular cingulate.... The lectures were well done and the lecture notes were (*kissing sound*) magnifico, I just wasn't interested in the course topic. There were one or two articles that were like OOOHHH SO COOL. But they were about behavior and the origin of cognition. ^^But those articles were NOT like the course at all. The course was more about how THIS part of the brain lights up when a monkey touches himself, and THIS one when he eats cheese, and THIS one when he THINKS of eating cheese. Not my cup of tea, but you can learn a lot if it is your mug o joe. Also, if youre going to take this course make sure to spend the hour it takes reviewing lecture notes AND slides before or after class. DO NOT try to do this the week of the test. You will pull an all-nighter. By test time you should just need the lecture notes (studying would be relatively painless then). If youre unsure about a topic then, just ask, google it, or refer to the slides. Youll learn a lot if you put in the Love. (TANGENT WHAT THE ARTICLES WERE ABOUT: How ocytocin affects behavior and about how the left hemisphere explains the unconscious actions of the right hemisphere in split brain patients. Therefore is the consciousness in the left hemisphere? And that would make sense since the left hemisphere is better at finding patterns than the right and also has language capabilities. Then is consciousness that pattern-finding capability? Perhaps how in pattern games our left-hemisphere is off the mark because it tries to find reason among the random, this is similar to our consciousness desire to ask questions to find the most likely or fitting theory regarding God, the environment, the nature of people, and about the weirdo asking those questions at all in the first place.)",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. The material is very difficult and we definitely went in depth into many things, but it Professor McCarthy makes the work manageable and the topics extremely interesting. I felt like I learned a lot in this class and I really enjoyed it.",
    "YES! TAKE IT! If you are a science major, it is a breeze. If you are not a science major, welcome to a science class. You have to memorize all of his slides. Don't worry, just do it and you will be fine. People do it all the time. DON'T BUY THE TEXT BOOK. It is useless.",
    "I would recommend this course. It is a lot of information covered in a short amount of time, but most of it is interesting and just good to know. The brain is extremely fascinating and this course does a good job of covering a lot of information regarding it.",
    "I definitely recommend. It's a good one to take Cr\/D because it has no papers, and you'll still learn a TON about the brain.",
    "I would highly recommend. A fascinating look at brain function. Also, Professor McCarthy did a wonderful job of teaching us to look at studies with a critical eye, which I think is an invaluable skill for any scientist.",
    "This is NOT an introductory course! If you have a strong background in neuroscience, maybe this is a class for you, but even if you've taken intro psych classes, they won't help you much in this class. The professor prides himself on the difficulty of the course and doesn't share the curve with students, so good luck trying to figure out if you're passing or not."
