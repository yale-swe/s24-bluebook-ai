    "An in depth study of Kant's Critique of Pure Reason with some background from preceding philosophers and some insight from later commentators.",
    "A beautiful, difficult class on a beautiful, difficult book. Although it takes some work and some imagination to understand exactly that the Critique is about, a systematic look at one of the great philosophical texts is a journey worth the effort. Paul Franks is an expert guide, a Virgil who guides his students with a steady hand and a good sense of humor. It's half-class, half-seminar: a smart guy telling you what the book says (which isn't always clear) with lots of breaks for questions. Very good paper topics, very fairly graded. Interesting secondary reading, as well as careful if limited attention to Kant's predecessors and interlocutors. This class doesn't really demand creativity of its students, and that was fine with me, because I had to do so much work just to understand exactly what the problems were.",
    "This course provides an introduction to Kant's first critiqueit will be helpful for anyone doing work in either the continental or analytic traditions of modern philosophy.",
    "This is a very good introduction to the critique of pure reason. The critique is a seminal book and it is absolutely necessary to anyone who wants to understand the development of the history of Western philosophy. Take it if you're a philosophy major. Not sure if it would be very interesting for others though."
