    "This is a difficult course where you have to spend an incredible amount of time in lab. Don't take 5.5 or 6 credits if you're taking this-- 5 is hard enough.You learn a LOT though. I've learned more about designing and building circuits in this course than I have in my others combined. Also prepare yourself for a very competitive atmosphere. There are prizes for all the labs and for other little assignments where the professor pits you against one another.",
    "This class is a LOT of work. Take easy classes and only four credits if you take this class with Koser. You do learn a lot though about op-amps and useful devices.",
    "Do not take this if you dont have to",
    "This class is the beast of all electrical engineering courses. If taken with Prof. Koser, be prepared to spend many long nights in lab with assignments that are literally one-page descriptions. At the end of the course, you will be able to build a mos amplifier that beats the 741 specs and you'll have put together an amazing final project, but at the cost OF YOUR SANITY!!Should definitely be worth more than it is, but at the end of it you'll really feel like an engineer!",
    "If Hur Koser is teaching it, you will learn a lot but probably hate him for the amount oftime he demands from your schedule. It's ridiculous. And the best part is he \"doesn't want the class to be a burden.\" Either he has seriously miscalculated the time necessary to complete his assignments or just demands more than he should from students who take more than 1 class.",
    "Great class, don't take it with too much other work. Be prepared to sit in lab for 15 hours a week though. Super rewarding at the end of it, but if you don't like lab, don't take it.",
    "Yes, if workload is decreased or no. of credits is increased.Mandatory for EE ABET majors.",
    "Koser was a good instructor. His method of selecting random students to go up to the board to solve problems with the class proved to be excellent. He managed to cover an unimaginable amount of material in a way that really gave us a solid conceptual understanding. Furthermore, he was always very available to help us in the lab. The only complaint is that his projects demanded a ridiculous amount of time spent in labs. Seriously, we should have turned all those hours spent in lab into a fullcredit."
