    "I think Mol&Rad is an excellent mid-level course for students who wants to learn more about the theories and applications of spectroscopy in physical sciences. I find this course very rewarding and helpful in my future studies and research. I would surely recommend this course to other students.",
    "Yes, I learned many new stuff in this course.",
    "It is a very important course for the theory of spectroscopy and quantum chemistry as a whole. I would recommend it to any physical chemistry student as well as students from other areas of chemistry who are good with physics. I would also advise them that this is a challenging course and serious effort must be put into it",
    "yes because a lot was learned",
    "Have to put in honest work. There is no way to play catch up late in the semester.",
    "Chem 540 is a review of undegrad p-chem and an introduction to the quantum that governs spectroscopy with an enphasis on NMR. Yes I would recoment this class to other students, particularly those interested in physical chemistry or spectroscopic research."

    "This course has been extremely helpful for my future study and research on quantum mechanics and spectroscopy. I have always wanted to learn more about the theories of NMR, UV, IR when I was taking undergrad Pchem courses, and this course is just for it! By taking this course I feel now I am more informed about the physics of the interactions between radiation and matters and it serves as a good beginning for my future studies in these fields.",
    "It provides basic theoretical knowledge for future research.",
    "This class has deepened my understanding of quantum chemistry and the methods employed in analyzing various systems. It has helped me understand spectroscopy at a more fundamental level, and I hope this will help me produce better work when I start research and using these spectroscopic methods",
    "I want to be a spectroscopist so lerning where slection rules come from and abour Fermi's golden rule are important to my futur goals. This knowledge will help me use and talk about my instruments and research more inteligently."
