   "comments": [
    "The course juxtaposes Soviet and German interwar avant-guard movements, would be interesting for anyone interested in Soviet or German avant-guard, or both.",
    "Yes. Anyone interested in the history of avant-garde art and practicing how to contextualize art should take this class.",
    "The course comprehensively studies the art and associated politics of the interwar period in Germany and Russian. I am a German major and have encountered Russian figures, texts, politics, etc. over the course of my studies, so this course gave me a chance to build on what I've learned. I thought it was fun to go \"travel\" back and forth between Moscow and Berlin and compare the artists and movements from each center.",
    "Yes: you will learn much, but must be self-motivated.",
    "I would definitely recommend the course to students who want a general, yet rich, introduction to Moscow or Berlin in the interwar period, guided by two amazing professors. However, if you are the kind of student who really likes to focus on one thing, writer, or topic at the time, this might not be the course for you. This course is more like a grand scale introduction.",
    "I think if the course is restructured somewhat so as to have a little more background information all of the students can have in common for discussions, and if the classes themselves are somewhat more organized as well, it could be an excellent course. As it was, it felt like a bit of a grab bag, both in the individual class meetings and overall, at the syllabus level.",
    "Yes, if you're interested in the cultural history of twentieth century Europe"

   "comments": [
    "It was a highly focused approach to avant garde aesthetics and applications, allowing us to see the correlation between the invention of radical forms of art and the reform of a social structure.",
    "I am interested in the politics, philosophy and art of Germany in the 20th century. I will be writing my thesis for the German major next term (Spring 2016) about the politics of East Germany, and this course provided a tremendous education in the period leading up to the partition of Germany after the Second World War.",
    "I got lots of new ideas, and saw parallels between Germany and Russia that I had not seen before.",
    "It was very helpful for me to gain a greater knowledge of Weimar-era film.",
    "Katie and Katerina come from different disciplines and their input was invaluable to me, as they knew of sources I did not. If you're looking for a topic idea in this period or want a better idea of the theoretical and historical debates around this period, take this course."
