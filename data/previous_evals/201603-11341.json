    "It was great.",
    "All of the concepts were thoroughly discussed and having regular assignments helped ensure we understood everything covered in class. My biggest complaint has to do with how this class is usually set up; our TA made a point of stressing how the repertoire related to other concepts of music outside of European sensibilities. Had I not taken this particular section, I think I would've been deprived of a lot of what made this class engaging and not just informative.",
    "This course varies greatly depending on the instructor; the syllabus is somewhat lacking and focuses especially on the Western European tradition, but many professors are willing to stretch the material to broader and more fundamental concepts",
    "I felt that this course was very well designed, and enough time was spent on difficult concepts."

    "Absolutely! Andrew is a fantastic instructor, although it is unfortunate to hear that this is his last semester teaching. Mus211 is otherwise a very well-structured and effective course.",
    "Yes, it got me excited about music theory for the first time.",
    "I would recommend this class to other students; its very informing and the class is manageable if you put in the effort.",
    "This is a wonderful course for what it teaches; that is, chromatic harmony and form",
    "Very much so. Whether you major in music or not, for those interested in music theory this course will serve as a wonderful way to delve into extremely interesting concepts."
