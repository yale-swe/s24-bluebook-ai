    "Decent class. Marci Shore is a great lecturer, and the material is fascinating. However, the readings are vastly insufficient to gain any real understanding of the material, and we moved through the material so quickly that the connections between ideas were tough to see for ourselves - instead, we had to take Prof. Shore's word for them. Extremely survey, but gives you a good idea of the sorts of things people were thinking about in the 20th century. A very good 5th class or audit - you don't get much out of the single paper, midterm, or final.",
    "A great fifth class. Genuinely interesting material. Short, but dense readings (that are fully covered in lecture), a long, but doable midterm, one essay and a final...really basic history class structure. Professor Shore is wonderful\u0097extremely knowledgeable and relates great\/helpful anecdotes.",
    "History 271 gives a brief overview of philosophy in the 20th century, and places that thought in a historical context. I would recommend the course to anyone who feels that he or she does not already know the material. The course was particularly effective for me as someone who does not study philosophy, in part because the questions it brings up about epistemology are incredibly relevant to other fields of study. I feel that I understand my own discipline (economics and political science) much better for having taken this course.",
    "Intellectual History is a summary of recent intellectual thought that anyone wanting to live an active intellectual life, or even really anyone who reads, so everyone, should take. If you like thought, I would recommend this class absurdly highly. Not too much work, and eye-opening in so many ways, and, again, really great and enjoyable lectures. Readings are occasionally tough, but there isn't too much, and most are explained in the lectures, and it's great to have this kind of chocolate-sampler of readings picked out for you.",
    "I LOVED this class. Amazing lectures, where you sit back and listen to the fabulous \"stories.\" Well, it could have been even better if we could type the notes, but she banned the use of laptops so it was often frustrated attempt to capture all the essence of her lecture that was full of fruitful& enriching information. Anyhow, this class gives you a nice background and overarching historical trend in the history of intellects and idea. I would not hesitate to take something like this again, and I wish I had a class like this every semester. Just fabulous.",
    "An enjoyable fifth class (would recommend credit-ding it, which I did not do). Don't expect to go too in depth into the philosophers, but do expect to have fun listening to lectures and doing the minimal amount of reading. Good for defining terms you've heard people throw around but aren't really sure what they mean (post-structuralism, Hegel, etc)",
    "Good sampler of big ideas (exposure, not depth). Shore is good at giving you the key points.Good Credit\/D.",
    "Take it. The reading is not overwhelming, the lectures are fantastic, and you come out feeling like you really understand the course of European thought over the last couple centuries. If Prof. Shore is teaching, at least shop it. She weaves together history, philosophy, and anecdotes in an engaging and profound way.",
    "TAKE IT. A perfect into to the history of philosophy class. While you don't get to spend much time on each philosopher, you get a good sense of the general arc of European intellectual history in the 19th and 20th centuries. I actually found section for this class really enjoyable because you get to sit and think about gigantic questions like \"what does it mean that God is dead?\" Also, Marci's lectures are amazing. I loved going to lecture (honestly, it's true) and the reading is very manageable.",
    "Take this class! It's that one philosophy course that can satisfy that voice in your head saying, \"I don't know anything about philosophy, and I should probably learn something about it before the end of college.\" Especially good as a fifth class, but you MUST go to lecture. Heavy emphasis on knowledge of the terms on midterm and final.",
    "yes. i have a feeling that Marci Shore is about to become one of Yale's most popular professors. most enthusiastic teacher that I've had. she is exceptional at explaining difficult concepts in an easily-understood manner.",
    "Yes!! Take it!! A fantastic overview and when else would you have the chance to learn the most important philosophy of the 20th century?",
    "Take this class, but don't be fooled into thinking you'll have anything more than a shallow grasp of any individual post-Nietzschean philosopher. You'll hear a lot about the personal lives of them in lecture--which is great, because they're super interesting--and you'll read, like, ten pages out of Being and Time--which is totally enough to get any sense of Heidegger, right? Ha!Yeah, you're not going to get anything more than a taste of anything, but that's definitely a good reason to take this class. It's helped me clarify my interests and understand exactly what I want out of future classes. And you'll hear a lot about Hannah Arendt's affair, which is definitely worth listening to.Your TA is everything. Shop individual sections. I definitely regretted this when I got my midterm back and realized that I was stuck with the harshest TA.",
    "If you don't have any philosophy background, YOU MUST TAKE THIS CLASS BEFORE YOU GRADUATE. Is it only cocktail-party level knowledge of most of the thinkers? Yes. If you're looking to go really in-depth on the material, you're either going to need to find the right section or a totally different class. But if you, like me, knew nothing of great thinkers of the past two centuries before coming in, it's an incredibly interesting topic that's presented in an accessible and exciting way. It was one of those classes that I left every day with a smile. Reading load is totally manageable, as are the exams.",
    "I actually think this is one of the best classes I've taken at Yale -- it might be my favorite. It's a gentle, low-pressure tour through the lives and thought of some of the greatest thinkers of the last two centuries. Marci Shore is a delightful lecturer: she summarizes and concisely deals with a lot of complex thought, distilling it without simplifying it, and she brings an element of human emotion and drama to the cascade of crazy individuals that make up intellectual history. You will fall in love with Mayakovsky in her lecture on the avant-garde and feel totally heartbroken during the Heidegger controversy lecture. I wish this was a year-long course. Take it as early during the course of your Yale career as possible, because you'll want the rest of your time at Yale to build on some of the thought you encounter in this course. TAKE IT. The readings are really, really minimal and all primary source-stuff (make time for them; there's not that much and it's so worth it to say you've read [part of]Phenomenology of Spirit or Being and Time). Not much work at all: a midterm, a 6-8 page paper and a final exam. Definitely worth it, and it will add a bright spot to your schedule.",
    "This class was amazing. I took it as a supplement to some other classes that covered the same material, and Marci Shore's enthusiasm was a great for motivating me to do some of the drier reading. The class mostly focuses on philosophy and theory throughout time though, and less with literature. And although Professor Shore contextualizes a lot of the texts we read historically, most of them aren't historical in nature. If this is what you're looking for - an overview of theoretical and philosophical thought dealing with the death of god - take this class! Even with (but maybe not instead of) other classes that cover similar material.",
    "A high-lecture based look at the evolution of philosophy. Requires a lot of self-motivation and the reading is quite dense. Worth knowing if you put the work in.",
    "I would recommend HIST271 if you really like philosophy. I thought the emphasis would be on history, however I think the title of the course is misleading in that it is almost exclusively about philosophy\/philosophers. That being said, Marci Shore is a great lecturer and readings are not really necessary as long as you take good notes in class. Overall, it wasn't really what I was looking for but if you like philosophy and abstract concepts then I'm sure you'll love it. A solid choice for the hipster crowd.",
    "If you are interested in the topic you won't be disappointed, but if you are a humanities major or already knowledgeable about the material, you should probably look for something less broad and more in depth, because it can seem very introductory at times and the readings are very short.",
    "This is one of the best history lectures I have taken. It taught me how to think about history, about the world, and about the world of ideas. I cannot recommend it more highly. I wish we had done a little more on material not related to Marxism\/Communism\/Death of God, but I understand that this is the scope of the course. It's just that I was hungry for material. Marci Shore is the coolest.",
    "Such a great course. Professor Shore takes extremely difficult material and makes it approachable and manageable. The midterm and the final were a bit excessive on the IDs - 10 IDs AND an essay in 50 minutes? 20 IDs on the final plus an essay? No one has the patience to sit through 20 identification questions and then write an essay - but Professor Shore compiles all the seemingly disparate thinkers of the 20th century and creates a narrative for understanding the material. A bonus is that it's a lecture sort of geared towards underclassman, so if you're a senior taking it like I was, it's going to seem even more \"manageable\" than it already is. The midterm and final were a bit excessive - too many IDs and not enough time - but hopefully they'll fix that if enough people complain. Not a reason not to take the course, though.",
    "Excellent survey class. As a science major, I loved being able to walk in and feel like the material was accessible. Prof. Shore does a phenomenal job at turning the history into a story, while still explaining the core philosophical concepts in enough detail to make them worthwhile.",
    "Definitely.",
    "Great history lecture",
    "This class is a great overview of European intellectual history in the 19th and 20th century. While at times it seemed a bit too cursory, the class did live up to the catch phrase, \"the second half of DS in one class,\" as it was described to me by another student. Prof. Shore is a fantastic, riveting lecturer and the readings are incredibly engaging, although sometimes disappointingly short.",
    "YES! this course changed my life. Such a straight-forward and comprehensible way to understand these major thinkers. If you're interested in philosophy but are afraid to take philosophy courses this is the course for you! Scratch that: if you are interested in any of the humanities at all THIS IS THE COURSE FOR YOU. everything will be revealed and everything you've studied will make sense.",
    "Professor Shore covers a lot in this lecture, and that's a big aspect of the course. If you're looking for an in-depth study of the thinkers, this is probably not the course for you. If, however, what you're looking for is a sampling of modern Western thinkers, this class is really great. I came out of it with a real desire to go out and read the thinkers in more depth and take more classes. Professor Shore's method of lecturing is not for everyone, but I found herto be wonderful. She approaches everything with a sort of bubbly excitement that's absolutely infectious.In terms of work, the readings are not too long, although they're not very consistent so some are much longer than others and some are much more opaque. There's one paper in the course, and it's really not bad. It's due right after Thanksgiving and is only 8 pages. The midterm is very manageable if you study a bit and the final is basically two midterms stacked together.",
    "Glossary course without an overbearing amount of reading or assignments.",
    "Easy fifth class that will give you a good intro to the intellectual currents of the 20th century. Prof. Shore is a great lecturer and does a good job summarizing the complicated ideas of the 20th century. But it can sometimes get frustrating if you already know the basics, because the class is an intellectual history class and doesn't go much into the depth of any one thinker.",
    "I would recommend this course, however if you have never heard of people like Hegel or Husserl before I would be ready for a lot of confusion. Prof. Shore is an excellent and entertaining speaker, however she tends to go off on side stories. Also, lectures deal primarily with the historical context in which a philosopher is writing, however this information is mostly useless for exams. Readings range from half an hour to 3 hours, not counting extra research you may have to do to understand what you are reading.",
    "Yes, if you want an overview of all the thinkers in the syllabus.",
    "Yea take it.",
    "Take this if you can get through very boring primary sources.",
    "Great class, continental philosophy is so much more interesting than analytic, though analytic may be a bit closer to solutions. If you like romantic thought and writing, if you like philosophy but want to get away from the stuffiness so prevalent in Yale's department, then take continental philosophy and learn that. It's great for literary theory, it's great for thinking of big questions in a more abstract, joyful way. It's not step 1, step 2, bring about step 3, it's not that linear, it's really just a bunch of people trying to make sense of their lives, and it'll help you do so as well. Take this class.",
    "An interesting class. I'm glad I took it as the lectures were some of the more interesting of my other classes. I feel more well-rounded after having taken it. But, it does take some work.",
    "take it.",
    "History 271 is an overview of all of the modern thinkers who you've heard about but never had the chance to read. For me, the class went into just the right amount of depth on each thinker, and it was a great intro to philosophy. Professor Shore as a great lecturer and the workload isn't too much. Definitely a class to consider.",
    "It's a good way to get a little familiarity with philosophers and thinkers you'll hear about a lot, and may pique your interest enough to get you to read more of your favorite thinkers.",
    "I would suggest this class to anyone. It is a good survey course in philosophy and is interesting and has a small workload.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course! I really loved it\u0097the lectures were really gripping\/ interesting and I learned a lot.",
    "If you are looking for an introduction to contemporary intellectual thought absolutely take this class. Professor Shore is fantastic! The reading is very manageable considering how much material is covered.",
    "Great lecture class that really changes the way you think. While it is a survey of thinkers and you don't expect to be an expert of any of the philosophers, it gives you a wonderful idea of how these thoughts progressed and are interconnected. Professor Shore is an amazing lecturer\u0097should definitely try to take a class with her."
