    "YES. Take it. Reading the books felt like pleasure reading. And it opened up my eyes to a lot of authors I had neve heard of. And there was such an array of cross-listed students in there.",
    "This course was absolutely phenomenal. Hazel Carby is by far the best seminar teacher I've had at Yale. If you like science fiction, if you like social history, if you like citing in classrooms that are incredibly rigorous but also gentle and nurturing to the core ... TAKE. THIS. CLASS. Professor Carby is great. The assignments are great. The class report ends up being great. What else can I say? Did I mention TAKE THE CLASS AT ALL COSTS?",
    "This class is good but since presentations took up the entire class session for most of the semester, class discussion largely depended on your classmates and peers. The reading list is fantastic and features a lot of books I never would have found on my own, and the mix of people that this class attracts is interesting - many different majors were represented. Professor Carby is extremely likeable and knowledgeable, but I wish she had played a larger role in facilitating discussion.",
    "EXCELLENT. Take it: this is the way every class at Yale is. You really have the opportunity to discuss the larger issues at stake in our world today. Professor Carby will blow your mind away.",
    "This is a pretty good course, especially if you enjoy reading. The readings overall were focused quite a bit on dystopian futures, so be ready to read about the apocalypse. A lot. A lot rides on your classmates, so take a look around on the first day and make sure you'd like to spend a semester talking to them.",
    "Yes. The only thing that was difficult was the time of the class. Monday mornings at 9:20 are not fun.",
    "This is a fascinating class that gives you a somewhat eclectic survey of science fiction, often focused on authors who are in some way marginalized from the canon of science fiction. I could not recommend Professor Carby more--she is quite amazing. The class is largely student-run, so your experience will definitely depend on who is in your class. But in any case, you have to take a class with her before you leave! She is not to be missed.",
    "Fictions of Imminent&Imaginary Futures is excellent. A great seminar that allows you both to read books you probably wouldn't have, and explore the boundaries of science fiction while challenging your conceptions of past, present, and future. Professor Carby is a very good facilitator of these discussions, and makes it enjoyable to come to class. Even though it is a book a week, take it.",
    "Take it. I wish everyone could take this course, or at least some course, with Hazel Carby.You will be floored, inspired, disturbed, humbled, encouraged, expanded. And then some.You will find outlets for and appreciation of your creativity and unique approach to texts and subjects, and will be able to take part in important and critical conversations, from unexpected starting points - namely, \"fictions.\"Last but not least, you'll learn a great deal from your peers, and have the chance to study with an unparalleled scholar and teacher.",
    "read sci fi and talk about it, how it reflects the current state of affairs.",
    "Basically, Fictions of Imminent Futures is a course where you use speculative fiction and the \"sci-fi\" imaginary as a platform to discuss everything from race to religion to economics to gender to sex to national myths, what have you. If you enjoy reading satire or social critiques and have ever wondered about apocalypse or encountering an \"alien other\", this class is for you. If you see literature as an archive, an intrinsic part of cultural memory and the project of history, this class is right up your alley. If you want to talk about robots,klingons and such, beware that this class is not so much about science fiction as it is about the speculative imaginary. But if you are down to talk about klingons as a proxy for post-Civil rights race relations then come on board;"
