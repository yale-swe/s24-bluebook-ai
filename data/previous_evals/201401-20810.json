   "comments": [
    "A great language course for anybody who is interested in Japanese, but involves a lot of work and requires much effort.",
    "JAPN 120 requires a lot of work every night. I had to work anywhere from 1 to 3 hours on daily assignments every night. The teachers are fantastic and funny and make every class fun and interesting. It is easy to succeed if you put in the required work.",
    "I would strongly recommend Japanese to another student, so long as they know what they're getting into. Expect to spend no less than 3 hours per day (including class time) on the class, and realize that you will often spend much more. That said, the amount of Japanese you learn in just two semesters is incredible. To future seniors considering taking the class: do not take more than 3.5 credits including Japanese while you are writing your senior essay. You will have to compromise your performance on one or the other if you have more than three classes. That said, this is a tremendously fun way to cap off senior year. Don't let the freshman prodigies get to you, do the work, and you'll be fine!",
    "I would highly recommend Japanese to another student. I think the people make the class. The team of professors is wonderful, and I always looked forward to seeing them outside of class at language tables. The students are also great and the sections are small enough that you can really get to know your classmates if you choose. I became very good friends with some of the people in my class. There is a lot of work (average of 2-3 hours a day), but I was continually impressed with how much Japanese I was learning, and I took pride in doing my work. I had no prior knowledge of Japanese culture, and I found it really interesting to have a look at the unusual culture of this country."
