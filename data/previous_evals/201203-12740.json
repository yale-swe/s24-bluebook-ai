   "comments": [
    "Complexity theory is a really cool topic if you liked the NP stuff at the end of algorithms. Professor Feigenbaum teaches this material well, despite her reviews in other classes. I would definitely recommend shopping it and seeing how you like her teaching style. The psets are challenging, but not overwhelming.",
    "Recommended if you are serious about studying computer science; Should definitely take if you are interested in the general field of computation theories. Be prepared to spend a lot of time on homework assignments though.",
    "Do it! So much fun. If you enjoyed the NP unit of algorithms, you'll love this course. It's challenging and it helps to have a study group. This material changed the way I think about problems.",
    "I would recommend this course to those who are interested in the concept of Complexity, from any perspective, and can handle the extremely rigorous work. As a non-computer science major, I was a little out of my depth, but got through it. The work is hard but interesting, and Professor Feigenbaum is great.."
