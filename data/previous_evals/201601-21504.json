    "I think the yearlong was very rewarding. Stressful at times but it felt so nice to produce a big body of work like that. You are also able to spend a semester studying what YOU want to study and not have to take tests just develop background which was great!",
    "This is required for them major--not really an option. I was really disappointed by my entire senior essay experience. Bill Summers is incredibly unhelpful and unresponsive to any of my requests for help and questions. The department is desperately disorganized and underresourced. Ask your upperclassmen friends for suggestions on the essay experience. When you pick your adviser choose a high tenure ladder professor so they have bigger pull on the grading process and more experience in advising you. When picking a grader choose lower ladder. This entire experience was really disheartening and disappointing for my \"pinnacle\" experience.",
    "I would definitely recommend a full-year HSHM senior thesis. It allows you to drive into a subject about which you are passionate. I loved getting close with my thesis advisor and engaging with primary sources. It was fun, rewarding, challenging, and exciting and I will remember my thesis and the process of writing it for a very, very long time.",
    "You Have to take this, I don't know what it is, but it's nice to get a credit."
