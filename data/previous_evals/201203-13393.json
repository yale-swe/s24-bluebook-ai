   "comments": [
    "If you want to learn how to write well, or even if you already think you can, you should take this class. It will change the way you think.",
    "You're not taking this class for the A. You're taking it to spend three hours a week in the presence of Cynthia Zarin. She's brilliant, she's funny, she kicks butt. Take it.",
    "English 120 focused on reading and writing pieces that used personal anecdotes to make a point. Not only is this an engaging and sometimes fun (not if you have other homework) task, but it also helps you learn a little about yourself. The class time is spent discussing essays, and through these essays discussing modern culture, which was always fun and the class flew by. I would absolutely recommend this class. There is a good amount of reading and writing, but by the end of the course it is well worth it as you can see how your writing has improved. In addition, the process of weaving culture with facts and personal anecdotes and drawing connections between all of them is a thought process I think is very valuable.",
    "I would definitely recommend ENGL 120 to another student and encourage them to get Zarin as their professor. Learn a lot, unique to other ENGL classes at Yale, improve writing in ways you wouldn't think of.",
    "Definitely try to get into Cynthia Zarin's section of 120! She is so great - witty and insightful and just awesome. People say English 120 is a lot of work, but don't be put off by that - it was only a few hours of reading and a few hours of writing a week, and I found it totally reasonable.",
    "Make sure to take this course with Professor Zarin! I had several friends say that ENGL 120 was not a great experience for them. While I cannot say anything about the other ENGL 120 professors, I can say that Professor Zarin is a fantastic teacher and friend.",
    "Definitely take it--this kind of writing will be important for any career, or even just for living: you learn how to write effectively, without ornament.",
    "If you are at all interested in creative non-fiction, you should take English 120. Not only will your writing improve, but you will be exposed to a ton of amazing non-fiction writing that you might not read in another context.",
    "English 120 was an incredible experience. I hadn't done much creative writing in years, but I gained a lot of confidence. We wrote relatively short essays and had a new prompt every two weeks. The turn-around was quick, and we wrote a lot, which was great. We also read many essays and really broke down the texts. As a result I not only write differently, but read differently as well.Professor Zarin is a dynamic teacher and an amazing resource. She has spent a lot of time doing this kind of writing, so she really knows the ropes (and knows many of the authors whose essays we read). She made a big effort to get to know all of us, and seemed genuinely interested in us as people, not just students.I would definitely recommend taking English 120 with Professor Zarin.",
    "I would highly recommend English 120 to other students, as in addition to helping develop my writing skills, it was also an enjoyable class. The freedom to choose what to write about is both a blessing and a curse; you could choose to write about virtually anything, but finding the topic you wanted to write about could sometimes be the hardest part of the essay. Mrs. Zarin was also a fantastic teacher. In addition to being a great writer herself, she thoroughly understands the craft and how to convey its nuances to others. The readings for the class were, for the most part, very interesting and thought-provoking, and Mrs. Zarin delved deeply into these pieces in class. Overall, I would definitely recommend this class to anyone and everyone on campus.",
    "English 120 is a great environment to write and read creative pieces and I would definitely recommend it to students, especially freshman, as a course to hone their writing skills.",
    "This is a great class for improving your writing skills. Professor Zarin is clearly very smart and very sharp. Somewhat accordingly, she can be pretty intimidating. Her grading and comments, though constructive, are unforgiving.",
    "Every Yalie should take English 120. It just makes you such a better writer, both in style, content, and organization. If you can take it with Zarin, it's worth rearranging the rest of your schedule to make it work. She's tough, but it's completely worth it in the end. My writing definitely improved thanks to her. The workload isn't even all that bad because it's spaced out so evenly. There's really not a reason not to take it.",
    "I would definitely recommend 120 to another student. 120 is a creative writing class, but its lessons can be applied to all types of writing. I now approach writing much more thoughtfully and with a different perspective. The assignments are fun, but the class is a lot of work, and there is sometimes pressure to write or edit by the deadline. Professor Zarin is great. She provided so much detail in her comments, and I really appreciated her guidance. That being said, the first round of comments was overwhelming because her thoroughness was unexpected. The comments are extraordinarily helpful, though. Professor Zarin picked readings that showcased a number of writers and that were simply fun to read. If you are willing to put in the effort, 120 is great.",
    "Fantastic, annoying, challenging and sometimes underwhelming, English 120 will not be a class that you regret taking. Do it."
