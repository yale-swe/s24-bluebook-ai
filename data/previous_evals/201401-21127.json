   "comments": [
    "I definitely recommend it! You learn a lot, and Dr. Toll is great!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course!!!! It is so great if you're into pursuing health",
    "A great and EXTREMELY practical class that makes you not only learn theory but also practise therapy skills. Additionally, the self-change project is an incredible way to promote healthy behvaiour and tackle that problem you've been meaning to fix for a long time.",
    "Overall, pretty good class. You learn lots of applicable life skills, regardless of field of interest. The self-help project is rewarding, but shouldn't be taken lightly. The exams, however, were absolutely ridiculous and didn't measure what you learned, rather, what you could memorize. You are forced to memorize details about every study which you read (there are a lot), and so much of the reading is absolutely pointless. It's a nice 5th class until the exams roll around.",
    "A fantastic course that I absolutely recommend. Definitely take if you have an interest in clinical medicine, psychology, or health behaviors in general. The course spans a wide array of health problems, from smoking to back pain to eating disorders\/obesity to asthma. This course teaches you skills in listening and expressing yourself with empathy, genuineness, and warmth - important skills in whatever profession you ultimately enter. The material is very interesting, and Dr. Toll is a great lecturer. Perhaps the best element of the course is a self-change project through which you strive to improve an element of your behavior (i.e. getting more sleep, working out more, eating better, etc.) using techniques learned in the class.",
    "Chill class. Good experience.",
    "Great class about changing human behavior using mainly one approach called CBT (look it up).",
    "I would definitely reend this course: it is a real world based class that educates you on health behaviors and the american medical system through the lens of psychology.",
    "If you are really interested in pursuing this material in a career, then you should definitely take it!",
    "DEFINITELY TAKE THIS CLASS! The work is not too bad and you actually come away learning a lot. The self change paper was key for me and I would Go so far to say that it changed my life. The readings were interesting and the class itself is extremely interactive. Also, with no section it is not a HUGE time commitment.",
    "Health Psychology is a fantastic course, especially given its real-world, hands-on approach. It is a very practical course, and is incredibly well-taught. The skills taught in the class are applicable both for application within the field of psychology, as well as for within the world at large. Dr. Toll is a wonderful professor who truly cares about his students, both as an instructor and as a psychologist. He works with each individual student on a change project, a project that has an impact beyond the scope of the class, affecting each student's life. Dr. Toll's care and devotion make him the incredible professor he is.",
    "I would recommend Health Psych, because I think it's a very unique class in which you're able to learn material in a very unique way. Professor Toll is also great and he brings in lots of interesting guest lecturers. However, I would warn that the tests are difficult because there's A LOT of information to know and he wants you to memorize theories and models verbatim or you don't get credit so I would warn against that. Also: Make sure you devote a good amount of time to your self-change paper. It's harder than it looks! Other than that, I'd recommend this course.",
    "TAKE THIS COURSE, especially if you are at all interested in clinical psychology. It will surely give you insight into whether the clinical route is something you would be interested in pursuing.",
    "Health psychology is a class that gives you some practical skills for keeping your friends sane. Take it.",
    "Unique class. Take it"
