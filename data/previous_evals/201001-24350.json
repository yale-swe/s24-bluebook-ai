    "Great lab. You learn all sorts of useful skills (I now how to run PCR now!), and you get to play with fossils, butterflies, and fruit flies. They aren't make-believe labs like most intro lab classes make you do - the two semester-long experiments that we ran were actual experiments about whose data actual scientists actually care (ethanol resistance in fruit flies has been going on for a couple years, but the microbiology experiment with the Turner Lab had legit never been done before), and you were given a lot of freedom in how you could approach the data analysis. Though the syllabus may look a little scary, everything is very clearly explained, Julia (the TA) and Professor Caccone were very forgiving of mistakes, and it's a lot of fun.",
    "This lab is fine if you're just starting out in biology. If you have had a few EEB courses, you probably won't get much out of it. The lab reports take too much time for the amount that you'll learn by doing them. If you're not familiar with statistics, you might have some trouble with the analysis in the lab reports. If you are familiar with statistics, you will spend too much time worrying about things they won't expect you to know.",
    "Consider it; it's not your ordinary lab. The atmosphere is relaxed, the class size is small, and most of the experiments are interesting. Expect several easy lab reports and several tedious ones, but also expect to have plenty of support from the TA. Although some experiments will hold you for the full 4 hours, many will not. If you're taking the lecture course, consider giving the lab a try."
