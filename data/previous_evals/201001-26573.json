    "Right place, right time.",
    "yes.",
    "yes",
    "Yes, but it should begin earlier. It is too valuable and there is so much potential material to be covered here for it to be crunched in such a short time frame.",
    "yes",
    "Yes. This is the perfect time to do team design projects.",
    "I felt this class was completely unnecessary and only aided in decreasing the value and quality of our work in other courses. Busy work for no gain, and one too many classes even if it were to be made into a good class.",
    "This is about where it should happen.",
    "Course occured in the proper sequence.",
    "It is kind of strange in sequence with the scale of studio projects moving from first semester into second semester, but I understand why it is how it is.",
    "This course didn't seem to have a very strongly established sense of its role within the curriculum. The sessions with Phil was an interesting side note but the rest of the course was unfocused and drawn out.",
    "There were many overlapping themes between this course and the site and climate\/building technology course. Given the intensity of this semester\u0092s schedule, it might have been better to combine these courses into one.",
    "The building project course as a course itself should be wrapped into the building technologies class that the 1st year is required to take second semester. It should not be its own course.",
    "This was the proper spot for it.",
    "I think it does fall in the proper sequence, but I do not think that it is a good idea to try to combine a studio with the building project. Either one, by itself, is more than enough work to fill a semester. By combining the two, both suffer because there is just not enough time and energy to divide between the two tasks.",
    "Yes.",
    "I think this course could have been combined with the Building Tech class. Then there might have been enough time in the semester to actually learn building methods in a straightforward way.",
    "Yes.",
    "Yes. There is no better way to learn how to actually build a building.",
    "Yes",
    "This course is completely unnecessary. I learned little to nothing from this class. Perhaps, I learned a bit from Phil; however, we will be taking his course our third year. This course should be eliminated. We are spending too much time \"in class\" and not enough time producing."

   "question_text": "Comment on the body of material presented and the content of the course: sequence, syllabus, and assignments.",
   "comments": [
    "It all made sense. The research, then the group stuff. It works.",
    "Appropriate material - good sequencing and very do-able assignments.",
    "Phil Bernstein's lectures in the beginning were interesting although not relevant to BP. Adam's lectures were not particularly insightful or relevant until the studio part of BP began. The sequence of the actual design phase was productive, but should be longer. Also, the SOM lectures seemed pointless until we had actually begun working in groups. It would be much more helpful if the SOM lectures were better timed with group work.",
    "Adam's lectures should be replaced by Alan's building technology lectures.",
    "The section times required to look over assignments for Adam should have been included in the initial syllabus.",
    "Sequence of material was well-designed and well-paced. Assignments were less helpful, as the division of labor in groups often precluded everyone in the group from grasping the whole picture.",
    "The initial part of the class where we were doing weekly exercises was poor. Every group did the work at the last minute without thought or consideration and I didn't really learn anything due to the large groups and rushed format.",
    "This course should be combined with the Building Technology course. Alan's lectures were much more focused and organized and often overlapped with the material covered in this class.the assignments where we had to draw detail sections where useful the times when I personally had to sit down and draw them. Maybe the assignments should be trimmed down to just that portion and it should be assigned to pairs or three person teams.",
    "This course was not very helpful. The lectures were very cursory introductions to the subject matter. The out of glass assignments often included too many components and there was not enough time in the overall schedule to devote to them. The Monday lectures with Phil Bernstein were the best part of the course- they were very informative, although not completely relevant to the actual building project itself.",
    "The body of material had potential to be relevant to what we would be designing during the later part of the semester; however, it was presented very broadly and the goals of the class were never very clear. Phil's portion of the class had a clear goal and the homework exercises asked us to explore building technologies further, but the rest of the lectures seemed to be irrelevant, or at least too broad to really cover anything. This might be why it would be worthwhile to wrap it into the Building Technologies class and have everyone take that course at the beginning of second semester.",
    "I thought that the time that we had to put in the first half of the semester was more that the value we got out of it. Although it was good to discuss the details of how a building would go together in advance of our actual designs, it seems like it could have been combined somehow with building technology and we could have gotten just as much out of it. I greatly enjoyed the second half of the semester and wouldn't change any of that portion.",
    "The early assignments were unnecessary.",
    "The course work is at times overkill and so too is the nature of the project. There is a lot to do, but the truth of the matter is that the work is that of 10, not 50. There are certain people that know what they are doing, and the rest is rather mindless work. If that is the case, rather do my learning in the field and get paid for the matter.",
    "I took this course to mean the sessions we had with Phil Bernstein and Adam Hopfner up until spring break.The course to some degree prepared us for what we would need to do later.However, given the overall pressure on our time, oftentimes for the group assignments only a few students would actually do the work for the assignment, and typically the students who already knew the materials best.",
    "The assignments for this class felt like busywork, and it was difficult for 6 people in a group to share the work equally week to week, so inevitably some people ended up doing much more work than others. This class covered so much, from Adam\u0092s seminar on building techniques, to Phil\u0092s professional practice lectures, to Amy\u0092s SOM team-building exercises, that it was exhausting. I can understand the desire to arm the students with as much information and critical thinking about house-building as possible, and maybe there is no other way to do it, but the course was sort of all over the place until we came to the actual competition.",
    "Generally speaking, the course was well organized with appropriate assignments that would encourage students to start thinking about the upcoming issues regarding the design and construction of the house.",
    "The initial detailing assignments were not useful. This stuff is taught in other courses.",
    "There were too many out-of-class meetings. The assignments, while idealistically appropriate, were not the most effective in inducing learning.",
    "The course seems unnecessary, and the material covered within it could just as easily (and more efficiently and clearly) be read in the students' spare time."

   "comments": [
    "Had no expectations.",
    "I expected to discuss more broader issues concerning siting and affordability, and regret the lack of conversation between professors and peers around these topics.",
    "I expected to learn about details regarding the construction of a house, and this was largely met.",
    "My expectations were that this course would introduce us to issues of building construction and detailing relevant to the building project. My expectations were not met- the content was often of a very general nature and unrelated to the building project, and most of it was a repeat of what I had already learned as part of my undergraduate degree.",
    "Not really. All of the instructors were wonderful when we began designing the building. All were available and had wonderful comments that furthered our design. However, this beginning portion of the class was not only a waste of class time, but it also required us to meet outside of class with the instructors--mandatory meetings during the evening-- that only accomplished taking up more time during our already cramped schedules.",
    "My expectations were that we would design a house that met the clients needs and that we would be able to build, both of which we met very well.",
    "I wanted to participate in the design and building of a house. So far, I think that is what is the class doing.",
    "I was expecting a great sense of the work flow of a built project, yet must say that i know this not to be the model here, but this project is not an efficient or even useful work flow to understand for future use.",
    "I had no expectations for this course.",
    "The course met all my expectations."

   "comments": [
    "All schools should have to do this. Designing something on the computer or in model is fine but it's only half the battle. BP taught all of us that wood studs don't just stick together. There is an assembly of parts and particular techniques that have to be thought of when it comes to a real building. I learned many valuable real world lessons.",
    "Not as valuable as I thought it would be - I expected slightly more from this course.",
    "These course was extremely valuable to me. Learning to cooperate, design and present in a group is a rare challenge in school but one that will certainly pay off in a real career. Again, I wish we had actually talked about affordability, which I think is a very important and contemporary topic in architecture, which we would do well by having some experience with.",
    "The building project is an essential piece of what makes the Yale MArch I program so valuable.I question whether or not it actually achieves any of the social mission which it purports to be about. I understand that there are MANY different parties invested in the outcome of the project, but this seems to create confusion among the students, and does more harm than good.If the building project is about affordable, replicable, accessable housing prototypes, we should have different studio critics, whose design experiences are more in that vein.If it is more about design, the same critics could stay, but the client and program should be changed.Developing a more singular vision for what the building project is about would be VERY helpful to the students designing it each year.I believe that the mission of the Yale Building Project could and should be simpler and clearer.",
    "Learning how to deal with team work is the most valuable experience of BP for me. It felt like, at times, playing soccer with a team composed of 2 very good players, 2 members who never played soccer before, 2 other guys who play well but don't want to play with the rest of the team, and 3 guys who wants to be the coach all the time. It was frustrating, but also extremely interesting. It presented analmost unique situation, and I feel some of the experiences will be transferable in an office setting, and others won't apply at all. What's really confusing in the end is that, I don't know what I would have done differently if I were to do it all over again.",
    "This course was of no value.",
    "Good preparation for building project in the second half of the semester.",
    "We all know that 50 chefs is not a great way to cook a soup. It is a serious problem for which I have no solutions.",
    "I found this course to be incredibly valuable. I think being forced to work in a group on a project that is real, addressed so many real world design issues. The building project was one of the main reasons I wanted to come to Yale and so far it has delivered.",
    "I think I will learn a lot more from the actual building portion of this class.The information from SOM on group dynamics and leadership was interesting, but I didn't see how it really helped in the actually group design work. I could see the ideas working within some kind of cooperate structure but not a bunch of graduate students.",
    "Low. Not worth the effort.",
    "Somewhat, but not much. It did get us down and acquainted with the BP site at an early stage, which meant we could hit the ground running for the actual design portion.",
    "Wonderful! This course was a huge factor in my decision to attend Yale and it did not disappoint!",
    "The actual BP competition, though difficult, was very valuable. I really appreciated the experience in the end, and was proud of the design that my team produced. I only wish that our studio critics somehow took all the work we produced with our team into account for our semester evaluation, because after working hard for a month, there was no recognition of what we had accomplished even though we didn\u0092t win.The SOM exercises were illuminating, though disheartening. Phil Bernstein\u0092s lectures were too unrelated to our task at hand, in the end, even though it was interesting to hear about alternatives to standard construction processes. One lecture from him would have been enough. I like Adam a lot, but he is better in small groups, drawing out details by hand, than in giving lectures to the whole class.",
    "I found this course to be very valuable. Most importantly, it thought me how to work in a large groupof people, with different backgrounds and values, towards a common goal.",
    "It's one of the reasons I came to Yale.",
    "This was valuable in the exploration of construction details, but the class wasn't organized in a way that was conducive to learning. Phil Bernstein class was also interesting in the sense that the subject matter of his class was a slice of reality that we had not yet been exposed to in this school."

   "comments": [
    "The instructors were amazing. They know their stuff. I trust all of them and they were always available when I needed help. Being constantly present to answer questions is a huge deal. We are talking about a real building, so being available to keep people on track is big.",
    "There was a TA?????If you are talking about Andrew Ashey, he was absolutely unavailable at any times.We could have used real input from him, but he was clearly busy with his own stuff.I can't believe he was payed to do that \"job\"",
    "It would be great if each group chose the critics they worked with. Being limited to two was difficult since we didn't agree with one of them 90% of the time. Joeb was constantly proposing radical, expensive ideas that had little to do with our intentions or the direction we had set out for ourselves as a group. Adam was very helpful helpful as a critic because he was open to any new ideas but also very in touch with the actual constraints of building and funding. Alan was also constantly available for feedback, which was excellent.",
    "At the beginning of the course, before internal structure emerged within our teams, the TAs totally saved Adam for his poor organization skills, and helped him to keep track of time during lectures.",
    "Herb was helpful in studio, Paul was always helpful in giving insight. TA's were available and helpful.",
    "our discussion sections were often drawn out and labored over. it would have been more useful if Adam were to redline our assignments accurately as opposed to talk about the mistakes in an offhand cursory way.",
    "Adam Hopfner was knowledgeable and enthusiastic, but did not present the course content in a particularly effective manner. It felt like we were always pressed for time, and that none of the content was really presented in-depth as it ought to have been. Phil Bernstein\u0092s lectures were well-presented and well-organized but they did not seem to relate very well to the rest of the course, or the building project itself.",
    "Course instructors were all great! They all know so much and were available whenever we needed them. However, this course just does not need to be its own class. It is too much on our schedule and until the BP designs actually began, there was no real interaction with the instructors anyway. This course needs to be wrapped into another class.",
    "For the first half this class seemed like a time drain, but I thought that the second half was very effective. In the end I was extremely impressed at the commitment of our instructors to standing up for something they believed in.",
    "The instructors were are very helpful and genuinely seemed like they wanted to help students produce the best work possible.",
    "Adam is a good teacher. However, he does need to stop trying to reach a decision or consensus about times, dates or other things with the group gathered as a whole - it is simply not very effective.",
    "Alan Organschi is an amazing teacher and I feel very lucky to have worked with him. I think Adam is great too, but his presentations are really disorganized and inefficient which was often frustrating just considering our time constraints.",
    "I was unaware that Herb Newman was considered an instructor for this course. I saw him just three times this semester, in reviews for the competition.Phil was very organized but his area of expertise was not really relevant to the task of building a house.Paul is impressively knowledgeable, though not very involved in the actual teaching of the course.Adam did most of the teaching work, and I really enjoyed working with him in small groups and one-on-one to explore building techniques, but his lecture style needs work. He speaks softly and tends to ramble. He also needs to work on organization, or delegate all organizational tasks to the TA--there were too many times when he tried to organize the class based on a show of hands or a quick poll, and everyone's schedules were too different and conflicting for these methods to work.",
    "Even thought I do not think we could do without them, the lectures at the beginning of the semester were a bit \u0093dry\u0094 and not engaging enough. But other than that, I think the preparatory assignments were effective in what they were trying to achieve.",
    "Adam obviously knows his stuff, but sometimes he is disorganized and hard to get a hold of.",
    "Paul was very helpful. Adam could use a little bit of work in managing the timing of his classes and lecture, but was in general enthusiastic and proactive.",
    "While clearly interested and knowledgeable in the material, the instructor presented the material in a very scattered manner that took much more time than necessary."

    "None. You guys know whats up.",
    "Too many meetings outside of class time is not acceptable in my opinion.Instructors should keep it in mind that we have other classes which we need to work for and with our workload this semester sucking up so much of our time - in particular the intense Viz-Studio-Structures combination, I think that my growing qualms with this course were that there were too many outside-of-class time meetings which:1. I didn't find to be particularly helpful2. was just frustrating because it offsets our work schedule for classes the next day or later on during the week3. At one point seemed out of control - we were having two meetings a week not including class time and yet we had just barely started working on BP in studios. Most of these extra meetings took place before studio had even started BP too.The class should be contained as much as possible - 'though its BP semester'.",
    "BP begins earlier in the semester in place of the first, one-week assignment. Groups choose their critics. If BP continues to call itself an experiment inaffordable housing, then the students should really devote some discussion and exploration into how to make the project afforable without accepting donations.",
    "Better coordination with studio course would be great.Less time could be taken with forming discussion groups, project teams and managing students or topics. Overrun of class time was significant.As the work load of the first part of the semester was greater, any time beyond scheduled class period was very precious.",
    "The building project is an essential piece of what makes the Yale MArch I program so valuable.I question whether or not it actually achieves any of the social mission which it purports to be about. I understand that there are MANY different parties invested in the outcome of the project, but this seems to create confusion among the students, and does more harm than good.If the building project is about affordable, replicable, accessable housing prototypes, we should have different studio critics, whose design experiences are more in that vein.If it is more about design, the same critics could stay, but the client and program should be changed.Developing a more singular vision for what the buildingproject is about would be VERY helpful to the students designing it each year.I believe that the mission of the Yale Building Project could and should be simpler and clearer.",
    "Remove this course to lighten up this semester's scheduling.",
    "This course felt unorganized and I learned very little from it. It could be improved by presenting information that is more relevant to the actual building project, and restructuring the assignments sothey are more focused and to the point. Additionally, there was time required to meet with Adam to review the assignments that was not scheduled class time. It was very difficult to find time for these meetings because of the density of the overall schedule; if these sessions are to be required, they should be included formally in the semester schedule.",
    "I think the first half of the course could be combined with Building Tech to talk about the details of a building and could be just as, if not more effective.",
    "I am not sure if the early weekly assignments really helped me very much. They seemed like busy work more than anything. Also I think more rotation or floating critics would help during the final design period. Having only two critics per group was hard in that they just reinforced each other without taking into account other ideas, even those of the students they were trying to help.",
    "Drop it. its time is over. it may be time to look into installation or rebuild work. Building a house in more about the schools ego at this point than an education.time to realize that.",
    "Rethink the assignments to ensure more students gets exposure to the issue - perhaps similar to the Building Technology course were there was only one project but done in groups of two.",
    "In order to keep the productivity and excitement of the students high throughout the summer, it would be beneficial to have a one week break in between the end of the regular semester classes and the beginning of the summer classes (visualization and the building project). I think it would positively affect the attitude and energy of the students that are staying in school two extra months to work on such an exciting project.",
    "This course should be completely integrated with studio (i.e. one course).",
    "The way the class is set up is kind of neither here nor there.Either more commitment to each assignment and less assignments is necessary,or the assignments are smaller but the groups are smaller as well. More class time is also necessary to examine the assignments as a group. The way it stands, there isn't time for people to learn about everything week to week. The division of labor in the big group is not as effective for the tasks assigned.",
    "I would suggest that the course time be used wisely andefficiently and that extra meeting time scheduled outside of the allotted class time be eliminated.",
    "More organization would help tremendously... Adam Hopfner is very capable, but should be far more decisive and authoritative in order to keep the class on course."
