    "This is an incredible class!!! It may seem daunting to work on a translation project throughout the semester, but you'll be helped along the way by Peter Cole, who is the most perceptive editor you could image. The balance between academic discussions and workshops makes it feel as though you've learned a great deal in the class, and that you had a chance to look at your own work with a scholarly eye. The class also brings in really wonderful students who all speak different languages.",
    "The seminar is just as great as everyone describes it, but make note that it is quite time-consuming and intense for a literature seminar, a 2 in 1 sort of deal. Come with some inkling of what you might translate and relative confidence in your language. Leave with a small and intimate group of translation buddies!",
    "Absolutely take this, it taught me a lot about reading and writing and religion and poetry and fiction and translating.",
    "Definitely! Take it if you get in."
