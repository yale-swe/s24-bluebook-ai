   "comments": [
    "A challenging course that solidifies the foundations learned in L1& L2. If you want to get better at the language then take this course.Madame Koizim is the best professor at Yale. She is extremely dedicated and is always prepared for class. A strict corrector and will help you if you ask her. She might be old-schooled but is still up to date with modern life (she responds to emails within a few hours!), a rare phenomenon these days.TAKE THIS CLASS.",
    "I personally felt like my oral french regressed, but my grammar improved. That being said its not a terribly large amount of work, and its worth the time to improve your grammar.",
    "Take it. And take it with Koizim. She's wonderful. Class will never be dull, and you learn so much simply by interacting with her that homework becomes much more manageable.",
    "do it if you want to feel like you actually learned something.",
    "A review of grammar using listening exercises, books, and films. The full amount of work is not required and the course packet wasn't really checked. Do as much of the work as you need to to know what is going on.",
    "Definitely. Especially if you're interested in French as more than just your language requirement and want to continue with it. Take it with Koizim if you can because she's amazing!",
    "Continuation of l1l2 but with real books instead of French in action. Take it! All the profs are awesome. It's really a good review of L1-2 but you actually get reflexively good at the trickier rules bu reading real French works and watching films and upping yOur vocab.",
    "I would definitely recommend French 130. It has been an amazing course, and I\u0092ve learned so much. French 130 has built upon what we learned in L1 and L2, and it was so rewarding to be able to read entire novels and watch films in French. It\u0092s a significant amount of work but it\u0092s not unreasonable and also really helped us learn the material (not busywork). Madame Koizim is fantastic and made the course fun and exciting \u0096 She is one of the best professors I\u0092ve ever had. Overall, I can\u0092t say enough positive things about this course."
