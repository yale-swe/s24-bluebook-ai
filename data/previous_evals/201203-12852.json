    "I do not recommend it if you wish to learn Spanish. Take an L5 elective course instead.",
    "If you're very comfortable with your speaking skills, take it. Otherwise, it's going to be very tough to do well in this class, no matter how much you prepare outside of class. If you don't care as much about the grade, there's not that much work at all and it only meets 3 times a week.",
    "A great L5 class to take if you want to work on your Spanish. Professor Harkema leads great discussions, and you'll usually have an interesting topic to talk about. Workload is reading for every class, with occasional writing prompts and 3 quizzes. Most of the grade is dependent on participation and 2 oral exams, which are usually related to the themes discussed in class.",
    "Your speaking will definitely improve, but you won't have much fun doing it. The conversation panels (read: debates) force potentially subtle and interesting issues into a black and white scenario where you're forced to take a contrived position rather than have a real dialogue about your actual views. Overall: meh.",
    "It's great for if you want to regain some Spanish-speaking ability that you've left untouched for a while.",
    "Yes, good way to practice spanish.",
    "It is a class entirely devoted to speaking in Spanish, so the course load is mostly reading assignments rather than written ones. I would recommend it only if the student is taking the class directly from high school, because a lot of my fellow peers reported a decline in their speaking abilities due to the nature of the class.",
    "This class is a waste of a credit. I also feel as though my Spanish got worse. There's not too much work but the class is boring. Leslie's grading was also harsh. Avoid this class."
