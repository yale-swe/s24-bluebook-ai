   "comments": [
    "I would only recommend it to the student if they like theory driven courses.",
    "Great example of how seminar style classes can make for interesting discussion of challenging topics under the guidance of an engaging professor. Especially good if you have a case study of particular interest or are particularly engaged in a certain element of national and\/or ethnic politics.",
    "Would definitely recommend if you're interested in nationalism and ethnicity.",
    "Highly recommend it. The course has definitely opened my conception of nationalism and ethnicity, how the two terms can and have been defined by various sociologists, historians, and political scientists. The reading was interesting (most of the time) and the professor is great. It's quite a bit of work, but if you are interested in the subject, def take it !",
    "This is a great course on the political and social theories behind national\/ethnic identity. The term papers are a thrill to write, and the four two-page reading assignments are very constructive once you get the hang of writing them. Professor Kocher, like most courses at Yale, is what makes this course so stimulating.",
    "I recommend this class. It's a class that any polisci major should take because it teaches important themes such as mobilization and group formation, which is key to understand and apply in any context.",
    "The readings didn't really connect across weeks, so it was hard to write the final paper, but Professor Kocher is totally fair and wants to make things work out, so the course might get better next time."
