    "Take it!",
    "Great Seminar! Interesting readings, good discussion, great professor. Manageable workload in terms of readings. 2 short papers and 1 final paper. Every student gets to present and lead discussion once during the semester. Professor Hyde is amazing - her personal experiences as an election monitor and her expertise on the topics of elections make her insights very interesting.",
    "Absolutely recommended. A study of democracy theory, the sequencing dilemma, strategies of manipulation, and the relationship between elections and political continuity\/change.",
    "Yes - if you're interested in elections or democratization at all! Prof Hyde is a very engaging teacher, and you learn a lot but also have time to engage in a number of substantive discussions. The material is always interesting.",
    "Yes but only if you are interested in the topic. Otherwise the content will be very dense for you",
    "This was one of the best classes I've taken at Yale. The discussion was always interesting and the topics were fascinating. I grew a lot from the class.",
    "Yes. if you are interested in global politics and elections.",
    "The course title speaks for itself. PLSC 450 is a great course on the essential role elections play in establishing the democratic process in authoritarian states, and how, once established, democracy is preserved in a transitioning state. Definitely would recommend the course to any student with an interest in international relations.",
    "I highly recommend the class. You learn a great deal about the motivations for as well as effects of elections. However, don't expect to come out of the class with all the answers. If anything, you will learn that elections are often complicated and far from perfect, plagued with problems with no ready means of resolution. I especially enjoyed discovering the nuances of the subject.",
    "I would definitely recommend PLSC 450 to another student. If the readings on the syllabus interest you, then you should take this course. Professor Hyde is a fantastic discussion leader and exudes an infectious enthusiasm for the subject matter.",
    "This class is great for considering the role of elections in the global democratization process, as it takes a really comprehensive look at the state of different elections around the world. Professor Hyde is also really dynamic in the classroom and brings a lot of experience to the table, as you can tell by some of the crazy stories she shares in class about being an election observer around the world. Assignment-wise, we had to write two response papers where we critiqued one or more of the week's readings (week of our choice), as well as give one presentation on the theme of a particular week's lecture. And then of course there's a final paper. Most important, I guess, is that I stayed engaged from the beginning to the end of the seminar, which is more than I can say for most seminars I've been in."
