    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. Cold War is, in my opinion, one of those classes that everyone at least somewhat interested in international relations or political science or history should take. It's a legendary class taught by a legendary super star of a teacher.",
    "If you are extremely interested in the Cold War, take it. But don't be fooled by the hype this course receives. There are far better courses in the history department and in other departments at Yale.",
    "If you are at all interested in history or the Cold War, at the end of the day I think this is still one of those must-take classes. It's worth taking it with a grain of salt and knowing that Gaddis is biased and unafraid to show said bias, but if you do go into it with that mindset it's worth it. Even from a biased perspective, the Cold War is still so incredibly fascinating.",
    "Take this class if you want a broad non-specialist overview of the Cold War. Professor Gaddis is a strong lecturer - witty, charismatic and clear.",
    "Definitely recommend.",
    "Take this course if it's offered again! Grading is a little tough but overall I learned a lot",
    "Yes, if you want a cool class without the most amount of work.",
    "Yes.",
    "Gaddis is a legend, the material was interesting, but the lectures were kind of boring",
    "TAKE IT. MATERIAL SO INTERESTING. The paper is argument based, not research based, so that makes things easier. Further, the midterm is really not that bad and Gaddis is a legend.",
    "This class was a bit of a disappointment. I expected to be wowed by every lecture but most of the class was spent watching the documentary. I feel slightly robbed having taken this class when I could have just watched the doc on youtube.",
    "Wouldn't recommend, honestly, because most of the class is a documentary that you could rent and pretty much get the whole experience of the class.",
    "Professor Gaddis' course is a fascinating survey of the Cold War. When I came to class in August, I knew very little about the Cold War, other than that it happened and that there was a red scare in the fifties (everything I knew came, essentially, from Arthur Miller's play, the Crucible). I left with a solid understanding of the events of the global history of the 20th century and a better sense of how the world we live in today came to be. If you're interested in knowing why the UN exists, why Russia and the United States still can't get along, or about American history in general, then this is a class to take.",
    "A real treat. I loved this class, and really think it's a must take while at Yale. Gaddis is an absolute legend and the whole class was awesome. Just take it.",
    "Yes",
    "I would recommend this class if you are interested in international history. It covers a big time span across a few different countries, so it is a survey class. It is also a class taught through the biases of Gaddis and his own opinions, so you have to bear that in mind as well. However, Gaddis is indeed a great lecturer and the class is pretty well structured.",
    "Exactly how it is described, great overview of Cold War.",
    "I would ABSOLUTELY recommend this class to any student in any major!",
    "I would recommend this course as it sets the stage for so many of the contemporary political and security challenges the world faces today and can give a new perspective on many contemporary issues.",
    "I think this is one of the best lectures I have taken so far. Take it -- it is interesting and fun.",
    "Absolutely recommended, but I personally think that both the aura of Gaddis and the subject matter make it an overrated and overenrolled course. Because there are so many students, the TFs can be a little suspect, and the majority of the lecture comes from documentary clips. Obviously it is a classic Yale course, so don't let that steer you away. But be warned, it is not supremely easy, there is a lot of reading, and the material, while interesting, can be cumbersome.",
    "Cold War is one of the best lectures I've taken at Yale - every class is interesting, and Gaddis tries to end each one with a thought-provoking question or idea. The difficulty of the course will depend on which TA you get, but the course overall is very rewarding. The readings are extremely interesting and you'll actually want to read to study for the final. One 10 page paper, one midterm, and one final. The exams are composed of ID's and one essay on the midterm, ID's and two essays on the final. The essays are very overarching and are pretty easy to answer. The ID's however, can become pretty obscure and he'll expect you to have done all the reading in order to get all of them. Regardless, please take this class - it's very rewarding and you learn so much about the Cold War that you probably won't forget. Gaddis is a great lecturer, and he shows videos in every class from Kenneth Branagh's Cold War documentary that are pretty great. Overall great class, not too difficult and very rewarding.",
    "Dry lecture. Read his book and watch the documentary, but don't take the course. He's a big name, but don't waste the class space. EXAMS ARE IMPOSSIBLY SPECIFIC. I seriously have no idea where Gaddis pulls these words from, but it's beyond absurd.",
    "Great course with not too much work. Definitely take this course.",
    "HIST 261 is probably the best overview and analysis of the Cold War you will ever receive. You learn from Gaddis's lectures, which are structured around his book and from the documentary made by CNN going through the Cold War. It is very engaging and interesting and I now feel like I truly understand the Cold War, which is very cool to say considering I am quite far removed from it. I would certainly recommend this course to another student.",
    "If you're into history or the Cold War, definitely take it. Otherwise, it's a lot of reading and I could see how the class would be a bore for people not into history. It's a good class to take Credit\/D though.",
    "100% take this class before graduation!",
    "Really enjoyed the course and learned a lot. Prof. Gaddis's lectures are great and I love the way he incorporates video. It makes the 1hr 15min go by quickly. However, beware the IDs, which will be chosen from obscure references in the readings and can hurt even students who have done all the work. Grade deflation appears to be a serious component of the class, which can disadvantage its students.",
    "Definitely take this class at some point in your Yale career! Although it is a lot of reading, the books are all pretty interesting. Make sure you stay on top of them and don't wait until the night before the exams to skim through them because Gaddis pulls obscure ID questions on the test mainly from the readings. There's one essay and midterm at the beginning of the semester, which is good because the rest of the semester is pretty free.",
    "You should definitely take this class. (1) Gaddis. (2) Readings are pretty interesting. (3) Cold War spans a huge time frame so you're bound to get interested in something. (4) Gaddis. (5) GADDIS.",
    "Yes!!! This is something everyone should know! But be prepared for a lot of reading. You need to keep up.",
    "Good class! I understand why people say it's a \"must-take\" before you graduate. Worth the hype for sure.",
    "I did enjoy it because of Gaddis, but I think I could have learned as much just from his book and the CNN documentary series. A standard history lecture course, take it if you like it.",
    "World class lectures. Beware the exam IDs\/choose not to do readings at your own risk.",
    "An excellent class that you really should take. You hear that and think \"well of course he's going to say that, it's Gaddis,\" but I mean it. You get a thorough but interesting look into the conflict presented by one of its greatest scholars. Gaddis really is that awesome, and the reading is phenomenal (read Gaddis' book and \"Ike's Bluff\" even if you for some reason don't take the class). The work isn't light, but it's manageable, especially if you stay on top of the paper. Ditto with the exams - some of the IDs are hyper-specific (read that in a review and didn't pay attention, and then the midterm happened), but they're ultimately not too bad. This is one of the key conflicts shaping our age (ABSOLUTELY still today all over the place) and you can learn all about it from the best.",
    "Even if you aren't a humanities person, you need the credit, and this is hands down the best way to get it. Do yourself a favor and take this class.",
    "The Cold War is an awesome class and I would recommend it to anyone. The subject matter is really interesting and remnants of the Cold War still show up in current events today. Professor Gaddis is great and his lectures are fantastic, especially if you are a fan of watching documentaries. There is a lot of reading, but otherwise the paper, midterm, and final are pretty standard and fair.",
    "A legend. If you have any interest in the Cold War, at least audit it. Prof. Gaddis' lectures are as fun as a TED talk.",
    "This is a great lecture course for anyone interested in history. It's not very stressful, because class only requires section attendance, a fairly short paper, a midterm, and a final. The material is interesting, and the readings are actually enjoyable (although you don't need to do most of the readings to do well in the class).",
    "Very interesting lecture to take. Took it Cred\/D just to learn more about the time period\/part of history. Engaging reading too.",
    "I loved this course!! I had never taken a history or political science course and this course completely made me wish I took more at Yale. The information is so useful to how you see the global relations since world war II and today. Kind of a lot of reading but I was in it credit\/d which was perfect because I would go to all the lectures and enjoy them and not do reading and I think I definitely got credit only studying for a few hours before the final. the mandatory section kinda sucks but it's fine...",
    "Great class, great professor",
    "a compelling, informational class that all yalies should take",
    "Yes for both the teaching and the material. Professor Gaddis is very witty and the lectures are enjoyable. Also, I don't think there is any better way of learning about as important part of history as Cold War.",
    "Don't take this class. It reminded me like a ride at Disney World. I bought into the hype, and I regret taking it. 1. The teacher doesn't teach all that much. If you want to take the class, watch Ted Turner's Cold War Documentary. The class is basically like watching a DVD-commentary track of the whole thing. 2. The teacher's perspectives are quiet strange. He views history as great events dictated by great men. Therefore, the majority of the class is spent pondering how Josef Stalin\/Truman\/Khrushchev thought about nuclear weapons, and not how the random people lived. He doesn't take into account that these leaders had millions of independently thinking people under them. 3. Gaddis' perspective is quite biased politically. If you haven't been exposed to any of the material before, there's a good chance that you'll inherit that political bias as well. All in all, take a real history class like War in Germany\/Total War. You won't be sorry. You'll learn more, gain a different perspective, and get a realistic picture of historical events.",
    "I definitely enjoyed this class, wouldn't say it lived up to its incredible hype. It's an example of one of the really great history classes Yale has to offer. Its also an important time in this country's history that everyone should probably know about. LOTS of reading.",
    "Obvious must take at Yale. Gaddis just knows everything and makes it interesting. The videos can get a little boring, but they also have such famous people in them, that you can't miss a class.",
    "If you're into history or the Cold War period, you would probably really enjoy this class. If not and you're just taking it for John Gaddis or because it's a Yale classic, I think it'll just be good but not great. So I would recommend it, but I've had better courses at Yale.",
    "Consider it. The material is important, and Gaddis's perspective was almost always interesting, but the course may not deserve all the hype it receives.",
    "Cold War is a pretty standard history lecture. Gaddis is an interesting lecture and the reading is pretty average (a bit heavy around the mid-term). As a history major, I've done a lot of history lectures and I have to say this course had the most difficult mid-term and final exam. The tests (at least the ID portion) often contained several obscure references - THOROUGHLY read to be prepared for that. Also felt like Gaddis had a very biased opinion of the Cold War (American won, communism never had a chance) and that was very evident in his lectures but also in the works that he assigned (Henry Kissinger's \"On China\" for example).",
    "You think you're going to take this course to have a genuinely interesting and easy credit, but it can actually be really hard. It entirely depends on your TA, and if you get stuck with a bad one then you're essentially screwed.",
    "One midterm, One final, one paper. Very do able class.",
    "By the end of the Cold War, you will have a solid understanding of this period of history. But because the lecture is so large, Professor Gaddis has to move at a pretty slow pace and the quality of TAs is very inconsistent. Definitely shop around.",
    "Gaddis gives fantastic lectures and his documentary is very nicely incorporated into them. His book is essentially a repeat of the lectures so reviewing the material is built into the reading. Not really the \"must take\" everyone says it is, but just take it, because you know you totally want to. Everyone has to at some point. I'm pretty sure that \"take Gaddis's Cold War Lecture so you can learn all of the different ways that metaphorical tails wag dogs\" is some kind of Yale distributional requirement. Watch out for those IDs on the final though!",
    "YES TAKE THIS COURSE BEFORE YOU LEAVE YALE!",
    "great c\/d fail course",
    "DEFINITELY TAKE THIS. It's a classic. If you don't have good recall memory and\/or aren't good with names and dates, take it Credit\/D!",
    "I really enjoyed my experience in the Cold War and learned a great deal about a period in history that is very relevant to my life today but that I did not originally know that much about. I thought the readings were very interesting, though often times a little bit too extensive. I thought the section discussions correlated nicely to Professor Gaddis's lectures. Finally, Professor Gaddis was an incredible lecturer - funny, engaging, and passionate about his material. The Cold War is an integral part of the Yale academic curriculum.",
    "Like any other lecture, you will not be able to engage with any topic in the Cold War deeply or in detail. This class provides for a decent overview, but is somewhat overrated, mainly considering the number of people taking this class. The 300-odd people in the auditorium suggests that it is somehow a miraculously good history class--not quite. Professor Gaddis' lectures are very engaging at the beginning, but as the lectures progress, you might find points he makes in the lectures worth disputing, and the perspective taken is inevitably US centric, which is not necessarily a bad thing, but you might need to actively seek out other approaches to this period of history if you'd like to find out for yourself. History major: a better than average lecture (because lectures are always frustrating), but it does not top a seminar.",
    "Absolutely take it",
    "Cold War is one of my favorite classes that I have taken at Yale so far. I honestly looked forward to going to lecture each week and feel like I am really just a more educated global citizen after having taken the class. It is amazing how much of an effect events from the Cold War still have on the world today. The workload really depends on how much of the readings you do. I would say that to get an A, it is definitely more work, but this class makes for a pretty easy but worthwhile credit\/D.",
    "One of those \"famous\" Yale courses--maybe a little bit overrated but overall really fascinating course. Workload is pretty average and definitely manageable (there's a lot of reading but it's pretty readable and not too dense). Definitely check it out whenever it's offered again!",
    "It's a great lecture class. But needs luck to get into a good discussion section with a good TA.",
    "Cold War is the epitome of the big poly sci\/history lecture. Gaddis is a great lecturer, and many will take advantage of how good he is at conveying information and not do the readings. This can make section a little painful at times, but generally not bad (especially if you avoid night time sections). That being said, be warned that if you do not do the readings, you WILL have a lot of trouble on exams-- Gaddis pulls obscure and often irrelevant info for IDs just to check to make sure you haven't been slacking off.",
    "Overrated. A third of lecture time was watching a documentary and the rest was Gaddis's dry reading of a script that is very similar to his book which happens to be an assigned reading.",
    "Incredible class-- Gaddis is probably the best lecturer I've ever had. Tons of reading, but other than that, just a paper, midterm, and final. I feel like by the end of this course, I had a really deep understanding of how all of the different pieces of Cold War history fit together. Would absolutely recommend this class to just about anyone.",
    "It is a great 5th class, as the material is very interesting and the work load is not demanding at all. I would definitely recommend going to class, because the time there is very enjoyable, and you do not want to waste an opportunity to learn from Professor Gaddis.",
    "This class is absolutely worth your time. I learned so much from every part of this class, lectures, readings, paper, and section all included. It makes you realize just how important and all-encompassing the Cold War was, and how much of today's world is a product of that time.",
    "I highly recommend this course for any student of any college in Yale University. This course will give those students a good understanding of what has shaped our immediate world. It will also give those students the perspective many countries have relating to each other.",
    "A must take. This is one of the iconic history courses at Yale, and it does a great job of presenting one if the most important phenomena of the previous century",
    "Cold War is the quintessential Yale class. This is stuff everyone should know, with a professor everyone should have had a class with, so do yourself a favor and get on board. Word on grades: its not a gut, be prepared to study hard. IDs on the midterm\/final will come out of NOWHERE so do the reading well. Otherwise just pay attention to Prof Gaddis, and you're good.",
    "I would recommend the class to someone very interested in the Cold War or American history in general.",
    "Lectures were great. They did include a lot of the documentary. There was less of a focus on \"Third World\" events, and more on the US\/Soviet Union and on major players. Obviously we couldn't cover everything, and there are many different ways of looking at the Cold War, which we should keep that in mind when listening to Gaddis's version of events. It would have been nice to look at primary sources and non-Western perspectives.",
    "Great course. Some people thought it was overhyped. I personally did not. It is one of my favorite courses at Yale, to the point where I would take it again if I could. Professor Gaddis is amazing. He has a great sense of humor, is a very engaging lecturer, and a world-class historian. The readings are a little much to be honest, and some were more engaging than others. But the tests are fair, and the lectures are great, so I would definitely recommend this class.",
    "Don't let the haters dissuade you. This class is the best CR\/D at Yale, and you'll learn an outrageous amount about the Cold War. Yeah, he uses a lot of videos, but the videos are great. Would definitely recommend Cr\/D, since the ID's on the midterm and final can be pretty tricky, and there's a decent amount of reading.",
    "Cold War is a very straightforward lecture style class. It will fill in so many gaps in your knowledge of recent history, and I at least find that incredibly valuable. There's less reading per week than many other comparable history courses, and you honestly don't have to read a lot of it. Just take it, you'll be glad you did.",
    "I would definitely recommend it, and would say that understanding the cold war is critical to understanding the current state of the world. I would also let them know that the course would be a lot of work.",
    "Take the class.",
    "This is definitely a solid history lecture and worth taking. The workload is light and reasonable (so consider this class if you are taking an otherwise heavy load). Gaddis is an excellent lecturer, and it really is a privilege to take a class with such an expert in the field. The TAs for this course are strong ones, I actually enjoyed our discussions in section, and mine provided helpful feedback on my essays. While the reading amount is large, how much is necessary varies by sections, but to get the most out of the course it is best to do as much as you can. Gaddis' book definitely provides a good summary of the different time periods of the Cold War, and is definitely worth reading. While denser and more debatable, Kissinger's book is also worth reading. Gaddis, as others have mentioned, does show many clips from the CNN Cold War documentary. My guess is that this allows for the documentary to give the list of Cold War events and then have Gaddis analyze then afterward. How much they were used varied by day; sometimes I thought they were used a bit much, other times I thought they weaved in well to complement the lecture and kept the lecture engaging. I would recommend glossing over past readings for terms prior to the exams in order to succeed on the IDs, however. Some of the IDs on the tests were tricky, but otherwise the tests were fair and not too difficult. I did feel at times the reading list, while diverse in subject matter, presented chiefly US perspectives on the conflict, and I would have appreciated more diversity in perspectives. Furthermore, I felt that the glossing over or omission of some topics, like McCarthyism and Iran-Contra, did a disservice to the study of the Cold War in this class, and sometimes the lectures could have gone more in depth and analyze the events as opposed to merely giving an overview of them. Overall, aside from these concerns, it is a relaxing and enjoyable 20th century history class.",
    "Cold War is your typical lecture class. And honestly, it should really be called AMERICAN AND EUROPEAN PERSPECTIVES ON THE COLD WAR because honestly I'm pretty sure Gaddis thinks America could do no wrong in the Cold War, which is just wrong. You hardly talk about the Third World in the class, and the readings are seriously skewed. I don't know why we read all of Kissinger's book 'On China' and then don't hear from any other source. Not only is the reading seriously boring and biased, but its all books where it could benefit from reading primary sources, articles and secondary sources especially because it's a lecture. It's overrated.",
    "Prof Gaddis is one of those professors whose class that everyone will tell you that you HAVE to take while at Yale but because of the glowing recommendations it doesn't always live up to the expectations. There is more documentary footage during lecture than Prof. Gaddis actually lecturing.",
    "Take it. Just take it. The reading is great, lectures are awesome, and you will learn so much about an extremely relevant period in history. Also Gaddis rocks. Just take the class.",
    "just fantastic",
    "This a great class about a fascinating period of history, taught by an excellent professor. There are hundreds of pages of reading assigned every week, but it is not necessary to do all of them.",
    "A history of the Cold War, with an emphasis on the US, USSR, and China. While the course does zoom in on conflicts in the \"Third World,\" don't expect to devote a lot of time to this area--there are other courses that just focus on it. I'm sure you've heard a lot of hype about the course, but it is very true! I was worried as a history major with a strong interest in this area that I would be disappointed, but Gaddis is absolutely amazing and the material is great. I would definitely recommend taking it--though the grading is not particularly easy and there is a substantial amount of reading.",
    "A great history class. Gained a comprehensive knowledge of the Cold War and how it impacted the entire world. The course especially picks up in the second half of the semester. Readings certainly add to your knowledge, but are by no means required for the essay or examinations (at least in my experience).",
    "Good class, a huge variety of students take it.",
    "Yes!! Great class but make sure you get a good TA or you will be unhappy.",
    "A very large lecture-based class that features the foremost scholar on the Cold War. It is an absolute must-take for anyone interested in American history or foreign relations. There is a lot of supplemental reading that is essential to understanding the material in the course, but it is generally enjoyable reading. The discussion sections are very helpful in understanding the material in the course and in the readings. My discussion section with Jermaine Lloyd was amazing because he is knowledgeable about the subject and is very friendly and engaging. He is a great TA and is easy to talk to when you have a question or just want to talk about anything in life.",
    "I loved this class! I never really got to learn much about the cold war when i was in high school, so this was an awesome, sweeping overview of everything that happened from world war II until the fall of the Soviet Union, with more detail than I thought we would be able to get covering all of that information. Gaddis was able to give us everything we needed to know in the right order, too - it wasn't perfectly chronological, but you still felt like the course progressed very smoothly information wise over the semester.",
    "Great class; you'll definitely have more dinner conversation ammunition as a result",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS!",
    "I loved this course - excited for lectures each week, readings were really great, and Gaddis is a master at lecturing about this material. He's truly one of the world's leading experts on the topic, and to hear his thoughts and opinions on everything is such a gift. Highly recommend this class to EVERY Yale student who's looking forward to an awesome lecture where they can learn information that \"I really should know, anyway\"",
    "The class takes a very in depth analysis on a crucial period in American history. Vital for anyone interested in US\/European History, or in IR theory. Would recommend this course to every Yale student; it's one of the best Social Science classes at Yale.",
    "She was a great fellow. Knowledgable and smart. She helped us interpret, expand on, and critic ideas presented in lecture and class very well.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student - it was extremely interesting, and it is a course that gives you a lot of knowledge in more recent US History.",
    "Must-take course at Yale. Difficult at times, but worth it.",
    "Gaddis is a great lecturer. He should do more of it. Should you take it? Ehhh, you could. Or you could just watch the documentaries. The ID's are also overly specific.",
    "Midterm, essay, final. Not too much work, not too difficult, and a classic course taught by a legendary professor. A great in-depth review of the cold war from the US perspective.",
    "TAKE IT. Super interesting and not too much reading. Totally worth it.",
    "To be honest, I can't really evaluate this before getting my grade back. It was really interesting material, a really awesome course, but since there are only 3 grades, and a final that's worth 50% (plus the reputation Gaddis has of being a hard greater) this final stressed me out more than any final I've ever had!",
    "HIST 261 teaches the history, significance, and implications of the Cold War. It explains the events of the Cold War, and analyzes their significance in regards to other developments during and after the Cold War. I would recommend the course to another student, as it teaches interesting material in a relatively low-pressure environment. The readings are interesting, but not excessive, and concepts are not difficult to grasp.",
    "HIST 261 was one of the most poorly organized classes I've ever taken. It took nearly six weeks for section times to be sorted out and even then there was little coordination about how section coincided with lectures. Instead of offering many differing viewpoints, the readings just had us explore five authors who all seemed to agree with one another. I would have liked to have explored more primary sources as opposed to conservative American historians and politicians who have hindsight on their side. Likewise, Gaddis assigned his book as the course's main text yet it only repeated (sometimes verbatim) what he said in lecture. Lectures themselves were scattered and jumped location and years without much structure. They relied too much on a twenty year old documentary.",
    "I don't think this class lived up to the hype. It's interesting, sure, and Gaddis is a legend. But the lectures aren't as good as they're purported to be. The reading is actually pretty fun though - no dry textbooks. I think it's a pretty perfect credit\/D class if you wanted, with a midterm, a final and a short paper. Make sure you're interested in the topic though.",
    "Yes, one of Yale's famous classes.",
    "Must take, lots of reading but interesting",
    "A phenomenal overview of the Cold War for someone who hasn't learned too much about it before. The lectures are engaging and the readings are manageable\/interesting, as well. Professor Gaddis will make you not want to miss a class and put in the time to do all the readings, as well. That said, as this class is a large lecture, you will get out of it what you put in. If you come to class and do the readings, you will learn a ton and do well, but if you do not, you will not learn as much and may not do well in the end. Overall, amazing class, but you need to do the work to get the most out of it!",
    "I would recommend taking this course as it is an important subject and the class is well taught.",
    "Don't come for the hype. But take it absolutely if you can. There are just so many things to learn, so many people to learn from, and you get such a better understanding of the present world order after the course.",
    "ABSOLUTELY take Cold War. It's a fascinating survey of the period. The reading is entirely manageable and very interesting, the lectures are fascinating, and you'll really learn the causes and consequences, not just the dates. I loved going to lecture- Professor Gaddis is engaging and hilarious, and knows more than just about anyone. This class pointed me towards the History major- it's one of my absolute favorites so far.",
    "In my opinion, Cold War is a must take Yale class. Professor Gaddis is as amazing as his reputation suggests. I liked that his lectures were a combination of him speaking and video clips from the CNN documentary he worked on. The grade consists solely on a short paper, midterm, final, and section participation, so it really is not too much work over the course of the semester. The reading can become a little overwhelming when studying for midterm\/final if you don't keep up though. A lot of the ID's for the exams are pulled from the readings so it is actually somewhat important to do them. Overall, I would highly recommend the class, regardless of whether you are a history\/polisci major or not. You really do learn an incredible amount about the Cold War, which is such an interesting period in world history.",
    "Take this class if you're interested in the Cold War and ok with getting a biased version of it. Gaddis is a good lecturer, but he is overwhelmingly pro-West (especially when Reagan comes into the picture) and the picture he paints is very top-down with little cultural or social history involved. The workload itself is very manageable -- one 5 page paper, a midterm, and a final.",
    "Yes! One of the best courses I've taken at Yale, and really gives you an understanding of our world today. I'm biased as a history major, but I don't think you can understand current events--especially foreign policy--without a narrative arc of the last few decades. The Cold War does a great job of giving an overview of this recent global conflict that is just so incredibly relevant to life today.",
    "Great survey course of the Cold War. A ton of reading, but great reads. The exams are fair if you do the work, But be prepared, the IDs are really difficult.",
    "Cold War survey.",
    "Highly recommend it. Really interesting. Good overall view of the Cold War",
    "One of the best classes I've taken at Yale. Professor Gaddis is incredible and the class makes you think about history in today's context.",
    "Hist 261 is a general overview of the events of the Cold War. I would recommend this class if you are interested in the conflict.",
    "No. It is a disappointment and I don't think that Yale students should take this class for a good base of knowledge on the period.",
    "A great lecture class but your grades are highly dependent on your TA, whose grading policies often vary wildly in reality:",
    "Lectures were boring sometimes. Honestly, a bit overrated. However, I do think that I know a lot more about the Cold War after taking this class. The books we read were also pretty interesting and informative.",
    "I had been told that this class would be life changing, and that simply wasn't the case. That being said, I learned a lot about an important period in American and world history by taking it. There is a lot of reading and it is stressful at times, so most students end up skipping over several books.",
    "A general overview of Cold War history. Most of the information you \"need\" to know will come from Gaddis's assigned book on the Cold War, but his personal anecdotes during lecture really make the class worthwhile.",
    "Great overview of the Cold War- provides essential knowledge to be a citizen of the modern world.",
    "Cold War with John Gaddis - or PLSC 176 - is one of the best classes you can take at Yale College! A fantastic course where you get so enthusiastic and passionate about leaders like Reagan and Stalin, while also learning about the intricacies of grand strategy and geo-politics. And, Gaddis is an incredible, Pulitzer-Prize winning historian who is one of the best lecturers and scholars you will ever meet! He is so compassionate towards his students, and that was the icing on the cake. I loved this course!",
    "Yes, an absolute must as a Yale student.",
    "Must-take for all Yalies, Cold War is so important to know about",
    "Great history class, not too much work. Gaddis lives up to the hype. Take it if you're at all interested in the Cold War.",
    "An interesting, broad take on the Cold War. There is a lot of reading, and you will be responsible for small details and concepts from it on the midterm and final.",
    "Great interesting material",
    "Good. The lectures are interesting, but there is no time to engage with the professor during the lecture.",
    "It goes through the entirety of the Cold War, starting with the end of WWII and ending with the collapse of the Soviet Union. There is one paper, a midterm, and a final. The outside reading is very manageable. Professor Gaddis is a legendary professor, as is this class. It was a fun class. It is not the best class I have ever taken, but it certainly was enjoyable, well run, and informative. I am glad that I took it.",
    "Cold War is a class that has a focus on community. Gaddis is a charming and engaging professor. The course will help you truly learn about the details and larger meaning of the Cold War simultaneously. It will introduce varying perspectives on issues such as nuclear capability and political improvisation. It is a helpful history course because the Cold War lays the ground for many modern day relations.",
    "Definitely take it. An amazing class, with interesting readings and engaging lectures. Gaddis is one of the best professors at Yale.",
    "I would recommend this course to a fellow student, regardless of his or her prior knowledge of Cold War history.",
    "Definitely. Do not miss out on this course - it's an essential Yale experience. You'll need to put in some work, there's a lot of reading involved, but it is definitely worth it.",
    "The subject matter is incredibly interesting and Gaddis is an expert. That said, each class involved about 1\/2 of clips from his documentary on The Cold War and 1\/2 lecturing (which I wasn't expecting) and discussion sections can be hit or miss. Also a TON of reading. Definitely not what it's amped up to be, but still worth taking just to be an informed citizen of the 21st C since Europe today was shaped by the Cold War era.",
    "Every student at Yale should take this course. You will learn so much and even if you are not really into history, it's still manageable. The readings are interesting and the lectures are engaging.",
    "Take it. Take it. Take it.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to another student. I think this course was really relevant to understanding our modern history, and I really feel like I learned a lot. I liked that the course wasn't just centered on learning dates but really emphasized greater themes and interesting individuals. The book readings were also really interesting, especially learning more about the personalities that shaped our world. Prof. Gaddis was a really interesting professor. Lecture was always really fun, and it was exciting to see how Prof. Gaddis was personally involved in the historical events that have shaped our world. The videos helped engage with the material in a more emotional way.",
    "Good lecture course with great readings, although you could learn almost all of the material independently by: 1) watching the 24-part \"COLD WAR\" BBC documentary which Gaddis uses liberally in the lectures (and for which he was a consultant); and 2) reading Gaddis's \"The Cold War: A New History\" which is a spectacular book, and which he assigns for the course. If you take the course, do as much of the reading as you can, and especially read Gaddis's fantastic book. A decent class to CR\/D if you can't do the reading and instead just want to attend lectures. Workload is one short paper and two exams; content is one long conflict about which it makes sense to learn something.",
    "A classic Yale course that gives a great overview of a fascinating period of history. Rarely dry and challenging, the class doesn't require much hard work and has a great return.",
    "The Cold War is a decent lecture on the history of the Cold War, primarily from the American perspective. The course is not too demanding, however, the midterm and final exam require you to pay attention in lecture, take good notes, complete the reading, and study. The readings are especially helpful in preparing for the exams and for completing the midterm paper. The course is a good introductory history course for majors and non-majors. Unfortunately, much of the class consists of viewing John Gaddis' documentary on the Cold War. While the documentary is fascinating, Professor Gaddis' limited lecturing and teaching is frustrating and disappointing. I'd recommend shopping this course but taking a history course with a more engaged and invested professor.",
    "I took this class for interest's sake only, so I enjoyed it because I was interested in the subject matter. Do go to lectures. Material will not be posted on classesv2 and ID questions often come from random people mentioned during lecture. There were a few weeks when the reading was pretty heavy, but it was easy to get through. Overall it's a good class that I do recommend.",
    "Take it! Definitely one of the greatest classes I've taken at Yale so far!",
    "I think it is a great course for people to take just to have a good overview of the cold war.",
    "This is an absolutely fantastic history course. It is huge, but definitely worth the hype!",
    "A great introduction to the cold war, and to international relations such as leadership. I would recommend it to any student who wants to learn about this historical period and is ready to do the important amount of reading.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone, history major or not. Everyone should have a sense of what happened during the Cold War and I can't imagine a course that would do it better than this one."
