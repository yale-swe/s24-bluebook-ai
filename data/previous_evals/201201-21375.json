   "comments": [
    "CHEM 223L is definitely a great lab course. The lab always has music playing, and the environment is very relaxed. It's not too difficult, and Dr. DiMeglio is awesome.",
    "There is a lot of busy work involved, though not as much as gen chem lab from what I've heard. I definitely would not recommend taking it for fun, especially since the labs can seem a bit repetitive in terms of the techniques involved. However, if you are pre-med\/a chem major, this is a good lab class to take.",
    "Go for it! same as first term!",
    "One of the best lab course at Yale, hands down. The labs were a lot of fun and correlated nicely with the material we covered in lecture. Moreover, the reports and assignments were very doable and often even enjoyable. Dr. Dimeglio is awesome. Highly recommended.",
    "If you have to, take it. generally not a bad chem lab!",
    "Yes, this course is much better than the first orgo lab course because you basically know how to perform all of the techniques and just get to focus on reactions. Fun!",
    "You need to take it. It can be a pain but it's pretty fast\/easy.",
    "Basically the same as Orgo 1 lab. Definitely recommend it, it's a pretty good lab (not tedious, well-structured, interesting experiments, not super challenging, not an unreasonable time investment, helps you understand the concepts better).",
    "If you need to take orgo lab, go ahead and take it. Work load is not too bad (expect about an hour's work outside lab each week, excluding the 2 full lab reports you'll have to do), and it covers a fairly useful range of reactions that relate more closely to what's in orgo lecture than 222L",
    "Yes, of course! If you're lucky enough to be in Nadia's section, you will have a good time.",
    "It's second semester orgo lab. You took the first one, and now you gotta take the second one for whatever reason there is. Get to lab early, set up the reflux quickly, and sit down somewhere to read a book or browse Facebook\/tumblr. Then get the hell out of there. Piece of cake.",
    "Similar to 222L but with less technique learning and more interesting reactions",
    "I assume you're looking at this course because you want to do something science-related in the future. In that case, just take it. It's not bad at all compared to the accompanying lecture.",
    "Yes, I enjoyed my experience in Chemistry 223L. Professor DiMeglio is great, and even though I had lab on Friday, it's kind of like a potions class with lab reports (which means that it's usually a ton of fun!). Overall, I would definitely recommend Chemistry 223L.",
    "Yes, yes, and yes. Orgo II lab was the best chemistry lab of all four chem labs I had to take. The three semesters of grunt work learning lab techniques (and titrating to no end -- ugh) finally paid off in this class. The reactions are much more interesting, and the products are more interesting as well (it wasn't always boring white powders). But don't slack preparing for the final exam -- it was definitely harder than the Orgo I lab final.",
    "The second semester of orgo lab is a lot more fun because you've already learned all of the technical skills necessary to perform experiments during first semester. I would recommend this course. The TA's are very helpful and the grading is for the most part very fair.",
    "A fantastic introduction to organic chemistry techniques and applications",
    "I would recommend this class to everyone.",
    "If you want to take it just to reinforce class concepts, it doesn't have the greatest concept mapping in the world. If you're required to take it, the worst part is just carving the three hour block out of your week. The good news is, you normally get out pretty early.",
    "Take it. If you're taking it, you probably have to take it, but honestly it's really a great lab and you end up doing a lot of cool synthesis labs!",
    "It's infinitely better than gen chem lab and easier than first semester because it gets repetitive. If you have to take it, it's not too hard and not too bad.",
    "You get to synthesize some pretty cool stuff but only take it if you need to.",
    "If you have to take it, you have to take it.",
    "The labs are long and the lab reports take a long time to right up. But it's straightforward. Take it if you have to for a requirement or if you liked CHEM 222L.",
    "CHEM 223L Is a great class and I recommend it",
    "If you're taking this course, you've already taken Orgo lab 1. This lab is conducted much like first semester, although the material and reactions you cover are much more interesting because you've already covered the basic techniques first semester. I would definitely recommend it.",
    "This is an amazing lab. By far the best one I've taken at Yale. Only 2 full lab reports in the semester, grades for labs don't depend on the success of the experiment, the focus is on learning the techniques, with a very fair test at the end of the semester. Take it.",
    "Good lab, not too challenging or time demanding or stressful but informative and engaging enough.",
    "It's a challenging lab, but very doable and less of a hassle than the gen chem lab. Take it if you must for some sort of requirement (you're premed, aren't you).",
    "Basically a continuation of the same material as in first semester lab. Not too much work though.",
    "A lot of reflux and more free time than in orgo lab 1.",
    "I would summarize this course as not too challenging, nor too much of a time commitment. It is not the most fascinating material, but it is very practical and useful, and allows you to interact with what you're learning in a very direct way.",
    "Definitely a good continuation of Orgo I lab.",
    "If you're in this class, you probably aren't taking it for fun. The workload isn't bad at all, unless there is a lab report, which are sometimes long and unnecessarily tedious. All in all, very straightforward lab course.",
    "Required for pre-med, not a bad class to take. Requires some work though.",
    "This course is both decent and pretty easy. It's more enjoyable than most other labs. But I don't think I learned a ton, whether in terms of new techniques or concepts in organic chemistry.",
    "Orgo lab is pretty solid. The experiments aren't too hard, and are sometimes kind of fun. It's also a great way to meet new people. While I probably had more work for lab than for any other class, it's really not too much work. The final's pretty tough though.",
    "From what I've heard, orgo lab is much less stressful than gen chem lab. The class itself is very organized and the course packet contains pretty much everything you need to know about class policies and standards in order to do well on the assignments. The grading policies are quite far and transparent.",
    "This is an excellent lab which builds nicely on the previous organic chemistry lab. The reactions are a little more complex and you need to understand the chemistry of then slightly more, but given that you will be taking second semester organic chemistry with or before this course that is not an issue. Over all work level and type is very similar to the pre req. lab.",
    "Yes, because it is a premed or a Chemistry major requirement. You probably belong in either of the two categories if not to both.",
    "A great course. Well organized, not too much work, quick too! and solidification of the lab techniques used. pretty much 222L with a few tweaks.",
    "Take it. Don't be afraid. I know gen chem lab was a nightmare. This is the happy light at the end of the tunnel. Its the best lab course I've taken at Yale, and I'm a senior MCDB major.",
    "This class is by far the best lab at Yale. If you liked 1st semester, you will definitely like this one, as the labs are overall just better.",
    "Take this class only if you really need it for a major requirement, or pre-med.",
    "It's a follow up from lab 1 and it basically follows orgo class",
    "Probably (besides Orgo 1 Lab) the best lab you'll take at Yale. It's pretty much a continuation of first semester with not much work outside of lab (except a few post-labs and 2 full reports - learn exactly what your TA is looking for and they will be easy!). It's very chill because Dr. DiMeglio doesn't care about % yield, so without that stress it really allows you to understand what you're doing in lab instead of just focusing on getting a good grade. Painless lab experience!",
    "It's a good lab class--you cover NMR and other useful things, and it's very similar in workload to Chem 222.",
    "It's very similar to 222L. I'd recommend taking it at the same time as 230, since there is some overlap in the material for the courses.",
    "It' s a good course. Take it.",
    "Orgo lab is fun, and second semester is WAY more fun than first semester because you get to make really cool products and do reactions that turn all sorts of colors and smell good, and are really pretty, and you already know how to use all the equipment, so there are no boring old technique labs! Don't be scared... go for it! Be warned, though, it is a lot more work than half an ordinary class, of course.",
    "Well, if you're pre-med you'll have to take it. Honestly, your experience will depend mostly on your TA, especially his or her grading. First semester, my TA was the coolest person on the planet but a very harsh grader. This semester, it took me a little more time to break the ice with my TA but she ended up being a much easier grader.Hey, lab is time-consuming, but you'll enjoy it if your TA is chill. Easier compared to other Yale courses.",
    "Much better than first semester!",
    "This is a requirement for pre-med (orgo lab), so for a must-take class, not bad at all",
    "Basically this is exactly the same as first semester orgo lab- you don't need to know much else!",
    "Not bad at all - similar concepts to first semester, so lab goes even faster (generally left at about 3:45 or earlier) and lab assignments (pre- and post-) were easier and quicker.",
    "This is a solid lab. It's well-run and expectations are clear. The work load is not overwhelming. You generally start with a white powder and two hours later end with a white powder, which can be a bit tedious. Take it if you need it. You won't suffer, but it won't blow your mind.",
    "The lab helped with a few concepts from the lecture, even though the two aren't really connected. This is a low-stress lab that teaches you a lot - I'd definitely recommend it",
    "Great class! You'll learn the basics of how to synthesize, purify, and collect organic compounds, and you'll end up with an interesting array of vials at the end.",
    "One of the best labs I've taken. The experiments were interesting, and the post-lab assignments were always relevant and not at all tedious like other lab courses.",
    "This semester is all about synthesis. For most labs, you'll be able to leave 0.5-1.5 hours early, which is great. This semester has a lot more writing than last semester. There are 2 full lab reports. For some post-labs, you have to read scientific papers.",
    "Chem 223L has an appropriate amount of work - some weeks you may only have to do a prelab assignment, while some you may have more with two postlab assignments. But overall, the work is manageable and the grading is fair. Some of the experiments are pretty interesting, and it helps you understand orgo better. Dr. DiMeglio is super nice and helpful, and the TAs are WONDERFUL.",
    "Great atmosphere for a lab; I would almost have taken it even if I didn't have to. Some of the labs get a little long and annoying, but most are done in a reasonable time frame. DiMeglio is a great professor; unfortunately, she won't directly teach your lab, but make an effort to get to know her. It's about the right amount of work for a half credit.",
    "It was a really laid-back, not too demanding course. There were only a couple long lab reports and mainly short post-labs that did not require too much time to complete. The labs were pretty much practical versions of what you learned in class. Overall, it was pretty repetitive, but not too difficult.",
    "It's a good lab course. You will learn a lot and you won't have too much work. It gives you a lot of freedom and it will help you if you're taking CHEM 230.",
    "If you need to take a chem lab, this is a great one. Dr. DiMeglio is very friendly and helpful, the experiments are interesting and informative, and it doesn't take 4 hours like a lot of labs. A great option!",
    "It's most likely a requirement, but if you have to take it, it's very interesting and much more enjoyable than general chemistry lab.",
    "Organic Chemistry Lab II is very similar to organic chemistry lab I. The work is very manageable (and reasonable) and the TAs are generally very good. Lab is more laid back than other chemistry teaching labs, and it is nice to not have the pressure of worrying about maximizing percent yield for a grade.",
    "Who takes this for fun.BUT - it ended up being pretty fun anyway. It's pretty much just like first semester lab. There are two lab write ups and a few pretty straight forward post lab assignments.",
    "Yes absolutely! It is the best lab I have taken so far at Yale. You will not regret it. Manageable and helpful to lecture. Plus, Prof. DiMeglio is the best.",
    "Yes, this was a great lab. I learned a lot and actually enjoyed it in the process. There is a good amount of work, but only what's expected for a lab, and it's completely manageable if you plan well (aka don't try to do everything the night before). It's a well-organized and well-taught lab; definitely take it.",
    "Great lab for tying together the techniques learned in 222L.",
    "I think most people who take this lab are pre-med so there\u0092s no point in making a recommendation. I liked second semester lab a lot better than first semester because I was familiar with where all the solutions and equipment were and I was placed into a much friendlier and open lab group. A lot of people say that lab should be worth more than a credit and I agree with that. The amount of work I put into preparinglab notes, analyzing spectra, and writing up post-labs or lab reports is disproportional to the amount of credit received. That being said, lab is certainly not as hard as organic chemistry lecture. The experiments are for the most part straightforward and you don\u0092t have to worry about being graded on yield for this class. You know what to expect from the lab reports (from doing one last semester) and so you have a good template for future lab reports. The exam is likewise not hard as long as you study the exam questions that Prof. DiMeglio puts at the end of each lab. As long as you don\u0092t get stuck with a psychotic TA, you won\u0092t find it difficult to do well in lab. And even if you do end up with a harsh TA, remember that you are curved relative to the other students in your TA group, not against other students in the rest of lab.",
    "For a lab you have to take, it is an enjoyable experience. Since you learned the techniques first semester, all the experiments are super fun!",
    "Harder than first semester.",
    "Take this course, because it is a really great lab experience.",
    "Overall, the course was well organized and I enjoyed it a lot. The material was difficult for some weeks, but it did a really great job in solidifying concepts learned in class. The final was a bit tricky, but certainly doable. A decent amount of work had to be put into this course, but I think that it was worth it.",
    "A good course. Basically a lot of synthesis experiments using the techniques you learned first semester. 2 full lab reports but other than that very light workload.",
    "Standard 2nd semester orgo lab. You'll do a half-credit's worth of work which is always nice for a Yale lab.",
    "I'm going to miss this laboratory class. Dr. DiMeglio has teaching an introductory lab down to an art form. Students come in, are given a sense of confidence in their beginning lab skills, and leave learning more orgo through practical, hands-on application than any lecture course can. I personally hope that the general chemistry labs take a lesson or two from Dr. DiMeglio - perhaps some people would not quit so easily on the sciences if they were given the tools and confidence early-on as beginners. Freshmen orgo kids are truly blessed to have this course as their first chemistry lab experience.In terms of workload - just like you learned from Chem 222L, WORK ON YOUR REPORTS EARLY. You will have longer post-lab assignments and more full-length reports. DO NOT PROCRASTINATE. She gives you at least 2 weeks notice ahead of time. DO NOT LEAVE LAB WITHOUT MAKING SURE ALL YOUR NOTES AND IR SCANS ARE LABELED...spending an extra 15 minutes at the end of lab to have all your notes in order saves you a LOT of time and stress later on when you're doing an in-class post-lab or a full report the night before it's due.",
    "Definitely take it, it's way better than genchem lab",
    "Yes, standing for several hours and doing the labs is sometimes tough, but overall the skills you gain are valuable, and practice writing post-labs is important.",
    "Second semester orgo lab is pretty fun! You're probably not going to take it unless you need to, but if you need to, it's totally painless. There's always music playing during lab, and you basically just follow some instructions and synthesize a cool product every week. You don't learn a lot of new material - you mostly just use the techniques you learned in first semester lab. The workload is reasonable - only two full lab reports, and the other post lab assignments are short - so this class is really not onerous at all.",
    "I would definitely recommend Organic Chemistry II lab. It is a great companion to the lecture.",
    "You'll probably be taking it because you have to. The class is kinda formulaic so once you know what little things to take care of, you can do better.",
    "Pretty much a continuation of CHEM 222; you do almost all of the same techniques and the class format and assignments are all the same. The labs are a bit more complex and you learn a couple of new techniques, mainly NMR, but as a whole it's not much harder than first semester. The reactions you cover are cooler and more advanced and you learn a lot, definitely as solid a lab class as is to be expected.",
    "I mean, you need the lab. It's a fine course.",
    "I would highly recommend this course on the practical application of concepts in organic chemistry to students interested in laboratory work.",
    "I don't think you have a choice to take it or not.",
    "A very boring class that did not correlate well with Organic Chemistry of Biological Pathways. The atmosphere is very laid back and the work load is very fair for half a credit, but the material is uninteresting.",
    "Good continuation of CHEM 222L. The experiments are pretty interesting and the lab is much more efficient and enjoyable than gen chem lab. You pretty much do the same thing every week--a different experiment, but you always make a compound and then analyze it by mass, TLC, IR, and MP.",
    "If you're considering this class, it's probably because you have to take it anyway. It's a pretty chill class, so there's nothing much to worry about aside from the usual nitpicky grading. We did a lot of syntheses this semester, which were pretty fun. The practical at the end of the course is easy as long as you pay attention during lab and actually read the lab manual.",
    "If you love chemistry and lab, YES.",
    "CHEM 223L is a great way to apply everything you learned in 222L. You will synthesize something every lab, a great indicator that you have done something. Take it!",
    "Orgo Lab is the most straightforward class. I knew exactly what to do all of the time and I just had to do it. I think it supplemented the lecture pretty well (even though they didn't line up).Some advice: 1) Do the chemical data charts with friends - they encourage that! it's just redundant work otherwise lol 2) make your EPs in Word (so you can share the chem chart and copy-paste&modify the procedures) 3) use a template in Word (or LaTeX!) which automatically adds \"continued from page\" etc",
    "This was a great lab; I would recommend it. I learned a lot!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to my fellow students, because it was a great opportunity to practice some basic yet very important techniques in a very relaxed and productive environment, with lots of guidance and support from both Prof. DiMeglio and the teaching assistants, in order to maximize our learning and our performances.",
    "It's a difficult class, but also a helpful one.",
    "This is a really great lab course - great follow-up to first semester. The experiments are interesting and some are colorful. Prof DiMeglio is awesome - she is always helpful and makes sure you understand the material",
    "This course is very similar to the end of Chem 222L, and the workload is fairly reasonable.",
    "Same as 1st semester orgo...",
    "It is a lab course. You take it because you have to. That said, DiMeglio is good and this lab is leagues better than gen chem.",
    "Most students taking the course have to take it, but it is definitely not a bad course. Though time consuming, it is very interesting.",
    "Yes, this class was more in-depth than first semester lab.",
    "Same as 222, just longer papers for post labs",
    "Orgo lab is great, Dimeglio is amazing. Da bomb! It gets kind of repetitive after a while. But seeing pretty crystals never gets old!",
    "Great hands-on series of experiments that coincide with what is taught in lecture. Must take!",
    "It's not too difficult, although more difficult than first semester - they don't give you models of the set-ups this time. But it's still fun overall, they still play the radio in the background and the other people in lab are pretty friendly. Plus you'll probably have to take it for some major probably, but it's way more fun than actual orgo class.",
    "I would recommend 223L to another student only if they are interested in Organic Chemistry and need the lab for their major or are a premedical student. The lab is great but it is time consuming and there are a lot of students in the course already. I would summarize the course as a combination of all the techniques learned in 222L with a stronger emphasis on actual chemistry.",
    "The best lab I've been a part of so far. Far better than gen chem.",
    "Just as chill as 1st semester. There are still plenty of post labs before an actual report is due and the only added procedure is NMR which is a bit more difficult. You have to take it anyways so..",
    "I would recommend this class to a premed student. It is a nice way to reinforce the ideas and topics discussed in lecture.",
    "Orgo Lab 2 is better than the first semester. You don't have to do a report for every lab, which is nice. And there are quite a few instances where the post lab assignment is really short, which was a nice change from the first semester.",
    "Yes I would recommend it if you need it.",
    "Yes, definitely recommended, it is a well organized lab where you actually get to put a lot of the mechanisms and reactions you learn in class to work.",
    "Wonderful course! The best lab class I've taken at Yale! Professor DiMeglio and the TAs are amazing -- very helpful and approachable. The experiments are interesting and the reports are reasonable, with real-life applications. Highly recommend this class.",
    "Yes I think it is a great class to take regardless of whether you are taking it for Premed or not.",
    "Good lab to do and get experience doing basic organic chem procedures. Do it if you have to, or even if you don't have to.",
    "If you're looking at this, you've taken 222 already. 223 is nearly identical. They definitely baby you less though, so instead of doing an entire lab with the sole purpose of learning ow to do TLC, and another to learn IR, at the end of your experiment, you'll be expected just to do these things on your own. Also, you write more lab reports and in less time, but overall, it's just as chill as last semester. And the expectations are super clear.",
    "It's generally required and a decent lab.",
    "Yes, great lab course.",
    "I would definitely recommend this lab to another student. It was one of the best lab experiences I've had and although some of the experiments get repetitive and boring, the techniques are useful and the pace is very relaxed.",
    "It's very similar to CHEM 222L. I enjoyed the course.",
    "This is one of the best labs you'll take at Yale so definitely don't be afraid of it.",
    "Harder than 222L but still an enjoyable lab.",
    "This is a great lab. It is not stressful at all and you learn a lot.",
    "CHEM 223L follows an identical format to 222L and because of this, the course is fairly enjoyable. The basic ropes of organic chemistry lab have been learned in the first semester, and the focus shifts to carrying out interesting synthesis reactions with unique mechanisms. The lab corresponds much better to the lecture than before. The workload is fairly manageable (most people finished lab early most weeks) and I believe we only had 2 full lab reports to do. Dr. DiMeglio is a wonderful instructor and is always friendly and approachable with any questions. The final was fair as well. For what boils down for most as a necessary course, it is fairly mild."
