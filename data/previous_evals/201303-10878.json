    "The class is weekly seminars with a 2.5 hour observation at Calvin Hill. It mainly focuses on different aspects of early childhood curriculum, such as play, block building, math, literacy etc. You also get to play with the materials in class! If you are interested in education, education policy or child development, you should take this course. The class gives you a good understanding of education from the ground level and how many things goes into consideration when designing an effective early childhood program. Finally, Professor Horwitz is incredibly knowledgeable and facilitates an entertaining seminar.",
    "I would definitely recommend it, very fun, and you can learn a lot.",
    "Def would not recommend--for a course on education, it was a surprise that it was so disorganized. Professor was also super closed-minded. This was a shame because I love psychology and had hoped this would be a nice way to apply it.",
    "If you can get in, take this class! You'll get to observe at Calvin Hill every week, then discuss your observations, current events and some readings in class. You'll cover lots of interesting topics. It was an enlightening context in which to consider my own early education. Also, if I ever become a teacher or a parent, I think I will have done my future kids a great favor by taking this class. Finally, for those of you who aren't familiar with the shuttles, as of fall 2013, the blue line is a great way to get up to Calvin Hill.",
    "CHLD 127 is an introduction to Childhood Education by looking at different themes in development (play, literacy, science, math, etc). The class meets once a week and you have observation once a week where you get to go play with the students and observe theories you learned in class. The readings are all fantastic and manageable -- you'll WANT to do them b\/c they're so interesting! The classroom seems far, but its really a quick shuttle ride away. It's really relaxing to get away from campus and see the kids!",
    "If you want to learn about early childhood education and curriculum development, it's a great class. You get to spend time at Calvin Hill with the kids, which is always a fun time, readings are pretty easy to skim\/skip, and the workload is fairly light (except for journal entries, which can get annoying-- don't write them all at the last minute!). My caveat is that if you are certain that you ARE NOT going to be an early childhood educator or run your own preschool, there are certainly times that you end up asking yourself... why am i taking this again?",
    "TAKE IT!! You observe preschoolers, write journals about it, do some reading, and then just talk to your classmates and Carla, who is a wonderful teacher. There's one final paper, 10-15 pages, but you feel totally prepared to write it after the semester. I had fun and learned a lot, still can't believe this is a class.",
    "Great course! The class is far away from campus though, so if you're thinking about taking it make sure you have enough time beforehand to get to class on time. The class consists of weekly readings and classroom observations with a journal component as well as a final paper. Classes are always interesting and informative and the readings are usually so interesting you end up doing all of it. You have to observe in a classroom at Calvin Hill for 3 hours a week (again, it's far so make sure you have time) - honestly this was the best part. Being with the kids always made my day and you really get to observe what you're learning in class. It makes you look back on your own childhood and preschool experience. After each observation you have to write a 3-5 page journal entry for the week. Don't fall behind! It's easiest to write them when your observations are fresh in your mind. The final paper is 10-15 pages and can be on any topic in early childhood education\/development that you want.",
    "This is a good class. There's a good mix of child development and early childhood curriculum and practice. Take it if you plan on working in education (at any level), having children of your own, or affecting policy to do with children and families (even if you just vote). If you like children (which I assume you do if you're looking at this class) you will love your observation.",
    "Not too much work, fun class, the kids are awesome (if you like kids, I can't imagine not really liking the class).",
    "This course is an overview of techniques and practices in early childhood education. I would recommend this course for anyone interested in education or child development.",
    "Class is super far away, but as long as you take the shuttle it's ok. I thought class content was interesting and obviously the observations were the best part. Note that kindergarteners are completely different from 3 year olds. 3 year olds are like babies - they want to sit in your lap and have you read them a story. 5 year olds don't need you anymore, so you mostly end up helping them write in their books or watching them. Class discussions sometimes felt like they went on forever because sometimes Carla talks a lot (not saying she isn't knowledgeable, it just sometimes was a lot). Also, i felt like talking about the observations and what we had seen at Calvin Hill that week was kind of pointless. Anybody can tell a story about how cute a kid was - it doesn't add much to the discussion. I sometimes felt like really interesting discussions were sidetracked by us just talking about how cute kids were or about very specific examples of observations that were irrelevant. Overall - not too much work. Try not to leave the observations until the last minute to do. The readings are kind of optional - mostly we never discussed them, but you should use them in your observations.",
    "YES! If you like kids, I highly recommend the course. Getting to observe the threes classroom would melt my heart each week. It's amazing to see how much the kids change in just one semester and you warm up to them by coming each week."
