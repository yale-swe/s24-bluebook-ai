    "Yes i would definitely recommend this course to another student because you learn a lot about England and there are 2 papers and a final exam and readings each week.",
    "So, so excellent!!! Prof. Wrightson is adorable and kind and so entertaining. And you simply can't choose a more interesting time in history than 16th-17th century England. And even a preindustrial credit! Take it!!!!",
    "A great survey course on early modern England that goes beyond the political and religious history of the period to also touch on social and economic developments. It covers the great figures -- Elizabeth I, Oliver Cromwell, etc -- but also the ways that ordinary people's lives were changing. Professor Wrightson makes the course accessible even if you start out knowing very little about the period, and the workload is manageable -- sections, 2 papers (5 pp and 10 pp), and a final. There are also optional visits to the Yale Center for British Art to look at 16th and 17th century art, which I would recommend taking advantage of!",
    "Yes! take it!",
    "A wonderful class. You probably have to be interested in the material beforehand as the lectures probably only seem magical to a history lover, but a great class all the same. The readings are not entirely necessary, which leaves room for deeper exploration into the readings you are truly interested in and thus can give your full attention to them. The two papers (5 and 10 pages) really turn the course into whatever you want to make out of it--a great case for anyone interested in early modern history. Also, Professor Wrightson is delightful.",
    "I would recommend this course 1000%. If you are interested in history and this part of the world, go for it! You will have a great time. As an English major, I especially enjoyed learning more of the historical context for --- who other than --- Shakespeare!",
    "Definitely take this class if you can. Not a huge amount of work, excellent reading, fun papers, interesting lectures.",
    "This is an excellent class for those interested in social history, a branch of history that is I think is often subordinated to political or economic history in other Yale courses. Do not expect to emerge from this class with a knowledge of the acts, decisions, and events of the reigns of famous Tudor monarchs like Henry VIII and Elizabeth I; while Wrightson mentions some key elements of these reigns, the course almost primarily focuses on the social trends of early modern England (15-17th centuries), lecturing on topics like gender roles and conceptions of women, the social hierarchy (laboring poor, tenant farmers, gentry, nobility, royalty) and how it changed over time, population growth, education, crime and law, popular protest, and witchcraft. That being said, issues like the growth of industry and trade, as well as political shifts and the English Civil War are addressed \u00e2\u0080\u0093 but not in detail. Readings tend to focus on social themes (i.e. an article on poor laws), and are generally brief. In general, I would say the workload is markedly less compared to other history classes. There is no midterm; only a short and long paper (you can write about anything you want for both papers) and final. Professor Wrightson\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lectures are thorough and detailed; he is not only extremely knowledge, but he is one of the premier scholars of English history of this time period. He also really understands the complexities and importance of historical study, and the final exam is not about testing your on your ability to memorize minutiae, but about writing essays about thematic trends \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s that actually interest you (the final exam is just two essays, and you choose among about twenty prompts!). Overall, worth taking if you enjoy social history; if it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not your cup of tea, you might be disappointed by the comparative lack of content on economic or political history.",
    "Would recommend. It's a great intro history lecture with an incredible professor and a very manageable work load.",
    "I honestly don't know that I'd recommend Early Modern England - only if you need a pre-industrial credit I suppose. Professor Wrightson is a great lecturer, but the setup of the class makes it so that the class readings are not essential and thus very low priority. Grading is a result of a 5 pg essay (20%), a 10 pg essay (40%), section participation (20%) and a chill final (20%). Doing the course reading is not really necessary to satisfy most of these requirements so there's not motivation to do them especially because the lectures often come with handouts that thoroughly detail the lecture. Really only take this course if you're REALLY interested in the Stuart\/Tudor dynasties and the social history of England at this time and will be motivated to actually take something away from the course.",
    "Yes!",
    "This is an absolutely wonderful class. The period is extremely interesting and the lectures are amazing. I came in knowing nothing about the subject and I feel like I learned so much. It's only two papers and a final. I'm terrible at writing history papers but Professor Wrightson made sure I got all the help I needed to succeed. He's a wonderful person as well and genuinely cares about his students. Don't pass up this opportunity. I took the class on a whim and it is one of my favorites in my four years at Yale.",
    "Wonderful class with wonderful professor. Don't be shy about material that's slightly obscure -- Professor Wrightson is excellent at making the material accessible and interesting. He's also the one of the most knowledgeable people in the world when it comes to Early Modern England. The readings are all very relevant to the class topics, and assessments are incredibly fair. Take this class!!",
    "History class taught about early England (not really modern) and the social changes going on. I would recommend it. It's easy, lectures are enjoyable, a little long but still nice. Keith wrightson has a British accent making everything better.",
    "Yes, take it.Interesting\/relevant topic (especially if you love US history...you see all the influences).Workload: perfect. 2 papers, final exam, section.Final exam: great. Answer 2 out of 21 essay questions.Professor: Wrightson's the man.",
    "Early Modern England gives a cool perspective on an important time in English history. The class is taught primarily as social history, so all sorts of topics get covered. The two papers are \"pick your own topic\" so you can really explore whatever interests you, and the final lets you pick from a wide range of topics to write on as well. Wrightson is an expert and it shows.",
    "History 251 is what you make of it. It is possible to do well without putting in great effort but that would not be greatly rewarding. Ultimately, if you stay involved with the readings and the section, History 251 is a good lecture. It can get slightly boring at times, as it is a lecture. However, overall, it is a very good class.",
    "Great class! Reading responses for sections (with awesome TAs), midterm paper, final paper, final exam. Professor Wrightson is awesome-- his lectures are really interesting and he's very sweet and helpful on paper topics\/sources. Meet with him outside of class! The class is also a very manageable workload. It's a great grounding in not only the political history of the Tudors and Stuarts but the economic and social changes happening at this time in England. Especially if you're interested in the period, it's one of the best history lectures I've taken (as a senior in the major).",
    "Yes, I would recommend this to any student, history major or not.",
    "Great course, really interesting material, Professor Wrightson is the bestt!!! Recommended. BUT if you don't want to do a weekly reading response, make sure to shop sections. Some had to (like mine) which I didn't really mind, but I think is a little unfair when it goes to your grade. Also keep in mind two papers are worth 60% of your grade.",
    "Great course! The subject matter might seem a bit dry if you aren't excited about England, but those who are will revel in the smaller details of the history. After all, one can't divorce Little England from its little communities.",
    "Early Modern England will give you a solid foundation in English history during the Tudor, Stuart, and brief Protectorate periods. You will learn a lot about both the broader societal trends in economics, social structure, and education while also learning the specifics of certain events such as the Henrician Reformation, the English civil wars, and the conflicts with the Scots and Irish. You will feel like you know a lot about a wide variety of topics but may not feel like you have mastered any. It's a good foundational course (as it's course number indicates) and not terribly challenging in terms of the reading and workload. Definitely take the course if you are interested in English history.",
    "Take it! Wrightson is awesome.",
    "Highly recommended! The lectures are fun and interesting, the sections were the best I've ever had at Yale (get Dan Jones if you can), and it wasn't a lot of work. There's a five page essay and a ten page essay, but the professor and the the TFs make themselves available to help you. There's also a final, but it's easy. And the best part is you learn a lot!",
    "Take it if you're interested in Britain and want an easier history credit - it's not much work, but be ready for the final paper that hits you right after Thanksgiving break. If you're not interested, lectures may get a little dry.",
    "Take it! Professor Wrightson is excellent \u00e2\u0080\u0093 his lectures are engaging, and he is extremely accommodating of his students. There is nothing better than learning from an expert who can teach well. The workload is manageable \u00e2\u0080\u0093 a 5 page paper, a 10 page paper, and a final (essays on 2 out of 21 topics \u00e2\u0080\u0093 all major themes from lecture). The reading assigned is truly informative \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and thoroughly engaging. You will have freedom to choose paper topics, and excellent guidance on what to read, from Professor Wrightson. I worked really hard on both my papers, but I enjoyed them more than most other assignments because I enjoyed the topics (that I chose), and because the reading assigned to me was wonderful. The papers are excellent learning opportunities \u00e2\u0080\u0093 where you can expand on the lecture, in specific areas that interest you. While writing my second paper, I learnt a lot about Elizabethan government \u00e2\u0080\u0093 which was among my main interests that made me take this class in the first place. So, you will never be forced to learn up everything - and you will be able to explore your specific interests. If you are interested in this field, you will feel compelled to read a lot, and write good papers. If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not interested in this subject, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not sure if you will enjoy the class as much as I did \u00e2\u0080\u0093 though it is the best that it can be, as a class on Tudor and Stuart England. So even if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re in two minds \u00e2\u0080\u0093 just take it!",
    "REcommended",
    "Yes!",
    "I would recommend this course. The class was interesting and Prof. Wrightson is a good lecturer."
