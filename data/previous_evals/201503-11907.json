    "10\/10 would recommend. If you can get in, this course is a joy. Professor Spillane is a phenomenal instructor, and she'll push you in ways that teach you not only to write about art, but to see art, look at and converse about it in an intelligent way. I built amazing friendships with the other ladies and gentlemen in my class, as well. It's an absolute adventure, wrought with beauty, enameled in history, polished with passion.",
    "HSAR 460 is a lot of work; however, if you are passionate about contemporary figurative painting, particularly if you are interested in the visual arts or journalism, this is one of the best courses I've taken at Yale, and I give it the highest recommendation to anyone willing to make the commitment.",
    "If you do have the time in your schedule for a class with a demanding workload, I would absolutely recommend taking this class! Not only was it engaging but it was awe-inspiring and enlightening!",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to someone who is interested in doing what the title spells out: writing about contemporary figurative art.",
    "Wonderful course, regardless of your prior experience with contemporary figurative art (or the history of art in general)."
