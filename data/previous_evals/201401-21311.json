    "If the other students in your class are good then the class will be good. Donald Margulies isn't particularly helpful other than the fact that he has had a successful career.",
    "Advanced Playwriting is an incredible opportunity to ensure that you will write part of your play every week. Bringing in six pages of your play every week, and knowing that you will share it with the class, will light the writing fire beneath you. While, I love playwriting I really needed the structure of this course to make me write every week and share my work. It helps so much to hear your work being read outloud. Most of the students in this course took Playwriting with Margulies last semester, so it's really cool that we have learned each others styles, strengths, and weaknesses. That being said, if you are a senior and you have not taken a playwriting class before still send in a writing sample and see if you can get into the class. It's worth it. As long as you can create voices you will be able to playwright. I really benefited from both professor Margulies's suggestions as well as the suggestions of the other students in the class. Take it! It will most likely be an intimate and safe setting to share your writing in. Keep in mind that you will have to read a play a week, email in your recap of the play, and write six pages of your own play every week. On stressful weeks, when you are feeling like the play you are writing is shit, all of this it will feel like work. On non-stressful week when you are really into your play it wont feel like work. Keep in mind you have to apply for the class and send in a writing sample. Don't let that intimidate you, apply! It's a wonderful class.",
    "Yes! If you get in, take it! You'll love it. You'll learn so much. Do it!",
    "You write about five pages every week, as well as read a play, and then you come in and discuss the play and everyone reads their sections and you critique.",
    "yeah, playwriting is super fun.",
    "I would recommend Advanced Playwriting to any student who is interested in improving his or her playwriting through in-class workshops and weekly writing assignments. You will learn a great deal about playwriting by listening to your classmates and having your own work read out loud. Unfortunately, Professor Margulies does not direct discussion and workshops with questions or comments. You will need to ask him questions in class and seek him out in office hours in order to hear what he thinks about the plays you are reading in class and what comments he has on your writing. This class requires commitment and dedication. As a creative writing course, and particularly as a playwriting course, this class demands a lot of time and work. The more you put into this class, in terms of reading the plays and spending a significant amount of time writing and re-writing your play over the course of each week, the more you will get."
