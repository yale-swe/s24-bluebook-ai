    "ABSOLUTELY NOT. I am a pre-med bio major senior, so you can take my word for it when I say that I have taken most of the hardest, most demanding bio classes at Yale. Those classes are now a fond memory compared to the mess that is this lab class. It is abundantly clear that the instructors put very little effort into the planning and execution of this class. For starters, the lab manual, which has not been edited in probably a decade, is full of typos, missing instructions, contradictory instructions or just plain incorrect instructions. The professor seems incapable of communicating effectively with the TAs, who perpetually seemed to not know what was going on or what needed to be done. We would be half an hour into an experiment, having followed the TAs instructions, when all of a sudden the instructor would whisk into the room and shout at everyone that what we were doing was wrong, and then just leave. The quizzes for the class are basically a random grab-bag of trivia based on the long experiments you have to read for every week. No study suggestions or guidelines or hints of any kind regarding what will be on the quiz are provided. Finally, the instructions and expectations for the two lab reports are confusing, contradictory, incomplete and at times just plain incorrect. IF YOU DO NOT HAVE TO TAKE THIS CLASS, DO NOT! HIT THE BACK BUTTON ON YOUR BROWSER AND SEARCH FOR ANOTHER CLASS NOW. IF YOU ARE A PRE-MED WHO TOOK FRESHMAN ORGO AND NOW HAS TO TAKE BIOCHEM FOR PRE-MED REQUIREMENTS, I AM SO SORRY. YOU HAVE MY SINCERE AND HEARTFELT CONDOLENCES.",
    "Don't take this course unless it is absolutely essential to your major or your pre-med dreams. It's really not worth it otherwise (even with the major\/pre-med condition, it's debatable whether it actually is still worth it). It was obvious that Konisberg and Pawashe were not on the same page for everything, and it often led to awkward kind of stand-offs in lab. The TAs sometimes seemed to be as confused as us, but when it came time for the writing the two reports, they were very helpful so hopefully your TAs are the same. On the surface, the workload didn't seem that bad: lab once a week for at most 4 hours, weekly quizzes, and two lab reports (no final, so already seemed better than most labs). But don't let that fool you! One lab in particular is so long and tedious, you will actually end up bonding with your lab-mates simply because you are being held captive by gel electrophoresis. The lab reports are a nightmare: super-long, super-confusing (especially when the class data uploaded by the instructors contains incorrect data or when the guidelines themselves are incorrect or ridden with typos). If you've taken enough science\/pre-med labs at Yale, you'll be used to this kind of confusion and mayhem, but for some reason, this lab took the cake. Again, if you have to take it, just take it and get it over with. If you have a choice, don't take it!",
    "This course is really unorganized. The lab manual is sloppily put together, and the weekly quizzes test all the minute details of the lab. The grading rubric for the lab reports are really bad as well. I wouldn't recommend this to another student unless it's required.",
    "Find another lab course. This one is too stressful and disorganized for you to learn anything valuable, and it basically covers the basic biology\/biochem lab techniques such as PCR and chromatography that you'll get from an intro molecular bio lab like MCDB 201L and from organic chemistry lab. Reports are long and difficult and its hard to know exactly what the professors\/ TAs are looking for because the guidelines are vague and you're not supposed to \"follow the sample report too closely\". The TAs really were the saving grace in this course, but I know that at least one of them isn't coming back to TA this course again, so there's no use in taking it.",
    "Take it only if you must.",
    "This was one of the worst labs I've taken at Yale. While the instructors promised time and again it wasn't a cookbook lab, it was. It was difficult to understand when the instructors were speaking and it was difficult to get clear answers to questions. The quizzes were not on the material that was specified and I never received a graded lab report back."
