    "good pre-1800 english class to take",
    "I wasn't crazy about this class, as I felt the lectures were mostly summary of the movies we had already seen and readings we had been assigned. It was easy, but I don't think I got as much out of it as I would have liked to. In previous years it was a seminar, and I think it should return to that format--Minnis is a stronger seminar leader than lecturer, I think.",
    "This course is a lot of fun and different from other English courses. There isn't a lot of reading involved, and there's about a movie per week. There are 2 or 3 movies per book. Sometimes the lectures seemed like summaries of the movies, but other times they were incredibly insightful analyses of the films. A great course to think about the development of Medieval literature through the ages.",
    "Personally, I thought the class was a little too heavy on watching movie clips--I felt like we didn't spend enough time talking about the actual meaning\/significance of the original texts. If you need a pre-1800 class, though, this one isn't very taxing.",
    "I would recommend this course. The readings are all very interesting and there is a great mix of readings and film.",
    "This is an incredible way to get a Pre-1800 requirement in the English major if you do not care about the pre-1800s. This could not be less of a real class. I attended three lectures, and watched none of the movies and read none of the books. I wrote my first paper based on a six-minute YouTube clip I found online and got an A. Literally take this class.",
    "Makes a great fifth class - workload is super light because you're graded only on papers and participation (short paper 10%, midterm paper 30%, final paper 50% and section participation 10%) so you don't actually have to keep up with all the readings and movies. In fact, it's entirely possible to read only one assigned text in the entire syllabus and write all three papers on that, because you watch several adaptations for each text. Lectures are entertaining, but they mostly consist of watching funny video clips rather than learning about the text-to-film adaptation process, which was what I was expecting. There seems to be little formal analysis or thematic exploration in the lectures - more so in section - so going to class isn't exactly important in this course...I enjoyed it, but am not sure if I learned a whole lot from it besides watching a whole bunch of medieval-themed films.",
    "An interesting class with not too much work: 4-5 page, 6-7 page, and 10-12 page papers. You basically read a lot of medieval literature and watch the associated film adaptations - most of which are pretty good. You don't need to do all the reading or watch all the movies for your papers but it's necessary in order to engage in the weekly discussion sections. Professor Minnis and the teaching fellows were great. Overall, a good english course that I would recommend.",
    "yeah easy pre-1800 for the english major",
    "This class is odd, but can be interesting if you put in the work for it. Definitely not as rigorous as some other English classes about the same era\/materials, but an interesting approach to looking at texts through film. As the other reviews say, you *can* get by with having read only 1-2 books and never paying attention to lecture, but Prof. Minnis' lectures are genuinely interesting, once he gets into his groove with the analysis, and has many great ideas about this unique approach. Sometimes feels a little structure-less and random, especially on days when we watch a lot of movie clips in class, but will be rewarding if you're at all interested in looking at the two mediums as a way to get to Medieval Lit.",
    "This is a really interesting course, looking at some medieval texts and their modern movie adaptations. I would recommend this course to anyone interested in the literature or film aspects of this class.",
    "Yes. It's not quite a gut -- you definitely have to put some work into it. But it's the most fun English class I've ever taken (coming from an Engl major). I used this class for my pre-1800 and I didn't expect to get much out of it, but I was so wrong. This class taught me a lot about film (I realized how much I love writing about film). And Prof. Minnis is AWESOME. The more work you put into this class, the more you get out of it. It's definitely less work than all other Engl classes I've taken. (though watching a 2 hr film per week does take more time than you'd think)",
    "Good course with a lot of entertaining movie selections and readings.",
    "what a hilarious class. i took it credit\/d which was great but i didn't go to half the classes. conceptually it's interesting and i think attending class\/doing the reading would've helped",
    "Great, not too difficult, make sure you do well on the final paper -- which is 50% of the grade.",
    "So, this is a review for a serious English student looking to knock out that pesky pre-1800. If you don't really care about learning, skim this and move on:I'm going to be honest with you: I did not go to class very much. I'm not usually such an academic apostate, but Prof. Minnis' lectures were, well-- boring. Very boring. Dreadfully boring, and I'm not the only person who thought so. I thought it would be super fun to talk about movies and books. Actually, reading books is easier than watching movies. Watching movies, especially ones you can't get from Amazon or Netflix, is pretty tedious. And writing about both movies and books is restrictive and difficult. If you're a serious English student looking to knock out a pre-1800 requirement, just take two semesters of Shakespeare and Milton. You won't learn anything here, or not as much as you'd like. Chaucer? You've done that already. Malory? You'd prefer a swift death. Beowulf? Actually, that one is fun, and so is the Twain, but movies? Spare yourself.",
    "This class was fun. Period. The text was engaging and canonical, so you never ask yourself \"why am I reading this?\" The films are interesting. It's just a good class, end of story. If you're a film or English major looking for a fun and worthwhile credit, take it.",
    "I definitely recommend taking this course. It was interesting, not too much work, and the professor is great!",
    "This was a fun and interesting course. You get to watch some good movies and talk about them. That being said, a lot of the lectures are background information on the movies themselves, and less analysis. It's definitely just as much an English class as it is Film. There's not a lot of work, though, and you can write your papers on basically whatever you want.",
    "ENGL 185 was wonderful, really one of my favorite classes ever. Professor Minnis is a pro and takes you through some really interesting material, about which he is clearly passionate. It is one of the few classes I honestly looked forward to every time.",
    "I recommend this course because it's a good way to fulfill your pre-1800s credit if you are an English or Lit major. Prof. Minnis is fun and really nice. The workload is not too much, some of the movies are boring and absurd. But hey, the best pre-1800 out there I say. If you like Medeival stuff go for it!",
    "English 185 is a fun course where we are made partakers of the challenges of adapting literary texts to the cinema. I would highly recommend this course to all those interested in Medieval Studies, Arthuriana and any student who enjoys film for it is a very dynamic and interesting class.",
    "This class gives you the opportunity to study texts that are very common in a new light, namely film",
    "Medieval Lit is a fairly straightforward, simple class. Professor Minnis is a sweetheart and really loves medieval literature and their film adaptations, as the course title would suggest. This is a pretty easy way to get a pre-1800 credit for the English major, but I wouldn't really recommend it otherwise just because a lot of the reading is very dry (specifically Beowulf and Le Morte DArthur). Chaucer and Twain are more enjoyable to read, but even talking about them for weeks on end gets tiresome."
