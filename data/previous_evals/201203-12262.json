   "comments": [
    "Like all the other econ lecture courses at this university, there's no point going to class. The professor wrote the book and follows the text nearly verbatim during lectures. His soft voice makes it really hard to pay any attention, and since most of the questions on the exam don't require knowledge of the proofs presented in class, most of your attention span would be wasted anyway. That being said, the textbook is very good and accordingly the course is nicely organized. I wasn't one of the regular attendees in the class but reading the book nevertheless really solidified my understanding of microeconomics. Reading and absorbing the proofs may have even piqued my interest in more theoretical mathematical reasoning. It helps to have taken a proof-based math or econ course before, since the notation and reasoning in the text and lectures can get a little complicated, but you won't have to replicate the difficult proofs on the exams. General equilibrium at the undergraduate level is more about solving the same equations over and over again; all the complicated and profound stuff about existence\/uniqueness of solutions and whatever is waiting for you in grad school. Basically, you optimize utility or profit, then equate supply with demand, and you've summarized 90% of the course. Still, I would recommend working through the proofs for your own sake. Homework sets are manageable but their length can get unpredictable towards the end of the semester. Because the text is more theoretical, not a lot of examples are given, and this can make the homework problems much more annoying. Also be prepared for three problem sets and an exam in the 2 weeks right before October break. The exams are fair and you get plenty of practice material before each. The final can seem a little scary because it is worth 50% or 75% of your grade; the midterm may not count at all if you do better on the final. As I've alluded to several times, the questions on exams are more computational, similar in style to those on the homework assignments.",
    "No more difficult than Econ 125. The professor is very nice, and will answer any questions you have. The homeworks and tests are mostly about problem solving, so this isn't too much of a proofy\/theoretical class, even though the professor goes through proofs in class.",
    "Its ok, especially if you're math\/econ",
    "You learn some interesting, important theory, though it's not presented in the most dynamic way. The mathematical rigor involved in the proofs might seem excessive if you're more interested in the economics than the math. The second half of the course, though, has some pretty interesting material, and you come away from it feeling you have a deeper level of understanding of some economic concepts than most college-level courses will give you.",
    "Course felt rushed, should be watered down for those who struggle with building the \"intuition\" to understand complex models. Unlike any math or econ course I've ever taken before. Horrible problem sets, horrible exams. VERY VERY HARD. High school national math champions came out of the exam partially in TEARS.Unless you LOVE math theory and want to only hear the words social security and tax and equilibrium ALL DAY LONG === Avoid at all costs.Ambitious and want to try being an Econ&Math major? See if you can survive this course. No really, I dare you.",
    "Yes.",
    "Don't take it unless you have to. The material is dry and the textbook and lectures aren't the easiest to follow. Problem sets and exams were fair though.",
    "Econ 350 goes through some of the important mathematical models in economics, and is taught by Prof Bewley, who also wrote the textbook. I have to say the textbook is really phenomenal in helping student understanding of the material. Class can be confusing with the proofs, but Professor Bewley understands that they are difficult and thus doesn't test on them. Truthfully, this course is not as difficult as past students have said, but is definitely not easy. If you are not a math-minded person (or haven't taken math higher than 222) I would say that you should not take this course.",
    "I was worried about taking the course at the start of the year because I knew it was difficult, but after talking to Prof. Bewley about this he was incredibly helpful and I'm so glad I did. The material is a bit difficult but it's so well organized and presented that this isn't an issue. Prof. Bewley is great about helping you out with anything you don't understand and explains the concepts very well, and the course follows the textbook so closely (Prof. Bewley wrote it!) that the book is an excellent reference that explains everything from class. The assessments are very fair and exams are similar to homework, so nothing is unexpected if you put in the time.",
    "Great class, indispensable for further studies in economics.",
    "The material is interesting once you manage to get through all the notation, definitions, and proofs. The coursework definitely needs to be practiced to learn it.",
    "You have to take it if you do Econ math"
