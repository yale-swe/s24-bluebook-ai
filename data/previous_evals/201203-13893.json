    "B-",
    "great emergency perspective",
    "Great course that is incredibly practical. It was great to get background on how the different systems and components work. It covered all the basics.",
    "Really enjoyed working on the VMOC--would be interesting if we could meet or communicate with some of the Tulane students as well.The VMOC experience was a very practical and excellent exercise to be a part of.Would prefer more kinesthetic learning experiences--more roundtables, more discussions, more working through situations as though we were in an EOC to apply what we learn to simulations.The final project experience was really a great one to work on--being pushed to work on practical applications of what we learn in class and in the public health world is helpful",
    "This class was interesting, although the instructors should do a better job at explaining what they're looking for with various assignments. We felt that we didn't have too much guidance throughout the semester",
    "I was extremely excited for this course, and unfortunately my high expectations were not met. Both instructors are fantastic and have fascinating and valuable experiences to share. The active exercises (virus outbreak scenario, sticky notes&tape, final table top exercise)we did were excellent--engaging and instructive-- and I only wish we had done more. I did not feel the online trainings were very helpful and the lectures were dry and probably not the best way to convey information. I wish there had been more active learning and more personal anecdotes\/lessons from the instructors.The final project was challenging and the instructions were vague, but I did learn a lot from the process of doing it.",
    "The course provided an overview of the role of public health and its practitioners in emergency and disaster response situations. Much of the material was based off of the same fundamental tenets, and since it was focused on the role of public health, many of the learned responsibilities were similar from situation to situation. This class provided a good opportunity to learn about the federal, state and local responsibilities in responding to emergencies."

    "Instructor: Sandy Bogucki \u00a0She was knowledgeable but the course was basically taught by Joanne McGovern. She was incredibly knowledgeable and experienced which made the course even more fantastic. She could teach us basics and give us examples of things that took place.",
    "Instructor: Sandy Bogucki \u00a0Sandy and Joanne clearly are knowledgeable and experienced in this field. Would like to learn more about their experiences. They provided useful feedback--doing the trainings was also really informative!",
    "Instructor: Sandy Bogucki \u00a0Sandy--a little quiet, often working on her computer, but when she did contribute it was always very valuable.Joanne--great rapport with the students, lots to learn from her",
    "Instructor: Sandy Bogucki \u00a0Dr. Bogucki was very knowledgeable about the intricacies of the public health role in disaster and emergency response. LTC McGovern took on much of the role of instruction in the second half of the class, and her experience in the field was a valuable resource. Both instructors did a good job of elucidating vague points, as sometimes the material could be somewhat abstract. They both did a good job facilitating the projects that were completed throughout the semester."

    "A+. Dalton's only responsibility was to take attendance, but he did a great job of it.",
    "needed office hours",
    "While he was in class every week and responded to email, it did not seem like he did anything else.",
    "I think the TA could be utilized more in this class, especially if there were scenarios that we more frequently had to participate in.",
    "Micheal Dalton did absolutely nothing all term. He sat silently (save for the occasional scoff) and played with his iPad. This is not exaggeration, I honestly cannot remember a single helpful thing he did all term except pass out a sign-in sheet for attendance.",
    "Dr. Dalton was available to take questions outside of class and helped provide midterm evaluations, which was appreciated."

    "If you are interested in emergency planning and disaster preparedness, take this course.",
    "The course had so much potential and if revised, could be truly excellent. The instructors are incredibly valuable but the lecture style of the course is not very engaging or helpful.",
    "I would recommend this course for anybody interested in the subject matter, as the instructors were valuable resources and clearly knew what they were doing. Feedback was somewhat limited throughout the course, so it was sometimes difficult to gauge how you were doing in the course. Otherwise, it was a very interesting and interactive course."
