   "comments": [
    "I practiced my mechanics and basic E&M skills, and learned a lot more about special relativity. I learned how to use Lagrangians, and expanded my calculus-based physics knowledge into multiple dimensions.",
    "I developed a much more rigorous understanding of Newtonian mechanics and E&M.",
    "vector notation in Physics, special relativity, Lagrange, electrodynamics and general proofs for many theories. (maxwell)",
    "I developed deeper understanding of vector calculus as it applies to the physical world, and stronger problem-solving skills!",
    "I developed my ability to understand physical systems and to apply the math I know to derive meaningful solutions.",
    "I learned how to apply mathematical rules, like Stokes' theorem and Green's theorem, to physics problems involving fields. The course also gave me a solid introduction to special relativity.",
    "I developed the ability to think critically and learn physics at a fast space. Applying mutlivariable calculus to physics is the main skill I aquired,",
    "For the most part, mechanics was a very comprehensive review of physics I already knew going into the course. The review did greatly increase my understanding of the concepts behind it, though. In the special relativity and E&M, a lot of relatively new concepts were introduced, or at least done more formally. I learned a lot of new material there.",
    "More efficient ways to solve problems in mechanics, more in depth understanding of mechanics and E+M, introduction to relativity",
    "I learned a great deal about mechanics, special relativity, and electricity & magnetism in a fast paced, proof-based setting. I learned how to think critically about the problems, especially within different coordinate systems. It was a great extension of my high school physics course that I found very enjoyable.",
    "Taking this proof-based course helped me see physics in an entirely new way. In the past, I had learned physics by memorizing and using equations, but in this class, I learned both how to use equations and where they come from. It's helped me better understand the world I live in.",
    "I have learned a solid, basic introductory approach to three key aspects of physics: mechanics, special relativity, electricity and magnetism. Most of the material in the course had been covered in my high school AP Physics C course, though I have learned some new material, including Lagrangians (in Mechanics), all of Maxwell's Equations (in E&M), and all of special relativity. Through this approach to E&M, I have learned how to apply multivariable calculus to physics problems and how to derive new physics formulas.",
    "Primarily a better understanding of Maxwell's equations",
    "This course is a perfect refresher for students well versed in physics in high school. In addition, it serves as an excellent introduction to higher level physics.",
    "Learnt a lot of multivariable integration techniques Lagrange's Equations A lot of relativity and E+M gained a much stronger mathematical backing to all of my physics knowledge",
    "I developed my understanding of physics as well as problem solving abilities. I also learned new topics in physics that I hadn't seen before, and deepened my understanding of the ones I had.",
    "Physics 260 is basically a review of all of Mechanics and E&M from AP Physics C, except that you use real multivariable calculus instead of the single variable shortcuts learned in AP Physics C. In addition, you get to learn about Special Relativity.",
    "The three biggest things I learned were Special Relativity, the Lagrangian, and Maxwell's Equations. I had seen most of the other material already, but still found the rigorous mathematical treatment interesting.",
    "I think this expanded my view of physics, especially with regard to electricity and magnetism and special relativity, by introducing some upper level concepts which went further than AP Physics C. It also illustrated how vector calculus can be incorporated into both the contexts of mechanics and electricity and magnetism which I hadn't seen prior to this course.",
    "In depth look at Mechanics, and we pretty much went over all of E&M from the empirical perspective. We also learned about the different fields in physics and some things about the current \"cutting edge\" in physics.",
    "A very in depth understanding of all of mechanics and E&M, as well as special relativity."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Maybe a few smaller tests and opportunities to be graded would be welcome. The midterm was somewhat jarring, in that there were 3 simpler mechanics questions, followed by \"derive E=mc^2.\" Prof. Baltay teaches well, and inserts the odd (and welcome) bit of humor into lectures!",
    "The course has virtually no weaknesses; the lectures are lucid, clear, while maintaining a high level of rigor and information density.",
    "Professor Baltay is incredibly smart and offers very clear explanations to complex problems. The problem is that there is no time for examples, so the notes I take in class do not make much sense when I reread them so I often have to rerefer to the textbook to relearn the concepts.",
    "This course is VERY thoroughly and well taught. The problem sets and exams very rarely strayed from the syllabus, and we were provided with ample review material from which to study. Overall a wonderful course and I can't think of anything to change.",
    "My strength in physics is my ability to intuitively understand things. My weakness is that I often mess up the math when calculating answers.",
    "The course does a good overview of the AP Physics C curriculum while also going way beyond that curriculum in most places.",
    "The lectures are good, the problem sets are helpful, and the tests are reasonable. I don't think anything really needs improvement.",
    "This course has great lectures but the way proofs are tested checks for whether you memorized the proof, not whether you necessarily learned how to do proofs in general or understand the physical underpinnings. At the same time, I did learn a lot from memorizing the proofs, so I'm not sure what my recommendation would be.",
    "Strengths: TA is very helpful with the final exam review questions. Problem sets are very fair. Professor is not dry. Class is challenging enough for gifted physics students but still reasonable. Weaknesses: Professor often makes mistakes in lectures and fails to address questions. Perhaps more organization (like posting problem set questions on classesv2)",
    "It's a good course to go through a lot of physics well and quickly. It expects a lot from students, especially in math preparation, but I did know that going in. The was a little difficult to deal with the transition between mechanics and special relativity to E&M after the first midterm. The math involved took a huge leap forward, and everything became much more conceptual. It may help if the problem sets kept pace with the course, as we were often doing work that had been covered two weeks before, and with the pace of the course, that meant that problems often used material that I felt very removed from. Delayed problem sets also made it harder to spend time going over lecture material when we received it.",
    "Strength: psets aid in understanding of material covered in lecture Weakness: psets were often a week or two behind the lecture",
    "This course was really fast paced, which in some ways was good because we were able to cover a great deal of material, but was also sometimes hard to follow. Especially on the mid-term and final, it was hard to know what topics were actually relevant and the types of problems that would be on the exam because the course was so broad. However, the material we learned was really interesting.",
    "I really enjoyed the way the course was taught, I think a typical lecture style is best for learning the material. However, it moved pretty fast at times. There was a disconnect between class and PSETs, as the PSETs required us to figure out how to use equations that we had only derived (but not actually used) in class. This made some of the PSETs very difficult to figure out.",
    "I thought a strength of the class was the standard teaching format in which the professor always lectured the class and students could ask him questions at the end or by raising a hand during class. Another strength of the class is the amount of homework it assigned - not too much so it was very manageable, but enough so that it reinforced the concepts taught in class. One weakness was the amount of examples done in class was too little - or the examples were too simple. Another weakness was how fast some material was covered and perhaps not in enough depth. The one thing I think the class could improve on is to do more and perhaps more complex examples during lecture.",
    "While it was completely justified that the course moved quickly -- the pace was good -- many of the examples that we did in class were very rudimentary and didn't teach much of problem solving or how to approach difficult problems. Many times the proofs were also unnecessary, and sometimes more intuitive ways could have been used for the proofs.",
    "Strengths: Content is thorough and engaging Weaknesses: personally I would prefer to have more regular, small tests throughout the semester so I'd have to be more constantly studying and applying course content",
    "I think the biggest strength of the course is that it's able to cover a ton of material (i.e. mechanics, electromagnetism, and special relativity) all in one semester while still providing enough depth for each topic. I would say the biggest weakness of the course was that at one point, our lectures, problem session, and problem set content became pretty out of sync; we would cover a topic in lecture, then have a problem session about it a week later, and then a pset on the topic the week after that (ie. our problem sets would be on topics from lecture two weeks ago). This made it harder to learn each topic, and it also meant that there were some topics we did in class that weren't covered on the problem sets.",
    "Strengths - Baltay covers the material thoroughly, and often with a sense of humor. Weaknesses - I thought the final exam was easy, which is certainly nice for the grade, but I wonder if there might be something to gain by making the final exam somewhat more difficult.",
    "The special relativity unit was too rushed. We didn't spend long enough on it for me to really internalize the material; I could apply the equations, but sometimes couldn't understand them. I liked the weekly problem sessions a lot, though I didn't go as often as I should have.",
    "I think the principal strength was the depth achieved especially when addressing electricity and magnetism. It was nice to see some concepts which are beyond the typical freshman physics course and be better prepared for upper-level physics (which did however come with the problem of only a partial understanding--see 2 below). Exams and problem sets were also both reasonable in terms of workload and grading (although I do wish mechanics problem sets had been a little more challenging--see 1). However, I also think two main elements of the course could have been improved: 1) I feel like I learned almost nothing in the mechanics section of the course (which took up a good 5-6 weeks). It was extremely disappointing to have class after class which besides for a few topics which went a little further (such as energy in multiple dimensions and Lagrangian mechanics) felt like a repeat of AP Physics C. The problem sets also felt fairly trivial and not very satisfying during this portion of the course. I wish that instead of going over AP mechanics material again, the course could have skipped much of that content to address more interesting topics that we skipped in the book (i.e. Newton's laws in polar coordinates, damped and driven oscillators, Fourier series and oscillators, calculus of variations, moment of inertia tensors, normal modes, etc.). I am aware that many of these would overlap with content covered in Phys 410; however, I think that 260 could have still addressed these in some regard and given more depth in introducing these topics while not repeating 410 completely (a much better job of this was done with E&M). I also think the derivations given in the mechanics section seemed much weaker than those given in E&M (i.e. it would have been nice to have done rigorous derivations for topics like momentum and angular momentum conservation for an arbitrary number of particles). Essentially, it felt as though the course doubled in difficulty and workload when we reached the E&M section, and I feel as though it would have been nice to have kept uniform difficulty throughout. 2) I feel like explanations at time were slightly weak or unclear especially conceptually. Sometimes, we would do long, mathematically rigorous derivations, and, at the end, I would feel as though I'd lost track of the underlying concepts or the overarching idea. I really enjoyed seeing these derivations (as I hadn't seen them before) but feel like the professor could have done a better job reemphasizing the deeper conceptual understanding. Thankfully, both Griffiths and Taylor while difficult books I felt did an excellent job of painting this larger picture. I also feel like a part of the problem was that we'd only \"half cover\" concepts and weren't given the machinery to understand them fully (i.e. we addressed Lagrangian mechanics without going over calculus of variations, learnt about poisson's and laplace's equations without talking about their solutions, learnt about the magnetic vector potential without ever talking about its conceptual meaning or going over an example of how to actually calculate it, etc.). I think the advantage is being better prepared for upper level physics, but it also felt frustrating at times to feel as though I only have a partial understanding of many of the concepts of the course.",
    "You cover all of mechanics and most of E&M at a relatively high level using math that many students most likely have never applied before (e.g. multivariable calculus). The professor recognizes this is difficult and thus makes the problem sets (especially for mechanics) very easy. Also the exams are very generously graded. The problem with this approach of course is that its impossible to really learn this stuff in-depth while both moving quickly and learning it at a surface level. However, that is what the 410 level classes are (supposedly) for."

   "comments": [
    "If you're interested in physics and want to cover a lot of ground, fast, this is the perfect class for you. If you don't know multivar calc, you can still take it, but I recommend at least taking the two concurrently. If you take this class, find a PSET buddy to review with every week. You will be MUCH happier.",
    "If you are planning on being a physics or STEM major and have prior physics background, this course is without a doubt a must. It's much better than physics 200 since you learn from Professor Baltay instead of participating in a flipped classroom. I've developed a tight group of friends in this class, and we all love how much we've learned in this class. It's simply fantastic, and I would unequivocally recommend it.",
    "Yes, but only those who could handle the workload because alot of it is self-studying.",
    "I would recommend this course to students interested in majoring in physics\/math; while some of the concepts are very challenging and a few of the E\/M problem sets are tricky, the class is graded very nicely - which frees us up to actually learn physics!",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who want to major in physics.",
    "I would recommend this class if you have a very strong sense of physics at the conceptual level and are interested in proofs.",
    "I'd recommend the course to any student who wants to take physics and has a solid background in multivariable.",
    "I would recommend this course. The lectures are fascinating and the psets are manageable. The exams are very difficult and require a lot of memorization of proofs from class.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone who felt comfortable in Physics C and wants to learn how to apply multivariable calculus to Physics. Course is fast paced, especially with E&M, but the class is graded very fairly and you do learn a lot.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to another student with a high level of interest in physics and a very strong background in physics and math. I came in with AP Physics and Calc, so I had to learn the multivariable calculus needed while taking the class. This is doable, but does require a lot of work. If you love math and physics, take the class, but if you don't feel strongly or don't want to spend a lot of time working out difficult concepts, it's probably not the class for you.",
    "Less \"grind\" than other introductory physics courses; fewer repetitive problems to do for homework",
    "I would only recommend it to someone who really loves physics and has a solid basis in multivariable calculus, mechanics, and E&M. If not, I would not recommend it. However, if someone meets these criteria, the course is perfect for them. They will find it engaging and challenging, but also fun.",
    "I would recommend this course. Although it was very difficult, I learned a ton. It opened my eyes to a different way of seeing physics, and helped me understand the bigger picture. It was difficult but rewarding.",
    "I would certainly recommend this class to another student. If they want a fast-paced physics class that involves higher math (multivariable calculus) and they thought the AP physics class they took in high school was not that hard, then this class is right for them. It covers enough material at a fast pace to keep them challenged and so that they learn something new, but it is not so hard that they will be drowning in work.",
    "I would recommend the course if you haven't necessarily taken more advanced physics -- however, the topics can be a bit repetitive if you have taken a similar course. Baltay does a good job of explaining for the most part, but some of the topics could be covered as well by looking through the textbook. In general though, a solid introductory physics course.",
    "I recommend this class to students that are well-versed in high-school physics.",
    "It is very possible to take this course without a background in multivariable calculus or vector calculus. I would strongly recommend that you purchase a copy of \"Div, Grad, Curl, and All That\" to work through in the first couple months of the class, otherwise you will likely fall behind. It is also not the case that you need to be taking Math 230 concurrently with this course; in fact, it seems that Math 120 aligns more closely with the material in Physics 260.",
    "Yes, it gives you a very comprehensive understanding of a lot of the maths and proofs behind physics",
    "I would recommend this only to a student who already has an AP level background in mechanics and electromagnetic theory.",
    "I took this class as a non STEM major upperclassman looking for a science credit that would be challenging and interesting, and this was a great choice. If you did well in AP physics in high school and have a knack for mathematical thinking, you should enjoy this class. The math gets significantly harder after midterm, so be prepared.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student who is interested in physics. I think this course is best suited to someone who has had good preparation in physics (ie. the equivalent of AP Physics C) and is at least currently enrolled in multivariable calculus.",
    "If you're very advanced and interested in physics, Physics 260 is the logical choice as a freshman. If you're a true physics genius you could probably skip this class and go straight to a 400-level mechanics class.",
    "Absolutely, especially if you know that you want to major in Physics. The rigor and comprehensiveness of the content is invaluable.",
    "I would recommend it to someone if I thought they had the math background to get it. Unless you've taken AP Physics you would probably be lost. With the proper background, it's pretty interesting.",
    "I think this course would only really be appropriate to a certain type of student: one who has seen up through multivariable calculus (one really does at least need a decent familiarity with the subject to succeed in 260) but who has seen some but not that much physics (i.e. has only seen it at, say, an algebra-based level). I think for the student who has met the stated prerequisites of the course: 5's on both AP Physics C exams and vector calculus, it would be possible to move straight into a higher level course (the two best options would probably be to do the 401\/402 sequence or go straight into physics 410). As the course stands right now, it is not really worth going through the entirety of mechanics again to gain the new knowledge covered in the special relativity and electricity and magnetism sections (which would probably be covered again in a course like Phys 430 or Phys 402). The department doesn't say you can do this\/recommend doing it, but it is possible (I know a few other freshmen who took phys 410 this year and did perfectly fine). On the other hand, I think a student who is mathematically advanced but has seen little to no physics might be better served by a course like physics 200 which goes slower, has more examples, and addresses some topics which 460 skips\/assumes as background knowledge. So, at the moment, I think it really only serves the middle crowd of advanced math and some physics (and I would only recommend the course for that audience); whereas, were the level of mechanics to be increased, it would probably work as an intro course for students with more advanced physics knowledge.",
    "*This is important* so it requires explanation; feel free to skip to the end for a summary though as it may cost you your decision to take this class will affect your sanity\/social life this semester. Physics 260 has a reputation for being the math 230 of the physics department. While I have not taken 230, I'm fairly confident that this is a complete myth and would like to dispel with such rumors for the sake of the poor souls taking 200 or 180, thinking that this class is too hard. I'd taken multivariable calculus, linear algebra, and diff EQ before taking this class, and took math 250 at the same time. Only material from the first of these was really necessary for this course, and at a fairly basic level. I forget pretty much everything that happened in 120, and I was still fine. In terms of difficulty I think just having taken a multi variable calc class before is more than enough preparation to deal with the topics in this course, and it's quite likely that the enterprising freshman who did normal calculus in high school would be fine taking this course along with a mutlivariable calc course. In terms of workload, this was the easiest sciency class I have taken here. The weekly problem sets on mechanics took a few hours at most, but the three or so problems sets on E&M at the end of the course took much longer. In terms of grading, this course is actually ridiculous. The curve for the midterm (and presumably the final) was more than generous; it was virtually impossible to get below a B. In all, I had friends in physics 180 at the time and they spent more time and likely got a worse grade than I did because that course is so inane. While they try to make 260 out to be for the whiz kids only, that is certainly not the case in terms of difficulty and workload. And to top it off, in 260 you can take an exam and remain confident that whatever your knowledge of the subject, you'll still get a good grade. tl;dr: If you have taken or are currently taking multivariable calculus, take this course instead of 200 or 180 because those classes are hell and this one, while maybe more conceptually difficult, will require less work and reward you with a better grade.",
    "Absolutely, but it may be difficult if they have not taken calculus based physics before."
