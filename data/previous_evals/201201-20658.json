    "I would recommend it. It offers a no-BS survey of the field of IR. It's quite a good preparation for the exam.",
    "I would definitely recommend that for a fellow student, because it helps a lot in getting introduced to IR and preparing for field exams.",
    "Political Science 679 is a great course for learning the theories of IR and I would highly recommend it. As a student I would be ready for a lot of reading, but that reading is very helpful for understanding the field. The assignments were very fair, and I believe any student would take away critical knowledge from this course. Finally, the final evaluation is a fantastic preparation for the IR Field Exam which one would take as a qualifying exam."

   "comments": [
    "I'm still looking for my dissertation topic. This course was helpful in giving me a broad overview of the field as well as identifying potential areas for future research.",
    "It introduced me to the exciting field of international security and the diversified methodology that studies it.",
    "This course deepened my knowledge of IR theory greatly. I believe that the course will contribute to my dissertation research tangentially in discussing relations between sovereign nations, however, my specific topic of immigration and integration policy is not really a central focus of the IR field."
