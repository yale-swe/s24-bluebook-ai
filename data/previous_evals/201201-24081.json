   "comments": [
    "This isn't a class about Politics or Politicians (or meeting Howard Dean). It's a class about learning about yourself and the people around you. The class is an amazing oppourtunity to learn something really valuable about human interactions, and if you go into it thinking that way it will be one of your favorite classes at Yale (rare class that you can be excited for on Thursday night)",
    "I have learned so much from this class it is incredible.",
    "A theraputic class that everyone should take.",
    "Absolutely. I looked forward to the two hours of class time each week. The self - reflection allowed in the papers is invaluable - very rarely does one get to write papers that feel so transformative. The class is lively and engaging and Professors Berg and Dean seem to truly care about the progress of their students.",
    "This class is unlike any other at Yale. If you're willing to be vulnerable and talk about some difficult issues, then you'll learn a lot and benefit from this class. At times it's group therapy, at times it's the study of group dynamics. A lot of people sign up for this class because of Howard, but David is a gem.",
    "Unquestionably, yes. Truly one of the best classes you'll find at Yale.",
    "I thought the the professors did a good job of making this clear through the syllabus and first session, but it bears repeating: this class is not for everyone. Dont' take it because you want to impress Howard Dean; don't take it if you are unwilling to engage in serious self-reflection; don't take it if you are unwilling to prioritize learning from others' experiences.For a student who wants to take it for the right reasons, this is an absolutely fantastic class. It was easily the most personally formative class I took at Yale. Each of the professors was incredibly helpful as I explored questions I entered the class with about the nature of political life and whether I should pursue it. Class itself is an experience in thoroughly evaluating group interactions and one's relationship with the world. I became a better person for taking this class. Finally, the group of kids in class got along really well and had fun together in class and outside\u0097a direct result of the care David and Howard take in constructing and leading the class.",
    "Please take this class if you get in. I had read the reviews from previous years, where people were like \"you will learn so much about yourself\". I did not believe them. At the end, I definitely learned a lot, that will begin my exploration about things about myself. It did not magically provide the solutions to all of my \"inner nature\". But, it will get you thinking about your prejudices, fears, hopes, and other things that you probably don't think about critically. Also, David and Howard are really great, and it's their dynamic that really makes the class. They do a great job in picking people, in order to make an engaging, dynamic class, as well as people who will really learn from each other. I know there's all this mystique about \"HOWARD DEAN OMGGGGGG\" but you soon get over that and really appreciate his actual insight. In all, it's just luck if you get in or not - it was me (I'm a science major without policy\/politics background at all - but you just put your genuine reasons on the card, and hope for the best. Take it.",
    "I would highly recommend this class if you want to learn more about yourself and relationships between groups of people. Although you have to be open to pushing yourself, the end result is highly rewarding.",
    "This is an amazing class. It's much more than just talking about politics and politicians. You explore issues of race and money as well as politics. A lot of the class involves reflecting on your own experiences and discussing them as a class. You learn at least as much, if not more, from class discussions as from the professors. There is not much reading (it really isn't discussed at all except in the first week) and you only have two papers and a presentation. You should definitely take this class. It was one of the best ones I took at Yale.",
    "Understanding Politics and Politicians was an incredible experience. I learned as much about myself as I did about our professors, group psychology, and the other topics we discussed. Getting to know David and Howard as people was an unforgettable experience. You will never forget taking this class!",
    "YES.",
    "One of the best classes at Yale. Be prepared to learn as much about yourself as politics. Two standout instructors who truly care about the class.",
    "This is a very different class -- it's a great opportunity to self-reflect. I learned a lot about myself but the process was very, and sometimes uncomfortably, emotionally intense. David and Howard have a great rapport and both bring a lot to the class."
