    "Important for any English major",
    "ENGL 334 is a wonderful way to think critically about post-colonial issues through the lens of literature. The books are phenomenal, and though it is a high reading load, it still feels like a treat to read them. Steph is so generous and kind, a pleasure to study under.",
    "Definitely, definitely this class if you are interested in breaking out of the Western canon\/what Yale English classes normally ask you to read (which you should be!). I'm not one to criticize normal English classes' syllabi, because there's definitely value to reading old white men, but there's also so, so much value to reading everyone else, and this class lets you do it. This class will teach you to think critically about what \"world\" literature is, who gets to define it, and how it is distributed. This class has shaped the way I approach reading and literary analysis and has actually given me inspiration for my own senior project. Steph is phenomenal - so sweet, and also a really great discussion leader whose passion for her field is visible every day.",
    "It's a great, critical introduction to postcolonial studies and literature. It's a great mind-bend for the average English major (and for everyone else, I'm sure) who cares not just about what language means and how it's used, but about how we conceptualize literature, the book market, and how a text is produced (figuratively and literally).",
    "Wonderful class",
    "I would definitely recommend Postcolonial Literature to any students looking to expand their English reading list beyond the Western canon -- it was really good to break that mold and to be in a class with students who wanted to break that mold. Professor Newell is wonderful -- insightful, kind, and understanding -- she loves her students and these texts, and she is brilliant at steering conversations towards thinking critically about the way we conceive of literature and how English courses like these reveal our biases. The theory can be overly complicated and dense, but if you're willing not to understand everything some weeks, it's worth it for the wide spread of novels, some of which are truly phenomenal. Even if you can't fit the course in, read Agualusa's \"A General Theory of Oblivion.\" We also got to meet two of the authors on the syllabus which was great!",
    "An amazing class, full of really interesting readings, and will challenge you to think differently about literature. Highly recommend!"
