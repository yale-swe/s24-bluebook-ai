   "comments": [
    "Sounds cooler than it is. I got to see some art that I wouldn't have seen, but this class was not as engaging as I hoped it would be.",
    "History of Art 321 is a fascinating lecture on global contemporary art that considers not only various movements and patterns, but various waysof approaching art history. Network theory constitutes an important part of the course. It also extends to current ideas, ending with a discussion of art in a digital economy and considering the development of information-based work. I would highly recommend this course, and I think it if a good one to take the semester after Early Twentieth-Century.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course. It made me consider art in the context of today's world; how art functions in a society overflowing with images and aesthetic. This course reaffirmed why I love studying art history. The lectures were so clear, and the readings were also phenomenal. Also the midterm was very fair.",
    "Don't take it if you want to learn about contemporary artworks or artists. The main focus of the class is on theory about the global community.",
    "As a non-major who has taken many art history classes, I did not like this class. The subject matter was obtuse and difficult to access. The lectures addressed philosophy more than they did art history. Definitely take it CR\/D.",
    "TAKE IT.",
    "One of the most significant, substantiating, and legitimate art history courses at Yale. Particularly in a field of contemporary art where much of the discourse seems to be predicated on whim rather than reason.",
    "Awful. Vague. No real substance, very little focus on art, incredibly boring discussions of meaningless post-colonial theory.",
    "Great lectures. Great material. Midterm\/paper\/final are based on broad topics\/questions which make them pretty difficult. A lot of theory in the class. Wish some texts had been stressed less, and wish it had been clearer which concepts from them we should focus on. Definitely take this class though.",
    "yes, take it, important to expand your perspectives...people always talk about the global these days anyways...",
    "Yes. it's an interesting take on contemporary art and you learn a TON.I would take it if you want to learn more about 20th art and history and theory.",
    "Overview of different contributing elements and interpretive frameworks to view contemporary art. Gives a broad introduction to different artists, movements, nationalities and geographic locations that influence contemporary art.",
    "I am not an art history major, and at first that was really daunting for me, especially considering that this class builds on so much pre-twentieth century art history. Nevertheless I managed, mostly because I was genuinely interested in the art. So: take it if you're really interested in contemporary art, especially in the broader themes relating to today's art market and international art world. I would not recommend this to non-majors who don't have a strong interest in the subject.",
    "It's a course that uses structuralist frameworks to look at different groups of artists across the globe in an effort to analyze them as one continuous whole. I would definitely recommend the class, as you learn a lot about different contemporary art styles and groups, but you also learn how to address these different networks using a global approach.",
    "This is the most important class I've taken at Yale. If you care or are interested in how ar history functions in the contemporary world you must take this class. Too, any opportunity to take a class with Proffesor Joselit should be seized.",
    "The class provided a good high level overview of the art scene from a global perspective. The material and lectures and readings were all very interesting and caused students to look at the topic differently.",
    "Yes - but I wonder if it is your only art history class at Yale, if it might not be entirely orthodox or representative of the major. However, it complements the rest of the art history classes at Yale wonderfully by introducing a different method \/ field of art."
