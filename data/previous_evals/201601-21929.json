    "The course is a deepening of understanding and a sharpening of tools from 210. I would only recommend the class to students who've gone through THST classes 111 and 210, and have an affinity for the playwrights in question. You have to be vulnerable with Joan, as the craft itself expects nothing less of you. I wouldn't say that anyone interested in acting should certainly take the course - but if you're a theater studies major who mainly acts then you may as well take it.",
    "Plenty of work on monologues and scenes from various periods in the artistic canon. Joan really enjoys working with students and wants to see growth in her students. You'll get as much out of the class as you put into it, so definitely commit to working on the monologues and scenes and putting effort into memorization."
