   "comments": [
    "Please for your own good take this course. Prof Kleiner is brilliant and an excellent professor. Be warned, however, of the massive amount of memorization that goes in before the two exams.",
    "Wonderful course, a must take!",
    "Yes, informative and interesting.",
    "Would recommend. Great introduction to Roman architecture, focusing on the peak empire. Very descriptive, lot of memorization, so be prepared\/don't take it if that's not what you're into. Not a lot of work (two midterms, one paper, weekly discussion posts)",
    "This course is a general introduction to Roman architecture that requires no previous knowledge of any kind. I would recommend it to any student wishing to explore a rather unusual topic with an enthusiastic instructor. The coursework is lighter than average, and the lectures are interesting and engaging. The exams are mostly rote recitation of facts, so if you're good at memorizing information, you will do well in this course. The term project is a creative assignment, not a lengthy essay. Try this course out if you're looking for a cool, fairly low-stress class outside your primary area of interest.",
    "Great intro to ancient Rome...it will make you want to go visit!!",
    "This course teaches you to recognize and appreciate the classical features of Roman architecture that are still prevalent today. If you feel the need to understand the space you are in, you have to take this course. Yes I would recommend it.",
    "A pretty good course. Very organized. Just be careful with mid-terms, because they are quite a large part of your grade. It's very hard to make up for your first one later in the course. Be very precise when you memorize. Other than that, the lectures were very enjoyable.",
    "Extremely informative",
    "This course was mostly enjoyable, but pretty shallow. The Ward-Perkins textbook is interesting but won't help your grade, and the ebook is really weak (last sentence: Roman architecture will continue to matter and to inspire architects for as long as Rome is eternal) but is a great study tool. If you're looking for an intellectually engaged and historical approach to Rome, this isn't the course for you, but if you want to get a handle of important Roman monuments and start to recognize Roman influence on more recent architecture you'll enjoy Professor Kleiner's class. The two tests are heavily based on memorization, and you have to spend a good amount of time studying for them, but it's always clear what you have to know. The \"Build your own Roman city\" project is really great if you're into that kind of thing, since they mostly let you run with it and do what you want.",
    "This is a good class, especially if you are interested in Roman history or visiting Rome. 9:00 am lecture can be rough especially with all the lights off, but really interesting material. Two midterms, one \"design your own Roman city\" project, and an online discussion forum that takes the place of section. I appreciated that there was no live section for this class, but as someone who would rather write a paper than do something artistic, I didn't really love the project. Great class to take Credit\/D.",
    "Definitely recommended. The class is very straightforward but never boring. The exams are very doable if you study, and while lecture can sometimes feel a little long it's always worth going to. The project can seem intimidating but ends up being really rewarding, and it's great to have the class done before reading period starts. Professor Kleiner is a boss and really loves her work.",
    "Recommend, but be prepared for a lot of memorization. This is a class that you need to study day by day for. It is impossible to cram."
