   "comments": [
    "Yes! It was a fun class to take.",
    "Fun class on a rather novel topic. Fully recommend if you want to learn about something you wouldn't otherwise. This is *not* a class that aims to discover the truth about exorcism and demonic possession (e.g. did it or did it not happen?), but rather to explore what people *thought* was happening at different time periods (regardless of the truth) and how exorcism functioned within society.",
    "Absolutely. It's a good seminar, the workload is evenly spaced, and the class is very interesting.",
    "This class offers about a book a week to read, and meets once a week for about two hours to discuss the reading. We started in the Middle Ages and moved through to the modern period, discussing the role of exorcism in history (and history in exorcism) through the past few hundred years. I would recommend the course to anyone interested in religious studies or European history.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class. It's interesting and the subject is fascinating.",
    "An incredibly interesting class with stimulating readings. I would recommend this class to anyone interested in religion or religious history.",
    "You read about a book a week on different topics concerning exorcism and possession in Europe since 1200- the themes: what possession accounts can tell historians about the differences in perceptions of exorcism among various political actors; how possession was used as propaganda; the manner in which religious thought and exorcism molded each other in a cyclical process.",
    "Yes. It's very cool and will give you a unique look at something that most people think they know.",
    "very cool class, is fun to tell people about, and open you up to a whole new world. There is a lot of reading, some reading responses, and two required papers, but everything is fair and interesting if you invest the proper time",
    "Exorcism and Possession was an awesome class. First, it was fun to tell everybody that I was taking the class--I got some truly great reactions. But, once you get past the shock-factor of the subject matter, Exorcism and Possession is a great class for a growing historian. Exorcism and possession, unlike war or racism or the rise and fall of nations and other typical historical subjects, is not something that exists today in the same way that it existed centuries ago. In fact, it is something at which most Western people scoff. I felt that the unique nature of this subject matter highlighted some of the main themes and dilemmas of studying history. What questions does a historian ask? How does a historian represent the people he or she is studying? Does it matter what actually happened or what people of the time believed happened? How can seemingly \"trivial\" parts of history contribute to the larger picture? Moreover, because the historical study of exorcism and possession is somewhat small, this course offers a great chance to research incidents that have not been researched before."
