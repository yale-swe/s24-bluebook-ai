    "It is an awesome class! Prof. Poole is a great professor and you will definitely leave feeling as if you have learned a lot. There is never a dull moment in class and the small class size allows for open dialogue.",
    "This course offers survey of art, architecture, religion, and academia in Medieval Spain. I would absolutely recommend it to other students because it is very interesting and very enjoyable.",
    "Spanish 327 is basically a history class about Medieval Spain in Spanish. The class starts with lectures on the time right before the beginning of the middle ages, giving a good overview of the period before the 700's. We discussed the groups of people that inhabited the Iberian peninsula before the Muslim invasion, e.g. the Romans, and then the Visigoths. We also talked a lot about the relationship between the three major groups in Spain in the middle ages: Christians, Muslims, and Jews. The topics are really interesting and are exposed from many different angles, but the most important elements are those of literature and religion. We also talked about different periods within the middle ages, and even after the middle ages, and before the Renaissance. The reading is highly enjoyable, and the class prepares you very well for the tests.",
    "Spanish 327 is a rather panoramic view of Spain in the Middle Ages. You'll learn a lot about religion, literature, people and history in the class, as well as funny stories about the professor's life and college years. Poole is extremely knowledgeable and truly loves the subject. I would definitely recommend this class to another student, especially one looking for an enjoyable Group C.",
