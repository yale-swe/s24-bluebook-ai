    "Really fun class. Be prepared for a lot of work.",
    "Take it if you want to improve your Hebrew beyond L3. After this course, you should be able to write pretty fluently and communicate well in Hebrew. All biynans (verb structures) are covered by the end of L4.",
    "Take this course if you have any desire at all to continue with Hebrew!! Ayala is a really fantastic teacher, and the structure of the class provides a great base to go from proficiency to the start of fluency.",
    "Yes.",
    "TAKE HEBREW! TAKE A LOT OF HEBREW! The professors are great and who wouldn't want to be able to speak one of the COOLEST languages EVER!",
    "Good atmosphere, any chance to take a class with Ayala is a must-take! Decent amount of work, but it does solidify your Hebrew. Worthwhile in the long run.",
    "I would recommend taking this class. I took a good number of classes this semester, and it was nice having Hebrew twice a week to relax with 12 other students (whom I knew decently well) and Ayala and learn Hebrew. It's a fun way to improve your Hebrew skills. This is a really great class with a top notch instructor!",
    "If you got this far in the Hebrew program, definitely keep going-- it's worth the work for the amount that you will learn. If you're a newbie, then things you need to know: Hebrew at Yale is a lot of work, but much of it is fun and collaborative, and you'll feel at the end like you really achieved something.",
    "If you just finished your language requirement with L3 and are debating whether or not to proceed, TAKE L4! All of the pieces from the previous semesters came together, and I now feel much more able to communicate both verbally and in writing. It was an cap to the introductory sequence, and rounds out your foundational Hebrew knowledge so that you can keep learning (e.g. you finish all the binyanim in all the tenses, learn how constructs work, do more advanced prepositions, and get well underway to speaking and writing \"high Hebrew.\") You also get to study some really interesting stories, poetry, and songs. Ayala could be a literature professor, for the connections she makes within\/without the text and the way she guides discussion around a text. I have also taken both English and Spanish (L5) literature courses and have never enjoyed a text discussion more than in Hebrew L4."
