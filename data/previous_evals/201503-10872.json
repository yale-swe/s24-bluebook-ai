   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this class--the way it taught me to look at the material was very very original and exciting. It felt like it was giving me tools to ask new and different questions about well-known works, and ground answers very firmly in the texts. Some of the more theoretical stuff about different philosophical approaches underlying different theories of narratology was particularly interesting.",
    "I would definitely recommend. CLSS 875 is a very technical and professional seminar, in which one can learn useful methodologies as well as knowledge.",
    "This course provided an introduction to narratology and Professor Bakker's research on the use of tenses in narrative. The majority of the semester was devoted to student presentations, which meant that some classes were more difficult to follow depending on the student's topic and presentation style. I would recommend this course to a fellow student with the warning that you must prepare for the students' presentations to find them accessible and useful."

   "comments": [
    "This class did what Professor Bakker's classes always seem to do: take very difficult questions about texts and ground them in a literary approach.",
    "The topic of this seminar: narratology and linguistics, is deeply connected with my dissertation topic. Especially, I learnt and practiced how to apply narratological analysis to a text and how to base it on linguistic analysis.",
    "This course was very valuable to my professional development and dissertation research because it provided an introduction to narratology as well as the freedom to explore my interests (and other students') in narratology and different authors and texts."
