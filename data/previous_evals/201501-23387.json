    "I would recommend this course. This course is an overview of the many components that affect the health of women and children in the United States. You also do a project where you learn about the maternal and child health systems of other developed nations and compare it to what you've learned in the course. I learned a lot about health insurance mechanisms in the US.",

    "Substantial information on Medicaid in this class. Fairly easy and straightforward. Great intro to the maternal and child health related policies in the U.S., and also some information on other countries' health care policies. Mainly lecture-based, with some discussion."
