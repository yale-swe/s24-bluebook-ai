    "This course was a strong course, and certainly one of the most interesting approaches to history Yale offers. Its strengths are that is includes both a chronological focus of the major developments in food (from prehistorical cavemen campfires to medeival court feasts to the invention of the restaurant in France) and also a spot-focus in certain pertinent food issues today: processing, authenticity, and immigrant foods. I would recommend this course to any Yale student serious about taking food seriously. this isn't about bumming out and eating. This is about a serious scholarly approach to food. that said, it's amazing and professor freedman is highly recommended!",
    "History of Food and Cuisine is everything you can imagine from the title. It is very interesting starting out like a history class and ending more like a general discussion of contemporary food customs.Also: lots of eating involved thanks to dinners with guest speakers and a great trip to new york.Discussion was always interesting because the topics was engaging to everyone and the reading was such that is was not insignificant, but it was never a burden to do all of it.",
    "This class is amazing. If you are interested in exploring the many roles food has played in society throughout history, definitely take it. Professor Freedman is one of my favorite professors I've had at Yale.",
    "This course was fantastic. It did what it claimed to do (provided a wide-reaching history of food and cuisine across cultures and centuries) and brought up interesting questions about current social and cultural connotations of food as well. If you have any interest in food, history, or fun, you should take this class!",
    "if you ever catch yourself daydreaming about food, watching the food network, or enjoying eating for more than just sustenance, this class is for you.",
    "Absolutely take this class. I had a great time, and loved studying food through the lenses of history, popular culture, and anthropology. The guest speakers were great, as was Professor Freedman.",
    "I would definitely recommend it. Great course, great material. Professor Freedman is really fun and interesting.",
    "I absolutely would recommend this course for students interested in the subject matter. The workload is reasonable, the discussion is fascinating, and the guests and field trips add a dimension rarely found in other courses.",
    "This is such a must-take course. It combines an amazing professor, lots of delicious food, great guest speakers, and awesome field trips. Professor Freedman knows so much about everything, and he cares so much for all of his students, he is a genuine mentor! MUST TAKE!!",
    "Great class, well taught and well organized. I highly recommend it.",
    "History of Food and Cuisine is distinctly a history class. I was looking for a more cultural approach to food but the class focused almost exclusively on the history of food and development of cuisine. That said, it was a fantastic class and the feild trips and guest speakers were incredible.",
    "I would recommend this to another student. It was a relatively relaxed seminar, and Professor Freedman is really amazing. He really made the class. Looking at food and cuisine is such a unique class, and it really gave me a different perspective on history. The papers were fun to write as well."
