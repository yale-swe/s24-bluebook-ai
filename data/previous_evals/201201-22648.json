    "great course, covered all aspects of spanish language very well. alessia was fantastic. patient and consistent and with good energy.",
    "If you need to fulfill your language requirement or really want to learn Spanish from scratch, you'll probably start with this class. Make sure you stay on top of your studying (and not just doing the homework you need to hand in) at the beginning of the semester. It is easy to fall behind, and hard to catch up. The class is very well taught, however, and it is rewarding and even enjoyable at the same time that it is very difficult (at least for a person who isn't especially gifted at learning languages).",
    "yes!",
    "I would recommend it if you want to learn the language -- there are much easier ways to fulfill your language requirements here. Getting a good grade could be a struggle.",
    "Its a great class that I recommend. Spanish is a great language.",
    "It was a fun class to take."
