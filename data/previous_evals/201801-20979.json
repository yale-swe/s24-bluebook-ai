   "comments": [
    "So many things. Aside form acquiring a deeper knowledge of the field of manuscripts in general, I particularly learned ways of connecting manuscripts to literary production in general. Any and all assumptions I had on the meaning of the term \"literary\" itself were challenged, and this course really taught me how to critically engage on a much deeper level with \"my\" field.",
    "For a non-medievalist like myself, this was a great introduction to medieval manuscripts, as well as to questions about authorship and the history of reading. It was also very helpful that class was held in the Beinecke and that so much of the work involved looking at manuscripts in its collections-- I learned a lot about conducting archival research.",
    "When I enrolled in the course, I was completely unfamiliar with medieval literature and scholarship, Old English, Middle English, or book history. Throughout the semester, I was introduced to a new field of English literary study and was able to gain some (still limited) dexterity with the methodologies and debates in the field. I learned how to examine a manuscript in detail, to appreciate the various parts and processes involved in book production, to engage with curators and librarians, to responsibly study archival materials. I practiced valuable skills such as public speaking in a conference-like setting, writing a manuscript description, and probably most importantly, being able to converse respectfully and productively across disciplines, subfields, periods, and interests."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "A particular strength was the openness of the discussion across levels of expertise and experience with the subject matter.",
    "This course is wonderfully structured. The best part for me was the required weekly blog posts, which really allowed me to distill my thoughts in a very focused way, which made my engagement in class all the more poised. The course was designed to suit the needs of both medievalists and non-medievalists, and I think it very much succeeded in those goals. I had such a positive experience, I really can't think of any weaknesses.",
    "I was very happy with this class, and thought it was particularly well structured, with an introduction to major concepts in the first half of class and an investigation of a series of case studies in the second half.",
    "Medieval Manuscripts & Literary Forms had very clear guidelines for its structure and intentions. I felt that the course was well organized to facilitate multiple types of learning that included being hands-on with materials in the Beinecke every week, having generative class discussions, handling manuscripts independently and as a group, using visual, literary, and oratory techniques to decipher these manuscripts. The variety exhibited in and by the course is one its strengths. I also felt that the course worked well to balance the range of students' familiarity or comfort with medieval manuscripts in such a way that made the course stronger. As far as improvements, the course could have incorporated more genres."

   "comments": [
    "Yes: this class was a fantastic and rich experience. I have taken away much from it, and it has given me new ways of approaching the texts, books, and tools I use every day (I cannot ever look at my pen or handwriting the same!)",
    "I would recommend this course on the grounds that Professor Brantley is such a strong pedagogue and that her ability to strongly and enthusiastically engage her material across disciplinary boundaries to a mixed group of students is so uniquely strong and pronounced. For medievalists, it's an invaluable way to get more deeply intellectually engaged with our material, both textually and materially. For non-medievalists, it's a unique and wonderful way to get the time requirement done while also acquiring technical and transferrable skills. Could not recommend enough.",
    "Yes! Professor Brantley is great and this is a useful class even for people who are not medievalists--the course engages important questions about book history and textual production\/reception.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to other students. I think this course is a great selection for anyone who would like a thorough but inviting introduction to manuscript studies, book history, and medieval literature. This course would also serve students who have more interdisciplinary interests such as book production as well as illumination and paratextual elements."
