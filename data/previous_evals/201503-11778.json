    "A really solid class. The material is interesting and important (and thoroughly understudied by Yale econ students. I mean seriously, this is pretty foundational stuff). Prof G is a fun lecturer and the class is really easy. A great class if you want to learn some cool stuff with minimal work. The course would be better if it included some more rigorous empirical work, but I suppose that might be too difficult given the pre-reqs. In that case, the yale econ department should probably start offering an intermediate econ history class that does use more sophisticated methods.",
    "A really enjoyable class. Professor Guinnane said, and I think hes spot on, that economic history is development economics applied to the pastso if you are interested in history or in development, this is a great course for you. Not a comprehensive survey of European economies of the period (i.e. not a history class). Rather, you learn to apply simple models about growth, trade, and technology to stylized nineteenth century European economic conditions. Most of the readings are short and fairly interesting. Guinnane is persnickety about certain things (dont say anything during an exam, even if there is a typo in the question) but if you just follow his directions you should be in the clear.",
    "Great class, a must take.",
    "Absolutely yes! An amazing professor, an expert in his field. Professor Guinnane is captivating speaker and never uses power points, but keeps everyone entertained and intellectually stimulated.",
    "The class is interesting. It starts to get somewhat repetitive because a lot of the same themes that are introduced in the beginning of the course keep returning throughout.",
    "An excellent course on the foundations of the European economies. I did not know much about the foundations of the European economies until taking this course, and after this semester I have a much better understanding about not only the foundations but also the interconnectedness of the major European economic developments..",
    "I would recommend the class unless the student doesn't like writing papers.",
    "Fantastic course!! An essential for any Econ major.",
    "A genuinely good class on a topic that's quite niche. Prof. Guinnane does an admirable job trying to make the class interesting, but unless you're into this kind of stuff, you may find yourself feeling uninspired at times. Work-wise, this class is rather heavy: 4 problem sets, 3 papers, 2 exams. It was nice to have the work broken up, but it felt like we had something every week for a while. Shop it: this class isn't for everybody, but if you like the first couple lectures, you'll probably enjoy the rest.",
    "Really great class. I had never taken a history or econ history course here, and I really enjoyed it. The workload is totally manageable and I took it in a 5 course schedule. Professor Guinnane is a fun and engaging lecturer. Don't show up late and pay attention and you'll do just fine.",
    "This is a really great course. The point was to examine how the Western European countries industrialized to catch up to and, in some cases, surpass Britain. In doing so, we talked about the beginnings of many different industries and sectors: railroads, banks, infectious disease, large firms, the idea of corporate governance, welfare, steel, and more. Whether you know you're interested in any of these topics or not, you will definitely find one that is compelling and can focus more deeply on it throughout the course. The workload is spaced out, with readings most days, 4 problem sets, 3 papers, midterm, and a final. The problem sets vary in difficulty and the readings can be easy or quite long, but it's helpful to have done them. Exams draw heavily from the readings. Papers are different than anything else you've written in class, but a great exercise and a really useful idea. Absolutely take this course if you can Professor Guinnane makes it really fascinating.",
    "Take it take it take it! Guinnane is one of the best lecturers in the Econ dept - the sort that will expect a lot from you, but also give in just as much (if not more) to the class. You learn a ton from an incredibly sharp professor!"
