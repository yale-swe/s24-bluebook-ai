    "This class is pretty much all strengths (best language class I've taken at Yale!). The only thing I'd recommend is included more online or interactive assignments for homework to make speaking outside of class more natural.",
    "The class is pretty unorganized, so if you are a student who needs structure, I strongly discourage you from taking this class. There was little to no structure, and we didn't use the book for anything substantial. We were also graded pretty harshly on writing assignments, even though we didn't have the grammatical proficiency to understand the corrections being made. Not a gut class. However, Walimu Kiarie and Edwina are incredible teachers-- I have learned so much in such a small amount of time that it makes the challenges from a lack of structure worth it.",
    "The course really gives you a solid grasp of Swahili. I feel very fluent in the language despite the fact it is only L1. I'll probably be able to write novels by the time I get to L5 if this is what L1 js like."

    "Absolutely! Kiswahili is an amazing language and Mwalimu Kiarie makes it fun to learn. It is difficult to find a program that teaches African languages from beginner all the way to advanced, so if you want to learn Kiswahili, take advantage of this opportunity!",
    "Yes take it. The professor is very friendly and really passionate about the language. I enjoyed being in his class.",
    "Yes! Kiarie is one of the best Yale has to offer"
