    "3d printers..",
    "All resources were available to use.",
    "Everything was available to us. The 3d printing became rather cramped at the end and could be planned out better, but other than that it was a surprisingly smooth fabrication course.",
    "The DM staff was awesome.",
    "The school could benefit from one more powder printer. The Objet needs to be cheaper. I'm not sure I've ever seen anybody use the break-away abs printer. (Replace.)",
    "Cutting costs for 3d prints would be nice. I know they are likely as low as they can be, but think about this way: studio is where we spend a lot of money to make models\/print etc, this rivaled those costs, ultimately having us pay two studios worth of money. My wallet says ouch.",
    "The facilities available to us were mostly adequate, with one glaring exception. In most ways \u0096 such as access to workstations, software, labs, photo equipment \u0096 they are second to none. The rapid prototyping equipment, however, is a weak area, and for this course, with its ultimate emphasis on physically prototyping our designs, that weakness held us back. First is the access to printers. There are several printers available, theoretically, but only one of them is ideal, which is the Zcorp powder printer. It is the best in terms of speed and cost (although still expensive), and only having access to one of them creates unnecessary backups around deadlines. No complaints about the Zcorp (other than cost), but there should be two of them. Using other printers is a workaround, but none of the others are a first choice. The other workable option is the Objet polymer printer, which creates durable models, but is nearly double the cost of the Zcorp, once support material costs are figured in, and takes much longer machine time to deliver a finished model, reducing the number of people who can use it. So, the main complaints are available machine time and cost. To address this, go with what works. Instead of having several 3D printers that never get used, replace the others with a second Zcorp. Having two (or more) Zcorp printers would be best, along with one (or more) FDM printing option(s) that incorporate soluble support materials ONLY. Focus resources on those two types of printers (Zcorp and FDM+SST). Investing in a water\/lye bath for dissolving the support materials would be a further benefit for decreasing processing time. These steps would go a long way toward making the school's rapid prototyping facilities on par with everything else at YSOA. (The costs for 3D printing are also out of hand, and far beyond what I have experienced at other schools, but I don't know enough about that to suggest any solutions.)",
