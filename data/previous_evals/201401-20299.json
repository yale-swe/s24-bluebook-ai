   "comments": [
    "Yes! Take this class, especially if Anja is teaching it. She's great.",
    "A much more pleasant core requirement.",
    "You have to take it as a GLBL major, so just take it for what it is.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. I think a lot of people here only take classes on rich econ, but the economy of the developing world is a different and interesting ball game.",
    "Yes, however, I'm not sure if this iteration of the course will ever happen again, considering Professor Sautmann is going back to Brown next semester. Hopefully the next professor can fill her shoes.",
    "Only take it if you have to for global affairs, otherwise it's kind of an okay Econ class, not as bad as it could be, just make sure to keep up and put in time on your own.",
    "Disclaimer: I am a security major who really dislikes econ as it is. But I would absolutely not recommend this class. Tragically, it's required for GLBL majors. I think Professor Sautmann is a lovely person, but I really, really disliked this class. More work than GLBL 275 (Intro Intl Sec) \u2013\u00a0a problem set and reading response a week, midterm and cumulative final \u2013\u00a0and just not enjoyable.",
    "Even for non-Global Affairs majors, this is actually a great class. It's a true introduction to development economics that's well taught and you're guaranteed to learn and do well if you put in the work. Plus the material is super important and super relevant. Everyone should take it.",
    "This class is extremely well-organized, but poorly taught. My understanding of the material is entirely drawn from section--you will do poorly if you end up with a bad TF. Professor Sautmann is relatively inoffensive, but not great at explaining concepts. Don't take this class unless you absolutely must do so.",
    "This class is terrible. Beyond boring and difficult for someone without interest or experience with econ. But if you're even looking at this class that means you're probably a Global Affairs major who has to take the class, so just take your lumps and try to make it through.",
    "Even if you're not a GLBL major, I think this is a great class. It's definitely easier than the development economics class taught by Nancy Qian though, so be aware of that when choosing between if you have the option.",
    "Very good course-- take it!",
    "If you are an economics major and can petition for this to be an economics credit, TAKE IT. It is a fantastic (and probably the best) introduction to international development that you can possibly receive at Yale. Well taught, covers mathematical foundations of international development, and allows you to appreciate the nuances behind traditionally controversial policies such as bans on child labor.",
    "This was actively one of the worst courses I have ever taken at Yale. The only reason I took it at all was because it is a core requirement for the Global Affairs major. The subject is not clearly presented, the midterms and finals are disproportionately hard, and the focus of the class is unclear.",
    "If you're a Global Affairs major, you have to take it, but rest assured that it is much better than Approaches to International Security. For non-Global Affairs majors, I wouldn't necessarily recommend it as there are other economic development courses that provide much more depth for those truly interested in the topic. With that said, it's certainly an interesting course.",
    "Take it with Prof. Sautmann if you can!",
    "If you want to learn more about the Econ side of development, then take this class. It gives you a better feel for what financial tools the world's poorest people actually have available to them and how and why certain policies are being used to help them. Although the graphs\/ math could be considered a little dry at times, every chapter has a reading which gives a real world example of the topic we are learning about. Discussing these real world examples in class helps to tie the class into what is actually happening around the world and makes it more applicable. Even if you aren't a Global Affairs major, but you are interested in the topic, then try this class (especially if Professor Sautmann is still teaching).",
    "GLBL 225 covers many different topics, but doesn't really go into any depth for any of them. The topics are interesting, but the class itself wasn't intellectually satisfying. There was a lot of memorization without much deeper explanation.",
    "This was not a good class and I would not recommend it to another student. Unfortunately, it will still be a requirement for global affairs majors, but hopefully, they'll make it focus more on concepts and current issues rather than equations later on. (The one caveat is that this class might be ok for those students who are very interested in development and really want to delve into it)",
    "Yes, but only if you have to.",
    "You should take it if you're interested in basic knowledge of a lot of developing area problems. Anja is a really sweet and clear teacher and the material itself isn't too hard. It's cool stuff and explains many of the problems in economic terms (albeit really simplified ones), and is a good, broad overview of this subject. Also, if you're a global major, you have to take this course, but even so I'd recommend it if you're just interested in the material. The workload is pretty light, reading is manageable (Anja gives us excerpts from longer readings, and these are actually of a nice and readable length), and tests were fair.",
    "A solid course with no surprises. Grading is fair. Lectures are engaging and interesting. Workload is manageable and not busy work but relevant to the material and the real world. I loved this class!",
    "If you are a global affairs major, you are going to have to take it. I cannot talk to the specifics of the course next year since the professor will change, and a new syllabus will be drafted. Expect a mix of development economics theory, particularly in the areas of economic growth, as well as new research from RCTs in the field and historical analysis. Personally loved the class, though it was basically a simple recap of other economics, econometrics, global health, and poverty alleviation classes I had taken at Yale. For those with little experience, don't worry, it remains at a very basic level throughout (or at least it did this year).",
    "The class was taught by a visiting professor, so it is difficult to say whether this year will be indicative of future years. That said, I enjoyed the material covered and found it very relevant to the international development track of the major. There are not many development economics offerings for undergraduates, and this class gives a taste of different topics in that field."
