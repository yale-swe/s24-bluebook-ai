    "This course gives you a decent overview of politics and culture in several Latin American countries, while enabling you to practice your Spanish language skills. Sometimes - especially the first week or two - the readings and discussions were highly theoretical, which can be difficult if you don't know much about Latin America to begin with.",
    "This course is intended to give you an introduction to the political realities in Latin America today, while enhancing your ability to speak about political issues in Spanish. I would strongly recommend this course, especially to people interested in politicalscience and have not really had the chance to discuss a certain subject matter in a foreign language.",
    "This course is a fantastic way both to improve your language skills and learn a great deal about contemporary politics and affars in Latin America, something I knew nothing about going into the course, but now feel I understand very well, thanks to the extremely knowledgeable Professor Carballal, who is also lovely and incredibly helpful. The structure of this class is also great, as there are simulations of mock governments, a few page long homeworks, and two 5-7 page papers, one of which you get to hand in a draft for, making it a very manageable class, with about 15-30 pages of reading a week. All in all, a great way to keep up your Spanish and learn a great deal about a very interesting topic.",
    "This is a really great class. I came in with 0 knowledge of politics\/Latin America&Mexico, but I came out with SO much. Carballal is wonderful, and knows everything about the topics she introduces in class. It is a good chunk of work, but if you're serious about learning the language\/topic, you should DEFINITELY take this class. The readings are manageable and super informative, and the best things for me were the \"midterm\" and \"final\" essays (5-7 pages), because I learned so much about a topic completely of my choice (environmental effects of drug trafficking--yeah, you can write about that--that's how broad the class is!), and the simulation activities (sort of like class debates, but you pretend you are a character, like the leader of a new government or a priest or a family member), where I learned a lot more about a specific, interesting facet of a topic, and also lots of vocab.I would say to take this when you're more comfortable with the language. I wouldn't say to take it right out of AP Spanish (I took IB, then I took another L5 class fall semester), but I do know people in there that did fine with less knowledge (though I was one of maybe 3 in the class taking it for a grade). You'll get more out of it that way, and Carballal gives you pretty much no feedback on vocab\/grammar until you have written exercises\/activities like the simulations. This is not to say you won't learn anything--I probably learned more in that class and had a better time than most of my classes this last year. Carballal is the best--always available at pretty much any time outside of class. She really does know her stuff on this!Lastly, forget about the Media part--it was the last week (partially our\/her fault for getting a bit behind, plus we had a snow day), and not very informative.",
    "Good class, but make sure you're super interested in Latin American politics, or you will feel bored and out of your depth. More like an easy Poli Sci section taught in Spanish than anything else. On the other hand, Professor Carballal is amazing, and everyone in the class is generally at a very high level of Spanish, so you don't have to wait awkwardly while a classmate tries to string a sentence together. The writing assignments are very low key, and the simulations, although seemingly annoying, really teach you a lot. As for the reading, sometimes it takes a long time to do since the vocab level for some articles is a bit high, but you get used to it (either that or the reading gets easier).",
    "The title of this class should probably be \"Contemporary Latin American Politics.\" It's a broad survey of Latin American politics taught by topic in a seminar of about 14 students with varying skill levels. It was a lot of fun, not too much work, and generally a good experience. That being said, the readings would sometimes be very vague and general, and so our class would come in with nobody really having a particularly strong or informed opinion to offer to discussions. Carballal is helpful and knowledgable, but sometimes she would talk at the class instead of encouraging student-driven debate. You do two simulations (ours were on the Dirty War and Cuba) that are really fun and helpful, and you write two research papers that I found to be challenging but rewarding.",
    "Definitely take this class if you can. It's easy to be misguided about Latin American politics as a result of the US media, and this class will encourage you to explore the truths behind the rumors. Important class for anyone interested in international relations and Latin America.",
    "Take it. No discussion here, take it and you won't regret it."
