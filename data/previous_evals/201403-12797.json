    "Very much an \"only-at-Yale\" class; got to look at a ton of old maps at the Beinecke and Sterling Map Room and read cool literature related to maps and exploration, in addition to some cartographic literature and theoretical texts on maps\/space. If this class had any fault it was that it was too ambitious; we were almost always short on time and didn't get a chance to discuss some of our readings, either because there were too many assigned each week, or because we spent a good chunk of time looking at physical maps or listening to student presentations. Ayesha is great at leading class discussions and making sure everyone gets a chance to participate, and also assigned some fun projects.",
    "As I said, Maps with Ayesha is one of those Yale classes that is so absurdly wonderful that I am filled with gratitude each time I look back on it. Ayesha is an incredibly talented seminar leader, the books and readings are so beautiful and eye-opening, and the theme of the class (maps in literature, maps as literature) is so fascinating and paradigm-shifting. The class examines the literary and cultural history of maps. We read wonderful books, fascinating criticism and cultural histories, and we also got the chance to examine beautiful map objects in Yale's collection. Take this class if you wanted to spend more time in the Beinecke and need a place to start. Class discussion with Ayesha was always fascinating and engaging. The class does have many papers and projects, but we had a lot of freedom in how we completed those assignments. People in the class had very diverse interests (there were architecture students and literature majors and even a physics grad student), and it was very cool to see how everyone responded to the different prompts.",
    "This class is an example of the best that Yale has to offer. The subject matter is incredibly rich, the resources you get to explore are amazing (classes are held at the Beinecke and sterling's map room) and Ayesha, while giving you enough intellectual stimulation to get you thinking, leaves room for individual interests and exploration. You read Pynchon, you read Deleuze, you read Calvino. What do all these have to do with maps, you ask. EVERYTHING IS MAPS. take this class",
    "Do you like maps? Do you hate maps? Do you like Yale? Does Yale serve Chicken Tenders on Thursdays? IF the answer is Yes to any of these you should take this class because if you don't you will regret your very existence. The Professor is AMAZING, the readings are INTERESTING, and the maps are PRICELESS. TAKE IT, TAKE IT, TAKE IT!",
    "Absolutely take it. I knew nothing about maps going into this class, and I loved it. Professor Ramachandran is an incredible professor and you will find something to love about cartography, literature, or just the way she leads class discussion. This class will make you think, be creative, approach literature in new ways everything about it is a dream. Being able to handle original maps in Beinecke or Sterling was incredible, especially since I hadn't spent much time in either library before this semester. As a friend put it after the last class, \"I walk out every week smiling.\" Don't miss the chance to take Professor Ramachandran's class."
