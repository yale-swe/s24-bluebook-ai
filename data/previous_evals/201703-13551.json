    "Learned much about geospatial software design.",
    "This course gave me a solid foundation to understand programming in geospatial analysis.",
    "I gained a basic understanding of Python and Earth Engine, and more familiarity with coding in general.",
    "Practical, applied use of Earth Engine and arcPython code editor."

    "It aligned very well with my expectations of what this class would go over.",
    "It surpassed my expectations.",
    "Fairly well. I expected a bit more introductory information, especially with Earth Engine, rather than just launching into it. Other than that it met my expectations - it is taught very similarly to Dana's other classes.",

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of the course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I found the examples and resources provided to be very helpful. The vagueness of the homework assignments made it somewhat difficult for me to challenge myself; it was difficult to come up with a problem or analysis that would allow me to utilize the skills we were learning.",
    "Strengths: the other students in the class were helpful and interesting to bond with. The homework assignements and final project were engaging as well. Weaknesses: It was challenging to learn some of the basics of what we were doing - what is a sattelite image, how do you get it, what information can you pull out of it- because we went quickly into the tools and where to find them etc. this class should be switched with the observing earth from space course so it is in the spring.",
    "GEE documentation is far more intuitive and helpful than ArcPy, which already has its share of problems with technical glitches in ArcpPy that has operations failing regularly. A troubleshooting manual would be extremely helpful.",
    "Strengths are many, including instructor knowledge and material covered in class. Weakness might be the pace (fast).",
    "I can hardly think of any weaknesses. The course content is excellent and Professor Tomlin is an extraordinary teacher.",
    "The class was great, except I felt fairly lost in the beginning of the Earth Engine section. This class gives very little background on satellite imagery, how it is collected, and how to analyze it, which made getting started difficult. I found myself spending far too much time struggling to collect imagery because I didn't understand what I was looking at. I think this class should be switched with the spring course on imagery to give students the opportunity to gain more of an introduction.",
    "The handouts, notes, and examples for Earth Engine and arcPython are excellent. If you take the time to go through the examples, you will learn the material. Both tools are fun and engaging, and I could see Earth Engine and arcPython offered as separate courses."

   "comments": [
    "Identify a topic or problem you are interested in that will allow you to utilize the skills you are learning in the course.",
    "If you already have experience in JavaScript or Python, or with remote sensing, this class will be great. If not, it is hard to get a lot out of it.",
    "Yes. If you love a good old fashioned challenge and want to learn a lot of interesting marketable skills along the way.",
    "Attend the classes and do so attentively, they are important and fun.",
    "You definitely need an introduction to GIS, satellite imagery, and coding to jump into the class successfully. It does give a great overview of Earth Engine and Python, and plenty of space to explore a topic or project you are interested in.",
    "Take the time to run through each example on your own, utilize Piazza, and take the time to get arcMap onto your computer at the beginning on the semester so you're not scrambling to troubleshoot it mid-semester when you'll have less time."
