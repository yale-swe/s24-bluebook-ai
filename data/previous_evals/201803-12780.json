The draft work plan was a useful exercise even if things changed so much it wasn't useful.",

    "Perhaps more information on how to find documents, types of meetings (informal, inf-inf, coordination, plenaries). That information would've been useful in advance of going to COP.",

    "Professors and TF available for questions, and the class had a nice atmosphere\/environment. It could be improved by being a bit more formal - we met for about 30 minutes each time, and I would have been willing to meet for longer in order to have a more organized introduction to attending COP.",
    "I benefitted most from listening to students who had already attended several COPs -- their advice was incredibly helpful. My only suggestion for the course would be to go through the UNFCCC website before COP to show students where to find schedules and negotiating documents.",
    "I don't think that this course is very useful and question whether it should be offered\/required at all.",
    "see above.",
    "The classes were very flexible and gave students opportunities to share their experiences or any concerns that they had, to build up a support system ahead of COP24, and to learn from each other as a class.",
    "The course prepares students to attend the climate summit and I would love to see more interaction with CDO on how students might maximizing such opportunities."
