    "It could be improved by perhaps getting a better overview of the students interest so appropriate faculty can be selected to given presentations.",
    "presentations are interesting. could invite more professors",
    "The course should be offered in fall. Most of us already had research groups.",
    "Have more research topics presented and only have professors speak that are interested in taking on more graduate students.",
    "The course was a good way to find out about the different types of research going on in the department as well as what professors are currently looking for students.",
    "This course needs to take place during the first semester. While I very much enjoyed the presentations and learned a lot about the research in the department, I couldn't help but thinking how much more valuable that information would have been during my first semester here. I and most of my peers began looking for an advisor during the first semester, and knowing exactly what professors were working on and who was looking for students would have made the process of finding an advisor much easier and far less stressful. By the second semester, after most students have begun working with someone, the course, though very interesting, is no longer helpful in this respect. It feels like a huge missed opportunity, hence why I disagree that the course is organized to facilitate student learning. I have heard that one reason the course is not offered during the fall is so that the graduate students are not overloaded during their first semester. If that is the case, I know several students sunk more time during the first semester into individually researching and meeting with advisors than the course would have taken up, so I expect it actually would have saved time and made the semester easier."
