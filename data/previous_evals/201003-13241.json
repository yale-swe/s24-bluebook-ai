    "DEFINITELY TAKE THIS CLASS. There's a lot of work at the beginning, but it levels off. The final paper is fun to write and the mid-term is not that hard.",
    "This class is so much more than just Hebrew Poetry in Muslim Spain. It is a history course, a literature course, a philosophy course, all in one. It may seem like a very specific topic, it is very interesting and you can learn a lot that is relevant to your life from it. If you want to study poetry that was written a thousand years ago, but feels like it's written for you in a fascinating time period, definitely take this course.",
    "Wonderful material, fantastic professor - take it!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to people who are interested in Jews and Arab lands, the process of translation, and medieval poetry. You will be fascinated, excited to come to class, and learn a ton.",
    "This class was amazing. I learned about a fascinating culture and world that I did not previously really know existed. Professor Cole is a great scholar, friendly instructor, and very helpful professor. The workload starts off very heavy initially, and then, about a week before the midterm-- with the obvious exception of the midterm itself-- drops off very significantly.",
    "I would summarize it as a course where you learn about the setting and poetry of the Jews in Muslim Spain, with a focus on the four major poets of the age: Samuel HaNagid, Solomon Ibn Gabirol, Moses Ibn Ezra, and Judah Halevi. I would absoltely recommend it to another student--unfortunately I don't think it's being taught again.",
    "Take this class, even if you don't have any background in Islamic studies, Spanish studies, poetry studies, or Judaic studies. It's worth it for the professor.",
    "Take it. If you're Jewish\/not Jewish\/interested in poetry\/interested in history. Peter Cole is a wonderful professor, who devotes an extraordinary amount of time to each student. Be prepared to work hard, but it's worth it.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS!"
