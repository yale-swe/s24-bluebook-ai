   "comments": [
    "Really great survey of western classical music! Lots of information but worth it to learn it all!",
    "Beautiful class, beautifully taught. Yes.",
    "MUSI 131 gives a great overview of the history of Western music, starting from Beethoven and continuing through to the 90s. Professor Kreuzer is amazing and so knowledgeable and you definitely don't need to have a music theory background to take this class! You'll walk away knowing a lot about music, and can finally go to classical music concerts and know what you're listening to.",
    "Take this class! Professor Kreuzer is awesome, and if you're at all interested in how music, art, and social movements come together in various sociopolitical milieus, this class will add color and depth to your life.",
    "It introduced me to a wide variety of music that I never knew existed! Thank you Prof Kreuzer!! The most amazing thing is that this class showed us exactly how certain composers and musical styles arose out of reactions to predating styles and genres!",
    "Music 131 is a fun course where I learned a lot about the different eras of music. The homework is very low stress - we usually just had to listen to a few classical recordings and read like 10 pages in the textbook and a few other articles. The lectures are interesting and filled with more cool musical recordings. A music background helps, but isn't mandatory - I have never taken any theory classes, but play an instrument, and I felt very comfortable in the class! I would definitely recommend it to anyone with any interest in music, even if they have no musical background.",
    "Music 131 is an ideal course for those who want to learn to develop a better ear for the music to which they listen. It is almost as ideal for the student who wants a general overview of the history of Western art music since Beethoven, but it suffers from the time constrictions that all survey courses do. Professor Kreuzer is one of the best, most engaging lecturers at Yale, and I really appreciated how much prep work she put into each and every lecture; you will consistently be in awe of her ability to casually walk over to a piano and play whatever piece she is discussing without reference to sheet music or notes. She also does a wonderful job of weaving music history with broader world-historical moments as well as movements in other art media. Her lecturing style is also very accessible, in that she distills complex musical terminology into terms that are comprehensible to those, like me, who do not have much musical background. The one caveat I have in recommending this class is that if you are looking for an outlet for analytical writing about music, this is not it. All of the written assignments are primarily descriptive explications about the technique or compositional procedures, and you do not necessarily get the opportunity to delve below the surface in that respect.",
    "Good introduction to the musical development of the western world post-Beethoven. Good intersection of historical content with musical theory.",
    "Fantastic course. Prof Kreuzer is a wonderful lecturer and really brings out the interesting stories and characteristics about the pieces and composers examined. Grading is fair and the exams are pretty straightforward if you've followed the material closely.",
    "MUSI 131-- a must-take. Going to every class was a joy because the material presented was fascinating, and the professor and the TAs were so supportive of every student!",
    "Great survey of music history from 1800 on. Definitely an easier class if you've had some music experience but I wouldn't base a decision to take the class solely on this point. Prof. Kreuzer is a great lecturer, and there's a nice balance between readings, exams, and short assignments.",
    "As a science major, I originally took this class for the distributional requirement. However, it quickly became much more than an extra course in my semester because of the amount that I learned and how much I enjoyed the class in general. If you have the time and are interested in Western art music, you should definitely consider this course.",
    "I thought this class was a great overview. It was not unduly demanding and the homework was always fun to do. It was very meditative to be able to take a break from my other homework to do listening exercises. There was little assigned reading and lecture was always engaging.",
    "This class is an engaging lecture with easy assignments, manageable readings and listening assignments, and a fairly tricky midterm exam. I took it CR\/D, which I would really recommend--not because the class is really hard or anything, but because the lectures were really worthwhile, I enjoyed coming to class every day, and I felt like I was learning stuff that made me a better person and cultured citizen!",
    "This is a great course for anyone interested in music, whether or not they play an instrument. You learn a ton of material, but the class and the readings are never tedious or repetitive. Professor Kreuzer is engaging and enthusiastic. This was one of my favorite classes at Yale."
