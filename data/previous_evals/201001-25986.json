    "YES YES YES. TAKE THIS CLASS! MDR is awesome, and you'll love the readings.",
    "A truly wondrous, but lightning-fast, tour of some really important thinkers and some really brilliant ideas. Definitely take it, and definitely GO TO THE LECTURES. You will learn a tremendous amount and think about thinks in a more sophisticated way and with greater humility. Emphasis on Philosophy lectures: unlike other DS lectures which can seem supplementary and complimentary, the Philosophy lectures provide really, really good summaries and framing for each work on the basic level. You will have an easier time understandingand appreciating the text if you go to these lectures.",
    "Its hard, but worth it. You will feel much more educated, but also expect to feel a little out of your intellectual comfort zone",
    "This is a great overview of modern philosophy. It gives the clear narrative thread of the philosophical issues that defined the modern era and you are able to experience it with some of the best philosophical minds in the business! I highly recommend it.",
    "2nd Semester philosophy is very different from 1st semester. In some ways it is harder, but in other ways it is easier to see what the authors are trying to do. It was once said that all of philosophy is but a footnote to Plato. It is interesting to approach the 2nd semester readings with this in mind. Yes, I would recommend this class.",
    "I recommend it highly"
