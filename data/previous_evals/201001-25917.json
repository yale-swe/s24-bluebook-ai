   "comments": [
    "Economics 404 really dives into development topics such as the poverty trap and government sponsored education and is really fun. You read 2 papers a week and go over them in class. The workload was very manageable and you come out with a good understanding of how econometricians model problems and conduct data analysis.",
    "Econ 404 is a good class and I would recommend it. It might be difficult if you have had no econometrics and is a good compliment to Econ of Developing Countries. More classes in this field should be taught at Yale!",
    "A great econ course with enough work to make you think but not enough to stress you out.",
    "I would recommend this class if you're interested in public health issues and economics of course.",
    "It's a good high level economics class to take. I would suggest it to econ majors who are looking to avoid the senior paper. Overall a great class with not too much work.",
    "Take this class. This is the best class I have taken in the econ department in four years. If you are at all interested in development issues, you will really enjoy this class. The workload is pretty low, Professor Qian is really nice and a great teacher, and all the papers that you read are really interesting. All econ classes should be more like this one."
