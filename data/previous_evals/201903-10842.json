    "The math behind intro micro",
    "How consumers and producers make decisions in an economically ideal world. Honestly, the Freakonomics podcasts were the most interesting part of this class.",
    "I learned similar conceptual material as in introductory microeconomics but with much more mathematical analysis.",
    "Learned skills to approach any profit maximization \/ cost minimization problem. Strengthened mathematical understanding of economics.",
    "Learned about the production function, consumer theory, monopoly vs. duopoly vs. perfect competition, and externalities.",
    "There is a lot of multivariable calculus. The first midterm is essentially a math test. If you havent taken multivariable, I suggest learning Lagrange multipliers, (bordered) hessian matrixes, and partial derivatives beforehand. It will save a lot of heartache later on.",
    "Lots and lots of multi-variable calculus to solve economic optimization problems.",
    "The same things you learn in intro, but with some lagrangian sprinkled in.",
    "I learned how to apply derivatives to microeconomics. I improved my math skills (lots of partial derivatives\/Lagrangians).",
    "basic economics with calculus",
    "In this class, I learnt a lot about the microeconomic skills. We apply mathematical models like Lagrangian method to many different cases in our real life.",
    "I learned about concepts like price discrimination, collusion, and game theory.",
    "Consumer and Producer Theory.",
    "I definitely feel impressed with how much I learned. Like after walking out of my final I was truly in awe at what I just did. Economics is scary",
    "I built upon my microeconomic knowledge from Introductory Microeconomics. I learned a lot of mathematical techniques and have become very familiar with profit maximization. I also learned a lot of theory, and about real world implications of what we learned in class.",
    "I got a really good grasp of intermediate micro.",
    "Good analytical skill development. But honestly, it just felt like the same exact concepts from intro micro but now we took derivatives. I dont know if I gained any new knowledge about economics that wasnt covered in intro, but I did learn partial derivatives.",

    "This course built on the key concepts from intro micro, adding a greater degree of math to better understand and explain certain concepts.",
    "Calculus related to microeconomics, profit maximization, basically building on intro micro with more math.",
    "I took Introductory Microeconomics during my first-year; therefore, this course was a good continuation of the material studied in Intro Micro since it builds upon it and further explores concepts that were only touched upon in the introductory course. I learned how firms choose their optimal supply based on costs and the output they are capable of producing from a given input. I also learned what the optimal demand of a consumer would be for a certain good. One of the most interesting parts of the course was exploring the way firms react to other firms' decisions in the market and the amount they choose to produce based on that.",
    "If you already took intro micro, this course will teach you nothing about economics. The only thing I felt I learned was how to do the same problems from intro micro, but with calculus.",
    "A lot of the assumptions that had been made in Intro to Microeconomics were explained. I feel much more comfortable with basic economic ideas and now have a solid base to expand on.",
    "This course did not expand my economic knowledge at all. I mostly learned how to apply basic calculus to everything we learned in intro micro.",
    "The calculus behind what I learned in intro micro: applying Lagrange multipliers to utility maximization and cost minimization. Basically the whole class is learning how to apply Lagrange multipliers to everything.",
    "I learned a lot about microeconomics, more specifically, about utility functions and how individuals and firms act according to basic economic principles. I also learned how to take the Lagrangian and partial derivatives of many, many utility functions. I really enjoyed the part about learning about the different ways firms compete against each other in oligopolies and in perfect competition.",
    "I expanded my knowledge in microeconomic theories.",
    "In this class, you will become very good at solving basic optimization problems using multivariable calculus. I think it gives a bit more of a mathematical basis for concepts in microeconomics.",
    "Learnt a lot about Lagrangian, and how to use Math in basically every microeconomics concept you can think of.",
    "I learned a lot about the mathematics behind economics; this course is very math-heavy and builds upon the conceptual ideas developed in intro micro and macro.",
    "how to use Lagrange",
    "Used calculus to answer theoretical economics. Includes demand side and supply side questions.",
    "I learned the mathematics behind important economic operations like cost minimization and profit\/utility maximization. I also learned about various types of problems, such as those of welfare, consumer, and labor. Overall, I learned the perspectives used in economics and the fundamental tool that help economists arrive at solutions to important problems.",
    "Understanding of economics and calculus involved with calculations of economics.",
    "I learned how to apply multivariable calculus to economic problems.",
    "A more rigorous mathematical grounding in microeconomics. Firm theory, Consumer theory, labor markets, and an understanding of multi-variable optimization. This class is learning how to optimize and then applying that to like 50 different situations (which all make things a little different, requiring small adjustments to the standard process). Also practiced my calculus and learned the Lagrangian method.",
    "I learnt about the different market types, labor, welfare, consumption, externalities, etc.",
    "Math",
    "I learned some basic multi-variable calculus, which I did not know before the course. I reviewed a lot of the concepts I learning in my high school AP micro class, with some additional applications using more complicated math. I also learned that I definitely do not want to be an economics major.",
    "Lots of math skills",
    "How to apply Calculus to Intro to Microecon",
    "It's literally the exact same material as intro except with calculus. If you have taken any sort of multivariable calculus, you could teach yourself all the material in a week tops. There should be different intro track for students who have never been exposed to economics but have the math skills to take a class like this.",
    "Tangibly, not much.",
    "Learned important economic concepts on utility, welfare, budget constraints etc.",
    "Required course for my major. Gained micro-economic knowledge.",
    "I learned how to apply utility functions to different contexts -- on both the production and consumption side of things.",
    "I learned how to do a lot of math.",
    "The analysis of economic concepts using case studies and empirical facts, using simple economic models to explain individual behavior. Using the primary tool for understanding firm, consumer or government choices which is the maximization paradigm that assumes individuals behave as if they maximize an objective function; such functions may represent the level of profits, happiness or social welfare. Also to improve skills in using theoretical tools to formulate and solve economic problems. and gain a deep understanding of the economic aspects of individuals' and firms' decisions.",
    "memorization... some math i guess",
    "I learned how economic principles can be seen in everyday life. I also learned the intuition and thought process of economics from a smaller scale, coming from the viewpoint of a firm or a niche market.",
    "I relearned a whole lot of algebra that I never ever wanted to think about again. I also learned the same concepts that I learned in intro micro again, except in a much more confusing way that was made less applicable to the real world. Mostly, you learn how to do the lagrange. There were a few higher level problems beyond micro, but not much conceptually.",
    "I learned more in-depth concepts regarding maximization and preferences.",
    "I learned microeconomics on a deeper level than in the introductory course.",
    "The class teaches how to apply calculus principles to solve microeconomics problems, and I learned more about the technical\/mathematical side of econ than the conceptual side.",
    "I learned how to apply mathematical tools to various economic situations and further got to expand my knowledge on concepts that were merely touched on in intro micro.",
    "I learned to maximize profits and utility, and to minimize costs of firms in different systems (duopoly, monopoly, perfect competition).",
    "furthered what i learned in intro micro",
    "This course provided a broad overview of microeconomics topics. It's calculus-based (unlike Econ 110), but that really means that you apply the Lagrangian method over and over again, and the most calculus you ever do is taking partial derivatives. We learned to solve problems regarding utility and consumer preferences, labor supply and demand, duopolies\/competitive equilibrium, monopolies, intertemporal decisionmaking, insurance, and basic game theory situations.",
    "We learned about Lagrangian equations\/constraints, production, labor\/leisure, market clearing and allocations, and risk.",
    "Microeconomics. The rational behavior and math behind the optimal choices for consumers and firms.",
    "I gained knowledge of some of the basic theories of microeconomics including utility maximization, consumer preferences, labor supply, uncertainty and risk, and price discrimination.",
    "This course materialized my intuitions about the use of calculus and maximization problems in various economics problems.",
    "Annoying algebra mostly. It's mostly intro micro with annoying math.",
    "I learned about how to apply math and theoretical analysis to economics. You gain a lot of deeper insight into the basic principles learned in introductory micro.",
    "Mathematical ability and reasoning",
    "We covered many of the same theories and concepts covered in Intro Micro, albeit in more depth and more confusing jargon.",
    "Using calculus in economics and learning how to calculate using multivariate analysis.",
    "intro micro stuff with more math (supply demand, optimization through lagrange, producer and consumer theory, a little bit of game theory)",
    "Microeconomics with multivariable calculus",
    "I really enjoyed this class. I was able to apply mathematical concepts to understand the underlying topics in economics.",
    "I learned about monopolies, Lagrange, oligopolies, and elasticity.",
    "I learned a lot about mathematical expansions of theories taught in Intro Micro.",
    "Thanks to ECON 121 I really learned how to maximize consumer utility, while minimizing the costs of the firms. It provided me with valuable mathematical, same as analytical thinking skills, which will allow me to understand the economic powers in real life and think about problems more complexly.",
    "Good understanding of microeconomics in detail using statistical methods",
    "math behind the concepts from intro",
    "Deeper understanding of concepts covered in Introductory Microeconomics, stuff ranging from optimization to monopolistic competition",
    "Applying math to economic concepts. Gives you foundation to take more advanced econ classes",
    "Developed skills and gained knowledge relating to microeconomic theory",
    "This course offered new ways of evaluating how individuals weigh out their options. I had never before sought to add mathematical assessment of how a consumer may attempt to maximize their utility in the various scenarios we explored. I was introduced to new ways of assessing the relationships amongst goods, and the ways companies may try to maximize their profits given certain actions and possible actions of competitors.",
    "Many basic microeconomic models, as well as basic mathematical foundation",
    "Calculus based approach to microeconomics",
    "I definitely gained a better understanding of why certain concepts I learned in intro microeconomics work the way they do, I felt the course equipped me with solid economic analysis skills and am grateful for this part of the class.",
    "I got pretty good at finding minima and maxima with Lagrange multipliers.",
    "Math in relation to microeconomics",
    "I expanded my knowledge of microeconomic theory by applying basic calculus to mathematical models. I also learned how to solve problems methodically, and how math can be used to predict outcomes and the behavior of individuals\/firms.",

    "An introduction to micro theory, and especially the math relating to it.",
    "Intermediate microeconomics, Lagrange method",

    "Calculus focused microeconomics and Lagrangians.",
    "I learned to do economics mathematically",
    "Mathematical applications in economics.",
    "Lagrange multipliers and other mathematical methods of optimization for both producers and consumers. Basic understanding of functioning of various markets, various forms of competition.",
    "I delved into more intensive microeconomics and applied a lot of mathematical principles and models to economics. This is the first course that I have taken that taught this type of material. It was also refreshing to complete the podcast highlights and understand real world applications of what we learned in class.",
    "Enhanced understanding of microeconomic concepts through rigorous maths.",
    "I learned that there is actually some pretty cool math going on behind the weird and abstract concepts I learned in intro micro. I also learned that cool math is very hard.",
    "Standard intermediate microeconomics.",
    "Mostly the Lagrangian method of optimization applied to a variety of economic problems. I learned a lot of economic concepts, but I found that they were similar or the same as the ones I'd learned in intro micro."

   "comments": [
    "Professor Chalioti is by far the greatest asset to the class. She is very genuine and helpful and is not trying to trick you.",
    "The value added of this course is minimal in comparison with introductory micro, especially if youre math inclined. All it does is add calculus to econ 115, but if youre math inclined, you had that calculus in the back of your mind when taking econ 115 anyway. Much better to probably take 125, as long as the instructor gets better.",
    "PSETs were too long and involved too much tediois math which did not help us learn the concepts",
    "This class is usually a requirement for those who take it, and those who genuinely enjoy economics will enjoy this class. The strengths lie in Professor Chalioti's teaching style and the TFs' willingness to help with problem sets. The exams are straightforward and have no surprises, which I respected. There are no controllable weaknesses.",
    "Very fair problem sets and exams.",
    "Eva is an amazing professor. She really understands what needs to be focused on and assigns an appropriate amount of homework. The midterms are manageable. The TFs are always available. I really can't complain.",
    "The major difference in students performance seems to relate to their math background. It is unfair that only 112 is a prerequisite for this class when the course uses so much multivariable. I also question the necessity of the extent we went to employing math. Whenever I searched for resources online for some of the work we completed in class, only graduate courses appeared.",
    "Professor Eva Chalioti is a good professor; however, I felt that I learned even better during the Section for the course. I think the course is naturally not my favorite due to its heavy focus on math (which is unchangeable).",
    "It teaches the basics of economics in an effective, if at times difficult, manner.",
    "Strengths: Professor Chalioti is a very good lecturer, and her slides make complex material understandable. You also learn a lot by doing the psets. The tests are very fair. Weaknesses: The material can be a bit dull at times; you can only take so many partial derivatives before getting bored.",
    "I would say Eva is really nice, but she needs to be a lot more clear with the material. I don't think lectures were helpful at all. Moreover, the material is extremely boring. You will need this for the major so you might as well take it, but don't expect this class to be the one that piques your interest in the major.",
    "I think the course structure is great. It is clear there are three parts: mathematical models, different applications of Lagrangian method to individual consumptions, and then markets and firm actions.",
    "Chalioti is highly competent and empathetic to students; a rare combo that is reflected in PSETs and exams. Pace yourself carefully on the midterms; they are definitely a time crunch! But the actual content isn't difficult. You can absolutely do well in this class without ever going to section. As someone without a strong math background, I found the material fairly straightforward. If you can take a derivative, you'll be fine in this class.",
    "The economic theories from this class are very broad and simple, which I guess is necessary in an intro course. However, I would be interested in a few more nods to the applications and limitations of economic models.",
    "Problem sets take a long time and lecture is only somewhat helpful. I learned most of the material in section with Julian. He is the best TF, and I would not have survived this class without him.",
    "The class was a little dry and repetitive at times, since a lot of it is variations around the same theory. The hour and fifteen minute long lectures could feel very long at times. However, most of the class was very interesting and engaging. Personally, I really enjoyed the course material.",
    "Loved Eva! All the TFs were great! Very good class. Can't think of any improvements except shorter psets at the beginning of the semester.",
    "Strengths: lots of practice material for midterms, clear-ish slides, Eva tried her best. Weaknesses: lots of Lagrangian at the front, if you dont get that concept you are doneski.",
    "I think this course was very well organized and the material was a lot more relevant. I enjoyed ECON 121 way more than either of the introductory courses. Evangelia is just the absolute best. She really cares for her students and has a lot of knowledge to share. If you take ECON 121 definitely take it with Evangelia!",
    "The slides and course material were published very consistently (a strength), but the lectures were dry (a weakness). Easy to skip class and fall behind.",
    "Strengths are that Eva clearly cares about the course and tries to make it interesting. If you like math, there's math in the course which is also a strength because I found that concepts made a lot more sense when you look at them with multivariable calculus. The course could be improved by putting up practice material before exams (there are no practice exams and only a few practice questions that aren't really helpful) and having more consistent levels of difficulty on the exams.",
    "Very formulaic solid course, could be improved through my review material before exams (IE past exams from previous years to use to study)",
    "Professor was engaging, and organized lectures well. Sections were also a useful combination of theory and examples.",
    "Professor Chalioti is a great lecturer-- her slides were clear and she did a good job of breaking down complex problems. However, sometimes lectures would start off too slow and then get much more complicated during the last 10 minutes of class, which made it confusing to follow. The psets during the first half of the semester were disproportionately long and tedious. TFs were very helpful. Exams were fair and manageable, but I'm not sure what the curve in this class looks like.",
    "I wish there was a course in between 121 and 126 in terms of intellectual rigor.",
    "A strength of this course is that the information is better synthesized than it was in the Introductory Microeconomics class. Since this course builds upon previously explored concepts, the material being taught is easier to grasp when you have a solid ground in Microeconomics already. A weakness would be the fact that it is a little fragmented; not all of the concepts learned connect to each other so it is hard for a student to see the big picture. Moreover, although a lot of real life examples are mentioned during class, it is hard for me to believe that businesses do the work we did and make their decisions based on similar calculations to the one we were required to do on the problem sets.",
    "The lectures felt pointless the majority of the time. Professor Chalioti is nice, but is not the best overall instructor, so the material is not taught in an engaging way. Also, I didn't feel like a got any greater understanding of economics of this class other than how to do problems with caclulus. I found the sections of this class to be really useful in teaching how to do the problems on the psets\/tests, but didn't see much point in the lectures. I think this course could be improved by adding more emphasis on the conceptual aspect of microeconomics.",
    "The classes were engaging and the sections were very helpful. Sometimes, the content taught was a bit abstract and I would have appreciated to see how these things are applied in the real world. In addition, some PSETs included problems that we had not seen in class.",
    "Biggest weaknesses are the lack of feedback and the timing of the midterms (way earlier than they should have been).",
    "Strengths: Prof is pretty good at explaining concepts and fairly good at engaging the class, lots of practice material for exams. Weaknesses: Huge class (though there's nothing that can really fix this), class can get boring at times, problem sets were a bit too long at the start of the semester",
    "The professor was incapable of explaining the microeconomic concepts clearly or even walking students through the PSETS. Class should be spent doing more problems instead of explaining microeconomic theory that was explained less effectively than in micro and was ultimately not evaluated",
    "I think Eva did a good job explaining the material in class and organizing the Canvas page to facilitate easy learning. On top of that, I think there were lots of office hours that gave students lots of opportunities to ask questions and understand material. Finally, I think the material for me was very interesting and constantly built off of what we learned beforehand, and the problem sets were the right amount of challenge for students. I think the course could be improved by giving even a little bit of feedback on problem sets, though I understand that may be hard due to how large the course is. Maybe a few online quizzes could also allow me to ensure I'm understanding the material and keeping up with the coursework.",
    "The pace was very good.",
    "- You get very good at optimization - I think relating the concepts to actual real life examples more would be nice. It is kind of monotonous just doing similar optimization problems for theoretical concepts all semester.",
    "Eva is an incredible Professor who really cares about her students and wants them to learn. If you take this class, ONLY take it with Eva. She's really dedicated and patient and explains everything 5 times if needed. HOWEVER, the class itself is just unfortunate -- it's not her fault, it's the subject matter and the fact that this class is a core\/requirement for many majors that could care less about Lagrangian and what it entails.",
    "Strengths: The biggest strength by far is Eva. She made this course 100x more interesting and understandable than it would have been otherwise. She also listens to student feedback and shortened the psets after we told her they were too long (ugh love her). The course also is doable and not too hard if you pay attention in class and go to section. Weaknesses: TAs are not great, office hours are usually over-crowded and unhelpful. The material can also be challenging if you are not good with math or have a weak econ background.",
    "the actual content wasn't very hard, so often times it felt like they would have to get the curve by just making it like a lot of annoying algebra or something. its nice to explicitly think about the microecon using calculus, but it would've been nice to do maybe a tad more theoretical problems.",
    "Although this course explains well the process to solving basic questions through calculus it fails to explain how the actual economy works. After doing the same equations over and over in slightly different ways, students remained confused about what they meant to represent. For example, we talked about \"expenditure with consumption.\" In these problems, we determined how much two firms maximize profits when they must decide how much labor to hire. There were only two consumers in this scenario who owned half of each firm and provided the labor. There, the consumer income was the firm profit. This, of course, is not a realistic model. However, no example of how this idea is supposed to give a basis of representation of the larger economy was given. This was the case for most topics. I do not feel like I know any more about the economy than I did when I finished Introductory Microeconomics and that is because the course does not seem to be designed to teach that but rather to master an equation that - at least in the way that it is taught and implemented in this course - cannot even be effectively applied to understand or solve real life situations and problems.",
    "The strengths of this class lie in the professor, who is a great lecturer, and the TA discussion sections, which did a tremendous job expounding on the breadth of information in class and working students through concrete examples of the problems. There are few weaknesses. The class's shortcomings mostly lie in that it's a lecture, so it can be difficult to stay engaged at times, as well as the fact that there is so much material to cover in such a short time span.",
    "The teaching assistants aren't too helpful at times and the section isn't too helpful for preparing for exams. Some strengths are that the slides are informative to study in your own time.",
    "A lot of the examples are interesting, but I wish there was a much greater focus on the math. It felt like there were lots of derivations shown in lecture, but it was mostly just showing math and not much explaining the economic intuition. From talking with more and less math-savvy students, I found that the students with strong math backgrounds (multivariable calc and higher) had an easy time understanding the intuition just by seeing the math. Unfortunately, the students with weaker math backgrounds can't see the intuition just from looking at the math and need further explanations before understanding how a concept works. Personally, seeing the math behind the concepts in lecture more often than not left me feeling like I was swimming in alphabet\/variable soup. Since the class is math-focused in the problem sets and assessments, and is meant to give a solid math foundation for economic concepts, spending more time on the math in lecture and going slower would help a lot. The math may not be as engaging as the fun examples, but it's the most important part of the class. Not understanding the math leaves the other stuff void.",
    "The strength of this course was that the problems are often interesting and new, and what you're figuring out feels useful\/real. For example, how does a company make profit, why competitive markets are better than monopolies, and how insurance works. What is weak about it is that it just repeats all the same concepts that you learned in introductory microeconomics, but with way more math. Means the class isn't particularly intellectually stimulating, and can feel like you're actually just obscuring concepts you used to understand with a ton of math.",
    "strengths: the slides were very informative and you could miss class and still be fine if you looked at the slides weakness: for both the midterms and the final, there was only one review session which was held a week before each exam and if you had not started studying for the exam, it did not make sense to attend the review session but then you missed out on that since there was only time slot offered.",
    "SO BORING",
    "The course was fine. I definitely learned a lot. I struggled with the math at the beginning, while others with more math experience felt quite bored. Having a young woman professor was pretty empowering. I don't really like that we didn't get real feedback on our psets.",
    "Strengths: Workload wasn't too bad Weaknesses: Didn't feel like I really learned any econ. Felt like much more of a math course.",
    "I believe the course was very well structured, which facilitated learning. However, I feel that it was extremely uninteresting for any student who had already taken Intro to Micro. I felt like this course was essentially centered about taking the Lagrangean for every single situation, which is very repetitive. Therefore, I feel like this course did not test AT ALL economic concepts but rather one student's ability to do Calculus quickly (and I think Math courses should be for that). As such, exams were centered around solving problems not only in a mechanical way but in the exact same way that was thought in class. A simple deviation from that (demonstration or problem-solving) or a non-comprehension of the exam question would lead to a bad grade that does not reflect one's understanding of Economics.",
    "The lectures were fine. There was a low number of problem sets for some reason, but they were fine and were good preparation for exams. The podcasts on the problem sets were completely useless, though. Also, the final exam only covered material from the last third of the course so it should have just been a third midterm during the last week of classes.",
    "Boy I really don't know where to start on this one. Scrap it and start anew.",
    "Very organized and straightforward course",
    "Great TA sections. Maybe do more practice in class, less theory.",
    "The course was very organised, and it was especially helpful that we had review sessions during lectures. The problems we solved in lecture were helpful for the problem sets, and with every exam, you were always really clear on what exactly is going to be tested and how to approach the problems. At the same time, the course also allowed for discussions\/topics that were related to real life, with examples drawn from actual firms and industries contextualising all our discussions during lectures. There were plenty of office hours for this class and the TAs were generally incredibly helpful. One thing that would have been helpful was if we had more practice material before each exam: while the problem sets were helpful, the practice materials online were often different from the questions we had been solving, and it was hard to feel secure in our revision.",
    "Sections were a good recap of everything we did during the week. Psets were challenging but help was always available. Prof. Chalioti is an incredible teacher!",
    "I am a Global major and found this class completely devoid of any real life applicability. Though I enjoy learning economics, it was very frustrating that this class was all math and 0% real life application. This might just be how microeconomics is though, in which case it cannot be improved. I really didnt liked how the PSETS were so complex and the answers were always incredibly long and complex. Also, the midterm was IMPOSSIBLE, and almost everyone I talked about didn't do 1\/3rd of the entire exam. It was incredibly frustrating that we were given so little time to do so many problems. Similarly, I did not finish the final exam, which was very frustrating, because I felt like the exam tested speed rather than knowledge. I felt like all the questions were very straightforward and were ones that I had prepared for, but I didn't have time to actually solve questions I knew, which was really upsetting.",
    "Strengths: Clear lecture notes, canvas organized, like how there were a lot of office hour opportunities, exams were fair Weakness: Having old final exams would be nice to review and practice with before the final exam. Having practice problems in the lecture that are more similar to psets because sometimes I felt that what we practiced in class was not like the psets",
    "she tried. organized well.",
    "Strengths: Professor Chalioti was one of the most engaging and interesting professors I've had at Yale, as she kept the course fun and interesting even during dense lectures. Weaknesses: I felt that the lectures didn't prepare me well for the problem sets. While the problem sets were good indicators of the midterms\/final, the lectures were not good indicators of the problem sets.",
    "This class would be much improved by a decreased reliance on using hard algebra to make everything more difficult than it has to be. There is literally no reason this class had to be so hard math-wise. Why did I have to look up the rules of how to use freaking logs again?? Literally no reason. I hate math and thats why this class was garbage for me. I'm good at econ conceptually and always knew how to get to the answer, I just literally could not correctly do all the algebra in the time allotted on the tests, although I will admit the final had better numbers.",
    "The course is well-facilitated for learning.",
    "Strengths: you learn Lagrange. Weaknesses: kinda repetitive after intro micro. I'm not quite sure how to fix that, especially since some ppl. go a while between intro and this class, and might forget a lot of intro. Having remembered much of the intro class, I found this one kinda boring.",
    "The course is very organized, all the lecture material is posted online, and there are office hours almost every day so there are plenty of resources to help you learn the material despite it being a large lecture. The discussion sections are also helpful for learning in a closer environment. It can be intimidating to ask for help because office hours are generally very busy and there isn't much individual attention, but overall this was a very organized course.",
    "The problems are diligently covered in class and the pace of the course is comfortable enough for us to understand and practice applying every concept before going to the next one. The sections and office hours are helpful to complete every assignment. The podcasts are further great to explore concepts beyond those covered in class. The one improvement could be that we have mainly been required to apply the tools to find equilibrium conditions or consumption bundles, while we haven't truly put emphasis on analyzing real-life applications of the models and how they hold or not.",
    "Shorter Psets but more optional practice problems particularly before exams",
    "Strengths: in depth content, practical examples",
    "i think some of the examples in lecture could have been done more slowly but overall this course was very very well taught. i loved Eva",
    "There was a good amount of practice material available in this course, which I appreciated when preparing for the two midterms and final. We had weekly problem sets (with answer keys posted online after they were due) and Prof. Chalioti posted a few extra problems and solutions to the course website before each exam. I thought that the exams were pretty fair, after making sure I understood the problem sets and practice problems. There were a lot of TFs for this class because it was so big, so that also meant there were a good number of office hours where we could go work on problem sets. Section is optional, but Julian Aramburu was a really good TF so I'd recommend going to his section each week when you can; he runs through the methods for solving problems in a way that's really helpful for problem sets and exams. I also appreciated that the problem sets were graded on effort, because I thought that took some of the pressure off and made them more about understanding the material. The grading for the course was pretty well spaced out between each exam and the problem sets, which I also really appreciated for those reasons. A small weakness of the course that I think I'd like to see changed was the podcasts on the problem sets each week. Sometimes listening to them was interesting, but I often found them to be a time suck that wasn't really all that helpful for understanding the course material or getting more excited about it. I think it would be good if Prof. Chalioti recommended some interesting podcasts on the syllabus or in class but didn't make them required.",
    "This course is well-structured and nicely paced, and I thought the tests and problem sets were pretty fair. As a Global Affairs major, I thought that there was too much math that wasn't applicable to me, but I'm sure for an economics major it was useful.",
    "I think spacing the midterms out more would have made the course stronger. Rather than having the first midterm in the first three weeks of school and then being done by Halloween, I think that course would have been better if the first exam was around Fall Break and the second around Thanksgiving. This would have allowed for more content to be tested on the first two exams and would have made preparation for the cumulative final exam much better.",
    "Students should be given more review material for the exam- we would benefit greatly from practice problems and a longer review session.",
    "I like the content a lot. Its very interesting and the slides give you a decent amount of information. I wish more class time was spent on the math, however, and setting up equations.",
    "Amazing course, no negatives.",
    "The course material itself was fine, and the PSets were mostly fine too. The main problem with the course was that it was poorly taught and the additional support lent by teaching assistants and office hours was far from enough to make up for the lackluster disorganized way the course was taught. Everything I learned in this class I learned by outside research and talking with other teachers. Nothing in the course was clear, from the course structure to the teaching to the grading rubric to the curve itself. Any future iterations fo this course should strive for more transparency in the course material and structure.",
    "Very interesting course with ample support in discussion section. Would be helpful if more real life applications were used.",
    "strengths- eva is a good lecturer. she always asks \"Are you with me?\" weaknesses- exams can be a tad confusing, but are still very fair. psets are literally effort based so everyone gets 10\/10 leaving your grade based on just exams.",
    "Section was not very helpful. Lecture was a bit dry. I liked how psets were graded on completion though. Professor was nice",
    "The class is very organized, which I really enjoyed. Also, Professor Chalioti is a great teacher and explains everything really well.",
    "A strength is how passionate the professor is about the subject and how much she wants to help the students learn. It can be improved by including more examples with step-by-step answers.",
    "Evangelina is an amazing professor and although the material was very difficult at the beginning, she always guided us through the problems in class and I really understood her explaining. For the weakness, I dont really feel like there was a big one. It was a hard class, but I really feel like I learned a lot!",
    "Problem sets very hard and not based on lecture material Exams very hard compared to lecture material",
    "weaknesses: too little theory; not much more interesting insights than intro strengths: eva is nice",
    "Well facilitated with how many people take it taken into account.",
    "Strength: availability of TFs, pset grading. Weakness: sometimes, the pset questions don't exactly match what we've done in class, which can make it frustrating",
    "Strengths - covers the core material in a reasonable manner Weaknesses - student engagement could be improved, as most lectures have very little student interaction, etc",
    "Dr. Chalioti was very clear about what would be expected of us this semester. The abundance of office hours was a great opportunity to take time and work through ideas about the problem sets. We were wrestling with new ways of applying math, and it took a bit of time to work out approaches to some of the problems.",
    "I would have liked to find more practical applications",
    "Course went over core topics but did so in a way that was far too abstract",
    "A strength would be the discussion sections and office hours which I definitely did feel were helpful and beneficial to my understanding of the coursework. The biggest weakness or challenge in my opinion were the problem sets, which I felt generally took the concepts we had learned in class and made them complicated beyond at least my ability to work through logically. While I definitely don't think the level of challenge was excessive, it did feel at times as if what lecture had prepared me for was insufficient to properly tackle the questions being asked. As such it sometimes felt as if the class was not aimed at setting us up for success as opposed to purposefully making questions convoluted and obtuse.",
    "The course is somewhat repetitive and could be made more interesting.",
    "It would be very helpful if we could use the midterm questions to study. We never get them back.",
    "There were a few lectures that seemed superfluous and interrupted the flow of the class. I also felt that some of the more complex theories such as Walras Law were not conveyed in their entirety. Reading the textbook made me realize that there was a lot more material that we could have covered.",
    "Its a good course with a great professor. It just gets dry at times.",
    "I thought the course was well taught and well organized. Eva was an amazing professor and exams were clear. Only weakness is practice material was limited.",
    "The problem sets are good preparation for the exams and posting notes online is very helpful. The lectures could benefit from more interactive elements, plus it feels that they don't always prepare us for the pset problems.",
    "I wish there were more practice problems for us to do. The TAs were really helpful when I don't understand what's going on",
    "If you have to take the class, take it with Professor Evangelia. Strengths: The PSETs were graded primarily for effort and the exams resembled the PSETs and practice problems. The TAs vary greatly, but try to get a section with Julian. He is the best. The TF office hours are also pretty helpful. Weaknesses: The class is pretty boring and is honestly mostly math. The lectures alone don't give enough background so you often have to get help outside.",
    "The material is not too challenging and similar trends really stand across units. The weakness is that the course is really just intro micro, but with actually less emphasis made on individual theories and more on mathematical interpretation.",
    "Sometimes the professors explanations of the math behind the calculations was hard to follow in lecture.",
    "I believe that the course was very well structured to explain concepts, but it could be improved by introducing more real world information in the problems we solve to make it more engaging.",
    "I wish the class didn't focus only on Lagrangians the entire time. Sometimes it felt more like the class was just \"how to set up Lagrangians\" rather than a microeconomics class. The lectures were well paced though and the material covered was still very helpful.",
    "Lecture was fast and incomprehensible, and I ended up learning everything from the section TA.",
    "TAs are very helpful and there was always plenty of office hours and sections were very helpful. Exams were rather straightforward, although some problems on the midterms were surprisingly tricky; I liked the podcast part of the problem sets. Most importantly, Professor Chalioti is a great lecturer; she was really enthusiastic about the classes and always had very well prepared slides and gave thorough explanation of the material. Sometimes, the material seemed a bit too theoretical and, thus, it was hard to relate it to real life. Also, I wish there was more practice material.",
    "I felt that this class wasn't too conceptual and more so memorization of how to complete economic problems. However, there were many available resources, including office hours and posted notes. I really enjoyed being in Dr. Chalioti's class and liked how she taught.",
    "More practice problems!",
    "Eva is great. All the tests are very reasonable, to some extent predictable given the review session and the practice problems. As for weaknesses, I feel that there is too much an emphasis on Maths, especially Lagrange, rather than economic concepts.",
    "Lots of math\/theory thrown out way, but I never felt like I had a solid conceptual understanding of the material. I knew what to do, but not why. That should definitely be emphasized more throughout the course.",
    "The class is well-organized. The teaching staff is incredibly helpful, and always available to help. PSETs, while difficult, and sometimes very long, definitely helped me understand topics just by working through them. I felt like I was able to apply methods that I had barely learned in class. However, the lecture moves along very quickly, and it is so freaking hard to keep track of all the calculus that is happening on-screen, and at the same time to remember what the problem at hand is asking in the first place. I often felt like Professor Chalioti would just delve into deriving an equation without first establishing a) what problem we were trying to solve, b) why we needed to solve it, and c) how we could approach the problem. It was very difficult to remember the mathematical methods that we learned in class without any practical context. I feel like the course could be greatly improved by having some sort of structure, for example, a broad overview of game theory, discussing how we would first establish the decision-making problems, then introduce different types of decision-making, derive the math for each, and then connect the entire thing to competition. The only time I ever had an idea of what the big picture problems were was at the review session before every exam. It often felt like the course topics were being \"created\" by the math - when really, it is the math that is \"created\" in order to explain the course topics.",
    "Strengths: presented content somewhat well, breadth of applications presented. Weaknesses: applications were cursory, and the actual problem sets were all pure textbook economics. Wished that the problem sets included some modeling using real-world data for example, in our discussion of monopolies, would loved to have seen data on how price levels have changed in a market with the entry (or absence) of a competing firm.",
    "I liked the extensive lecture slides, but I found that the rote method of solving each equation (grouped by type) was not that compelling in terms of actually knowing 'economics.' It wasn't really a class that was much of a conversation starter."

   "comments": [
    "I think you should take it. I don't think I will continue with the econ major after this, but I still recommend it.",
    "No. Take econ 125 or 350 instead.",
    "Yes. Since you're at Yale, you have a high chance of ending up in some field where this is definitely a good class to have under your belt. If you know how to calculus, definitely take this over intro micro. Although the models aren't the most realistic, the ideas and logic behind them are pretty useful and applicable to the real world.",
    "Yes! If you placed out of econ 115 with AP credit I would definitely recommend this course as long as you have also taken multi (or at least have studied lagrangian maximization). This class doesn't really go into much of the economic theory and seems more like a math class at times because it is so heavily focused on using lagrangian maximization techniques for econ problems. But if you feel confident in your understanding of economic concepts I would say take this class instead of repeating everything again in 115 because 121 is a very solid class and sets you up for further classes in the department!",
    "Yes, if you are interested in economics. It provides a strong foundation for microeconomics and future courses.",
    "Only take this course if you have to",
    "Unless you're a Global or Econ major, probably don't take the course. It's basically a calculus course to solve economic optimization problems and not an enjoyable class whatsoever.",
    "If you want to take higher-level econ classes many of them use this as a prereq, so in that sense, it can be boring but worth it.",
    "If you're taking this class, it's probably because you're an Econ major. It's the hardest course I've taken so far within the Econ major. I was a bit nervous coming into the class, since this was my first experience with partial derivatives (the furthest I had gone in math was Math 112.) However, they teach you everything you need to know; I got by just fine without having any multivariable calculus experience prior to the class. There were 8 psets. The first few probably took, on average, 10-12 hours. Later psets were a bit shorter (5-7 hours). It's definitely helpful to have friends in the class so you can go through psets together. The class is taught very well. The lectures\/slides make sense, and you learn a lot from the psets. The tests are always a time crunch, so you have to really know the material and work fast without making algebra mistakes.",
    "I would not, unless you are an economics major.",
    "Definitely yes, especially to those who would love to be an Econ major.",
    "No, this course is a lot of work for very tedious concepts.",
    "You have to take it if you're an econ major. Even if you're not, I'd still say this class is worth taking if you're somewhat interested in the material.",
    "Take it only if you have to.",
    "Yes, if you are interested in the subject matter or need it for major requirements. It is a bit of a time commitment and requires a strong foundation in calculus, but otherwise was a very fulfilling class.",
    "Yes, especially with Eva. Really fun math and very interesting topics.",
    "I dont know if I would do it for fun but have to do it sometimes for the degreee!",
    "Yes to people that are an econ major or anyone looking to get a better grip on econ. Definitely 10000% better than the intro courses. If you take it, take it with Evangelia Chalioti.",
    "Yeah, it's a good overview of microeconomics, and the workload isn't too bad if you are mathematically inclined.",
    "I'd recommend the class. It's obviously not riveting or going to change your life. Almost certainly not the best course you're going to take at Yale. But for the rep it gets, its really not that hard. I'd take it with Eva.",
    "Take it w Eva if you can, otherwise don't take it unless for the major, not a fun course",
    "Yes, Eva is great.",
    "Yes, I believe that learning microeconomics is useful for anyone, regardless of major. The material was interesting, and the professor was engaging.",
    "Only if you are an econ major and must. Eva is great, but the course material is pretty boring.",
    "Yes! I found the class engaging and overall not too difficult. The math is just taking a bunch of derivatives and there are resources available (TFs, office hours).",
    "I would recommend it to people who have a lot of prior knowledge in Economics, are interested in the subject and do not mind doing a lot of work outside of lecture and a lot of studying on their own. I would not recommend it to anyone who expects that the course is sufficient for him to understand the most important Microeconomic concepts.",
    "I took this as a requirement and assume most students are doing it for the same reason. I WOULD NEVER have taken this course if it was not required. I took intro micro and felt like I learned a lot more about economics from that class than this one. All that I learned here was how to do the same problems in intro micro, but with calculus.",
    "If you are on the econ track, this is a required course and I very much recommend it. If you are not in the econ track, I do not recommend it.",
    "Really only take this course if its a major requirement or a prereq for a course you really want to take. This is not a particularly enjoyable course.",
    "I would recommend this class, though you're probably taking it because it's required. I think this class could be a little challenging if you haven't taken intro micro at Yale (though it's still extremely doable), but if you have taken intro micro, the class is pretty easy. It's pretty much a review of everything in intro micro but introduces how to apply Lagrange multipliers to all of the concepts. Lagrange multipliers could potentially be confusing if you haven't taken Math 120 yet because you learn there, but the Prof is really good at explaining it so you'll be fine even if you haven't taken it.",
    "Its a requirement. Honestly isn't hard you just need to be comfortable with calculus. Not worth going to class as it will only confuse you, just look at practice problems online and you will figure it out",
    "Only take this if you are an econ major and absolutely have to. This course is mindnumbingly boring and that's not the fault of the instructor, that's just how Yale econ works. It goes through the exact same stuff as intro micro just with a small amount more of math. They should honestly just rename the class Applied Lagrangians because that's really all you learn, and you don't need a whole semester for that.",
    "Yes, I really enjoyed the concepts that were taught in the class. I also think Eva and my TF Zhengren did a good job explaining these concepts and expanding off of basic ideas we learned earlier in class.",
    "If you are an econ major, and are not super interested in the mathematical theory behind microeconomics, then you should take this, although it can be boring at times. If you are not, you might still get a little bit out of doing the problems, though I think these things can be learned outside the class too.",
    "Lol please don't subject yourself to this class 'for fun.' Only take it if it's a required class, and then pat yourself on the back once you survive it.",
    "You are taking this class for a requirement so it doesn't matter whether you want to take it or not, but it really isn't that bad (as long as Eva is teaching it).",
    "if they have to take it for the major yea there's nothing super duper wrong with it. but not for fun.",
    "This course is a must for Economics, Global Affair, and EP&E majors, among others. I therefore recommend it to those who are planning on majoring in one of these topics. However, don't expect to learn much about how economic decisions are made in the real (dynamic, multifaceted) world.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student who is willing and able to put in the work required to truly master the content. Though it can be dry at times, someone with the requisite enthusiasm can take a lot away from the class, especially learning the mechanics of the operations that lead us to solutions.",
    "Yes, because it is a good intro course to economics.",
    "No, I'd say don't take it unless you have to. In its current form, the class leaves more confusion and work outside of class than its worth. The concepts are interesting but not well-explained for anyone without good math intuition. Also, as a first year, I found the pre-requisites to taking the class inadequate. Going into the class with only an AP calculus BC background left me feeling lost when we started using multivariable calculus (not part of the BC curriculum) in the first class period.",
    "Take it if you have to for your major, or if you want to apply to EP&E or Global and want to look qualified (don't even know if it helps but it might). Otherwise, no, there's no conceptual understanding that introductory micro doesn't provide and I don't feel like there are a ton of practical skills either. If we empirically measure demand curves and utility functions in the business sector then I guess so, but I really don't know if we do. Even if you do, you can learn Lagrange on the job, no need to take this class instead of class that is conceptually challenging or interesting and also useful.",
    "If it is a major requirement then you have to take it! If it isn't I would still recommend taking it, it was quite interesting.",
    "Nope unless you have to take it for your major (i.e. everybody in the class)",
    "I would say that you shouldn't really take this course unless you have to for your major. All of the interesting concepts are introduced in intro micro. If you do have to take the course, it's not the best and not the worst.",
    "This course is likely only taken cause you have to take it, but it was not as bad as many make it out to be.",
    "No. Course is Lagrange optimization applied a bunch of different ways, none of which are particularly insightful about actual economics. Exams are 2 hour fraction-fests as you rush through the problems that you know how to do but end up losing points because of arithmetic errors (curve is good though). Class feels designed to discourage people from becoming econ majors, and is not representative of a lot of other great classes in the department.",
    "I would recommend a student to skip Intro and go straight into this course after building up his or her Math skills--otherwise, it feels like the same thing all over and over.",
    "If you're an econ major, you have to take it. If you're a math\/econ major, you should probably take micro theory instead (which was my mistake). Otherwise, I have no clue why you'd want to take this class. You don't really learn anything useful\/interesting\/applicable.",
    "You don't need me to tell you not to do this. Only if you have to, and even then I would consider changing your major if it doesn't allow for a Credit\/D\/Fail.",
    "Yes, if they are interested in economics and how firms and consumers make choices",
    "Yes if you have to take it. Not just for fun.",
    "Definitely! One of the best classes I've ever taken here at Yale, due in large part to Professor Chalioti, who is easily one of the best professors I've ever had here. And since Intmd. Micro is a lecture class, this says a lot. The concepts covered throughout every lecture could easily have been grueling and needlessly complicated, but Eva really knows her stuff, and explains it all on a very grounded level. She takes the time to work through problems with you, and she's so nice about it, too. The epitome of a great professor, and therefore, a great class and experience!",
    "I would really not recommend this course to anyone. If you have to take it, I am sorry.",
    "Yeah but you probably have to take it anyway for your major",
    "yea i mean no one is taking this for fun. kinda dry and boring. seems useless",
    "If you are an aspiring economics major, it's a must take.",
    "Don't take this class unless you are required to, and if you are EP&E take it credit\/d unless you are really good at math. I hated this class so much, I can't even describe it. It wasn't even entirely Chalioti's fault, she's not that terrible of a professor. I just did not have the math background to succeed in this class and constantly struggled to execute simple concepts that I understood. This is because in the middle of the pset we would suddenly have to do the quotient rule or some other crap I haven't thought about since junior year high school calculus. I credit D'd this class hard, and I recommend doing that. I did terribly on the exams because of the math and I got an A in intro micro, so I'm not naturally terrible at anything here except algebra. To be fair, I put in less effort because I only needed a C-, but I still studied for these exams for not insignificant amounts of time before flunking them. TLDR: save yourself from this mess if you aren't great at math (esp if you haven't taken math at yale). If you are EP&E, credit d this instead of intro ethics, so glad I did.",
    "This is probably the best taught economics class. It is challenging but Eva is an amazing professor, and her skills and dedication aren't matched anywhere else in the department.",
    "It's kinda boring, so take it if you have to for your major. It's the same as intro micro, just with more math (taking derivatives for marginal things). I love econ, but this class is really just kinda bland after taking intro. The EXACT same concepts are covered with slightly more depth, and it just isn't really fulfilling coming out of the class. (This is not a reflection on Prof. Chalioti, who is great, but on the material that the course covers). TBH, if you can handle it as a freshman, you might consider skipping intro micro and just doing this.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone with a strong math background and who is willing to do some self studying because the class covers a lot of information very fast.",
    "I would recommend the course to another student since it is a great introduction to applying mathematics to solve some economic problems.",
    "Yes, it teaches microeconomic concepts in both mathematical and real-life terms.",
    "yes. but i would tell students who are not taking it as a requirement to be weary that it is not easy",
    "i mean its required",
    "I'd recommend this course with Prof. Chalioti (Eva) if you're looking for a broad introduction to microeconomics topics. It's not the most riveting class, and you won't come away with deep insights into understanding the economy, but for the purpose it serves I think it gets the job done and is a very fair class. I took this after taking Econ 110 credit\/D\/fail the previous semester, and I thought that it assumed some knowledge about the basics of some of the concepts from 110 but that it was still a pretty introductory class and one that you can probably take without having taken 110 if you're willing to read the textbook once in a while if you get confused and if you feel comfortable taking partial derivatives. i definitely wouldn't be scared away by the reviews saying that this is a very math-intensive course. Most of the homework and exam problems are basically math problems, but it really comes down to partial derivatives, algebra, and setting up the problems the way that they teach you. Prof. Chalioti is pretty good overall and definitely puts time and care into the course, so that was also a plus.",
    "I would say only take it if you absolutely have to or you have a very strong interest in economics and love math.",
    "Yes",
    "If you are interested in learning more about economic theory and\/or are an econ major, yes. If not, then probably no.",
    "Only if you're majoring in econ (its a requirement). Definitely don't take this for \"fun\".",
    "Yes, I think you gain a lot of deeper insight into microeconomic principles. However, the class becomes more difficult than it should be mathematically.",
    "This is a great course for anyone, not just economists.",
    "I would not recommend this course to any student who doesn't have to take it. You don;'t learn anything you can't find elsewhere, and the grading scheme is highly vague, while the teachers are largely unaccountable and unresponsive. The tests are poorly graded and do not explain anything about where you went wrong, nor do the grades on the Problem Sets. Solutions are rife with errors and typos that make it difficult to glean any valuable information, and most importantly, the teaching is unclear and confusing. Honestly, you might learn more about Economics by not taking this course.",
    "Yes, a very interesting course, with a very good interplay of economics and math.",
    "i recommend it if you have to take it for your major. otherwise, no point. psets are a lot of work, but they're effort based. exams are manageable. difficult to get an A but very possible to get A-\/B+",
    "Required for Econ and global affairs majors",
    "Yes, I would highly recommend this course. The professor is amazing.",
    "I would recommend if the student likes math and economics.",
    "If you need it for your major, yes.",
    "Definitely yes. As I said before, it is challenging at the beginning, but it is definitely worth the skills you will gain at the end of the course.",
    "Only if youre doing it for the major",
    "Definitely not, if you don't have to",
    "Yes, gives a good overview of the topics it covers",
    "Yes. You have to take it if you're an econ major, and it really is not that bad and completely doable!",
    "Yes",
    "Yes, I would. In a few months, we have explored scenarios that discuss how consumers\/firms choose between goods, risk, and responding to competitors. At the end of the course, I was amazed at how far I had progressed, and how easy it was to go back and complete the first few problem sets. This is not an easy course, but it is an interesting, challenging, and informative course.",
    "Yes, it was quite complete and engaging.",
    "As a requirement, I think it is not too bad a class to take, but likely would not recommend it for someone simply trying to get a background in economics if they do not need it or have a strong math background.",
    "Yes",
    "I think it teaches a good foundation to Econ, so yes.",
    "I would wholeheartedly recommend this course to another student so long as you can find a TF that you find helpful. The TFs overall are very in touch with the professor, which is a testament to the professors organization of the class. There are office hours every single day, so if you find a routine and make use of all the resources, the class will be very enjoyable.",
    "Yea only if needed. The skills obtained here were not of particular use if you are not an econ major.",
    "Yes, but only if it is required. Please take it with Eva.",
    "Yes, definitely! It probably isn't terribly useful stuff to learn if the class isn't required for your major, but it does cover some important theoretical topics about utility \/ profit maximization, etc. Not too hard if you are willing to keep up with the material on a weekly basis and go back over all of the problem sets before the exams (which are pretty straightforward). All in all, a good and definitely manageable class.",
    "Only to fulfill major requirements.",
    "It's helpful to be able to approach microeconomics situations with a more quantitative style; however, I don't think this course is particularly useful for anyone not pursuing an econ major.",
    "Only take it if you have already taken intro courses.",
    "Wouldn't take this class if it weren't a requirement, but if you take it, take it with Professor Evangelia.",
    "Absolutely, it's required for the major but also a pre-req for a lot of the great elective lectures and seminars offered at Yale. And it's not too difficult to manage, workload wise and in grading.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another person who wishes to develop the tools to analyse microeconomic problems.",
    "If you need it to fulfill a requirement, take it.",
    "If they plan on majoring in economics, yea",
    "I will recommend this class to an economics major who does not want to take Microeconomic Theory.",
    "I enjoyed it more than Into to Micro. If you have to take this course, I would advise you to take it in Fall with professor Chalioti.",
    "I would recommend this class to a student who wants to study economics. As for the general student, I feel that the content in this class is too specific and not really applicative to many other fields.",
    "Yes. As a major requisite, the course is well-structured and easy to navigate.",
    "I would recommend this class only to students who are genuinely interested in economics, confident in their calculus skills, and willing to buckle down for one helluva wild ride. The teaching staff were an extremely helpful resource to take advantage of, and I feel like the new economic perspectives I've gained and the accomplishment of finishing the course are well worth staying up to ridiculous hours to finish the PSETs.",
    "As far as an intermediate micro course, the course itself is fairly organized, the instructor (Eva) is clear, and sufficient resources are provided for student success. Take it if you have to, but know that you won't gain any mindblowing perspectives into how the economy or the world works. I wouldn't take it unless you have to for Econ, EP&E, Global, CS-Econ, or Math-Econ, because otherwise it really is a pointless waste of time (and a semester doing Lagrange multipliers).",
    "Only if you need to take it. There are other ways to get a good understanding of economics through electives.",
    "Yes. I really enjoy learning about microeconomics and it was even more interesting because of all the mathematical concepts integrated into it."
