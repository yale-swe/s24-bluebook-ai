    "Often, this course felt more like busy-work than effective educational engagement. Some of the assignments were fun, but the variation in instruction style, assignment, and reading work from week-to-week was difficult to manage at times.",
    "This course went as well as any proseminar could go; that is to say, it went quite well and fulfilled the goals it set out to accomplish. Something that might be addressed is the schedule of readings and assignments. Some of these were left quite obscure on the final syllabus. In the future it would help for planning purposes to provide a full list of readings and assignments to supplement the occasionally cryptic outline on the syllabus."
