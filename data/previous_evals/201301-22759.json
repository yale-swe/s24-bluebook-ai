    "Prepare for biology.",
    "Standard lab course - the reports can take a bit of time but after pchem lab, they're definitely not bad at all.",
    "This is fine lab class that is pretty low key compared to pchem lab. However, while the lab reports are less work, you also don't have the advantage of Vaccaro's organization and packets full of information. Especially for the two biology based labs, unless you've taken biology courses, you will have no idea what is going on until you're forced to write the lab reports.",
    "It's probably required, but it should be okay!",
    "You have to take it if you're chemE",
    "A requirement for the ChemE major, so the lab is all chemE majors. The workload is not too bad compared to PChem lab, but the lab does consist of 5 lab reports so it is fair amount of work compared to most classes. The TAs are fairly helpful and the labs are fairly straightforward.",
    "Good class although a few biology labs are performed which are difficult to grasp and to write up. The class is a nice review of all the topics you've previously earned. Take it Junior year if you can, it is totally manageable and you can get it out of the way for Senior year.",
    "The only reason you would take this is if it were required for your major. Otherwise don't bother. Of the 5 labs, 3 were mindless ones that covered basic topics we've already studied to death, and for the other two 2 no one had any idea what was going on since they were bioengineering labs. Also the 5-9pm time slot blows.If you're a young'un smart enough to look ahead at the evaluations for courses you'll be taking later in life, my advice is to pick another major. CENG is definitely not worth the headache, even if you are absolutely sure that you want to go into an industry related to chemical engineering (which let's be honest, you're not)."
