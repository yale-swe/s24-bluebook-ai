   "comments": [
    "General overview of disease mechanisms. Heavy on immunology, and the lectures are disjointed. Recommend with hesitation, as there is hardly any student participation.",
    "It is very good course for students who are interested in disease-related research. I would recommend it to another student, since it deepens of our understanding of different diseases.",
    "Lots of lectures, more of them were interesting. Long periods of no work followed by one intense week of work (for each test and paper). Not a lot of structure but I learned a lot and enjoyed the class.",
    "Interesting class to learn about different diseases being studied at yale and different methods for looking at diseases. The class does not stress KNOWING information about each system as much as understanding general STRATEGIES and patterns behind diseases, both unique and conserved.",
    "If you like pathology, good course.",
    "Patho690 is a fun class where you can get a great molecular understanding of a lot of diseases you might encounter as a first year grad student. I would definitely recommend to other students who do not have a strong background in many diseases already.",
    "This course provide insight into a large vairiety of human diseases. It is really a helpful coures at the interface of basic reasearch and medicine.",
    "The class provides a good overview of the pathology of many different diseases.",
    "Path 690 is a very interesting course were experts in the field cover the mechanisms of many diseases. Although a very good course, the course expectations are lacking and the workload is intense at times.",
    "I would describe the course as an overview of many different diseases, the current research aims of each field, and the mechanisms of the disease, with a strong focus on treatment. I would recommend the course.",
    "I would highly recommend the course.",
    "This class introduces the background and current research on various diseases, especially focusing on the research being done here at Yale. I would recommend this class to another student if they are interested in getting a introduction to a broad base of different diseases.",
    "Definitely yes to someone who looks for an introduction in mechanisms of pathogenesis."

    "General background knowledge to understand diseases.",
    "It is very helpful for my thesis research.",
    "There were no lectures geared toward my exact discipline but I enjoyed learning about other topics and experimental setups. This course did not really contribute to my dissertation\/research.",
    "I learned about a wide array of diseases in a manner that will be extremely helpful in the future when listening to talks about others research as I will already have a base knowledge of diseases where it is often assumed you understand before the talk begins!",
    "It helped me learn about a lot of the more clinical aspects of disease-related research, although it might not really have had a direct impact on my own research.",
    "The topics didn't help my research directly. The exams and papers did help me analyze the literature and think creatively of how to design experiments.",
    "It deepened my knowledge of disease and pathology, but was not related to my dissertation research.",
    "This course helped me through providing a couple lectures that were very useful information wise. Additionally, the tests and final paper helped me expand my ability to think about different ways to develop possible therapies and experiments."
