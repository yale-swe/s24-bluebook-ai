    "Take this class if you need a QR credit and want to learn something. It has real world value and doesn't feel like a complete waste of time.",
    "Good intro stats class! I was in 103 with JDRS and he's super entertaining during lecture (if you like his sense of humor). Class itself wasn't all that difficult, even for an intro class. I recommend it for someone who's not super mathy.",
    "Stats 103 is a great introduction to stats. I had never taken stats before, and I realized what a difference having a stats background makes the other day when I was reading a scientific paper- I actually understood the statistical tests they used and why they used them for certain data sets. I think that it is important to know something about statistics, and this class will give you that background. It was not a particularly difficult class, but you should not take that to mean that you don't have to do anything. All the notes were posted online, but you should still go to lecture. Theoretically you could never go to lecture and just read the notes, but going to lecture helps you understand the information SO MUCH more. Plus lectures are actually fun. JDRS somehow manages to make stats enjoyable. Take 103 so you can be with him the whole semester- he makes the information clear.",
    "I would recommend it if you're looking for an easier QR than calculus but don't expect it to be extremely easy. It moves very quickly and failing to pay attention in lecture makes it very easy to get behind.",
    "Yes!",
    "A great intro to Statistics, especially if you want to go into such fields as Technology, Business, Finance, etc. I look forward to taking more Statistics courses with practical applications.",
    "Good QR class and really useful. Psets are manageable.",
    "I would recommend it. The 103 section was really interesting. The class work gets a lot harder as the semester goes on so go to office hours.",
    "In short, it's a basic introduction to statistics and an overview of statistics as it applies to social sciences. You go through material very very quickly, so if you haven't had AP Statistics in high school, it might be a challenge for you. Overall, the workload is light (one pset a week) and not super challenging. If you're looking for an interesting, practical QR credit, this is the class to take.",
    "Yes, good intro class to a necessary subject.",
    "Basic intro to stats. Would recommend it, relatively useful and not hugely difficult QR.",
    "This class is a \"not very mathy\" math class, so if you're interested in getting rid of your QR requirement it's a good class to take. If you're interested in studying statistics, it's a good overview of the types of tests you can use to analyze data sets, and it gives you a good idea of how important the analysis of statistics is in real world applications.",
    "I assume you're taking this because you have to take it for your major, otherwise DONT TAKE THE CLASS IT IF IT'S NOT absolutely necessary!!!!!!!! That's all. This class sucks DONT TAKE IT. He goes too fast and doesn't explain anything and to do the PSETS just go to a TA otherwise you are going to get the questions wrong, they're not built for you to do on your own. If you're terrible at math like me, get a tutor, otherwise you are going to fail. Be ready to work your ass off and be confused, but if you do you should be able to get through it.",
    "Stat 103 is as good an intro statistics course as any - probably better because of the humor and good-heartedness of Prof. Reuning-Scherer.The homework and exams are not super easy, but my experience was basically that students who prepare will do well. Simple as that.",
    "For a QR credit, this class was really good. Professor Reuning-Scherer is funny, easy-going, and understanding, and he makes the lectures mildly interesting. 2 midterms and a final and weekly problem sets, all of which isn't bad if you stay on top of it.",
    "This is a really fun class. You have to go and pay attention in lecture, but if you do, it's not a hard class at all. There are no curve-balls on the exams (except for maybe \"what's your favorite color?\"), and the class prepares you for them very well.A word of wisdom: don't be put off by JDRS in the first lecture, he'll grow on you.Finally, a shout out to all of the psychology majors reading this: take this class instead of PSYC 200.",
    "If you're a humanities major who needs a QR, you should think really hard before taking this class. The first few lectures will seem easy and JDRS will seem like he makes things interesting and easy to learn. What ends up happening is that the subject matter gets really difficult and confusing, and you realize that the professor's jokes and silly metaphors are actually just making things more difficult to follow. Proceed with caution.",
    "Not the best QR available but JDRS is the man",
    "Easy, fun, class with a great professor. JDRS is hilarious and really nice. Take it for your QR or to learn stats if you are interested.",
    "Great intro class: not too hard, funny class. I was deciding between Psych Stats and this, and I'm really happy that I chose this instead.",
    "I took it as a requirement for the Psych major, but for a QR this is not bad at all. The mathematics and statistics departments at Yale are decidedly subpar relative to the other departments, but if you have to take this for a requirement then don't worry too much. There are weekly problem sets (don't even bother trying to set up Minitab on a Mac, just use Yale's computers), two midterms and a final. I suggest getting one of the optional textbooks because doing those extra problems before exams were extremely helpful. JDRS is OK, he tries to make classes interesting but sometimes all you want are the hard facts...not hidden in jokes you don't get.",
    "I would recommend Stat 103 to a fellow student whether or not they need the class for a major requirement. The class provides extremely useful knowledge and has a manageable workload.",
    "Take it! Stats is definitely an important thing to know and JRS makes the subject interesting and accessible. (I hadn't had a stats class before but never really struggled in this class.) Plus the work load was very manageable: 8 p-sets, two midterms, and a final.",
    "STAT 103 is a course where you really learn a lot of material that is definitely applicable to anything you do in life. I would definitely recommend this class, even if you are just taking it to fulfill a requirement.",
    "Basic intro class which is never too interesting but is very applicable in research and in understanding, at a rudimentary level in any case, how statistics works.",
    "Basic overview of statistics. Will teach you all you need to know. Professor is funny and engaging. Not a lot of work but you'll learn a lot. Because you have all of the lecture slides\/notes in front of you during every lecture it's easy to zone out, but even then it's not difficult to catch yourself back up. You can engage at any level you want- really understanding the math underneath, or just understanding what processes you'll need to be able to use for the sort of data you're working with. Professor R-S makes it easy to do either- he sort of teaches to both crowds during the lectures.",
    "A good intro to stat and a good QR.",
    "This is not for math people. If you like math at all and want to understand formulas and logic, find another class. This will be far too slow and mundane for you.However, JRS is funny and will teach well the very basics of statistics.You're cover in one semester maybe about 4 weeks worth of intro statistics at a grad school level, minus the proofs and math.",
    "It's not a lot of fun, but it's not bad if you want a QR that relates to the social or political sciences.",
    "Yes. 103 with JDRS is just a continuation of the first half of the semester. Other sections branch out and MIGHT be easier, but definitely less useful. You'll learn statistics that can be applied to psychology, which is why I took it.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this class. If you are at all interested in learning statistical analysis, whether it is because you want to be a statistician or because you want to understand what that scientific paper means when it refers to a p-value, this class is for you! It might be a little difficult at first, but once things begin to click it will go well.",
    "While I was dreading having to take stats for the psych major, I actually ended up enjoying this class (and I hated stats in high school!). While chances are you have to take this as a requirement, and the information isn't exactly fascinating, everything in the class is very fair. Whilethe psets before the class split into sections can take a while, if you check with a friend it's usually not so bad. The psets after we split into sections were actually shorter and easier, and it was nice continuing with Professor Reuning-Scherer after getting used to his teaching style. The exams were all fair, and he puts practice exams up too. He is one of the coolest professors I've had at Yale - really entertaining and engaging, and his jokes are corny but really funny! This was not bad for a required class, and I would definitely recommend taking it for a great experience with JRS!",
    "It was an unnessarily difficult course. The workload wasn't too bad, but everything was graded really harshly.",
    "Take it because you probably have to for your major; go to class and pay attention. Not everyone naturally gets statistics, but you'll get out of it what you put in.",
    "I wouldn't strongly recommend this course particularly if you don't have any background with stats or are good with math and logical thinking.",
    "Yes I would. Especially if you are looking for an applicable and useful QR credit.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone looking for a basic introduction to statistical concepts and procedures without a rigorous mathematical basis. For such an introduction, the class is good - JRS's lectures and notes are clear, and problem sets are straightforward (and generally representative of what's on the exams).",
    "it would probably be helpful to attend class",
    "This class is a good introduction to Stats and Professor Reuning-Scherer is a hoot! He is very funny and works hard to engage students in what can be a sometimes dry or confusing bit of material. The break off section did not seem to specifically deal with Social Science material over anything else so I think you should stick with JRS as he is a great teacher. One word of warning though - if you do not glean this type of material well from lecture you should perhaps try the ENAS or GLBL versions of this course. They are smaller and attack problems more directly in class which may be a better fit for your learning style.",
    "This is much more useful than Calculus; take it.",
    "Make sure you do not fall behind on the material. It would be very helpful to go over it before the lecture. Missing lectures can make the problem sets very difficult. The work load is pretty manageable and the professor is fun.",
    "Good course that delivers what it promises - a thorough introduction to statistics. I also thought it was exceptionally well paced. Stats is a great tool to have under your belt and this is a well structured environment to learn it in.",
    "I would definitely recommend taking this course if you are interested in statistics and data analysis. I started the year in Stats 238, but after the first midterm Professor Reuning-Scherer allowed me to transfer into his course even after the drop date had passed. As such, I was only part of the 103 section, but from what part of the class I took I would highly recommend it. Professor Reuning-Scherer was always enthusiastic about each of his classes and made even a large lecture very interactive. He follows the notes online very closely which makes it easier to follow in class and allows for a better understanding of the material outside of class. The class also requires that you use online statistics software. The software is easy to use and the problem sets allow you to utilize it, so when the professor uses it in class you have a good grasp on how to work through the problems on your own. If you are interested in the data analysis side of statistics rather than a probability focused class, I would definitely recommend taking this course.",
    "A good basic introduction to statistics. JDRS is a lot of fun, and makes the subject very accessible. It can be a lot of fun, and the problem sets are, for the most part, very manageable. You'll be well prepared for the midterms and final, and it's one of the most relevant classes you'll take at Yale. Excellent way to get a QR credit.",
    "Prof. JRS is super engaging. He teaches the main section of the class and all of STAT103\/PLSC 453. If you're taking this for a poli sci credit, you can either take this or 102 with Gerber. TAKE THIS CLASS. Other people had serious issues with 102 so stick with JRS the whole way through. He's a fantastic teacher, and he even makes the material relevant and interesting!",
    "It teaches you everything you need to know to move onto another level of statistics.",
    "If you want to mess around and lazily pick up a QR, don't take this class. It's not easy. It's not always fun. JRS's jokes can be painful. Regardless, I don't regret taking this class at all. It completely changed my view of the world. Unlike all my other finals, I actually enjoyed studying for this one. I think that says it all.",
    "A crash course in statistics. I have already found it very beneficial for my understanding of the \"statistics jargon\" in psychologicaly papers, so if you're interested in that I'd recommend it.",
    "Yes, but its a lot of work. Don't take it unless you need to",
    "I would. I didn't need a QR and took this because I am interested in doing research in the future.Overall, I feel like I learned a lot about basic statistics and basic statistics software. I expect to use what I learned in this class in the future. It's strength is its straightforward lessons, colorful power points, and very vocal and engaging professor.I think Professor Reuning-Scherer is fantastic. He made statistics exciting, was very laid-back, was extremely creative in his approach to teaching the material, and was available and incredibly helpful outside of lecture.",
    "Intro Stats is not a fun course, but it is a manageable option for a QR. However, the course does move fairly quickly, and it is easy to fall behind. For those who are not mathematically inclined, going to all lectures and taking advantage of office hours is probably necessary. Professor Reuning-Scherer is very approachable and helpful, especially when approached with specific questions.",
    "I would surely recommend this course, both for students who are looking for a course to fulfill one of their quantitative reasoning requirements and for students who have only taken calculus and have never taken statistics. The workload is manageable, the professor is fantastic, the exams are not too difficult at all, and the material one learns is extremely practical."
