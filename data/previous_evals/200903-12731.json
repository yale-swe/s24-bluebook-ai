   "comments": [
    "The course is presented during the comprehensive studio semester, which makes sense in terms of sequence. The course could be presented in first year, however, giving students the opportunity to apply concepts of the course to the building project and other assignments.",
    "This course is placed at the appropriate time, however Environmental Design and studio try too hard to integrate with one another, so it would be impossible to see it happening at any other time in the curriculum.",
    "placement was ideal",
    "Yes, the course is well-placed in tandem with the studio sequence",
    "Yes, this course should occur exactly where it does. The semester's emphasis on the environment and systems has taught me a lot, and right at the point where I feel like am beginning to understand my design sensibilities.",
    "Yes, this course occurred in proper sequence within the school's educational program.",
    "I absolutely think that this course occurred where it should in terms of the overall curriculum.",
    "Yes.",
    "Yes.",
    "Yes.",
    "The course was appropriate for second year.",
    "Yes.",
    "yes",
    "it occured in the right spot.",
    "I think pairing this course with the comprehensive studio course was an excellent decision.",
    "Yes this course occurred appropriately alongside the third semester 'comprehensive' studio.",
    "Yes.",
    "I think this course is well placed in the 2nd year simultaneously with the comprehensive studio.",
    "Yes",
    "The occurrence of the course is appropriate, it should be much more integrated into the studio work though and I don't mean weekend workshops that nobody really has time for or arbitrary dabbling in ecotect.",
    "The course was very useful to studio and was timed correctly in the curriculum.I do not think that the 3 classes a week was necessary. It made the course alot more dry that it needed to be, as information was frequently repeated.",
    "Yes, I feel this course is properly sequenced within the schools curriculum."

   "question_text": "Comment on the body of material presented and the content of the course: sequence, syllabus, and assignments.",
   "comments": [
    "We were able to cover a huge body of material in a very deliberate, logical way. I appreciated that the underlying theories as well as the practical applications were covered.",
    "The body of material covered in the course is ambitious in scope. The course is very much a survey of the plethora of information on both passive environmental strategies and integration of active building systems. While at times there was some overlap in the lecture components of the class, overall the the material presented each week was dense and thorough in its scope.",
    "The course builds on its self, so the sequence is appropriate and the assignments directly correspond to the material.",
    "Perhaps too much information was presented too quickly, it became very difficult to sort things out by the end of the semester.",
    "-Very broad (perhaps too broad)",
    "This course covers a lot of material. The body of the material is a bit overwhelming, but it is all extremely useful.",
    "Overall, the body of material presented in this course was what I expected and was presented in a logical sequence.",
    "The sequence of the course made sense and was fairly easy to follow in terms of units, from energy to climate to heat loss and construction, to lighting and acoustics. The one thing that I felt was not useful was Ecotect, which never quite made sense to me even though I spent many, many hours trying to figure it out.",
    "The work load was high and the class does not need to meet for 6 hours a week. Many of the lectures were just repeats and with 18 credit course load wee just don't have the time for 6 hours of required class time.",
    "This course was amazing in its scope and the level of expertise of its instructors. With professor Addington - you were listening to a first hand source of information.That said - I know it is a survey course, but the scope is immense. It should really be a two semester course.",
    "Assignments were generally helpful, the ecotect homework being the exception, however. The Autodesk tutorial was worthless, and the homework was thus impossible to accomplish. I frankly can't offer any specific suggestions as to how to improve this portion of the class, but suffice it to say it does need improvement.I think there don't need to be as many lectures. It would actually help the content if it were distilled. Fewer lectures, more time spent learning the computer programs?",
    "The course presented usefull and interested subject matter. However, the workload and amount of class time for the course (3 times a week for 2 hours) was inappropriate for the amount of credits we receive for the class. Compared to classmates taking seminars for the same amount of credit, they only meet once a week and have less work. Either reduce the amount of class time or increase the amount of credits received for this class. Also, some of the expectations for the problem sets dealing with ecotect were a bit unreasonable.",
    "It seemed like we went through the material very, very quickly, but then repeated it in the next class. It seems like it might be better to go through the material more thoroughly, and only cover it once, because I tended to stop paying attention when I heard the same thing a second time.",
    "The course's material seemed appropriate and well sequenced although there seemed to be a fair degree of redundancy. We went over some material many more times than seemed necessary.",
    "I did not have to take this class but thought it would be a good refresher and helpful in my studio project. Instead the class was too packed with scientific information which we would never use in a firm. Scientific properties were never applied to architecture. Knowing theories and formulas is useless unless you can use it to design a better building.",
    "There was too much material presented. The material presented could have comprised a masters degree in and of itself and, although we were not held to a very high standard, it seems a waste for us to go into any more depth on the subject than concept. I couldn't help feeling that I was wasting my time doing acoustical calculations for a train station with or without people in it.",
    "The class covered a very broad spectrum of topics - therefore it was sometimes difficult to grasp topics in depth. The in-class assignments and specific exercises could often be completed without a full understanding of the broader concepts covered in lectures.",
    "The content was presented in a logical matter with the assignments distrubuted appropriately.",
    "The class had too many \"busy-work\" assignments. As the class met three times a week for two-hour sessions each time ( a total of 6 hours of class time\/week), having two to three hour assignments outside of that time was redundant. It took valuable time away from more important courses; such as, studio or independent research.",
    "The material presented was engaging and useful. The homework assignments were helpful in solidifying knowledge.",
    "I thought the course had entirely too much content and required too much course time, consequently it felt that the lecture material was either overly cluttered or, in some instances, too redundant. It was a little frustrating to have to devote six hours of in class time with an additional three to four hours on assignments for a three credit hour class. The course would greatly benefit if it's content were parsed down and allowed for greater attention to larger concepts.I strongly feel that students could learn twice as much if the class covered half the material.",
    "The course was well arranged and assignments were frequently very relevant.What fell through were the workshops that functioned as extensions to studio. The rushed nature of those sessions and the lack of assistance to troubles when they occurred meant that the technical aspects for analysis were frequently underwhelming and stressful.",
    "For a three credit hour class, this was a very work-load heavy course. Not only did the course meet three times a week for 2 hours, but there was often a weekly homework assignment that required a substantial amount of out of class time to complete. Given this, it was often frustrating when a large majority of the course material was covered multiple times. This leads me to believe that the course could effectively be taught in two sessions, one lecture and one recitation, in which the homework is completed during the recitation. Given our overall course load, and intense studio demands, and credit-hour assignment, this course met far too many times and required too much time that detracted from time that should be dedicated to studio."

   "comments": [
    "My expectations were fairly high for this course and I think they were met. We covered all the technical material that I was looking forward too and learned some unexpected things on the side (EcoTect, etc.)",
    "I would say the amount of information conveyed in this class exceeded my expectations for the course. The scope of the class covered everything that I have learned about environmental design in the past, and then some. This speaks to the incredible expertise of the instructors in the subject area.",
    "I have taken systems before, and I feel that my knowledge of the material was largely supplemented by this course. I would suggest that no one be able to opt out of this course.",
    "I had mild to high expectations, and I believe that I learned a lot.",
    "My expectation for this course was to familiarize myself with the environmental issues related to architecture, and this expectation was met.",
    "My expectations for this course were met perfectly well; we were taught the basics of a lot of principles but did not go too in-depth for it to feel weighed down.",
    "I was a bit disappointed there wasn't better integration between studio and environmental design. Also the homework seemed more tasky than integral. The question i would ask of a class of this nature is how does this relate to what i am going to do when i get into practice.",
    "I expected a refresher to my undergrad course as well as more in depth lighting explanations. This course delivered that and so much more.",
    "My expectations to learn about environmental design were certainly well met.",
    "my expectations were met.",
    "Sadly, this is what I expected.",
    "My expectations for the course were met for the course. Michelle Addington isan incredible instructor and I do not believe that anyone could teach the material better than she does. We are very fortunate to have her here at our institution.",
    "The course met my expectations for a thorough introduction to environmental design concerns and a myriad of possible solutions.",
    "I had no real expectations of the course other than that I assumed it would strongly integrate itself into the studio course and that ultimately we would have a very thorough understanding of our studio projects relative to their environmental approaches. I don't feel the course ever truly acted as a supplement to the studio work.",
    "I wish the workshops were more helpful to studio design.",
    "My expectations were for the most part met. Prof. Addington and Darling have an incredible amount of expertise in the subject matter, but it often felt like that we were actually covering too much; to the point that it was actually no longer productive. A bit more focus for the subject matter I feel would allow much more of it to be \"digested\" as opposed to just having an overabundance of information."

   "comments": [
    "This course fits exactly with where I hope to be professionally. It is precisely this material that I will have to master if I hope to be successful and thus this course was extremely valuable to me.",
    "The course was valuable in that it forces us as architecture students to consider the integration of building systems that are a real factor in architectural design and practice out in the real world. By considering the technical and spatial aspects of these systems at this time in the curriculum is beneficial. In addition, considering aspects of passive design and environmentally conscious design is a major factor today and will continue to grow in importance.",
    "I found the course valuable. There is always more to learn about passive design.",
    "I believe that it is important to understand this subject material, and the course does a good job of providing a basic understanding.",
    "This course was certainly valuable, but the volume of content was somewhat ridiculous. While the course met for six hours per week, there is no doubt in my mind that the material could be covered more effectively in half the time. Furthermore, I think a reduction in the meeting hours would encourage students to pay closer attention and better absorb information.",
    "I felt that this course was extremely valuable; having taken a similar course in my undergraduate education, I felt that this one taught more in terms of the broad spectrum of ideas and principles of environmental design without getting bogged down with specifics, which I appreciated. I was also impressed with the fact that Michelle and Naomi were helpful in discussing our studio projects on the grounds of the architecture, and not just the practical imperatives of building performance.",
    "Pretty poor. This was more of an introduction, which i've already had, and didn't really focus on how to integrate this material into an integrated design approach.",
    "This course affects fundamental decisions that architects make - in every design related course in the school. It has taught a series of first principles that can help guide projects as well as basic knowledge for interacting with the many contractors and consultants that are in involved in architecture today.",
    "Certainly valuable, a necessary part of the curriculum.",
    "This course was interesting but really only scratched the surface of the larger issues at hand.",
    "valuable",
    "I personally am not very interested in the subject matter at this time. It seems to be material that can be learned when necessary, later in one's career. I do however, recognize the value and apppreciate being exposed to it now.",
    "This course was valuable as an overview of siting, lighting, acoustics, and systems.",
    "This class was valuable in instilling a sense of awareness for the remainder of my time at Yale. Additionally, it proved to be a beneficial course in outlining some future topics that continue to shape and reshape the practice.",
    "This course was quite valuable and I found the material to be engaging. Most of all, it was a pleasure to be in the presence of Michelle -- she is a spirited teacher and is incredibly full of knowledge.",
    "I think the course has incredible potential especially given the Michelle's expertise but it needs a lot of editing in terms of how the material is presented and what exactly is critical and what is cursory information.",
    "The real strength of the course was in its ability to help inform the various environmental workshops that were coincident with the progress of our studio projects. It was also helpful to interact with Patrick Belluew and Thomas Auer to help further understand the environmental systems of our specific building proposals and their intended effects. As much as I hate to say it, it was helpful to have the homework centered around hand-calculations of heat exchange, daylighting factors, etc. because it forces you to think about things in a totally different way, which I always found helpful."

   "question_text": "Comment on the effectiveness of the teaching by the courses's instructor",
   "comments": [
    "See above.",
    "The instructors are incredibly intelligent and knowledgeable on the subject matter, which can occasionally be to the detriment of the students. Given the vast amount of material presented in a very rapid manner, the student sometimes fails to grasp the concepts as thoroughly as the instructors might believe. Given the large amount of information delivered, it is difficult to come away with more than a basic understanding of the major concepts and themes. That said, it is obviously to the students' benefit to have a group of instructors that are so energetic and intelligent delivering the subject matter of the course to them each day.",
    "Michelle has great expertise of the material but she frequently overlaps the subject matter. She does however have a great ability to read the general attitude of the class of our interest in the material. Naomi also has great expertise of the subject matter, however she lacks the ability to adjust a lecture to our needs.",
    "I believe that Michelle and Naomi were great. I appreciated that the sections aligned with the subject learned during class that week. This level of integration is a bit of an anomaly here, and I think it helped keep the class focused and not overwhelmed.",
    "While Michelle and Naomi are incredibly knowledgeable, the method of teaching in this class could be greatly improved. Like I said in the previous question, six hours of meeting time per week is quite excessive. Furthermore, the lab meetings on Fridays are somewhat painful. I greatly enjoyed some meetings such as the lighting workshop, but reviewing homework problems for two hours can be very difficult to sit through.",
    "The teaching was very good, and Michelle was extremely sympathetic to our concerns as students, often telling us when the material was going to be dry and encouraging us to get a cup of coffee or inserting something to capture our attention every once in a while. Naomi was also very good at encouraging us to ask questions when we didn't understand the material, and explaining it when it felt opaque. I appreciated both of them very much as instructors.",
    "They were well organized, but the assignments did not realistically integrate studio and didn't seems applicable to what we might do in practice.",
    "Professor Addington was extremely engaging and available.",
    "Professor Addington dealt well with this usually dry subject matter, making it interesting at times.",
    "Michelle's lectures were interesting and easy to follow. It was helpful having the section time in class to learn how to do problems, but again it was way too much class time for this class.",
    "Lectures were overly repetitive, often with the same information presented on two or three occasions. The instructor did an admirable job of trying to make often dry information accessible and exciting. By paring back the presentation of theory, and perhaps devoting more time to case studies, the class might be made more engaging.",
    "Michelle Addington very clearly holds a great wealth of information and her course is extremely helpful. I appreciated very much that she does not teach \u0093methods\u0094 of environmental design, but rather helps the students to understand the various scientific phenomena of climate, lighting, sound, etc., so that they are able to develop a much fuller understanding of the problems at hand.",
    "Both were effective but in general 6 hours of class a week was redundant. We went over the same material again and again. It seemed the course could have been taught in 3 one hour sessions a week which would have kept everyone's attention. Alternatively more optional sessions as opposed to mandatory classes would have prevented repeat material.",
    "Michelle is a very engaging lecturer. It was helpful that she spent the first part of each class reviewing the material previously covered. The two class trips were very valuable. I think the in-class assignments and sections were a bit frustrating due to the large class size.",
    "Good!",
    "Michelle made this course worthwhile for me. Although I often found if difficult to sit through so many hours of lecture, it was also difficult to disengage completely, mostly becase Michelle is so full of life and committed to teaching. She one of the best role models at the school.",
    "Well done for the most part, but it would have been nice had the assignments been worked out and posted somewhere as a resource, something that students could refer to and continually access as a review.",
    "Michelle was able to convey her expertise on the topics. She was a fantastic instructor. However, the course swung between extremes depending on topics. Although Michelle was great at teaching, frequently the information was too dry. There were certain presentations that could be worked on. The overload of information over the 3 class\/ weeks made it hard to grasp the essentials either. Sometimes the amount of Environmental Design per week was just way too much for interest to linger.Naomi needs to present better. She was frequently monotonous in presentations and it was hard to retain interest. When one was able to concentrate, she gave good concise advice and information.",
    "Prof. Addington was effective in conveying the subject matter, however, as stated above, I think the course should be a bit more limited in scope so that more can be retained by the students. Often it felt like their was too much \"on the table\" to the point that it was overwhelming. Prof. Darling was always patient and clear when explaining the homework and going over specific examples. Overall, the two were great."

   "comments": [
    "None.",
    "Thinning out the material a bit to expose and emphasize the major concepts of the course, and the major takeaways in terms of design strategies would be to the benefit of future students. The homework problems were helpful in refining the relevant aspects of the lectures in terms of design consequences, and the field trips were great in terms of showing the students' the real life application of the principles taught in the course.",
    "It would be more productive to not review the material from the previous class each time. I think there could have been half as many classes and the material could have been covered just as well. It seems to me that as a class we are in Environmental Design too much which makes us loose interest.",
    "-I did feel asif there were a lot of repeat images and slides plus too lengthy of a \"review\" at the beginning of each class.",
    "A midterm. I never thought I would suggest such a thing, and it certainly would be tough to implement given the breadth of work required by the studio during this time period. But, I think it would be good to split the amount of material into two halves.",
    "Compress the lessons into shorter meetings with less repetition and think of ways to liven up the friday labs (the lighting lab was fun! The 2 hour homework reviews were not)",
    "My main criticism of the course is the amount of time it demands in terms of actual class time. Six hours per week is quite a lot, in addition to time spent doing homework. I understand that there is a lot of material to cover, and so I am not quite sure how to deal with this, but the course felt oppressive; it often felt like we were in that room every day of the week. The only other remediable complaint I have is that I think that either Ecotect needs to be jettisoned from the course, or much more time needs to go into it, because it is simply a confusing program.",
    "Less lecture hours and more hands on integration with studio or with practical simulation.",
    "Two semesters!",
    "Less class time! Three times a week at two hours each class! How are other 3 credit courses only a two hour lecture each week and this one requires three times that?! It was difficult (due to the dry subject matter) to sit through that much class a week! Distill it.",
    "condense lectures and meet 2 times a week",
    "Six hours per week is too much time to dedicate to this course. Given the demands of studio, it is simply not reasonable to expect students to remain engaged in three class sessions per week.",
    "Work through the material much more slowly the first time, instead of repeating it two or three times.",
    "see answer 7.",
    "The course, which was taken for 6 hours a week with homework that took about 1 to 2 hours per week totals more hours than the sum total of required history and theory classes in the curriculum. To me, this is outrageous, I am not at a technical school and would appreciate not being treated as if I am.",
    "Some lectures were redundant and appeared to drag on due to the long in-class time requirement.",
    "I think the course should only meet two times a week for two hour sessions or if it continues to meet three times a week it should be for 1 hour sessions.",
    "If possible, the course should be taught for fewer hours a week. A one hour lecture twice a week, plus section, would make the material much more digestable. Class would feel like less of a burden, and it might be easier to muster enthusiasm for incorporating lessons from the course into our design work.",
    "I think the course has incredible potential especially given the Michelle's expertise but it needs a lot of editing in terms of how the material is presented and what exactly is critical and what is cursory information.",
    "Shorten the time for the course- too much information presented",
    "Reduce the scope to be more focused so that more of the subject matter can be retained. Reduce the number of required class meetings to 2, one lecture and one recitation. I feel that 3 two-hour class meeting is just too much to ask for, especially given that the homework assignments often took atleast 2 hours of out of class time to complete. When the course demands 8 or so hours of time each week, but is only a 3 credit-hour class, something needs to be re-calibrated."
