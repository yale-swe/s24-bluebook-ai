    "The course was well organized. The assignments were challenging and perhaps could have been sequenced in a more didactic way. T Here seemed to be a bit of a disjuncture between the difficulty of the first three assignments and the final two.",
    "I thought the course was great - it was a nice balance of history, technical information about classical drawing, and student exploration. The assignments were sequenced nicely, built upon one another and growing in complexity, and produced some nice drawings in the end."

   "comments": [
    "I took the course as an opportunity to continue drawing since the curriculum offers few choices in that area. It was as expected although I would have thought the assignments to be a bit more refined and thus allowing for an opportunity to choose more technical\/labor intensive methods of production (technical drawing rather than computer) for the final projects."

    "I would recommend only one extended 'analytique' for the course and more time spent on the technical aspects of the course (ruling pens, drafting, watercolor, etc) in place of the extended lectures or even the computer techniques which I think most student are more apt at than more traditional drawing techniques."
