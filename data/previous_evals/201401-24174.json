    "A dump truck full of readings fall on your head, burying you. Your task: try not to drown, and learn something along the way.I would recommend the course, especially if given by Nathan, and even more so if some of the changes suggested above were implemented.",
    "The course is what one might expect, reading a lot of primary sources and not an insignificant amount of secondary ones.",
    "I would recommend the course highly but with the qualification that the work load is intense and became at times unmanageable."

   "comments": [
    "This course furthered my appreciation for the history of my discipline, forcing me to confront the fact that many of the concepts I take for granted are rooted in centuries of heated debate. It also encouraged me to question fundamental assumptions at the heart of present-day theoretical discourse.",
    "This course was a good introduction to the history of our discipline and our predecessors as music theorists. Our time with each historical figure was necessarily short, and I would have liked to have gained a more comprehensive knowledge of many of the theoretical traditions we studied, but since the coverage had to take place over the course of a single semester, it is clear that we did quite alot as is.",
    "This course did a good job introducing me to many theories with which I was previously unfamiliar. Precisely because of this unfamiliarity, however, I would have appreciated a broader approach to the historical importance of each theorist."
