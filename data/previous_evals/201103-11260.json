    "I think it would be valuable to add at least one class that deals with climate change skepticism and denial. It would be useful to read arguments presented by climate change deniers and skeptics. Understanding climate change is imperative. In addition, we need to understand what mechanisms prevent people from believing that climate change is real.",
    "Very good instructor and useful overview of the basics of climate change mitigation and adaptation, with lots of information on international negotiation processes.",
    "1. I really liked how interdisciplinary the readings were, the provided a good overview of the different angles and issues within the broad topic of climate change. They also went into more depth then we were able to go in class, so felt I got a lot out of the readings.2\/7. The instructor's lecturing style was hard for me to follow. He moved very quickly through the slides and the lectures were very choppy. The best part of the lectures were when he was answering a student's question because then he was talking in a straight forward more conversational way rather then reading off the slides. The most useful thing about his slides were his use of graphs. The graphs in the slides were often ones used in the readings but that I didn't understand and so it was very helpful to have them explained.3. I would have liked it if instead of student led discussions of the second half of class could have included more in depth discussions\/ explanations of some of the material. I would have liked to hear about the instructor's experience and heard more from him rather than overviews from the students. I think more in depth discussions would have been beneficial."

   "comments": [
    "the weekly write ups on reading material, really helped with my writing and understanding of the material.",
    "The best parts of this course were class participation (specifically student-led group discussions) and the readings.",
    "We covered a ton of topics which was incredibly helpful for getting an overview of everything climate. Rob also did a great job of answering any questions in class (he had responses for pretty much every question, but if he didn't know an answer he would go look it up and get back to the class).",
    "Since everyone had done the reading, it made for interesting class conversation.",
    "The best things about this class were Rob's lectures, the policy memo, and the final paper. Rob gave great overviews of each week's topic and the two papers were a great exercise in synthesizing information of your choice about climate change and making recommendations.",
    "The openness of the class dynamic. Every student was very welcome to participate and express their opinion.",
    "The weekly reading responses force you to read and reflect on all of the class readings.",
    "Great overview of a wide variety of subjects.",
    "The breadth of material that was covered and the readings were very helpful. Also the weakly writing assignments really kept me on task with the reading and I feel that I got a lot more out of the readings because of that assignment (I think they should be due later though for example 12:00am the night before class).",
    "Professor Bailis has very extensive knowledge of climate science and policy. The readings were, in general, very interesting and informative, and the lectures were clear and engaging. An excellent overview of climate change."

   "comments": [
    "Slow down a little and maybe cover a little less material.",
    "The lectures seem a little rushed sometimes, but maybe this is just the nature of an introductory course on such an enormous issue.",
    "Get rid of the student led discussions at the end of class. They were extremely boring and not interesting at all. The length of the class was also problematic, three hours is a long time to make students sit through a powerpoint presentation. It would have been cool if other teaching tools could have been used instead of massive powerpoint presentations. I also would have appreciated if Rob coordinated more with the students before their student-led discussions. He would post the powerpoint presentation the day of lecture, so students couldn't see what he was going to cover in his lecture or know what they needed to include or not include in their discussion as a result.",
    "Writing a commentary every week can become tedious, but at least it forces you to do the reading. Some of the student led discussions were a bit drab. I would grade the discussions and let students know their grades as the semester continues. Additionally, I would let students know what grade they are receiving on their commentaries.",
    "It could have been interesting to have class presentations of students\u00b4final papers.",
    "Many of the student-led discussions fell flat. At the beginning of the semester, Rob and the TAs stressed the value of leading engaging discussions, but students should be prodded throughout the remainder of the semester to keep the discussions engaging and relevant. One of the best things about this class is that everyone has read the material and formulated an opinion. It was disappointing when \"discussions\" were powerpoint presentations of what we'd all read before class.",
    "None, the course was great.",
    "The lecturing style of the professor. I would also suggest that maybe every other week the professor would lead the discussion and every other week would be led by the students. If discussions were led by the professor than the discussions could go deeper and I think I would have gotten more out of the material.",
    "Some of the readings were very long and technical. Also, the second half of each lecture was dedicated to student presentations. These were not nearly as informative as Bailis's lectures. While presenting is a worthwhile experience, watching the presentations was not always a great use of time."

I imagine that getting a slot in his office hours can be more challenging than for most professors. However, he was quick to respond to questions I e-mailed to him, and he always informed the class about when he would be"
