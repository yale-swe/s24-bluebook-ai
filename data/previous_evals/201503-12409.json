   "comments": [
    "There's a reason this class has some of the highest workload assessments. There's also a reason it has some of the highest ratings. It's an amazing class that forces you to think critically, critique your decisions, manage working in a team (This is HUGE), give your heart and soul, learn to work together, and push to execute well on your ideas. The guest lectures are an amazing array of passionate people, and the teaching staff, professors, and CEID staff all also are passionate about medical devices and helping you realize engineering reality. Would HIGHLY recommend. JZ and JZ make a great team.",
    "This is an incredible class! Your experience is mostly shaped by the project you are put on, but this class gives the opportunity to learn so much practical and innovative ideas.",
    "This is the best class. Take it, take it, take it. It is a lot of work, but I had no regrets. It's incredibly valuable to work with a client and see your work turn into something real. It's one of the truly rewarding classes in the engineering department. I couldn't have asked for better instructors - Jean and Joe are fantastic teachers and people. They care about the projects and the students, and are always ready to help. The projects are all really interesting, and 404 is the single most well-organized course I have ever had the pleasure of taking at Yale. I learned so much and would take it every semester if I could.",
    "Honestly, one of the best courses I've taken at Yale. It teaches you so many things: from the design process to exploration of seemingly infinite concepts to realization of ideas. Even if you have limited background in mechanical engineering, there is ample room to learn and grow throughout the semester. If you have the time, I highly encourage applying to the class!",
    "This was perhaps the best class I have taken at Yale. If you can get in and can spare the time, please take this class. Working with a physician mentor, we worked in teams to engineer a solution to an unmet clinical need within 15 weeks. I was amazed at the progress that we were able to make, and our team is planning to take things forward after the end of the semester. We had so many amazing experiences (and sleepless nights) in this class, from visiting an OR, to testing our device ex vivo, to hearing from medical device companies, the FDA, surgeons, and many others on the intricacies of medical device design. This was the capstone design class that I feel did not exist otherwise for BME. Be prepared to spend around 15-20 hours a week outside of class on this; it may take over your life. Even so, the time you put in is extremely rewarding, and I took several skills away from this class that will serve me well in the future.",
    "Take this class if you get in.",
    "BENG404 is an interesting class with a very unconventional structure. One class each week is a lecture, giving background from those in industry or policy on different aspects of medical device design, and the second lecture each week is a team breakout session to work on the project. Youll have a physician mentor, with whom youll iterate and exchange ideas, which is a cool part of the course. The professors are very invested and will also schedule a weekly half-hour meeting with your team outside of class. However, while the class was a refreshing break from usual class structure, to some extent, the overall experience was luck of the draw, not just in terms of the project you were assigned to but also the team you were placed with. You might be called upon to do a LOT of hands-on work and pick up a lot of great, applicable new skills, or you might end up with a more conceptual project that is a little more busywork than actual design. Although I felt myself more in the latter group, this class has a lot of potential and the professors are really great and always happy to put students in touch with their contacts.",
    "Great course. Must take it if you have any interest in medicine or engineering.",
    "Medical Device Design is a course unlike any other that I have taken at Yale. It is not for the feint of heart. If you are not interested in spending 20 or more hours a week near the end of the semester on this class alone, do not take the class. You will expected to spend a substantial amount of time working on the project outside of class (as almost no class time is given to the project), and deliver a high quality work of engineering by the end of the semester. Every student interested in engineering should try to take a class like this. The class is well taught and allows you to both work on awesome projects as well as learn more about medical innovation and entrepreneurship. One note is that senior BME majors have probably seen a lot of the lecture content before through other classes, so the lectures are more interesting for people in other majors. Beware that you will get more out of this class the more you know going in. You will have an opportunity to learn new engineering skills, but will soon find that your ability to contribute to the project often depends on your existing knowledge and ability to rapidly learn new skills. If you do not have a large set of general engineering or micro-controller or software skills, you might need to spend a substantial amount of extra time just learning some basics.",
    "404 is a great class and You'll learn a lot of useful things and get hands on experience, but it is a lot of work, so if You're not ready\/don't have time in Your semester to spend hundreds of hours on this class, it might not be the class for You. I loved my team, which definitely improved the experience. Basically, this is a really fun, great class, but it is a tremendous amount of work.",
    "Medical Devices is a wonderful course. Its difficult, of course, as you and your team go through the ups and downs of the design process, but I couldn't name a better set of mentors that the team this class has set up.",
    "Yes I would highly recommend 404 to someone else. I would caveat that it is truly a time intensive course and you have to put in the time in order to get the most out of it, as well as in order to work as a functional team with undergrads who are so inspirational in their enthusiasm. The time put in though is truly worth what you learn from the experience."
