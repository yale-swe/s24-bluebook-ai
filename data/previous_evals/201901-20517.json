    "In many ways, this studio taught students to create a much more holistic architecture. Design decisions had to account not only for formal consistencies or agendas, but for history, philosophy, landscape, ecology, people, and more.",
    "This was one of the most challenging studios I've taken but it teaches you all the skills you will need in real life. The learning curve was high from the beginning. The expectations are high but that makes you better at what you do.",
    "A more digital and theoretical approach to architecture compared to prior studios. Projects were broad and abstract, with a lot of latitude. Skills in this course are more well suited for professional work though, due to the increased CAD workload.",
    "You learn how to make professional quality renderings and work. I did my best, most polished work in this class. I feel prepared to work in architecture this year and to go to graduate school.",
    "This class taught me to better present my projects through renderings and planned presentations."

    "Having pinups every week was a (taxing) strength. Our projects developed much more rigorously as a result.",
    "I would be great to start the final project with a conceptual exercise or know about the program a little in advance.",
    "Due to the mixed availability between the various members of the teaching staff and professors, it was sometimes difficult to receive a continuous string of feedback on the projects. Mixed messages occasionally happen as a result. As a whole, the course was fairly well weighted between theoretical and practical ends though.",
    "The course helped our technical skills, however, it was occasionally impersonal (professors didnt know our names)."
