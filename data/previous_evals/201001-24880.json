    "Take it! Professor Frank is cool and the course is very interesting.",
    "Overall a good course. I definitely got better at proposing and defending models to explain sets of data. On the whole, I feel like syntax actually makes less sense after this course than it did before, but this is probably a good thing--it shows that we were forced to think about what problems some of the standard theories have and what the original motivation was for believing them.The workload was rather light. We only had about 6 problem sets throughout the entire semester, and the take-home midterm listed on the syllabus never materialized.",
    "This course is definitely aimed at graduate students; if you don't have an excellent grasp of the stuff from Syntax I, you're going to get lost pretty quickly. The initial problem sets were really difficult, though they got easier later on. But you do get a good introduction to more advanced syntactic ideas, and Professor Frank is good about giving extra help if you ask for it."
