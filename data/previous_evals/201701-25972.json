    "different approaches to media studies, philosophy of technology, researching broadly, finding oblique angles into texts, philosophies and ideas",
    "This was a very challenging and worthwhile course -- one of the best that I've taken during my time here. I've learned to think in a wider scope. I'm used to doing a lot of close reading where I zone in on a single text, but this course challenged me to tackle big ideas spanning multiple genres, time periods, and cultures."

    "John is an extremely gracious and encouraging teacher, while also setting a very, very high bar for his students in a way that is motivating. He has high standards for research, reading, and writing, but also gave us space to experiment with our own unformed thoughts. He encourages everyone to participate. He asks thought provoking questions and provides his own personal insights. We read a broad variety of texts, most of which were excellent examples of scholarship and writing, which was great to learn from.",
    "Oh boy, where to start!? This was hands down my favorite class so far at Yale. The field of Media Studies felt nebulous and confusing and daunting at the beginning of the semester--it is still all those things, but in a wonderful way! The syllabus was full of wacky, enormously interesting material, all of which I am glad to have read. Professor Peters is incredibly kind, responsive, encouraging, and caring. He never makes you feel like any question is too small or silly. He is a wonderful role model--as a person, a professor, and a scholar. I also really appreciated the number\/frequency\/variety of assignments. The timeline and shorter paper were both very fun to do, and the longer assignments kept me on task, kept me thinking all semester, and kept me from falling behind (which I was very grateful for when I started writing papers this semester). p.s. We were all incredibly grateful for the extremely generous offer to teach two sections of the class--we all got so much more out of the class and the readings with the smaller group sessions.",
    "While we dealt with a lot of texts and themes, it was clear why we were reading them, and how they all tied together. What I really liked about this course was that it was organized around ideas rather than time periods or authors, and there was enough structure to make connections between the big ideas each week, but also freedom enough to appreciate each week's readings for their own, and to explore each cluster of texts for new ideas. The biggest strength of this course was how much it encouraged and fostered individual interest -- I didn't feel like I was tied down to the texts\/professor's interests, but I also didn't feel like I was left all to myself. There was a great balance between structure and freedom."

   "comments": [
    "Yes. The opportunity to get to know and work with John was the best part of my semester. He has a way of converting his class to see the beauty, rigor, and value of media studies. He will push you as a scholar and person to take ethical questions from our texts seriously.",
    "YES",
    "Yes, definitely! This course is a very great introduction to media studies, and we cover a lot of fascinating and useful\/relevant topics. Professor Peters is also an encouraging teacher, and provides a lot of useful feedback on exploring new ideas and writing."
