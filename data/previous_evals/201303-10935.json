    "One of the few classes at Yale where you actually get to produce something, which is cool",
    "Learn how to make, market, and sell a new product. While you may not create a product you will actually sell, the methods you learn will really help you in the future.",
    "Take this class.",
    "I would absolutely recommend it. However, it is COMPLETELY up to you how much you get out of this course. Some projects really look like they were put together the day before final crit - and they'll probably do well. However, if you really want the experience of making something cool and applying yourself, and not having the semester go to waste, it's all on you. It's totally rewarding.",
    "Yes, but everything depends on how much you put into the class. Get a great group because you will be working with them for the rest of the semester. It's not a lot of work and the project can be fun.",
    "Great fifth class and a class for seniors. The final project can be a lot of work.",
    "Great course on learning how to develop and market a new product. Very practical!!",
    "This is a really fun and great class. By far in a way the most practical class at Yale. Make sure though that you think of a product that is realistic to actually create.",
    "Great class!",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. You learn about the process of product development by spending the whole semester creating your own product. Homework is straight forward and easy, and Bolanos is hysterical. Other than creating your own product (using a 3D printer, usually), you only have to give two 10-15 minute presentations. The only major downside to this class is having a group that doesn't do the work. Make sure to choose groups wisely, or you'll end up doing everything the week before it's due! Also beware that this class is not updated and you don't get to learn about cool products on the marketplace now, or about entrepreneurship and start-ups, or even about design. Bolanos is an engineer and this class focuses strictly on the engineering side of product development. That being said, it's a GREAT and easy class.Hard to get into so email him early!",
    "Creativity& New Product Development is seen as an easy class with minimal commitment. And, truth be told, it is. If however, you treat approach the semester that way, you will leave this class with nothing - no lessons learnt, no useful product made, and no new friendships. If you approach this class like an actual engineering class and set out to make something cool, then the class is fun, low-key, and you get something out of it. Although the lectures are and will remain a waste of time.",
    "Definitely take this class. Nothing else at Yale quite like it"
