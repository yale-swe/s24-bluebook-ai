   "comments": [
    "I will recommend this class because it has helped me grow a lot in terms of my writing.",
    "YES! Take this class before you graduate. Dr. Stuart can be irritating sometimes, but she is totally worth it. I've gained so much from this semester with her, even though I didn't necessarily appreciate her all the time. She is most valuable in office hours, so use them! She genuinely cares about her students and is willing to invest time and effort if they are. Definitely worth taking.",
    "This is a great class, but be prepared to do a lot of writing. An essay a week, even if the first draft is ungraded, is pretty tough to do. Still, it's lots of fun, and I really feel that my writing improved. Barbara Stuart is pretty good, but beware: her feedback is often minimal and not helpful (one time she literally wrote on my draft: \"Good start, keep going!\" and nothing else). I would try seeking someone else out if you're not confident in your writing yet. Overall, I recommend this course.",
    "English 120 is definitely a lot of work, but it's very rewarding in the end. I would absolutely recommend this class. Prof. Stuart is excellent, and she really helps you improve as a writer. The readings are interesting, and the work is doable as long as you keep on top of it.",
    "Yes I would recommend it to another student. I would say that while English 120 is a lot of work that it is a class definitely worth taking because you actually do improve as a writer.",
    "Definitely take this class. Dr. Stuart is probably the best Engl 120 teacher so definitely try to get into her section. Great readings and cool class discussions. It's cool to see your writing improve over just a few months.",
    "A fantastic introduction to the some of the modern short-form nonfiction \/ long-form journalism out there. Essays are read and critiqued in an intimate and friendly setting. Prof Stuart created an incredibly open, friendly, and student-centric atmosphere, and workshops were invaluable; that said, I was a bit disappointed in the (low) level of detail of her weekly essay edits and in the somewhat haphazard nature with which we approached the essays we had read for homework.Overall a great WR for those not particularly lit crit\/creative writing- inclined.For upperclassmen (excuse my unavoidably supercilious tone): Because the class is freshman-heavy, discussion CAN be a bit sophomoric and AP English-y, but it's also nice to have a set of fresh (and less jaded) perspectives; it's also great to be able to approach the material with more experience and understanding. Overall I'm really glad I waited until my junior year to take this class."
