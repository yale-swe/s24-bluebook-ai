   "comments": [
    "I felt that I did not learn anything new by the end of the course. Though the professor was very nice and seemed to enjoy the subject, the course was very poorly organized and seemed to have no direction.",
    "Picking either SAS or R to focus on would have been more helpful than splitting the time between the two.",
    "The course gives a very good broad overview of applied regression analysis. I do feel the duration of the lectures can be reduced (It's 110 mins long on Tuesday). It'd be helpful for the instructor to actually show the SAS or R operations on the computer.",
    "The materials covered is a little bit easy. Some insights of professor are good, though.",
    "This was my favorite course all semester. The professor did not waste our time by trying to derive a bunch of complicated theory that, realistically, would not help us. The bulk of the course was in applying what the professor explained in our weekly reports, so after this class I feel more comfortable using R, even though I had never used it before. To improve the course, I would suggest more organization in the form of powerpoint slides, handouts, etc. If you missed a class, there was no way to catch up on the material. That being said, Dr. Zelterman's notes from the board were very organized and easy to follow-- it would just have been nice to have those notes uploaded to classesv2 as well.",
    "I enjoyed the weekly homeworks that Dr. Zelterman assigned. I thought it was a very practical and useful way to apply the concepts we were learning. However, we never got really good feedback on the homeworks, so I was never too sure about how well I was achieving the tasks. Including a lab as part of the class or actually looking at SAS\/R output in class and interpreting it together would have been helpful.",
    "The class was only okay. I learned some interesting things but I think that the structure and format of the class could have used some work. This might have been because it was taught by Dr. Zelterman at the last minute. I also did not like the time slots. Class on Tuesday was 2 hours long. If it were to be broken up into a lab section, that would've been much more helpful.",
    "Strengths - lectures are very detailed, emphasis on learning the concept of statistics not just computing numbers on SAS or R. Weakness - lack of structure in terms of syllabus, grade breakdowns, very little feedback on homeworks.",
    "intuitively for beginner but not concise enough",
    "Very useful.",
    "",
    "The weekly assignments were very helpful.",
    "A smaller size for this course means that it would have been easier to ask questions, but the class lacked any structure (and therefore a sense of rigor).",
    "There was a disconnection between what was written in the syllabus and what was taught in class. There was no midterm or exams-- same as written in the syllabus. However, We had more homeworks given than the number that was specified in the syllabus. We also covered more material than originally noted in the syllabus. I appreciated Dr. Zelterman's ability to tailor the course to the students' needs and he was willing to dive into topics that were not necessarily in the scope of the class.",
    "This course provides an overview of regression methods and some in-depth instruction on diagnostic tools to evaluate these methods. I liked having several options on data sets to use for homework assignments. While I learned some new material, I felt like a lot of the course was a review of Biostatistics II so I recommend covering additional material and doing less review of concepts students should already be familiar with. Another weakness is lack of a comprehensive syllabus, and not following the syllabus that was provided in regards to the number of assignments. I also recommend using more or all data sets that are public health relevant. It would be great to receive more written feedback or comments on homework assignments.",
    "Homework assignments provided \"real life\" experience with analyzing data sets, not just following step by step instructions. I now feel more prepared for my dissertation work. Course would have been improved if a detailed syllabus with plan for topics to be covered was provided.",
    "Intuitive rather than just proving and memorizing.",
    "This course is a combination of theory and application. The workload is appropriate for each week. And professor emphasizes the importance of interpreting statistical analysis result. I think i can handle and eager to learn more content.",
    "An overall assessment of the course cannot be properly produced due to the poor construction of the course by the professor.",
    "I think this course provided a good overview of conducting regression analyses in SAS and R and various diagnostic techniques. However, I feel that a lot of material in this course was review from Biostatistics.",
    "This course provided useful applied methods of all kinds of regression. I had a great time and learned practical knowledge.",
    "Overall the class was OK. I realize that the professor took over the class last minute and didn't have adequate time to prepare. I learned a few things that will be helpful for my future work. However, the class lacked structure and did not cover all the topics that were outlined in the course registrar description. Also, there were no slides for class, which would be useful for reviewing the material at a later date. It seemed as though only the basics of linear regression were covered. It would have been useful to be given complex problems using real public health data to really test our stats skills. Covering mediation and moderation would have also been useful.",
    "If you are an AP\/MPH student in the ABE track, then take it. It would do you good to combine it with categorical data, another course I adored. Trust me, the workload combining both is very very doable and would actually help you understand cat data analysis.I say this not as one who failed the first test in the summer Bio class and barely made it with a pass, thanks to Maria, another outstanding and patient prof. The workload is bearable. Weekly homework assignments. No midterm, exam or projects. The grading is very very fair, not punitive. If you put in the effort, you cannot get less than a H, yes honors. Google his name for more.",
    "The course could have been more structured and challenging. I also think we could have covered more material than we did. Dr. Zelterman was a great teacher though!"

    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0Professor Zelterman was nice and bubbly, which made the class only somewhat tolerable. However, he went off on many tangents and sometimes didn't even seem to know what he was talking about.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0I love professor Zelterman. He's knowledgeable, caring, engaging and very funny. Some of the materials could've been compressed or speeded up so the Tuesday classes could be shorter. Also lecture notes and R scripts, including in-class demonstration of R or SAS operations would be very helpful. But other than that professor Zelterman is a great teacher and he makes going to class a joy.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0Very kind grandpa-like instructor! Great manner! Explain things explicitly!",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0I really enjoyed the class. Dr. Zelterman was enthusiastic and always made the material enjoyable.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0Dr. Zelterman was an incredible professor. Unlike most of my other professors this semester, it was clear that he really enjoyed teaching. He was great at explaining things in a clear, simple way that made applied regression intuitive, and he was good at gauging what would be too easy\/too difficult to explain. He also threw in a few personal stories that make his lectures more engaging. The only improvement I would suggest is to have notes uploaded to the classesv2 site for each lecture.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0Very good at explaining certain things, but sometimes when we got to things he was knowledgeable on, he didn't supply great explanations. He wanted us to gain the practical skills of working with data and writing up analysis, but more feedback or doing it with us in class and going through the steps would've been helpful.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0While very helpful and kind, Dr. Zelterman's primary mode of instruction was chalk and a blackboard. He coupled it with anecdotes that I didn't always find helpful. I got lost very often during class and wondered why he was deriving various equations on the board. I had difficulty a lot of the time following what was going on in class and think that Dr. Zelterman could have structured the class better.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0Strengths - I appreciated the professor's passion and dedication to statistics. His lectures are also very easy to understand. Weakness - None.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0great professor",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0Very nice professor, talks slowly and makes sure everyone understands what he is saying. The course is a little slow though.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0Good lectures and assignments. It would have been useful to have a more structured syllabus, but you can't expect that when the instructor is assigned a course at the last minute!",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0Professor Daniel's lecture is very useful and interesting, and he is also very helpful. He is always willing to answer my question.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0Dr. Zelterman's teaching lacked any structure--what should have been a very useful class felt more like wasted time because his lectures were impossible to follow. Homework assignments received no useful feedback, and the combination of these factors left me feeling like I learned no more than I had in 505b. If Dr. Zelterman is to teach 505b next semester he should be sure to create clear powerpoint slides to guide his otherwise meandering lectures.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0Very enthusiastic about the subject and happy to help.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0Dr. Zelterman has an amazing ability to tell extended stories related to statistics. His passion for the subject is evident in his teaching and he sincerely cares about his students.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0Dr. Zelterman was open to questions and discussions with students, and was engaging with the class. I also enjoyed his teaching style. I think that he could have had higher expectations of the students, he reviewed the same material several times in class and could have used that time to cover additional topics. I also recommend making the course more structured by creating a general schedule and including it on the syllabus. It is really useful for students to know what topics will be covered prior to registering for the class.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0Great at explaining information, took his time during class and carefully answered student questions.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0Does a good job of outlining assignments. Does a good job of explaining how to perform the assignments and the theory behind them.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0Excellent professor. Fair amount of homework. Very knowledgable",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0Dr.Zelterman is passionate. I was deeply motivated by his enthusiasm and passion in the class.",

    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0Amazing instructor with a patient and engaging approach to explaining course material",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0By far, the worst course I've taken in my two years plus at YSPH. 1. The professor continued to state racist comments despite being reported to the Diversity Committee. His lack of sensitivity and understanding of diversity issues created an environment in which students from diverse backgrounds felt silenced and unable to engage in academic conversations without feeling their diverse backgrounds were up for debate as well. This professor needs additional training in cultural competency before being allowed to teach diverse students. 2. The professor rarely taught Linear Regression which is counterintuitive to the course. The professor only spent 3 weeks on linear regression concepts and moved on to other non-revelant topics taught in full length in other course such as logistic regression (i.e., Categorical Data Analysis). When asked to teach other topics related to linear regression such as ANOVAs or examining moderators, these requests were denied. This is very disappointing and does not adequately prepare students for linear regression analyses. 3. The professor produced an inadequate syllabus that ended up hurting the students more than himself. For example, the syllabus stated that only 6-8 assignments would be required however 11 assignments were required. The syllabus stated no midterm or final, however, a final was administered verbally. In addition, there was no grading scale denoted in the syllabus. Instead of averaging the grades of the homework assignments for individual students, the professor decided to give 2\/3 of the class an Honors and 1\/3 the class a High Pass, which is completely unfair. This type of grading system does not take into account the fact that some students mastered other topics well enough to receive an average that was worthy of an Honors.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0The instructor as very knowledgeable about the course topics, however, I would have appreciated more feedback on homework assignments\/ways to improve upon my use of techniques.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0Dr. Zelterman is an instructor of great wisdom and passion, I really enjoyed his lectures.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0Dr. Zelterman is very nice and it is clear that he genuinely wants students to understand the material. He presented the material in a clear manner, that helped students with less stats\/SAS experience learn.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0Outstanding! A magnificent teacher through and through. This is how biostatistics should be taught. He gets down to the nitty-gritty, really down to the basics, you understand concepts and actually enjoy getting the big picture, why stuff is done, alternative methods, clarity on data interpretation e.t.c. I wish he taught all biostats courses. 10 stars 3 3 3.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0He was funny, engaging, kind, always available to meet students outside of class, and generally a great teacher overall!"

    "Good elementary class for linear models.",
    "This course is a good introduction to different regression models. I would definitely recommend this class because you get actual practice working and reporting on datasets and can choose which language (R or SAS) you want to use.",
    "Good experience analyzing different datasets each week, but could've been much better with just a little more hands-on work in class.",
    "I think a different professor might make this course better. We had weekly assignments that went along with the class. I think there are other classes that might be better for learning regression models though.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. This course has special emphasis on learning the concepts and motivations behind different methods, which I find very important when working with data.",
    "",
    "yes",
    "This course can be summarized as a review of Biostatistics II with additional instruction on diagnostic methods. I would recommend this course to other students because it gives you the chance to apply this material to real data, and to evaluate regression models to decide which are most appropriate rather than just being told which model(s) to use.",
    "Yes I would highly recommend this class to another student because it teaches them important techniques, in order to properly analyze data.",
    "Would definitely recommend this course to a fellow student",
    "What I imagined in learning linear regression course was simply proving and memorizing formulas. However, I loved this course because it was intuitive. Also, dealing with homework problems that has no strict requirements helped me to broaden my view. However, I thought that it would be much better if we could get some feedback on homework problems. For example, there was one time I struggled with homework problems and got H on that homework but still didn't knew the right way of approaching this problem or wanted to know how other students\/TAs approached the problem.",
    "A great introductory level course for regression analysis which attaches great importance to application and interpretation.",
    "Would definitely recommend if looking for a course that covers basic statistical regression analysis using SAS or R.",
    "Overall, I would not recommend this professor to any current or potential YSPH student. While the course may have been well intentioned, it was poorly designed and implemented by the instructor, leading to a cohort of public health professionals with an inadequate understanding of linear regression analysis.",
    "This course provides a basic overview of regression analysis techniques.",
    "Depends on who the teacher is and whether or not they have adequate time to prepare the lectures. Make sure you know what you need to get out of the course so you can ask the professor to be sure to cover it.",
    "Absolutely take this course. If you don't you missed the best in YSPH!",
    "A generally easy course on linear regression with little programming and a lot of theory."
