    "Medieval Manuscripts walks you through the basics of making a medieval book (all the cool nitty-gritty stuff about inks, scripts, and bindings!) and then broadens into a broader discussion of the book as it was used in monasteries, schools and private homes. Working with Beinecke materials is amazing, and I'm really grateful that I got to experience it while at Yale. Do be prepared to do some paleography (reading medieval scripts!) which can be a bit scary.",
    "I would definitely recommend Medieval Manuscripts for anyone interested in history, art, or literature. This definitely is not your typical English course because it's not about literature, it's about the making of books in the Middle Ages, and includes religious as well as secular works. You get to work in the Beinecke which is awesome and examine manuscripts that are hundreds of years old. The course is a bit of work, but it's very worth it - midterm, midterm project, weekly blog assignments and responses in the second half of the course, and a final project that can be anything you want. One of my favorite courses and also the most singular at Yale.",
    "The course may not be as well structured as it could be; the reading may not be as scintillating as you'd like it to be. But it's pretty cool to look at the Beinecke's wonderful collections!",
    "Definitely take this course if you're at all interested in the Middle Ages. It's also a nice change of pace compared to other pre-1800 English courses which focus on Shakespeare, Spenser, or Chaucer as literature. You'll have a lot of interesting discussions about the history of the book, the activity of reading, and be able to define your own final project \u00e2\u0080\u0094 an extremely fulfilling project for me!",
    "This class is an overview of manuscript studies: in the first half, you study the features and production of manuscripts, and in the second, you analyze the social and historical uses of manuscripts. The course forces students to get to know the library, which most English majors never do, and the unique opportunity to explore the Beinecke's wealth of precious holdings is very worthwhile.I think the course can be dull and difficult to relate to at times, and professor Brantley doesn't always steer discussion effectively, so it becomes vague.Get ready to spend lots and lots of time in the beinecke (even outside class) if you end up in this seminar.",
    "This class is a wonderful chance to familiarize yourself with some of the remarkable material in the Beinecke. The class isn't as structured as a typical English seminar, but nonetheless is a truly one-of-a-kind class that only a place like Yale could offer.",
    "Amazing way to engage with Beinecke",
    "Medieval Manuscripts is a great way to get involved with the incredible manuscripts of the Beinecke. It works as a good pre-1800 that isn't reading based, rather the course is based on original research and learning basics about medieval bookmaking.The material was interesting although very field-specific.This was a lot of work for a 9-person seminar.Jessica Brantley is a nice and understanding professor, albeit a harsh grader. She has an incredible level of knowledge on the material."
