    "Yes it is a lot of work, but do not be put off from taking this class because of the heavy workload. It is a really amazing class and Professor Spooner is a truly exceptional teacher.",
    "If you love sports, you need to take this class. Simple as that. And please do NOT treat this as a 'gut' because you see sports in the title. Throughout the world sports are becoming an educational topic that actually has extremely intriguing themes, concepts, and discussions. Sports are a key example to how our world deals with image and politics. Be ready to do a lot of work. The only thing that I would fix about this course is something that's actually not something you can actively 'fix': more diversity amongst classmates. I really enjoyed my time speaking with each person in my class it was definitely a comfortable environment. However, I noticed (as a black female student) that while discussing some topics throughout the semester that there were a lot of opinions that went unspoken or perceptions that were not illustrated because there was a lack of diversity among the students taking the course. For a class called: Sports, Civil Rights, and American Leadership I would have definitely enjoyed hearing some perspectives that came from more POC in the class.",
    "Best class in my four years at Yale, if you have the opportunity absolutely take it. Don't be scared off by the apparent workload.",
    "LOVE. Look at the syllabus beforehand and try to read some of the books before the start of the semester because it's a TON of work, but totally worth it. You get out of it what you put in, but if you put in the work and have a good discussion group, it will be your favorite class at Yale. It certainly was for me.",
    "Would DEFINITELY recommend!!! One of the most worthwhile classes I've taken. It's a great class on leadership and civil rights, both independently and in relation to each other, throughout the field of sports. Phenomenal.",
    "Dean Spooner was an incredible teacher. It is a lot of work, but the class was very worth while. I would center my schedule to accommodate this class, as i highly recommend it.",
    "This is an excellent class. Dean Spooner is fantastic, and you will learn a tremendous amount. Don't be fooled by the work ratings--there is significant work in this class, and to do well will take a lot of effort. That being said, it is consistently enjoyable and certainly worth taking."
