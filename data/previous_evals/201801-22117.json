    "This course is an excellent introduction into the field of soft matter. Specific focus areas include rheological techniques, basic fluid and thermal dynamics, Van der Waal forces, and colloidal suspensions. Most importantly, this course has an overarching focus on the nature of research itself.",

    "This course is presented in a logical and easily understood manner such that even the most novice soft-matter student can understand. There is a tremendous amount of student interaction and lots of interesting examples to real world physical systems. The capstone projects also provided an outstanding mechanism for combining all the skills learned throughout the course. The only negative is that with all the discussion and student interaction, the course regularly runs overtime.",
