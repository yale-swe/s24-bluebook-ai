   "comments": [
    "This class exposed me to a huge variety of classical and modern literature. I learned how to read plays very quickly, a skill which it took a while to develop.",
    "I deveopled my analytical skills, my reading skills, and my discussion skils in this course. My writing benefitted a lot from the types of essays that I wrote, and I learned to think more creatively about a prompt than I had in the past. I recieved an excellent base in much of the western tradition that I had not been exposed to before.",
    "How to write in a more precise manner, especially when analyzing more than two texts at once. I also developed verbal communication skills in the seminar.",
    "This course helped me refine my writing skills. The plays we read were great.",
    "As far as public speaking goes, I gained a sense of calm because the class and professor where attentive and values everyones input. The main skills I gained were an ability to draw many relevant connections between different works and a central idea plus an enhanced ability to sustain a nuanced argument for the the essays. My writing certainly improved as the semester went on regarding argument substantiation."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The syllabus kinda bounces through time. The beginning sequence of Greek literature was very cohesive and connected. And the last three weeks were inter-connected. The middle part of the syllabus jumped from Shakespeare to Chekhov without much in between. The paper prompts were good and clear. I enjoyed writing the papers. I would have liked feedback on my participation in class. I wasn't sure if I was doing well in terms of in-class participation.",
    "The course was very strong in that it was able to cover a lot of material quickly; this also has its drawbacks, as we could only spend so much time discussing each work. Regardless, the number of plays that we read was one of the reasons I loved the course, as I really felt that I learned a lot about the western tradition in a short period of time. The class's discussion based style was fantastic. It was great to be able to come to class and bounce crazy ideas off of everyone else.",
    "Strengths: - A great survey of plays across human history - The professor - The seminar Weaknesses - A few too many books to study",
    "I really enjoyed this course. My only real criticism is that we read so many plays that there were times that I don't think we really had the time to appreciate the text. I think if a few plays were cut in the curriculum it would provide the students with more depth rather than breadth regarding tragedy.",
    "Strength: the chosen works fit well enough together to nurture comparison but were also different enough to yield contrast. Weaknesses: some works only get a day, but this is necessary because of time. Also, the strength and vibe of the class depends wholely on the students you get in your class."

    "This is a really awesome course that sits at the intersection of literature, philosophy, history, theatre, and art. The syllabus is fantastic, and even if you've read some of the plays before, Professor Robinson really challenges and expands your understanding of these fundamental texts. It's also well-structured, enabling you to progress as a thinker and a writer. Robinson is also wonderful and very helpful -- always available for his students, very sweet, open to lots of different ideas and interpretations. His immense knowledge of ancient Greek and classical civilizations adds a fascinating, exciting level of depth to the course.",
    "I'd recommend this course to anyone. Taking this class and sitting in WLH while the light streamed and discussing Aeschylus really makes me feel like a Yalie. This course is an excellent introduction to tragic theater. This is the heart of a liberal education. The course and Prof. Robinson will introduce you to the basic concepts which underly Western Literature. I learned things which I find applicable to literature across the spectrum. I was tempted to take DS and decided not to take it. This class felt like a bit of a replacement for me. I got to read and discuss lots of \"classic\" literature.",
    "I woud definitely recommend this course to another student. I learned a lot in a short amount of time, and I had a great experience with the teacher and the other students.",
    "Take this course! You will not be dissatisfied!",
    "Yes, it's a great course with really interesting plays.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course if a student wants to finally buckle down and read classics of the western tradition. I think the value of reading these works is to get a sense of the thematic seeds that can still be seen in western works today. Its a also a good course to practice speaking in front of your peers and refuting or disagreeing."
