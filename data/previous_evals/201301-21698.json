    "Stephen Irons is da bomb. Even though he's not even listed as the instructor, he taught most of what I learned from this class. He is amazing!!!",
    "PHYS 206L is somewhat better than 205L but is a huge jump in workload. The lab reports regularly top 10 pages and starting them the night before they are due is a recipe for a late night. I would avoid the electronics labs (with the exception of digital logic) because they take the most time and aren't necessarily clear in what their write-ups require.",
    "This course was much better than Phys 205L, and there are some fun experiments to choose from.",
    "Take it if you have to! Nothing too special about it. Do the superconductivity and electric field plotting. Avoid an circuits experiments or milikan oil drop.",
    "Much better than 205L. Beware of the particle accelerator one: it's a cool lab, but the report is quite long, so start it after the first week of the lab. I highly recommend the superconductors lab.",
    "You're probably here because you have to be. Bear with it.",
    "Much more enjoyable than 205 -- you get to choose your partner and experiments, and work basically on your own. There are written lab reports, but they are usually pretty manageable.",
    "Don't take unless you like physics or need to. The whole semester will go over smoothly if you go in with a friend (or luck out and get a nice partner) and choose the right labs. Unlike 205, you stick with the same partner and choose your labs. Some labs are really cool but others are just plain tedious with error analysis(Millikan Oil Drop).If you are not amazing with time management, I guarantee you will pull several all-nighters throughout the semester for the lab reports.",
    "A requirement for physics majors. It's something you have to get through. If you pick the right experiments, you'll be interested in the material and have a good time. Writing lab reports suck.",
    "MUCH better than 205L. The grading was a bit less ambiguous. No practical at the end, which was great. Therefore, everything was just the lab. Some of the labs were really cool like the particle accelerator lab and the superconductivity lab. DON'T put off your lab report until the end!",
    "So much better than 205 lab. This class was so fun!",
    "It's a good class. The labs are really interesting and you get to repeat some of the experiments that were critical in our understanding of science- Rutherford's experiment, Planck's experiment, etc. Would definitely recommend over the other intro physics labs.",
    "Fun! Much better than 205L.",
    "Better than 205.",
    "This class is more fun than 205, since you get to choose your labs and partner. That said, it is also significantly more work (I spent probably 5 or 6 hours a week on reports) because the lab reports take time and thought. You basically only collect data during the lab period, and do the analysis on your own time. The labs themselves are pretty cool and not what you did in high school physics.",
    "Definitely better than 205. Yes, you have to write lab reports each week, but it's not usually a time-crunch. Plus, some of the experiments are pretty cool. EASY: Digital Logic, Electric Field Plotting, Superconductivity (also very very cool - get it?), Planck's constant. HARD: Fraunhoffer Diffraction (don't do it! the writeup is really really long and tedious), Electron Diffraction and Electron Charge-to-Mass (the writeup is relatively easy, but getting the equipment to work can be somewhat annoying), Nuclear Scattering (using the particle accelerator is really cool, and the operator does everything for you, but the writeup is long and not that easy if you haven't been paying attention).",
    "Some people like some of the experiments, such as the superconductivity one or the particle accelerator one. Personally, I thought every experiment we did was extremely boring, and things ALWAYS went wrong with every experiment. By far the worst part of this lab, though, are the weekly lab write-ups, which means that every weekend I had to churn out a 7-12 page lab report on something that was uninteresting and boring.",
    "Much better than 205",
    "This is a class that will take up your life with its weekly lab reports, but the experiments themselves are really, really cool. Do superconductivity. Trust me! Take the time to get to know the TAs so you can switch sections if you do not like your TA. This is vitally important!!!",
    "Take it if you have to, though consider taking 166L instead. The lab prep documents are not very organized or up to date in this class, and some labs can get frustrating just based on stupid details.",
    "My guess is you are taking this because it is a pre\/req and frankly it's not a bad one, maybe a little bit of extra work but that is to be expected from a lab course.",
    "I would highly recommend this lab course for anyone in the science fields. The ability to choose the lab experiments you want to perform makes the entire lab experience enjoyable.",
    "Physics 206 is a lot more fun than first semester - the choice of labs is very diverse which allows us a lot of flexibility. Some of the labs can be tedious with a lot of data analysis and the lab report per week can definitely be time consuming, but overall, I would say that this is a very good laboratory course.",
    "More interesting than 205, but with lab reports. The workload is not very intense, and you learn a lot.",
    "If I had the option between 165\/166 and 205\/206, I'd have probably chosen 165\/166 had I known how much work 206 was. In contrast to 165\/166 (a one page lab report due every week) and 205 (no lab reports at all), 206 required a multi-page(10+ pages) lab report due every week, although apparently there was a secret rubric that said an introduction section wasn't necessary despite the sample lab report posted online (the only instructions given for the lab report). Otherwise, 206 is pretty much the same as 205 -- just as hectic and stressful during class, except you get to pick your own experiments (don't do anything related to electricity except for digital logic).",
    "It's fun to be able to pick your labs. Good ones are energy in 2D, digital logic, charge to mass ratio, and superconductivity. Don't do the DC power supply lab. Just don't. It was such a struggle. And start your reports early, of course, or they'll get annoying.",
    "This is so much better than Physics 205! You get to choose 9 experiments out of 20, and even get a couple weeks off. The experiments are much more interesting, though the writeups do take a fair bit of time.Look at previous semesters' evaluations for comments on the most interesting\/most tricky\/least troublesome experiments, find a partner who will want to do about the same amount of work as you will, and have fun!",
    "Do physics experiments and stuff."
