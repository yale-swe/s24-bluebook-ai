    "I wouldn't recommend the course in its current form. The instructor didn't seem to be as invested in the course as I would like him to be. The models were too theoretical and were suitable for a PhD student and not for an applied degree.",
    "The course was interesting but the final paper did not seem to coincide well with the lectures. I would have liked more direction with the paper and more support. However, I would still recommend the class to a peer.",
    "It is a really good course if you want to know about what development projects are going on around the globe, or if you want to pursue a Phd in Development.",
    "Great development economics class",
    "Comprehensive overview of development theories",
    "A broad overview of some applied papers in the subject of development.",
    "Not useful. Too PHD oriented",
    "An interesting, if somewhat mechanical, overview of development economic theories and some applied assessments thereof.",
    "Would not recommend this course to anyone who is going into policy work in the future. Too technical and academic - suitable for PhD students only or those intending to pursue intensive research."
