    "It's technically Sexuality in literature and pop culture, but it felt a little literature heavy at some points so beware if that kind of thing upsets you. I would definitely recommend the class to another student. It's super easy and you can get by having not done a lot of work. That said, you get out of it what you put into it, so if you don't do any work you're going to be absurdly bored during those two hours.",
    "loved this course! professor avilez is really nice and open and the topics we cover are really interesting.",
    "This was my favorite class of the semester and one of my favorite classes at Yale. The material is so interesting and very different from anything you've seen before. The workload is not too bad: it's a book a week and some additional articles, but the readings are so interesting and so different from the other work that I do though that I really didn't mind it. The course assignments were very doable. Professor Avilez is such a nice, smart, and caring professor. He really prepares an interesting seminar every week. He's also not a crazy grader--if you put in good work and engage with the material, it is not hard to do well, especially since Professor Avilez makes himself so available to his students. TAKE IT! TAKE IT! TAKE IT!",
    "I would definitely recommend English 371 to anyone interested in African American literature or in viewing literature from a cultural lens.",
    "Take it if every part of the course title attracts you. Otherwise do something else.",
    "This was a fantastic course overall, partly because Professor Avilez is one of the best professors I've had at Yale. It was also a great chance to apply my background in WGSS to AfAm cultural material in particular. This year, the majority of the class had the opposite experience (more background talking about race and African American culture than gender or sexuality), which was occasionally frustrating for the handful of WGSS people, but I think ultimately made the course productive for everyone. I don't know if I'd recommend this class if your primary relevant experience is Major English Poets, though... you might feel pretty lost when the music videos start. Who knows, though, it's such a good class that it might be worth a try.",
    "Absolutely! You learn about some issues that you might have never really considered critically (like sexism in Hip Hop)",
    "I loved this class! We discussed sexuality through provocative texts, films, music, and music videos, explored our thoughts on them through great class discussions and blog posts, and looked at different aspects of black sexuality that I had never considered before. Definitely take this if you can.",
    "Please take this course. You will not be disappointed! Relatively easy course load and great discussions !",
    "In this class, you will learn how to develop a critical lens through which to analyze African American pop cultural personalities (anyone who you would see on a magazine cover, in a celebrity gossip blog, or on Youtube or World Star Hip Hop). This class will open your eyes to how black people are perceived in the media, and will cause you to reflect on how and why you consume popular culture in the ways that you do.",
    "The reading list is really great. Professor Avilez designed an awesome curriculum that allowed us to explore everything from queer women of color in Canada to Michael Jackson.",
    "Great Class!!"
