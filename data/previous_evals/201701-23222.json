   "comments": [
    "I have gained a much deeper understanding of the concepts and practices of Human Rights globally. I learned more about philosophers historically and recently and their thoughts' regarding a plethora of different rights that all fall under the label of Human Rights. I've learned about the balance between politics and NGO groups who enforce rights and why they are fundamental to our humanity.",
    "I learned some basics on histories of human rights, the philosophical underpinnings of human rights, and a few human rights related topics, such as international courts, refugees, and business and human rights.",
    "A great dive into political science courses.",
    "Learned a lot about the history of human rights and the philosophical foundations, as well as the issues we have with human rights today.",
    "I have a much broader overview of the human rights movement as well as issues it has grappled with.",
    "This course is an introduction to the international human rights regime. You'll talk quite a bit about theory, history, and laws. There were also some really interesting weeks where we focused on more specific topics such as torture, refugees, etc.",
    "Major insights include how human rights have been constructed, where they come from historically, different frameworks for thinking about human rights.",
    "I frankly feel like I didn't learn anything from this class that I didn't already know about human rights.",
    "I was very grateful for this course because I had an AMAZING section -- best at all of Yale. (Shout-out to Paul!) It also helped bring the human rights scholars together, which was great for us. The content of the class is really interesting. However, it really felt like too much of an intro course. The lectures often felt so introductory that they did not feel that productive. It did not feel like the lectures contained that much nuance or that they were very thoughtfully constructed to make an argument. I felt like I learned a lot more from the readings and from section discussion than from the lecture per se. I think the midterm assignment (two 4-5 page papers with choices of prompts on the readings, no outside research) I think were very very productive in furthering my understanding, particularly of the philosophy, which was the hardest for me to understand. The final is an 8-10 page research paper, from prompts or a topic of your own choosing, which was also a really valuable opportunity to learn more about a topic I cared a lot about.",
    "A good introduction to the theory, history, and legal framework of the human rights system.",
    "Great introduction course into international human rights law and history",
    "A philosophical and historical approach to human rights, coupled with an analysis of current issues within human rights. In general, I would say I got a better concrete idea of what human rights means, especially human rights law.",
    "This class provided a great survey of issues relating to human rights and human rights activism. As someone who has always thought of myself as passionate about human rights, I think it was incredibly helpful to think critically about human rights as an intellectual matter. We read several philosophical thinkers that I had never encountered before and were exposed to legal documents that many students were unaccostimed to reading.",
    "really great for an overview of the human rights situation today and in the past",
    "Human rights",
    "I became quite familiar with all aspects of the study of human rights. The course provided a fair level of insight into some of the philosophical\/theoretical underpinnings of the idea of human rights, then provided a good amount of perspective on the history and development of international human rights as a framework, discourse, and law. Afterwards, we segued into examining several issues in human rights specifically. The course did a nice job critiquing human rights as an ideology, looking forward to challenges it may face, while also highlighting solutions and methods in human rights. Altogether, the course was far more insightful than one would expect for a survey\/introductory class. I came in knowing quite a deal about human rights already, and still found the course useful because it provided a very coherent review of all things relevant to human rights. The readings were intriguing, meaningful, and highly relevant to lecture. They added extra depth to what was being said in class.",
    "The major bases of human rights thought, the history of human rights, and a variety of human rights case studies.",
    "From this course I learned about the philosophical roots of human rights, and this allowed me to better understand the contemporary issues of human rights that we discussed later in the class.",
    "Learned a lot about the history of human rights as a concept and now can apply it to life today."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I think the number one thing to help improve this course would be to make a course packet with all the readings available for purchase instead of just posting the readings online. This would help to take notes and reference particular passages in discussion sections. The strengths are definitely the professors and their knowledge of the topic.",
    "While the course is great there is a lack of deep knowledge gained by the end of the semester.",
    "I wish the class would have spent less time on the foundations of human rights and more on case studies regarding the topic. Also, I wish I would have spent more time engaging with the material but the way the final paper was set up with choosing a topic that you had to do research on, I focused more on my energy on other classes (whose lectures were truly important to focus on). But, Professor Robinson and Professor Sanchez were very passionate about the material which made it a fun class and the guest lecturers were very cool.",
    "The course material seemed a bit dry at times. I would recommend taking out the beginning part of the class which focuses on the history of human rights.",
    "Strengths - readings, TAs Weaknesses - lecture was awful. I think maybe 1\/8 of the class showed up consistently by the end. It was not enlightening in comparison to the readings and it was very boring. I would rather do the readings than come to class to hear things explained very poorly\/simplistically.",
    "I'd say some weeks of this class were really interesting and some were just not. In particular, I thought the sections on history and courts dragged on way too long. I wish instead we had talked more about current human rights issues. For example, we never really covered LGBT rights, which would have been really interesting. Also, for me I thought was focused too much on talking about the specific laws and documents that set up human rights laws. I know it's important, but I think that prevented us from really getting a grasp on the more practical aspects of the topics.",
    "There was too much reading, so I didn't do any of it.",
    "I think the course did a great job of covering a wide range of material. Lectures did take time to go over the readings, sometimes, which was also helpful. I'm not sure if this course has a weakness, but I do think both Professor Sanchez and Professor Robinson would've preferred teaching in a seminar.",
    "The section in our material on histories of human rights was so broad and over-generalized; the lectures on this section were basically useless and extremely boring. The readings on this material were unnecessarily long and were not helpful. The guest lectures were probably the most interesting parts of the class, especially the ones given by Harold Koh and Posner. I felt that the midterm take-home exam was worth too much in the grading scheme, and that it was graded too harshly by the TA. I wish that the grading scheme was distributed into more assignments that are worth a smaller portion of the entire grade, because given the current grading scheme a student who did not do well on the midterm exam was basically screwed since it was worth 40% of the entire grade, which seems unfair.",
    "Strengths: Paul and section and the reading list. Seriously, Paul is excellent: so kind, brilliant, and thoughtful about his teaching. Weaknesses: lectures that did not feel challenging or productive and interesting enough. They might have been good for students with very little knowledge of human rights issues but for those even with a precursory background were less-than-stimulating. Also, I thought Professor Sanchez's tone on some issues was casually flippant in a disrespectful way -- e.g. about torture, the Holocaust, genocide in Yugoslavia, etc. This got in the way of my appreciating her lectures and the content she provided.",
    "Exposes students to the legal background of human rights. Section afforded us the opportunity to debate the different ideas presented.",
    "It would be great if there could be more of an intro into HR law terms and institutions. Assume the students know nothing about HR law.",
    "Strengths: Internesting topics. Student engagement. LOVED the guest speakers (especially Mike Posner and Laura from IRAP). Overall, great introduction class. Weakness: Classes moved a little slowly sometimes. I think we could probably do less of the historical aspect and focus more on modern day applied uses of human rights, which I find more interesting.",
    "Although the philosophical thinkers section was not particularly enjoyable, I think it's a great strength of this class, as it grounds many class discussions going forward. I also LOVED the guest lectures (particularly Koh's) as a way of getting outside opinion, even if some people disagreed with them. One weakness of this class is that class lectures did not always feel particularly organized to cover as much material as possible, and it was often frustrating to feel like other people felt like lecture was optional (the class often had low attendance). I wonder if it's possible to organize a section that would be more intensive (perhaps an optional writing credit?) that could offer a more rigorous option for students who want to take the class more seriously. I would also recommend reworking the section on the history of the 1948 Declaration to be a bit shorter and more directly related to the actual content of the universal declaration and less about the players in its making.",
    "if you're interested in the manor or an overview of human rights this is good. but not for lellle who want a specific, in dept understanding of a particular issue",
    "Boring lecture good section",
    "The lectures could be more engaging and perhaps more specific",
    "The course did a nice job critiquing human rights as an ideology, looking forward to challenges it may face, while also highlighting solutions and methods in human rights. Altogether, the course was far more insightful than one would expect for a survey\/introductory class. I came in knowing quite a deal about human rights already, and still found the course useful because it provided a very coherent review of all things relevant to human rights. The readings were intriguing, meaningful, and highly relevant to lecture. They added extra depth to what was being said in class.",
    "It remained very surface level despite the depth of the material.",
    "Discussion sections need improvement. Quality of discussion was lacking, mostly summarizing material. There was little incentive to read the material so it was obvious that most students did not.",
    "The history portion of the class was just not very engaging as far as anything pre-UDHR. It didn't feel well connected into the course, and I felt the time could have been better spent on case studies. The different sections don't feel cohesive. Overall the course is engaging however, and manages to give a good introduction to a broad topic.",
    "I think some of the lectures were a bit off topic and strayed away from the goals of the class. However, the sections were very useful in better understanding the sometimes dry material that we learned in lecture.",
    "Lectures could have been a little more engaging but material was very interesting."

    "This course is relatively interesting class that is also fairly easy in terms of workload. It is a good 5th\/6th class with low time commitment.",
    "If you're interested in human rights conceptually and global issues that need to be dealt with through the enforcement of human rights definitely take this course. However, it is highly abstract so if you're looking more for specific human rights movements or more recent human rights advancements I wouldn't necessarily recommend this particular course.",
    "Most definitely",
    "This is a broad overview course on different important topics related to human rights. I thought it was interesting and helped me understand the world better, but I don't think it is a \"must take\" class.",
    "Yes, a great critical introduction to human rights.",
    "Human Rights Theory was a really interesting overview of all things human rights. The workload was decent with a midterm paper and final paper, but you had to do some of the readings for section and section responses each week. Unfortunately, it is very easy to lose interest since the final paper is a research paper only dealing with class material topics. Overall, pretty easy and kind of interesting, but a little disappointing.",
    "This would not be my first choice class wise. Thought it would be really interesting, but the material ended up being very dry.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student. There's a good balance of theory and current events\/history such that anyone can find something to be interested in. The subject matter is super important and relevant as well. Well taught with amazing TAs, at least this year. The midterm is take-home and the final research paper is straightforward and pretty short.",
    "If you're in the Human Rights Program, you're forced to take it. If you want to understand the Human Rights movement, then yes, take it. But if you're interested in engaging with human rights from a more practical perspective, then there are plenty of other courses at Yale that are better taught.",
    "Yes. Minimal work load, great PLSC credit.",
    "Not unless you have to take it or are guaranteed Paul as TA",
    "Gut",
    "I would recommend this course to students who have zero background in human rights, up to a moderate background. The course is facilitated to truly walk once through the arc of human rights, which means you get to build through each unit as we go along. I think if you invest some time into the readings, you can get a lot out of each. Be warned that it is taught from a legal-scholar perspective. You talk about cases and intl law a lot. Professor Robinson and Sanchez, if they teach it again, are great. But I felt they would've been more dynamic in a seminar. Watch out for the paper--they're worth like 50% of your grade.",
    "Do NOT take this class unless your are in the Human Rights program and therefore required to take it. The two professors (Sanchez and Robinson) are very poor lecturers, and the lectures are extremely dull and poorly delivered by both professors. If you already have a good background knowledge of human rights and the international human rights legal framework, you will basically learn nothing new from this course and it will be a waste of time.",
    "Yes, definitely if you're in the human rights program (required), or if you want a not-very-challenging workload on an interesting subject, or if you're interested, vaguely, in human rights and want an introduction. But don't go to this course looking for a huge intellectual challenge or life-changing lecture. I didn't really feel like in either lecturer I was getting any information beyond a pretty basic standard; I didn't feel like I was getting the newest\/freshest take on the scholarship. Also, the lectures really repeat the readings (and the readings are honestly much more compelling than the lectures), so it seems like you need to do one or the other but not both. If Paul is TAing the class still, then it is definitely worth taking it if you can get into his section. If he isn't then it might not be worth taking.",
    "Yes, political science students should have a grounding in human rights.",
    "Yes must take course",
    "With Professors Sanchez and Robinson, this course is amazing. Readings are carefully chosen to provide a meaningful snapshot of the topic for that lecture. The assignments are a joy to write and don't come too frequently. I would absolutely recommend this class.",
    "Yes, good introductory class. If you're interested in human rights, it equips you with beginner knowledge\/tools in the philosophical and historical background, as well as modern applications. You cover interesting material, and the class has great guest speakers.",
    "This class is a great option if you want to take a class that will force you to think critically about human rights as an academic field (and not just social justice activism). The class is as hard as you make it, so if you put in the time and interest, you can get a lot out of it.",
    "100% required if you're interested in the program, but also good for general knowledge of recent human rights circumstances and the development of the movement today",
    "Yes great intro course",
    "Yes; I became quite familiar with all aspects of the study of human rights. The course provided a fair level of insight into some of the philosophical\/theoretical underpinnings of the idea of human rights, then provided a good amount of perspective on the history and development of international human rights as a framework, discourse, and law.

    "I would certainly recommend this course to any student who as an interest in human rights (which should be all students btw) because it provides a clear and concise foundation of the intellectual background which we should use to analyze contemporary human rights issues.",
    "Yes, I thought the material was very interesting and I learned a lot."
