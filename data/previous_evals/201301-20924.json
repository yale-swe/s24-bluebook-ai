    "Classes can be enjoyable. Readings prescribed were great. However, classes lack the kind of rigour and structure that one would expect in a graduate course.A more methodical way of teaching is required- that makes one master the various development models and also provides the necessary insight for policy discussions.Pace of instruction was painstakingly slow-- out of all topics, one topic was dragged on for 13 weeks, leaving very little time for other topics of interest to other sections of the class.It also seemed that the topics that were clung to for majority of the class time were meant to be useful especially for those appearing for certain interviews, thereby leading to a potential bias in the kind of instruction in class and beneficial for a small section. The discussions were also centered around one organisation and one kind of evaluation methodology, namely RCT.",
    "This class consisted mostly of uninteresting class discussions. I never took notes on the discussions and I did not learn from them. I am extremely frustrated that I was forced to take this class instead of an elective that might have taught me something.",
    "I will recommend since I enjoyed discussion and writing project.",
    "Currently I would not recommend this course. The coverage has some really interesting topics but clearer structure and less time spent going off-topic would allow for a more in-depth understanding of the relevant issues.",
    "yes",
    "The course gives an overview of topics in developmental economics and has a large focus on the economic theories behind economic development.",
    "I would recommend this class for those who are keen on learning more on development, and want to work personnally through research and readings on it.",
    "Required course",
    "I would recommend it for the potential it holds in terms of reading and discussing economic research.",
    "Take the class for any understanding of development issues. YES.",
    "Yes, it is useful for IDE.",
    "Could be more precise in delivery"

   "comments": [
    "Would have liked to derive a lot more from this course. Alas, such was not the case. The class varied wildly in terms of interesting discussions-- some were great days and most others were very dry and students seem to lack attention in class.",
    "This course did not deepen my knowledge of my discipline except through my own research for the final paper.",
    "I got to have more interest in this subject which I used to know nothing and even I did not care.",
    "The development paper is a great opportunity to open my research project, and Mike has been a great help throughout!",
    "I believe with more encouragement, and with more crisp discussion of the material, as well as incentives to work harder and be more engaged (as opposed to going slowly through the material), I would have learnt more.",
    "It exposed me to many critical issues in developmental economics and the theories behind them.",
    "The readings were definitely helpful for my research project.",
    "Gave perspective on current research in Development and provided interesting insight into contrasting views on certain aspects of Development which will be helpful in future career",
    "The final project at the end helped us use our statistical skills more.",
    "Yes, but not necessarily the specific field of development I'm interested in.",
    "Extremely so"
