   "comments": [
    "SO MUCH!! ASL is so so cool and I had no idea before about all of the complexities of the language. Like the way you use space to convey meaning; it's so cool.",
    "So much vocabulary, but more than that, culture and the beginnings of nuances pertaining to the ASL.",
    "We learned SO MUCH. A lot of vocab. I used to keep a vocab sheet, and we learned over 500 words by midterms. Also, basic grammar structure and classifiers. I also gained a greater appreciation for deaf culture.",
    "I feel that I already have the ability to be communicate in ASL pretty well, even though I am still in ASL 1 because we practice and learn so much every day in class.",
    "I learned the basics for signing!",
    "I learned so much about basic signing including vocab, classifiers and finger spelling. I also learned how to practice my receptive skills and comprehension. Lastly I learned about deaf culture and signing norms.",
    "In ASL 110, I gained a vast understanding of the basics of ASL grammar, lots of signs about a variety of topics (sports, time, family members, food, activities), and how to use facial expressions to convey meaning. We also learned a bit about deaf culture.",
    "We learned many signs and classifiers needed for basic conversational ASL, & I learned to be more expressive and creative in general",
    "Even though this is only L1, I am able to use ASL almost everyday when communicating with other people on campus who have known it for a while. Im obviously not fluent or incredibly proficient, but I can understand them and they can understand me!",
    "I developed an understanding of the basic signs and structures used in ASL. I also learned that the deaf community has a culture much more complex than Id realized. I now have enormous respect for those who are able to grow up without the privilege of hearing.",
    "I learned so much about ASL and deaf culture! You learn so many signs and so much grammar in one semester. You learn to think about language in a very different way. There are so many amazing facets of ASL that I'd never known about!",
    "I mean ASL basics for one."

   "comments": [
    "strengths: Mikey is AMAZING! He is so so good at communicating. He can act out anything. And he makes class so fun.",
    "Even though often times it was difficult, the videos we watched were fast-paced and meant to help us become more fluent\/understand the nuances of ASL.",
    "It's really hard to study for this class. You can't take notes unless you want to draw the handshape of each sign really quickly in class. But then, you risk not looking at the next sign he's teaching. So, \"studying\" consisted of you racking your brain trying to remember handshapes. There is an online dictionary, but there are so many regional variations. Quite a few times, his version was different from the dictionary, so you were screwed if you didn't remember. There are no tutors available through the Center for Language Study like they have for other languages because this is a new course. I liked the structure of the class built on itself. It really made sense and was not too overwhelming even though we covered a lot to material. It was really fun!",
    "Small class size and a very hard-working instructor who involves every single one of us are strengths of this course. If there was a vocabulary review session before midterms\/finals that would be wonderful because often the vocabulary signed by the instructor is different from that of the Internet.",
    "Very fast paced and informative. However, was a little information-heavy at times.",
    "I think the main strength of this course (aside from Mikey of course) is that it requires everyone to be very active and present. The class is incredibly engaging and everyone is excited to be there and sign everyday. You also can't really take notes, so it forces you to be focused on the material the entire time. The main weakness, which is hard to remedy because it's ASL, is that it's A LOT of vocab and it's difficult to remember everything.",
    "Strengths: Fun class! Genuinely wouldve gone everyday even if it had been at 9am Weaknesses: No feedback on class participation, and no feedback on some videos we made and the quizzes we took. Just had our grades.",
    "I really enjoyed the immersion style of learning ASL. It was difficult, but definitely effective. I think that this course could have been improved by some opportunities for real world interaction with the deaf community. We were only beginners, but by the end of the semester I felt as if I could carry on a simple conversation.",
    "I loved going to class everyday, it was always a lot of fun and super engaging. You have a video assignment a week, but other than that the only homework is to go over signs and practice.",
    "Extremely engaging and well taught, only weakness is that the textbook is kinda inconsequential. Wish I hadnt spent like $80 on it"

    "YES!! This is the most fun class I've taken or will take at Yale. Mikey is an amazing professor and the class is so fun. We laugh a ton and play games. It's the only class that I actually wish that it did meet during reading week. ASL is really challenging but really cool.",
    "Yes! More people should definitely learn ASL. Make sure you practice continually because there's a lot to remember.",
    "Yes. We learned so much, and it is a lovely environment in class.",
    "Yes! But please make sure to look at the online book you are given on the syllabus. It will help your learning greatly!",
    "Yes! Being able to sign is so important! Not only does sign language expose you to another culture and community, it also is just a fun break from your other classes. It's five days a week, but it's only 50 minutes and you kind of just show up, speak with your hands for a bit, and then are on your merry way. There are a few video assignments and quizzes throughout the year, but the overall workload of this class is low, especially for a language, and you learn SO much just in L1. Plus, Mikey is the best - so encouraging and fun to take a class with.",
    "If you have the opportunity to take ASL, take it! Not only is it a fascinating language to learn because of the combination of hand movements and facial expressions, but it's important that people are learning about and engaging with the deaf and hard of hearing community. I was genuinely excited to go to class everyday and found myself practice with my friends all the time. It's such a unique opportunity to have - take ASL!",
    "Yes absolutely, especially if you have an interest in ASL and Deaf culture. There are definitely a lot of assignments and the quizzes are not easy so don't expect to cruise, but that's how we learned so much in one semester! It's an incredibly fun class and a beautiful language if you really immerse yourself in it.",
    "Yes! This course is a great way to fulfill your foreign language requirement if youd like to begin a new challenge. Professor Barrett is excellent at working with beginners.",
    "Absolutely! Mikey is an amazing professor and you learn so much. You also get to think about language in a completely new way which I thought was really cool.",
    "Yes. Period."
