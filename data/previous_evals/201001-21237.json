    "I would highly recommend this course for a student interested in clinical psychology. The course provides a great review of current literature in developmental psychopathology that any clinical psychology student should be familiar with.",
    "I would recommend it for students who want a good, broad introduction to the developmental approach in psychopathology. I would describe it more as an upper-level undergraduate seminar than a highly practical graduate course.",
    "Yes, I would recommend it.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this class to other students.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student, particularly one who was interested in the developmental perspective. This course was a great introduction to the complexities involved in the research of psychological abnormalities (and normality) when taking a developmental approach.",
    "This is a course that focuses on asking questions from a developmental perspective. It is almost entirely student-run and discussion based."

    "The work wasn't too much, the readings were helpful in broadening knowledge base and the final paper was a good practice in writing and reviewing literature.",
    "This course gave me a new lens through which I can examine my own research interests and enlightened me to new perspectives I may not have ever considered otherwise.",
    "This course exposed me to the basic principles of developmental psychopathology."
