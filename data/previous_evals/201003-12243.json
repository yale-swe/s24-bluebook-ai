   "comments": [
    "This class is phenomenal. The professor is great and the readings are very interesting (and a bit sad at times). The workload is not bad at all and can actually be fun to do. This has been one of my best classes at Yale and would definitely recommend it.",
    "If you can get in (only like 20 percent of people did because everyone knows how great Dean B is), take it for sure. Not too tough and Dean B is great. Very interesting look at genocide. Pretty broad, though- there are other classes to take, for example the Poli Sci one on Rwanda, if you are looking to go more in-depth with a specific case study.",
    "This class is pretty much a survey, nothing too detailed, but Dean B is great, and the class isn't too much work, although there's sometimes a lot of reading. Take it!",
    "Certainly. This is a highly popular class and as a result, very hard to get into. If you are willing to learn very depressing matter - but that will teach you a whole lot more than you were prepared for - try to get in!",
    "Yes, if they are genuinely interested in learning about genocide and its prevention because it takes a lot of engagement not to be overcome by the depressing topics involved.",
    "Yes, definitely. The topics discussed in this class are important for anyone interested in global affairs.",
    "EP&E 269 is an exploration of genocide and its ramifications, including the legal backdrop for intervention and other issues the international community faces in dealing with genocide and ethnic conflict. I would absolutely recommend this class. You will learn more than you ever wanted to know about the subject matter, but it's important to learn about, and Dean B is an amazing instructor.",
    "This is a good class, but to be honest, it will leave you feeling a little bit unsatisfied. I supposed that's inevitable with such a depressing topic. The professor is very nice though, so if you are interested in the topic, go for it.",
    "Take it! It's a great class. Discussions are largely open-ended, so be aware of that, and if you want to dive into specific things rather than just going over the readings, definitely bring them up yourself. Dean B is an excellent professor, and she made the class really special by bringing in speakers and showing documentaries to bring up media portrayals of genocide.",
    "Definitely take this class. Dean B is knowledgable and knows how to encourage discussion. The class really does depend on who else is in it though.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course if you're interested in learning about genocide. You'll learn about the Holocaust (from a different perspective than usual), the Cambodian genocide, the Rwandan genocide, and genocide in the former Yugoslavia, while also considering genocide from various perspectives and talking about prevention and punishment. There's a lot of reading for the class, but the books are great and the stuff in the course packet is really informative. The material is really heavy and upsetting, but Dean B is wonderful and made the semester as easy to get through as possible."
