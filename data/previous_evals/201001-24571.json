   "comments": [
    "Take this class! It's a step up from all the other French courses at Yale, and you'll actually start to feel competent at understanding\/speaking\/writing the language.",
    "French 140 uses a variety of films and texts to work towards language fluency. Grammatical concepts from lower levels are revisited. This class also covers smaller, more specific rules that haven't been covered in previous levels.",
    "Absolutely; it is an excellent, thorough follow-up to French 130.",
    "French 140 is a great way to improve your language skills and to really see if this is the language you want to continue with in your career, learning-wise. This course will let you really apply what you've learned in past language lessons.",
    "I would recommend it wholeheartedly. You learn a lot. My French certainly improved, and I got to learn many things about other cultures and historical events."
