    "Got me excited for Leadership and Ethics senior year.",
    "This is a subject that is all encompassing for any career or chosen profession. The class challenges you to question yourself and your own motives, to explore the successes and failures of those who have gone before, and to explore various explanations for certain phenomenon in team environments. I wish this class had credit so that more people could have the opportunity to think about these kinds of things.",
    "If you're in NROTC, you're going to have to take this class no matter what. If you're not, I would not recommend it; it's too much work to justify taking the class without getting credit.",
    "A repetitive course discussing leadership for Naval ROTC students. If you are not in Naval ROTC, do not take it; it is in general a waste of time.",
    "A great course if you are interested in learning about leading others, especially in a military context."
