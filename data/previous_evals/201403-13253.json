   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this class if you are really motivated to improve your Chinese and know you will be putting in the work. Otherwise, you will just float by and not take this class seriously and learn very little. This is a class that is really easy to just forget about and not prioritize.",
    "CHNS 162 01 is a great course for people who already understand the basics of Chinese and who want to bring it up to a level that's actually usable in China. I would recommend it to other heritage students who are committed and confident they can do the steady, daily work needed to keep up with the course. It's relatively easy if they don't fall behind.",
    "There are a LOT of heritage students in this class, so be aware that some people WILL be better than others\/have different levels of experience. At first, the class feels like a lot of work, but once you understand what the professor wants, it's not so bad. He is a fairly lenient grader, which makes the course less stressful. There is a lot of busy work, and a lot of self-studying. The professor definitely knows a lot and has a lot of insight on Chinese culture, but he may not be the best at actually teaching language skills. It sometimes felt like class time was not incredibly effective, and lectures sometimes seemed repetitive. He does call on people a lot in class, but not everyone is called on equally, and it does feel like he has some favorites. We wrote many essays, which was great in improving my writing skills but was also very time consuming. I definitely expanded my vocabulary and improved my writing skills, but it might have been out of necessity in completing assignments rather than in what he taught. One area I felt like I could have improved in more was speaking (my writing, listening, and reading all improved). For the exams, you need to know the lessons\/articles and the vocabulary well, so it can be time-intensive to study. The exams will have some things you have never seen before and require you to use your inference skills. However, this class was great in that it is only 3 days a week as compared to other Chinese courses.",
    "Typical Chinese learning class - if you need to take it because it's at your level, it won't hurt and you might learn something out of it."
