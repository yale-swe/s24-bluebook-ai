   "comments": [
    "gooooooooooooooooood!",
    "Strengths: FANTASTIC CLASS. The instructor kept the class engaged, very informative, the labs were extremely useful Weaknesses: The grading on labs each week was not very clear - 1,2,3 given for each lab, which makes it unclear how the final grade will be calculated. I also wish it took less than a month to get us our graded midterms back.",
    "This is the only course where I have been able to develop a clear understanding of SAS! Professor Desai effectively teaches students the appropriate tests techniques for data analysis. I am excited to apply the skills learned in this class to my summer internship and future research. This course is extremely beneficial and provides students with a strong skill set upon completion.",
    "Its such a good and necessary class. It teaches you the fundamentals of how to use SAS. The lecture notes are gold. I'll never throw them away. Weakness: Lecture is really LONG. Its just hard to sit there and watch the professor talk about how to use a software for 2 hours at a time. I wished section was shorter and lab was longer. That was where I really learned.",
    "Mayur is very engaging and a good lecturer. It was difficult to focus on a two hour SAS lecture without having SAS in front of me though.",
    "Overall excellent course - mayur provides an excellent overview of SAS programming and other materials you learn in other courses.",
    "Amazing class! This is an essential class for anyone who wants to learn more about SAS and data analysis. The prof and TFs were amazingly helpful. It is a challenging yet empowering class! I just wish things (like the midterm and final) were graded more quickly. I also would almost suggest doing more labs (maybe 1 or 2 more) so we could get more practice with the material.",
    "Best course I've taken at YSPH for skill-building by far. Best, clearest instructor I've had, incredible organization of the lectures and labs. This should absolutely be required of every MPH student. I could go into further detail, but if you are reading this, no need to think any further, take this course. you'll be happy you did.",
    "The grading is very strange and overly harsh. It does not facilitate learning or improved understanding of SAS.",
    "Excellent course overall - easy to follow and comprehend.",
    "I wish we could adopt a flipped classroom style of teaching for 1 or 2 of the classes. This would allow us to learn the concepts outside of the classroom and, as a class, work on problems together. However, I understand that with such a large class, it would be difficult to coordinate this successfully! I loved the fact that extra information that we did not necessarily need for the course was included; it helps put the concepts in context for when we apply these concepts to the real world.",
    "good",
    "it was good if you want in depth knowledge about sas. one recommendation: make lab 1.5 hours so they don't feel so rushed.",
    "Required course for me, but great instructor on topic. This is where I really (maybe) learned SAS!",
    "I learned how to code, A skill i did not have WHATSOEVER before this class. I feel like it was a huge learning curve and at times very difficult, but I learned a lot. The lecture slides were excellent.",
    "Exhausting",
    "Very good course, Very useful and practical",
    "Very useful course.",
    "Great course! Very useful skills that I will be able to use in my future job. Really brought the statistics and epidemiology classes together in a way that ensured I would be able to analyze data independently in the future.",
    "excellent course overall. should be required for all MPH students. I think the first few lectures could go a little faster. maybe adding a lecturer on formatting\/labeling. I think we went over this once in lab but my mind was preoccupied with learning the lab and SAS. Robyn Cree made excellent review slides before the midterm and final. it would be great if these could be posted. I think going over correct and incorrect interpretations of data and what are considered good\/bad summaries of tables would be very helpful.",
    "My absolute favorite course this semester. Excellent course about SAS applications for public health problems and the professor and TAs are very thorough in their grading and assessments so the students become very att stove to necessary details. Must take.",
    "The whole class exists within the labs. Labs need to be longer so that it is not a mad dash to get the code down but so that we can take time understanding what we are actually doing. The lecture is important but there has to be more practice time given how important the topic is.",
    "Helped apply many analytical methods needed to write up a manuscript. It is an essential class for anyone going into research as a career.",
    "This is a great course! You learn to use SAS hands-on and the methodology of why you use certain procedures and analyses. The lectures themselves are a bit dry, but to no one's fault other than it's hard to learn a practical application from slides; perhaps live-coding could be incorporated into the lecture portion to see the slide information in action.",
    "I really really really like this course though it is really challenging. This course is very interesting and helpful for our future study. It's not related to SAS programming, but also statistics, which is a great change for us to connect our theories into real problems.",
    "It's very practical. I think it will be better if the lecture can be real time computer demonstration.",
    "Pardon my french, but this is the best fucking course at YSPH. Dr. Desai is incredible; he made a subject that should be super boring extremely interesting and engaging. Skills learned are very practical, useful, and applicable. Labs were great illustrations of class concepts.",
    "Greatly valuable.",
    "good resources and material; nice overview of coding and presenting data",
    "I'm still unsure of what I'm doing when it comes to SAS.",
    "This was an excellent course. The lectures and assignments were well designed to help us learn and the professor was well-prepared and engaging. Everything was taught very efficiently. I did find the slides harder to understand as reference material, though. You really had to take good notes in lecture because the slides weren't always clear (they were definitely just visual aids for the lecture.)",
    "I am not a SAS pro at all. I do not have any biostats background, so this course was a little hard for me. But it was certainly a great skill to have. It was also very well organized and very well taught. Very systematic, organized, with clear crisp notes and explanations.",
    "The main thing wrong with this class is that SAS is a piece of crap designed in the 70s, and both has terrible usability for a working professional, and next to no didactic value. A big part of this class is learning how to use a shitty tool. So, excellent job with that part of the material, but I want YSPH (and PH as a whole, and software companies serving PH) to get a clue and invent a better tool.",
    "The course was great. I was a little worried at the beginning of the semester as I felt my knowledge of SAS was lacking, but now feel so comfortable with SAS and would absolutely love to take more courses that build upon this knowledge. Mayur's lectures really provided such a solid foundation of how to go about understanding and analyzing data, and the lab assignments really applied everything we learned in class to \"real world\" situations.",
    "Strengths: Really taught me how to use SAS. Weaknesses: None that come to mind Improvements: Offer it in the fall semester.",
    "AAMIE was a great course! I definitely feel like I learned a lot and developed a skill that will be useful in my future career and in my current research work. The course was challenging at times and a lot of effort was necessary, but I would not change a thing!",
    "Strengths- makes SAS actually make sense, and reinforces concepts learning in Epi and Biostats, which helps solidify general public health knowledge. Areas for improvement: this would require kind of a radical change, but I'm not sure how helpful learning about SAS in a large lecture is, and then having just an hourlong lab session, since the labs are the most helpful parts (to provide feedback). Would love for the lab sections to be much longer, and maybe the lecture itself to be shorter, so we can learn about a concept, and then practice it on SAS immediately afterwards, then learn a little more, then practice a little more...",
    "This course was amazing! I loved the format of each week, each lab, and the midterm\/final.",
    "Not a fan of the grading scheme, it seems a little harsh to drop a person from an H to a HP just for one mistake.",
    "I found the course to be overall incredibly useful an applicable to my other classes and work. I unfortunately did find myself frustrated with the scope of our homework assignments. I feel as though an opportunity was missed to discuss the impact of scientific writing and dat interpretation in academia. Occasionally our homework assignments asked us to summarize tables in statements that read something to the effect of \"X race has ___ times the odds of unethical behavior as compared to Z race.\" While this was what was asked of us I felt that this was a strange hanging sentence. I wanted some instruction on how to publish information like this in a responsible way. While most academic papers stay within the homogenous PubMed reader-body I questioned the impact of a statement like this in general media. I would have loved to have had more discussions in class about not only applied analytics but applied writing and effective and responsible communication in epidemiological studies.",
    "not sure how this course will help me in the future.",
    "Great course--I felt much more comfortable with the SAS software as a result of taking this course.",
    "This is the most helpful class at YSPH in terms of learning and understanding SAS code as well as statistical analysis and interpretation. I honestly think this should be the first experience with SAS - why on earth are we waiting until the second semester to learn what a libname statement is? Slides are not annotated particularly well. I would like to see more examples of how to interpret and present the data as a reference.",
    "Really loved this course. Taking a quantitative class among my more 'qualitative' courses is always refreshing. Really enjoyed learning more about the nuts and bolts of SAS, being refreshed in statistical methods, and having to really think through coding. Really thankful for the course and feel much more confident in quantitative analysis because of it.",
    "Very useful course. One must be careful to follow in class and grab basic concepts. Mayur is an enormous resource.",
    "no weaknesses. Much more fun than BIS 505 and even learn more statistical knowledge with the hands-on SAS practice.",
    "It would have been helpful to have more information on analytical interpretation during lecture\/on lecture slides",
    "Very helpful in introducing SAS and statistical analysis methods.",
    "I thought this class was excellent. I learned a lot and feel like I have a better mastery over SAS.",
    "Learning skills directly applicable to own projects and work.",
    "strengths - taught in a way that makes the application of the material in real life very clear. My coding skills became much stronger and I feel that I was able to apply them in other classes as well. weakness - the time and duration of the class. It is hard to sit and pay attention for that long at that time of day, especially on Mondays, which are typically filled with classes. Might be better in 2 shorter parts.",
    "Great course and overall great course organization. It would be helpful to provide more hands on practice during lecture if those resources became available. I think YSPH should offer more courses similar to this, as well as an advanced AAMIE course (with similar structure- it sounds like existing courses with such a name have very different structure than AAMIE).",
    "I really appreciated the fundamentals of SAS portion of the course. I like the fact that we're given the code to do the analyses in class. Writing new code is difficult and we all appreciate having the code in front of us to manipulate as necessary. As the course continued and we became more comfortable doing the basics in SAS, we simply continued learning new procs, most of which we had some exposure to in the concurrent biostats course, so nothing terribly intriguing in the later portion of the course. My biggest concerns for this course were the way class and lab time was structured. I feel that this material should be largely self-driven; that we go at one pace and that some students will be well above it and some well below it. This is problematic for labs, where the whole lab rushes to copy the text the TA types up front without conceptualizing what is going on. Whatever the TA codes is going to be right, we all know that, so rather than think through things ourselves in this time, we end up just copying the screen. I suppose though that there is still considerable amount of time spent after lab tweaking and perfecting the code, but I often found the lab structure silly. Combined with the fact that we have to sit through these long lectures about coding in SAS which is tedious, although Prof. Desai does an excellent job livening the material as best he can, I'd say a time distribution is in order. More time should be spent doing longer lab exercises. There are a lot of concepts we cover in class that are never addressed in lab. My suggestion is that the class meet twice a week and lab meet once a week. The labs should be longer in terms of the assignment itself, but also in terms of contact time with the TAs.",
    "Useful course. Had a lot of basics and tricks to using SAS that are not taught in most biostatistics courses.",
    "While the workload for this course was hefty during certain weeks, I thought this course was, for the most part, very fair. The final exam, on the other hand, was not fair at all. I understand that take-home exams are generally longer than in-class exams, but this take-home final exam was exceptionally long and tedious. Even though we had one week to complete the final exam, we have other final assignments and exams to prepare for. I had to spend less time studying for other exams just to complete this final. I feel that the length of this final exam should be comparable to that of the midterm take-home exam, which was not too long or short."

    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Mayur is a wonderful lecturer and professor. It takes a special person to make SAS statistical approaches sound and seem engaging, but somehow he manages to do it! He is a fair professor and grader, and seems intentional about the way he has taught and sets out the course. Lecturers like those of Epi 2 and Biostats from this professor should consult with him to learn better ways to teach with students - because he has got it down to a science. Thank you for a great semester in AAMIE, no better person to teach us confused first years about SAS coding.",

    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Fantastic. Knowledgable but adds a fun spin to the class",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0I think he is an acquired taste. Much better one on one than in a large classroom setting where he often lost me. His grading methods were very confusing and because they were based on points LOST not points GAINED - it was not only confusing but discouraging and backwards.",

    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Dr. Desai is great! He covers the material extensively and when learning a new topic, he seemingly covers all the permutations of results possible so you really get to know what you are seeing in the results and how to best interpret outputs. He's very approachable and great at explaining what can be pretty dense topics.",

It also took awhile to get the midterms back, so the feedback on it wasn't as useful as it could have been.",

    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Although I didn't engage much with Dr. Desai, I really appreciated how much thought and detail he poured into the lecture notes\/slides and walking us through things step by step. I think it's challenging to teach coding because it's not the most riveting material. But I think he regularly attempted to make it interactive. Would perhaps recommend using clickers and going through some examples that way, if possible, to help inspire more engagement perhaps.",

    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0great teacher and Mentor!",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Professor Mayur is great. He lectures in a very clear and organized way. He is also entertaining, making it easier to pay attention to material that is dry by nature.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Great professor, one of the few who could manage to make a lecture about statistical programming software fun. I would have appreciated having set office hours, as getting a response by email was not always efficient and some questions are better suited for a professor than TAs. In general, amazing TA selection (Biostats courses could take a note from how engaging the AAMIE TAs are), though certain TAs emailed section with specific helpful tips for a given lab, leaving other sections led by different TAs at a disadvantage without having the same guidance. I would suggest that it become routine for any clarification emails sent by TAs to be sent to the entire course, not just their sections, as other sections likely had the same questions.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0He brings plenty of energy and knowledge to the subject. He's well prepared and cruises through the material without problem. My concerns were mainly lack of contact time- class was cancelled because of instructor travels and several classes were let out early. In some ways is seemed like there wasn't quite enough material for the whole semester. My second concern is that exams took forever to grade, presumably because he does them all himself- which has its merits- but when exams are returned weeks later it's hard to recall the exercise and figure out what to do differently and learn from one's mistakes.",

    "Very good. Highly recommend",
    "I recommend it to all the students who want to learn SAS with basic statistic knowledge. Very useful and practical.",
    "Great course for anyone seeking to gain practical skills in data analysis and epidemiology",
    "highly recommended. great teaching. great lab experience. practical skills for public health.",
    "There's a reason AAME is often cited as people's favorite class. It is practical and comprehensive in using SAS for epi analyses. Especially if you take Epi II the same semester (for CDE and SBS), I think you get very proficient with the kind of analyses public health research does on a day-to-day basis. It also covers more basic and universal topics like data management and how to clean and thinking about data values.",
    "Definitely, it's such an amazing course. The course is well structured and very helpful for your thesis. Must have it!!!!!!!",
    "Recommend even if it's not your required course. very practical and useful.",
    "Take it. It's the best course here.",
    "A valuable course and necessary for finding a job.",
    "Required course that should definitely be completed in the first year. You familiarize yourself with SAS and learn to create excellent result tables.",
    "Highly recommended. Everyone in every concentration should take this course.",
    "a bit hard but a great skill to have. Created really well. Dr. Desai is great at teaching it.",
    "SAS is a turd. This class will teach you how not to gag while dealing with that turd. As long as brain-damage that is learning SAS is a requisite part of PH practice\/research, I recommend this class. But if you foresee using tools other than SAS in your future, lean on YSPH to offer this class with those tools in mind, rather than inflicting SAS on you.",
    "I would absolutely recommend it to another student. I think gaining insight into how to better understand and analyze data is an invaluable skill regardless of what area of public health someone finds themselves in.",
    "Take it. If you ever need to use SAS, this is the class to take to learn it.",
    "Even if it's not required, you should still take it to feel more comfortable on SAS.",
    "If you want to learn SAS, take this course!!",
    "AAMIE is an invaluable course. I recommend this to all YSPH students who want to learn how to effectively analyze the heart of epidemiological research.",
    "Well worth your time. You'll come out of it with a better understanding of SAS and of statistics. Highly recommended.",
    "Great, great course. Would recommend it to anyone, regardless of their coding proficiency.",
    "Very useful course. It requires more effort, but can be exciting as well.",
    "Highly recommended to all YSPH students",
    "This course is a great introduction of research methods. Highly recommend it.",
    "Yes, I would highly recommend this course to another student. It was the most beneficial class I took this semester.",
    "Excellent course. Will help tremendously for thesis preparation.",
    "Great class!!! This may be the most useful class I've taken at YSPH - you learn a lot of skills you'll be able to apply to other classes\/thesis\/future jobs. Mayur is a great and entertaining lecturer. The sections are helpful for learning the material well. There is a decent amount of work but it also felt productive rather than like busy work. The take home midterm and final are also nice because they help you to feel like you've mastered the material.",
    "Definitely recommend to future students, and would like YSPH to offer more similar courses.",
    "A course dedicated to SAS. Data interpretations that piggyback on Principles of Epi I. The fundamentals and a number of useful procs in SAS which should cover a job portion of analyses you'll have to perform in the near future and beyond.",
    "Very useful if you will be using SAS to clean or organize data."
