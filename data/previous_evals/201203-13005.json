   "comments": [
    "The course is essentially an in-depth discussion series of epistemic topics in belief, including how to define belief and what categories of belief exist. I would certainly recommend this course, thanks mainly to Professor Whittle's and DeRose's great discussion style and the course content.",
    "I wouldn't recommend this class if you really want to learn something, but if want to exercise a different mode of thought, this would be a good bet.",
    "I recommend it, but be prepared for much of the discussion to be over your head. The grad students and professors really dominated the discussion, and oftentimes the undergrads did not know what was going on. That said, I learned a ton from the course and enjoyed it. I probably should have taken at least one epistemology class beforehand, however.",
    "Each week you read really specific philosophy papers about a particular aspect of belief. The next week, you read really specific philosophy papers about a different aspect of belief. That's just about it. If that's the type of thing you're into, it's pretty great. That definitely is not the type of thing I am into, but I thought it was pretty great anyway.",
    "In addition to my previous comments, which are quoted below, I would say that I think everything about the course is great for someone who really does have an interest in the material. However, the title might mislead some unfamiliar with the context in which the various debates are occurring. For this reason, I think that it is worth reading and skimming a few papers before taking the course. Make sure the class is addressing the kinds of questions about belief that you might be interested in. Here is my earlier response:\"This was an excellent course. I came to it as a Philosophy major senior, with very few M&E courses except DeRose's introductory PHIL 270 - Epistemology. The course managed to keep discussion and philosophizing to a high level throughout which meant some rather challenging papers and discussions but after a while it was easy to get a handle on the jargon and concepts. Very interesting material, and taught by two really clear, entertaining, and incredibly sharp instructors.\"",
    "The two professors really work well with each other, facilitating good discussion about a topic that you've never thought this much about. Not too much reading, but the reading is interesting. Pretty much a fun discussion group on belief.",
    "Belief is an excellent philosophy seminar, perfect for senior majors. Non-majors may be ok, but should note that this is not at all about religion or anything like that. A great course, which I thoroughly enjoyed."
