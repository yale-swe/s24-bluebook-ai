   "comments": [
    "114 is a great class. The workload is not too bad and it will definitely help your writing. I wish that we got to discuss and read more on censorship and the arts, but it still was interesting.",
    "If you are going to take a writing seminar, take this one. It is low stress and the topic of Censorship and the Arts never gets dry. Robinson, while he talks a good amount, is hilarious and makes the class very chill. Although he can be unclear with instructions, he is helpful and his grading is really fair.",
    "If Professor Robinson is teaching, I highly recommend that you take the class, or at least shop it. Professor Robinson is very funny and witty, and he's also pretty flexible when it comes to meeting with him outside of class to discuss essay topics, etc. As for his actual teaching, I've found his comments on my papers to be pretty helpful. He's good at finding logical errors, so you really learn how to make a solid, well-supported argument in his class.",
    "Great course. Take it!",
    "Easy. Little improvement in my writing. Get another section.",
    "I would recommend this seminar. The assigned readings and topics were interesting, and in such a small class made for really good discussions. You will get as much out of this class as you put in; do the readings and meet with writing tutors and the professor even though it might not seem necessary.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student. It improved my writing, wasn't that time consuming in terms of homework and we always laughed and had fun."
