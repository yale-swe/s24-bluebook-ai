    "This was the first philosophy class that I ever took...bad decision. Although I thought many of the topics were interesting it quickly became a mess.TAKE IT CREDIT D-Fail. I thought about doing this, I didn't, awful awful life choice. If your a philosophy wiz you'll be fine but for the rest of us...",
    "Philosophy of art is a fantastic class that asks questions about the nature and ethics of art and expression. It isn't an aesthetics class, necessarily, but it also isn't a history of art class. Be prepared to read lots of real philosophical texts, from Plato to Kant to Nietzsche to Adorno, etc. as well as art criticism and art-specific philosophy. Absolutely take it if you are interested in human culture AT ALL. It is well worth your time.",
    "yes- I've been able to apply what I've learned in this course to so many other fields of knowledge",
    "If you choose the right section with a great TF, then go for it.",
    "Gilmore is fantastic, but the readings got especially painful. You aren't expected to do all of them, but that doesn't change how painful they are.",
    "Great class to take CR\/D if you at all interested in art or philosophy (though it's a lot more \"art\" than \"philosophy\"). Fun lectures, interesting readings (for the most part), three assignments.",
    "Yes take it",
    "It's not that much work and really interesting. readings are manageable and all online! Clear, interesting, engaging lectures. 2 long-ish papers and a really low-stress take home final. If you're interested in art at all, I would highly recommend it. If you're not interested in art, well... there are probably better options for you out there.",
    "good class, definitely take if you're interested in philosophy and\/or art, but if not into either, then it might be pretty boring.",
    "I would definitely recommend it. Seriously, take it if you are at all interested in art.",
    "This is a loosely-organized class that covers some basic topics in the philosophy of art. It's not well-organized or rigorous, but professor Gilmore can make you laugh.",
    "Very enjoyable and interesting. Professor Gilmore is a great lecturer although it sometimes feels frustrating that we don't get to the bottom of things in lecture -this is because we go through so many topics quickly. The readings are great and I think that, especially through writing the essays, I learned an immense amount about the philosophy of art this semester.",
    "This was an absolutely amazing class. At the beginning the reading was both extensive and slightly intimidating, but as the course progressed, the readings became more manageable. The readings were also definitely worthwhile in augmenting my experience during lecture and section. Professor Gilmore is a wonderful lecturer and made even relatively dry topics interesting. If you enjoy thinking about art or philosophy, this is a wondering and not particularly taxing class and I would recommend it absolutely.",
    "This is the kind of class everyone should take for their personal culture. It just so happens it's well taught and not a lot of work. If you're the kind of person who's ever listened to a great song or seen a great painting and thought \"damn, how did they do that?\", definitely take it.",
    "Do not take it, unless they totally restructure the course.",
    "Philosophy of Art is a collection of engaging lectures on various topics that, while they do not come together into any sort of narrative defining the course as a whole, will be of interest to anyone interested in questions about nature of art and its value. Professor Gilmore is a very good speaker and explains philosophical issues in a style that is clear and succinct, offering compelling examples of pieces- mostly visual artworks- that apply to the concepts at hand. The readings vary greatly in length and difficulty; some weeks are lighter whereas others are overwhelming. Overall, the class is interesting but not entirely satisfying- I found that I was waiting for something more.",
    "If you're interested in art, then this is a great course to offer a new angle of approaching art.",
    "Not for everyone, if you think you're interested in the topic maybe take it credit D. But certainly not a bad class by any stretch of the imagination.",
    "I would recommend this class if you are not expecting a formal and systematic philosophy course. It is very abstract and irrelevant at some points; however, the lectures are good and it is worth it if you do the readings.",
    "The course engages in very interesting material but the readings can be very difficult to wade through alone. While the lectures were fluffy, relaxing, and perfectly pleasant, they in no substantial way helped me gain better understanding of the material. Gilmore offered very little insight into the philosophies discussed, and instead just raised further broad questions in a seemingly unstructured manner.",
    "Phil of Art was a great course in terms of subject content - the lectures were very interesting and Professor Gilmore does a great job of explaining even confusing content. I was slightly frustrated by the way the syllabus was set up - two papers, neither until the end of the semester and then a take-home final a week later. Hopefully this will be changed in the future. If you are interested in the content on the syllabus, and enjoy the first few lectures, definitely take this class - worth it, will give you a new perspective and serious appreciation for art!",
    "Great lectures. Gilmore is very witty. Two very manageable assignments plus a take-home final.",
    "Interesting material. Gilmore's lectures are awesome but he doesn't use slides or lecture notes so you have to pay attention. you'll be glad if you do.",
    "I think that this is not a good class for someone with no background in philosophy or art history. The lectures are great, but if you've never written a philosophy paper before or analyzed philosophy before, you will have a lot of trouble. I'd suggest that you take the class Credit\/D\/Fail or audit it, especially if you're a freshman or someone with not background in philosophy. Otherwise, there were compelling lectures and interesting subjects covered, but I wouldn't recommend this to another student unless they were majoring in it or had a specific interest in the subject\/class.",
    "YES! i took the class because i wanted to learn about art without having to take an art history course. this is so fascinating, and going to lecture never felt like a chore. take it! also, even though it's a lot of reading, you have freedom to read and realluy learn about the things that interest you",
    "This course is a fine, if a bit pointless, survey of the philosophy of art. I think it speaks more to the weakness of Yale's art history and philosophy art departments than anything else.",
    "Every civilized person should think about the questions covered in this course. Take it.",
    "Good if you like the subject. You should probably avoid it until sophomore year at least; if you want to cut your teeth on philosophy, there are other classes you should start with.",
    "Take it as a seminar!",
    "Yes",
    "This probably should have been the best course of my semester, but unfortunately it wasn't. Here are three of the reasons I had trouble with it:1) The first 2\/3 of the course was definitely the strongest. All the lectures and readings were interested, we kept hitting the major questions of aesthetics -- why I took the course in the first place. Then it felt like we sort of ran out of topics at some point, and started hitting these insular, one-week lessons on topics like depiction, evolution, and censorship. The class became a lot more disjointed and a lot less interesting around then.2) I felt that Professor Gilmore's treatment of some of the subject matter was not always as thorough as I wanted it to be. He tends to take for granted that art is a worthwhile discipline with plenty of self-evident virtues, but one of the reasons I wanted to take this course was to be convinced of that. I felt that Gilmore was a bit dismissive of any argument that characterized art as elitist.3) The assignments weren't very well thought-out. The paper topics for the first two assignments weren't great, and the topics for the take-home final were just the paper topics re-listed, which was sort of lame.This class was definitely fascinating at times, and I don't regret taking it. It just should have been better than it was.",
    "Great course. I'd recommend taking it, its exactly what you'd expect, a lot of philosophy and the aesthetic\/moral\/ontological considerations that exist in art. Gilmore is the man.",
    "YES. The lectures are fantastic. Professor Gilmore touches on topics that are interesting to any educated person. He draws on contemporary art, art history, literature and popular culture. This is one of those classes that makes you feel like a smarter person. The section can be kind of mixed, but it's worth it for the lecture. We were supposed to have two 6-8 page papers and a take-home final, but for some reason, had two 10 page papers and the take-home final all within the last month and a half of class.",
    "This is a good class for students interested generally in the Humanities. At times, it has the rigor of a philosophy course and at others it is much more general in its approach.",
    "Way too much reading, even though only around half of the readings on the syllabus were actually assigned. Gilmore was a decent professor, though his ability to keep the class' interest waned as the semester progressed. I'd recommend it only if you're really into philosophy; I was more into art than philosophy, and I feel as though the class wasn't really for me. The class delved too far into abstraction - at certain points during the semester I wondered why anyone actually would take the time to ponder the questions raised in class.",
    "Wonderful class! Gilmore is an amazing lecturer! The readings are not too onerous, and lectures are not difficult."
