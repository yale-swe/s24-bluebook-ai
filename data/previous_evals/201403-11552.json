    "This course has a lot of potential, but the learning is bogged down by assignments which overburden the students, and take attention away from the readings and in class discussion. I found myself constantly trying to keep pace with the h\/w assignments, and as a result, I had no chance to digest anything in the readings or class. In effect the professors were 'competing' to get their material in the course. We are graduate students, and there is no need to force feed us silly exercises. It is one thing to assign a causal loop diagram or mass balance exercise for a small system. This can be a useful lesson. To ask students, however, to do the latter for the entire system is just going overboard, and takes away from the real lessons.",
    "Q 12 -- My interest in the course was more about systems evaluation than the specific water management subject matter, so while I also found the subject interesting, it is not directly relevant to my area of study.",
    "Really good lectures. #3 The material flow project was too much work. Just... way too much. The concept was REALLY new to a lot of students, and it's too much to have everyone do the whole system. It would have been impossible to do most of the the projects without the reading and resources given to us (finding numbers and values for NYC). The final project is really unecessary. It isn't really an culmination of what we've learned. It's just us picking a new topic and doing the same old stuff in our groups.",
    "This was easily my least favorite course of the semester. I was promised to be taught how to approach a problem from many situations, instead, for every assignment, I just used my previous knowledge. Assignments were lengthy and time consuming. Too much emphasis was placed on upper watershed when the final paper was supposed to be all-encompassing.",
    "14, 16, 17, 19",
    "That deadline extension on the final assignment was a blessing and a curse. In my group, we really strove to get things done ahead of schedule so that we weren't stressed as deadlines approached. Unfortunately, only 2 of the 3 group members agreed with this approach. A task will tend to expand to fill the amount of time allot to complete it. This was the case on the final assignment. I am against deadline extensions (save for extenuating circumstances), and think that it reflects poorly on the individuals who require them. We should be able to manage our time and responsibilities effectively enough to get things done in the original time allotted. People who will succeed will find a way to get things done on time. If the course structure remains the same, I would recommend adjusting the way the points are allotted among the assignments. Too much weight was given to the final paper, and not enough was given to the mass balance project, especially given how much time the respective projects demanded. Perhaps a split of 25 and 25 points? I know we are told that the grades \"don't matter\", but some people take very seriously those little fractions we get at the bottom of our returned assignments...",
    "Zimmerman - Initially, I was very excited when I found out she was teaching the course. I feel she does some fascinating work and was eager to learn about it. I was very disappointed after just a couple of her lectures. She was condescending to the classroom and asked very menial questions, which did not elicit a response from the room (recognize this is a two way street). She belabored CLDs while whizzing through the later section of the course where she actually presented cutting edge technology. Seems like she doesn't have confidence in FES students. Brad - could use less text-heavy slides, but overall great. Thought he asked good question to other speakers and kept discussion moving as much as possible Pete - better energy engaging the class would be helpful",
    "#11 & #12- Had there been a case study from a developing country, I would have rated these higher.",

    "Brad's discussion of financing these massive water infrastructure projects and improvements",
    "Bradford Gentry - Brad was the only one who tried to make this an interdisciplinary class. The other professors rarely got out of their own personal academic silos.",
    "This is a multidisciplinary course that teaches students to think in systems, to collaborate in teams, and to consider methods and solutions that are new.",
    "This course provided a good overview of the types of challenges that managers face with complex systems, and also provided an in-depth discussion of the NYC water system as a case study. Overall, it was a good introduction to the application of systems management.",
    "Good progression of material, from sourcewater, city, and wastewater. Very useful tools (MCDM, CDL, etc.) and assignments that let us learn how to use them. Good panelists.",
    "You can take this course because you are interested in water, or you can take this course because you are interested in learning how to work through the complexities of making policy choices in complex systems with a wide range of stakeholders. For the latter purpose, this course is an excellent learning vehicle.",
    "I liked the integration of subjects and the use of causal loop analysis and multi-criteria decision making. I plan to utilize these techniques in the future.",
    "Learning about the NYC watershed and distribution process",
    "The assignments, field trips, and panel discussions were very helpful.",
    "The assignments were challenging, requiring systemic evaluations and processes that most students were not likely familiar with at the beginning of the course. I found that useful.",
    "I thought the strong emphasis on real world problem solving was fantastic, and I wish all of my classes at FES were as solutions focused. Really liked the format of exploring one system from physical science, technology, financial and legal perspectives. Some students said this made the course feel scattered, but I think this is a accurate reflection of how things are when trying to solve problems in the non-academic world, and very important to be able to navigate.",
    "As a whole the course was great. I enjoyed the group work and the panels.",
    "Group work. This is a skill I want, and I think this class spoke to that very well.",
    "-the co-taught nature of the course. All three professors provided interesting, distinct perspectives on the course material. And, from a more practical perspective, the regular rotation of their presentations kept student engagement high. -the focus on one water system, the NYC water system, which allowed for deeper engagement with the subject matter and a satisfying sense of completion at the end of the course after having analyzed all of the components from start to finish.",
    "The best aspect of the course were the guest lectures and field trip where we met with staff working on water quality and water quantity issues on the ground.",
    "The in-depth look at the NYC water system. The strength of this course, which some will say was also its weakness, was how hyper-focused it was on NYC.",

   "comments": [
    "Some of the project designs were poorly thought out. The multi-criteria decision making exercise, while very applicable to real-world situations was difficult to carry out in the manner the professors wanted. With only two options to compare (build filtration plant vs not build the plant) the decision matrix seemed like a waste of time. For it to be useful I would have liked to see more intermediate options (build it 10 years later, put the decision to a ballot initiative, etc.) Or alternatively, the MCDM assignment could be used to evaluate a different issue with more nuanced options like how to deal with CSOs\/green infrastructure. Whether it happens in this class, or elsewhere (maybe MODs??) it would be nice to have some sort of group-work workshop. We have diverse backgrounds with different expectations for how to act as part of a group.",
    "I'm not sure how a relatively small (in terms of grade) project (Mass Balance) turned into a 2-week, tens of hours, assignment. Why is this worth half the final project when it takes 2-3 times as long to complete?",
    "Structure - reduce the number of assignments, emphasize the readings, and ask for more in-class participation. I wanted to learn more from my peers, but you wouldn't give us a chance to do anything but sit and be talked at.",
    "While the concept of the course is very good, the details (specific assignments, assignment timings, etc) were poorly thought out. Perhaps this is because the instructors try to re-make the course every year. Workload was extremely heavy in the second half of the semester after a light first half. The Mass Balance assignment in particular was an unreasonable workload.",
    "Some of the time devoted to a deeper understanding of the technical details of reservoirs and water infrastructure could have been shortened to allow for more time to explore another case study or discuss management strategies. While a reasonable level of understanding of technical aspects is essential, at times the material seemed more detailed than necessary for this particular course and its assignments. The mass balance assignment may have been more appropriate for the course if the sources of information were provided to make it in to more of a thought exercise (students still perform calculations) rather than an exercise in searching for data. As it was assigned this semester, it seemed more appropriate for a water management hard skills class rather than a class focused on systems thinking and using water management as a case study.",
    "Sometimes seemed unstructured. The field trips were not helpful (with the exception of the NH sewage treatment plant). The professors are not really available to discuss material except right before major assignments. Maybe having a professor \"assigned\" to each group. The workload was too much. Too many group projects, with no instruction on how to work successfully in groups.",
    "There was a lot of confusion about what was expected from the assignments. That may have been intended - a dose of the real world. But it made things difficult at times.",
    "I think it would have been helpful if the lectures were more grouped together by subject so that we could learn each aspect of the NYC water system in more depth. Otherwise, I found the lectures were very interesting. Additionally, I think that the mass balance was an interesting assignment, but that we spent too much time finding the numbers and less time learning how to measure their flows through the NYC water system. If base numbers that should be the same for each group could be provided, that would be most helpful. Lastly, I would love it if we could do another city in the out-of-class assignments throughout the semester. I would find it interesting for each group to pick a different U.S. city and present their findings for the final project at the end of class. Overall, great class!",
    "The course felt very disorganized. The lectures were not very useful and sometimes were not engaging. Also, the power point slides in the presentations were sometimes overloaded with written information and the presenter would go through these extremely fast.",
    "Do not do a mass balance. That type of project could be someone's thesis. There is not enough time in two weeks to do all the research that project entailed. Furthermore, it wasn't even that helpful to our understanding of the system. We could have easily read a paper and had the same understanding.",
    "I often left the lectures unsure of what I had learned. The assignments were much more successful at conveying information. I know that the class is meant to be introductory and provide a tool of parts for us moving forward, but I thought the class time could have been used better to achieve that. As is the lectures felt more like a list of things that I could go back to later if I wished, but Brad, Julie, and Pete are so knowledgeable I would have preferred offering a list online and then going more in depth into 1-2 subjects in each class.",
    "-While it was cool to look at the whole system from watershed to output in the bay, maybe it could be worth exploring looking at 2-3 systems and just doing watershed to tap or just tap to bay. The management objectives for the upstream component and the NYC component seem to be different in a number of ways, and the upstream and downstream components of the course seemed slightly disjointed. I go back and forth though on which approach (1 complete system or 2-3 upstream systems) I think would be better. -Also like the idea of doing the final project on a different system. Most of us will be applying these skills to other systems, and the ability to distinguish between what is transferable between systems and what is unique is an important thing to be able to do.",
    "The coursework was very heavy at the end of the semester and light at the beginning. Would be nice to have a more even distribution.",
    "I would adjust the requirements and\/or guidelines of the materials flow analysis assignment. Based on my conversations with other groups, I sense that many people felt the assignment resulted in long hours of deep dives down informational rabbit holes.",
    "It is difficult to address the needs of all students, and it is unreasonable to ask the professors to be so flexible, but if it were possible to tailor the course to the specific desires of a few groups of students while still hitting the overall goals of the course, many students would find the course more valuable. If the course is about managing water, we should look at places where it is being done badly and develop plans based on those instances. It would be no great success for graduates of FES to go work on a water system that is regarded to be one of the best in the world. The greater contributions can be made in areas that need more help, are more stressed, or lack the level of governance, support, and enforcement that NYC receives. Introduce the broad concept, show the good\/bad about NYC, then look at few cases that need vast improvement and let the students apply what works in NYC to the case studies and see if\/how those solutions would actually work.",
    "course structure and teaching homework - we had so many homeworks that were just variations of the same initial question. By the end, I was over the NYC system. And it is hard to draft a mock-recommendations memo on NYC, when the city is doing everything you are learning about to recommend - needs to have more focus on APPLYING learning elsewhere.",
    "It's such a crap shoot to put so much of the course's value in the hands of a randomly assigned group.",
    "there are too many assignments..that need to be managed better reference materials need to provided as most of time is wasted for data mining",
    "Case Study, Group work, Class Discussions Case Study 1. F&ES is broadening its international student body (this year representing the highest number of international students thus far). 2. Many US Students have been and or aim to continue working internationally and\/or for international organizations. The presence of 1 and 2 suggest that classes such as this one may be improved substantially from broadening its scope to include at least one case study from the developing world. Group work: I think it would have been far more valuable to work in different groups. Working in one group for the entire class limited the interaction and therefore potential learning that could have occurred had there been the opportunity to engage with different people. Discussion: Class discussions could be better facilitated if the class breaks into groups to discuss topics brought up in class.",
    "1. This class is multidisciplinary, not interdisciplinary, which at times made the co-taught lectures feel disjointed. The out-of-class assignments could have been structured in a way that helped synthesize the policy, management, and science aspects of the issue. (The MCDM assignment definitely achieved this, but the mass balance did not) 2. It should be made clear that this class is really most beneficial to those interested in water management. There are lessons applicable outside of this field, but it really takes you into the weeds of water systems. I recognize the need to focus on a specific case study like this to draw lessons from, but I think potentially more effort could be made to draw parallels between water management and other systems-level environmental management challenges. 3. NYC is a good model system, but when we where asked to \"improve\" on their model, we often felt we were coming up short because they are already doing virtually all of the right things (at least that was our impression). It may be helpful to look at systems that have a clear problem with them.",
    "The class will be better if it can provide more information on drinking water system located in other cities or countries.",
    "Instructions for assignments were often unclear. The points each assignment was worth should better reflect the time needed to complete assignments."

    "Partially. I learned systems thinking as it applies to the US and more specifically a city with the available resources to do so. This tool may even be applicable in many aspects to other developed countries with differences in political structure and allocation of resources but transferability to the developing world will prove to be far more complex. I learned invaluable skills but this class would have been far more valuable if it considered a developing country.",
    "Not exactly. I did not expect there to be such an emphasis on gaining a technical understanding of watershed systems, and I felt this occurred at the expense of discussions about techniques or approaches dealing with complicated policy problems.",
    "We discussed about the filtration system and overflow problem in the NYC. Somehow I feel we haven't touched the true problem of the NY drinking water system. Maybe the city's water system is constantly improving so that our suggestion to the systems seems to be irrelevant.",
    "Yes. I felt the final project was a good way to round out the class and I felt prepared to do it based on the earlier content taught in the class."

   "question_text": "If yes, what were the advantages and disadvantages of the group work?",
   "comments": [
    "Advantage is that it took some of the work load off of my own shoulders. Disadvantage is that my group was extremely passive. I feel like half the time that was spent during group sessions was me waiting for someone to provide some input and then my finally saying, \"ok lets do this\".",
    "Advantages - trying to decipher what the hell was expected of us from the professors. Disadvantages - Scheduling conflicts, and different degrees of interest in the class (and consequently differing levels of effort)",
    "I thought the group work was appropriate to allow students to work collaboratively and reduce the workload from some of the assignments by delegating to group members.",
    "Working a group is one of the skills that I think this class is supposed to teach. But the course is too heavily focused on working in groups. At some points I felt like nothing that I turned in was my own work. My final grade won't really reflect MY OWN efforts. Need some instruction in how to work in groups.",
    "This was a fundamental part of the learning experience. No one makes policy on their own - you work in groups or teams. So learning how to work together as a team was very important.",
    "I thought it was helpful to work in groups and learn how to incorporate other people's ideas into a project.",
    "I enjoyed working with my group, I think our personalities were a good match, this made the group work a lot smoother. We were able to exchange ideas on how to tackle the assignments and it made the workload lighter for everyone. Disadvantages are having to constantly find time for everyone to meet.",
    "I liked the group work and would not have changed any of it.",
    "Sometimes group members are less cooperative and considerate than they should be.",
    "Doing things in teams was tough (way tougher than any team work I have in the professional world, for some reason). The group work compelled us to balance managing across, where we try to influence people over whom we have no control, and peer empowerment, where we try to support and nurture our colleagues ideas is ultimately a very valuable exercise. Good to learn to balance the two.",
    "Great.",
    "Group work is what I wanted to learn about the most in this class. This was the major advantage of the class.",
    "Although working in groups felt, at times, time consuming and inefficient, I appreciated the course's emphasis on group work, as I know that projects in the \"real world\" are usually accomplished in such a fashion. It emphasized the importance of clear communication and setting objectives for meetings.",
    "Not everyone approaches group work in the same way. I was frustrated by group members who preferred to wait until the final days\/hours to complete projects, leaving no room\/time for revisions or improvements. Not being willing to make personal concessions for the group hindered our collective ability to work efficiently, especially on the final two projects. We all have other things to work on, but group work, where you have responsibilities to others, should take precedent over individual work where others aren't depending on you. Advantage: Splitting up the workload to allow for more in depth exposure\/learning about a particular point Dis: Splitting up the work can result in learning \"too much\" about one thing and \"nothing\" about another. While there is some comparison to having to work with a group in the \"real world\", usually there would be a manager who would be available to help facilitate productivity in the workplace. While it would have been an option to go to the professors and ask for intervention, it would not have been worth the ramifications of having to deal with an \"incident\" for the next 3 semesters at FES.",
    "advantages - share the workload disadvantages - some group members were not as committed and competent as others",
    "Group projects were interesting. Randomly assigned groups are rough. Free riders abound.",
    "Advantages: We learned each others work and communication styles. Being in only one group is representative of what could possibly happen in the real world. Disadvantages: Being in only one group restricts communication and active learning with other classmates.",
    "Helped fill in gaps in knowledge and made otherwise unmanageable workloads more manageable. Group work always comes with its challenges but figuring out how to coordinate and manage the folks in my group (some needed more management than others) was a good learning experience.",
    "The group work allowed for me to think critically about NY's water issues and expand on my communication skills."

   "question_text": "For students who might consider taking this course, what advice would you give them?",
   "comments": [
    "You should take it. The instructors seemed to always be fine-tuning the structure of the course, but this is not a bad thing! They are responsive, knowledgeable, and engaging.",
    "Do more of the projects individually, you will learn more and be able to focus your work on the interests that you have.",
    "Don't.",
    "If you're not interested in water infrastructure, you will not like this class. It teaches a lot of useful tools and techniques that aren't topic specific, but those skills can be picked up in other courses.",
    "take the course",
    "Make sure you are truly interested in the topic and be open to group work",
    "Don't take it unless you know that you want to work in the NYC watershed. The information you learn in this course is pretty unhelpful in basically every other watershed.",
    "Be aware that you are on a team for the entire semester, and that can be good or bad depending on how your team functions. Also, the readings are extensive, but you don't really need to do most of them to complete the assignments and learn the material.",
    "Definitely take the course and take it seriously. For the group work everyone should start by saying what it is that they are good at and want to contribute to the team over the course of the semester.",
    "Definitely take the class, these are great Professors and they do a good job of integrating the different pieces together (science, policy, finance and stakeholder engagement)",
    "You are going to spend a lot of time and energy focused on one topic or idea. Make sure you are interested, or get interested in some way or another. If water isn't your thing, then apply the issues that managers face (federal oversight, stakeholder engagement, etc.) to wherever your interests lie.",
    "hope you get a good group!",
    "If the class structure will remain the same (only US focused), I would advise others who are considering this class to only take if they are okay with only US applicability. Start assignments before they are assigned.",
    "Be aware that you'll probably get more out of it if you are actually interested in learning about water management. Otherwise, I wouldn't say don't take it, but think carefully about your reasons for taking it and try to talk to students that have taken it.",
    "If you want to learn about the process of decision making in the environmental management, this class will be an ideal one to take. If you want to learn more about water management, this class may only serve as an introductory course.",
    "Be prepared for group work!",
    "Prioritize the reading from day 1 and with the assignments and final project in mind."
