    "Anthropology of Art is a great chance to explore the Art Gallery, and to get to know the collection in a really different way; I highly recommend this class to anyone who has ever wondered how museums work, especially the kind of person who reads all the labels whenever they visit one! However, you should be prepared to put in plenty of out-of-class time in the gallery, and for a class that requires a great deal of original theorizing and some research, not just reading and synthesizing the texts.",
    "Go to the YUAG every class period and talk about interesting\/ new outlooks on art pieces.Don't really have to do the readings although some of them are pretty interesting.Fun class.",
    "A lot of art and not a lot of anthropology.",
    "Take this class if you have an interest in art history, in museums, and the way art history and museums treat cultural objects.",
    "Yes, I would recommend it, because it's a very fun class, and since it's a seminar, you get to develop pretty good rapport with the rest of the class. This is a good class to make you think, but I don't think it's very necessary for any particular major, unless you're interested in museum curating.",
    "Its a series of intelligent conversations trying to define art. Recommended if that interests you!",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course. It is a great survey of the anthropology of art taught in a great setting-the Yale University Art Gallery. The course included studio visits and great guest lecturers. Professor Odo gives great feedback and is very approachable.",
    "This was an awful class. Everything about it was disorganized, unfocused, and poorly run. While in theory it sounded amazing and could certainly be a fabulous seminar if taught properly, in practice Anthropology of Art was a hot mess. As an anthro major, I was really looking forward to getting into some anthropological approaches to studying art, but was thoroughly disappointed. The class was more museum studies oriented; I don't think it should have even been listed under Anthro. The readings were sometimes irrelevant and either too obscure or overly simple. After barely discussing the readings, we would make trips to the YUAG and wander the galleries. While you do become familiar with various collections in the YUAG, discussion was usually quite random and poorly led. To tell the truth, I still have no idea what the anthropology of art really is or how to speakarticulately about the subject. On the plus side, it was very minimal work. Especially as you didn't have to do the readings. Overall, I would not recommend this seminar.",
    "Lots of reading but you learn so so much!!"
