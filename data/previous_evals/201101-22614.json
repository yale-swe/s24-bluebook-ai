   "comments": [
    "L4 isn't quite a continuation of L3 - at least in my section, the grading was harder and the time spent of grammar was less which was a bad combination. That being said, the readings are more interesting and I definitely feel as though my French has improved as a result of this class.",
    "Learn about French culture around the world and World-War II France while improving your writing and grammar skills.Mme Tremblay was quite good; she won't be teaching in Yale again next year though. The class was 1\/3 going over the grammar and vocabulary homework, 1\/3 discussing the story and so on in a large group around a table, and 1\/3 other things (one-on-one discussion, short compositions not for grades, dictations).The discussions were pretty helpful in helping me to retain my French, but the emphasis on grammar is quite heavy and retreads a lot of old concepts (subjunctive, subordinating conjunctions).",
    "This is what you would expect of a French language course. There is a lot of reading of French fiction, which I found interesting and helpful. Most of the grammar skills could be taught to yourself by paying careful attention to the exercises in the course packet, but it is necessary to go to class tocheck the answers to these exercises and to do listening and speaking practice. There are tests and compositions every 2 weeks, but I thought this amount of writing was a good way to improve my skills.",
    "I would recommend French 140 to another student who really wants to improve their French with a focus on grammar. It was a really helpful class.",
    "A lot of work! But still a great class. Prof. Tremblay is a good professor.",
    "A lot of work, sometimes superfluous, but ya gotta take it if ya wanna learn french, right?",
    "It's a fairly normal language class, which does not differ that much from what you would likely expect going into it. I would recommend it, though perhaps not quite so strongly as I might recommend other classes.",
    "I recommend it. You probably need the requirement anyway.",
    "Fren 140 is a good way to continue learning the language. I would recommend it to someone looking to improve their skills beyond Fren 130."
