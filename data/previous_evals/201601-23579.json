    "Would definitely recommend!",
    "Take the class. It's not hard, there isn't a ton of work, but you'll learn a lot, even if you're not a science major.",
    "I loved this class. TAKE IT! Professor Sargis is phenomenal, approachable, and always willing to offer assistance both in class and out. The main strength of this course is it is taught by Professor Sargis. And I use the word taught purposefully, Unlike some other courses, Prof. Sargis actually teaches his students and provides the tools his students need to evaluate scientific papers and fossil and extant taxa. He is an instructor that I will be recommending to my friends; so be prepared for over populated shopping period classes. Another strength of the course is that students are provided the opportunity to study fossil and extant taxa. The weakness would be that the semester flies by too quickly, for there is so much more you want to learn\/study\/see. (Yes, this is actually a PROBLEM in this course!) Best Science credit to take at Yale.",
    "Even though this is a higher level seminar course, do not be intimidated! Professor Sargis makes the information very approachable, though it can be technical at times. There is only one final paper at the end, so your main goal is to keep up with the readings in order to participate fully in class.",
    "This course is great for students interested in early primate origins. Professor Sargis does a great job making the material accessible and engaging, and the labs are great! You'll learn a lot about dental formulae and general osteology, and you won't even realize it's happening. If you're looking for a class about chimps and humans, know that only one or two weeks focus on them in this class. Instead, a lot of the course centers around analyzing different theories of primate evolution and migration. I learned way more than I anticipated. Definitely a thumbs up.",
    "An overall great class. It was the perfect amount of work and the labs were so much fun.",
    "Definitely recommend for a SC credit. Sargis is really cool and super helpful in labs. Just make sure you study for the quiz and know dental formulas!",
    "Unless you are really passionate about primate evolution, I would describe the course as relatively dry subject material taught in an amazing way. Even if I thought the readings were boring, I always enjoyed discussing them in class and hearing what Professor Sargis had to say about them. His lectures were always informative and interesting, and then the lab component of the class would be great. So cool to get to go around and look at so many actual specimens and apply what you had just read and learned to real life. Overall it's a great class and I would definitely recommend it if it sounds moderately interesting, and if it sounds particularly interesting then definitely take it because you'll love it.",
    "It is an amazing science class if science is not really your thing. It's engaging and interesting while not being overwhelming and daunting. I really loved learning about something so different from what I normally do!",
    "If you can get in\/it fits in your schedule, I would highly recommend that you take this course. Not only does this course offer an excellent review of evolutionary biology principles, it also provides a thorough and balanced account of primate phylogeny. Lab work in this course is genuinely quite fun. I found it refreshing to be in a course where a large proportion of class time is spent analyzing primate morphology through specimens. On that note, there are a variety of very interesting specimens brought in from the Peabody museum. Professor Sargis is an excellent lecturer. I highly recommend that any Yale student take a course with Prof. Sargis.",
    "Attention prospective students: FOR THE LOVE OF HOLY GUACAMOLE, DO YOURSELVES A FAVOR AND TAKE. THIS. CLASS. It is so fascinating, you'll forget how much information you're actually absorbing ! One of my best finds in 4 years of Yale. Practical applications + intellectual stimulation in a great conversational environment. And the professor is the coolest of maybe all Yale professors."
