   "comments": [
    "Yes. You should have a basic understanding of programming and preferably some experience with Matlab before coming to the class. The class is fun and synthesizes a lot of materials from different disciplines, and yet without being overwhelming. The professor and TA are extremely nice to work with. Pick your final project early, and it's best if you can work on a project related to your actual research.",
    "It's a helter-skelter mix of math, biology, and very basic MATLAB coding. Great course in theory, in practice it's alright. Problem sets are a bit redundant, lectures can be interesting. I took it as someone with a strong math and programming background but literally zero biology since tenth grade, and was able to ace the problem sets because they didn't require much knowledge of biology--just MATLAB and some algebra.",
    "An interesting subject, but a boring class. Problem sets are kind of fun, I guess, and don't take too long (considering they comprise 70% of your grade). The 5 billion professors who teach this class are all generally pretty boring and unenthusiastic.",
    "This course is an exposure to the use of modeling in biology. It was really interesting. There are many professors, so you get a broad exposure to the topic, but on at the same time, there sometimes isn't a lot of continuity from one week to the next. There's also a big mix of different backgrounds in the class, from math to bio. If you don't know how to use matlab at the beginning, the first weeks of the class you'll be scrambling to figure it out. You definitely learn a lot in the course, and especially if you're coming from a more biological background, you develop a new modeling skill set that's very useful.",
    "This course covers a large number of topics in present areas of interest. Prof. Emonet taught most of the course, with each of the other 4 professors teaching one week. This format was somewhat disorganized, and the guest lectures often seemed disconnected from the course. Homework often involved MATLAB programming, which is a great skill to develop. The final project was a very unclear assignment, making it difficult to figure out what to do.",
    "I would tell you to take something else.. It wasn't that great.",
    "I was a bio major and what I really loved about the class was how it looked a biology through a completely different lens. I felt like I relearning familiar topics, which was really different and fun for a bio class. However, because I hadn't taken much math at Yale, I didn't get as much out of the class as I would have liked and the structure of the class makes it a little difficult to come out with a \"general understanding\" of things. I've learned how to use MatLab to a moderate extent which is cool but I would definitely be using the things I have learned in this class to understand others who work in this field, not to pursue my own work in systems modeling.",
    "I would absolutely recommend it.The topics are fascinating, and the homework is a lot of fun."
