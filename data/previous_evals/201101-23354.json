    "Great practicum to get some 'real world' experience.",
    "The 'excellence' of the course, as I described it, is entirely contingent on the projects a student is working on. In my case, I had one fantastic project, and one project that was okay. Altogether, the process was very valuable.That said, Jim seems to know how to select projects that will pay off.",
    "This is not a traditional lecture-style class, so take some responses with a grain of salt.Question4: workload was A LOT heavier than other courses. I'm sure everyone will comment on this, and has been for the past couple of years, so I don't understand why it hasn't changed. It should either be a two project\/6 credit course (though I heard that it's impossible to do that if the professor is not tenured...) or a one project\/3 credit class.Question 9: I think it's important to meet clients once in the beginning and once at the end, but it still felt like a lot of traveling. For one project, the final meeting seemed unnecessary, as the client seemed uninterested. Also, the instructor and TA were unclear about what could get reimbursed, and how to do that. So I ended up spending a lot of money on my own for food, metros, etc."

I learned so much from working with clients on real-life, applicable projects that I don't learn in more traditional, lecture-based courses. Not to say that one is better than the other, I just usually get more lecture than practicum.",
    "The projects were terrific and getting to meet leaders at environmental non-profits was an incredibly valuable learning experience.",
    "The chance of working with real projects, with real problems faced by our clients",
    "The opportunity to work for the non profit and is excellent way to prep oneself of consulting work.",
    "The best part of this course is working on a real project with a client and doing research for them. Working with a group is also a great chance to learn from your classmates and taking trips down to DC is a great way to learn how politics work and how the city works too."

   "comments": [
    "Coordination with professor for class time .",
    "Project assignments that are too broad in scope and\/or require a subject expertise that cannot be gained over the course of a single semester. All project designers need to consider the circumstances as they design research questions: students come from very different backgrounds and have big workloads on top of this course.",
    "The workload, it's so much. I felt like I worked more on one project than I did for my entire master's project, and that was just one of the two projects! Either scale down the projects' scopes, or cut one out. There are many other practicum classes at FES to look at for examples, such as the Land Conservation course.",
    "I think other people have said this before but it is perhaps worth saying again that completing one project instead of two would have really raised the quality of our work and possibly our experience. It would also make this class's work-load more manageable and reasonable.",
    "I was really looking forward to learn more about the US political system, but due to issues with the professor not being able to travel to campus, we skipped a lot of class sessions. NO make-up classes",
    "The course scheduling must be reviewed along with the work assigned.",
    "This course is a tremendous amount of work. I think this course should have 1 project, instead of 2, per student so that students can deliver a very high quality report rather than be stretched over two huge projects throughout the semester. It was also challenging to do the projects when the professor didn't give feedback on reports until the end of the semester when there wasn't much time left to make changes and do further research. The professor also should have been more available and responsive."

    "Loved the group work. Really taught you how to schedule and manage your time and communicate with group members.",
    "Standard challenges were difficult, but groups bring perspective to a problem and, ultimately, tend to produce a product that has a sum greater than its parts.",
    "Advantage: divvying up the work, it would have been impossible otherwise.Disadvantage: often times, it ended up being a lot of work anyway, because we had to peer edit each other's sections. THis is because we all think\/write\/cite differently but didn't realize that till after everything was written, so there was a lot of editing. You can't be in control of style, which led to disagreements within one of my groups about how the content should be presented. It is frustrating working with others who are not responsive to emails, don't do an equal amount of work, and show up late or don't show up at all to meetings. But such is group work in general.",
    "It was absolutely essential for our groups to work well together on our projects. I learned a great deal about how to manage time, work with others, and use the strengths of different team members to produce a fantastic product.",
    "It was great, you get learn to work with two groups on two different projects and deal with deadlines and communication. Great experience",
    "Advantages were that you are brainstorming, discussing and working together which makes the work much easier.Disadvantages were that a lot of time spent on group discussion and brainstorming and it was hard bring all the team members to come together.",
    "The group work helped us be able to deliver a high quality report to the client and to cover a large research question with many components. It also allowed us to each specialize in an aspect of the research. Disadvantages were that group work is time-consuming for meetings, and at times group members did not do their portions of the work and so some group members had to do double the work load to make up for this."

    "Take a lighter 4th course--this course will consume your a lot of your time!",
    "Get ready for a lot of work. Make sure your other classes are easy. And start writing as early as possible. Get as much done before spring break as possible.",
    "Take it, much better to take this class than many others on FES. Butpush your Professor for the class sessions. He knows a lot and you should take advantage of it and learn as much as you can.",
    "Its a great class to if you want to do consulting with conservation agencies. A lot of work is done outside of class and time commitment is much more than it seems while prepare yourself of a hectic schedule at the end of the semester (presentation, final report etc).",
    "This is an excellent course and you will learn a lot about policy and current environmental issues such as renewable energy. It's a fantastic chance to work with clients and nonprofit organizations in Washington D.C. and to get to know the city and how policy is formed. You will do a TON of work, especially in the last 4 weeks of the semester. But it's worth it and you end up with a great report written by you and your group members and often this can lead to internship offers and at least some great connections in D.C. The professor was somewhat hard to reach and it took a while to get feedback on reports. Sometimes you'll have to pull double weight in your group. Just be prepared for a very heavy course load and try to jump on the project early in the semester!"
