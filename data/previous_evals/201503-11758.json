    "Dr. Mironenko puts his all into this course and has a unique perspective on discussion, reading, and writing. This course was sometimes too consistently overwhelming - sometimes I just wanted a breathe of air! But I feel that North Korea is very difficult to teach, and Dr. Mironenko is an expert. If you want to strategize about how to learn about a very private country, this course if for you.",
    "It shows you the different lenses you can look at North Korea through. Will also teach you how to think in new ways. Propaganda is not as straightforward as you think and neither is the United States' relationship with North Korea.",
    "Watching movies made or set in North Korea, and then discussing them. Acknowledging things people don't usually acknowledge about North Korea (like there's a reason why people live there, the average North Korean isn't a fanatical dictator, etc.).",
    "Cool, light-workload course. Take it if you're interested in NK, for sure! The readings are quite informative and the films are eye-opening.",
    "Fascinating, odd course. You have to put some work in, but definitely recommended if you're looking for something that's a bit out there."
