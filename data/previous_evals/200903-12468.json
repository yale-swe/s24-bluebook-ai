   "comments": [
    "I would absolutely recommend it. A very interesting look at the political and economic situation in Africa. Not a huge workload.",
    "Yes. Limited amount of work and interesting subject matter",
    "A history of political patterns in Africa. Looks mostly at sub-saharan Africa. This course is not a history of individual African countries, but it does take a close look at a few countries in particular. Yes I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. It sheds a lot of light on an area of the world few too many people know enough about.",
    "Yes, it is a good intro to African politics class to take!",
    "I would recommend this class to another student. While the whole 9 a.m. thing isn't easy to deal with, it is completely worth it.",
    "exactly what the title says. there are little surprises however know that, as usual, is the study of african problems not great successes",
    "yes, it is a low-maintenance course with interesting material, but lectures can be a bit boring.",
    "This is a pretty good class. You will get a solid view of precolonial, colonial, and early postcolonial history, but beyond that you will get a scattered understanding of some specific countries. I thought this was useful having already taken a general African politics class because it was not redundant, but maybe not the best class if you are looking for your basic African history\/politics class.",
    "I would definately recommend this class to another student",
    "We learned about the history of Africa and how that contributed to the current problems that are present in contemporary Africa. It was interesting to see the number of trends that seem to be unique to Africa, and also to look at things from a larger scope. I would recommend this class if a student was looking to get an introduction to contemporary Africa.",
    "Yes, if you do not know too much about Africa, I recommend this class in order to gain a foundation on some prevalent problems.",
    "A broad look at political and governmental questions all over Africa",
    "This class was ALL over the place. Not really that enjoyable or informative.",
    "For anyone really interested in African politics, this class is way too basic. Simon's lectures were great and many of the readings were compelling, but sections focused on sorting out very basic questions (ie. what was the reading about?) rather than discussing more complex questions (ie. how can this idea be applied to various regions of Africa? is it indeed applicable?). I would recommend taking a different course for anyone thats looking for more than a very basic overview of African politics. I would recommend taking a different course for anyone thats looking for more than a very basic overview of African politics.",
    "A good basic overview of Africa and it's history and current political problems. Comes across as a bit doom and gloomy, but you feel good at the end for understanding why these things happen. Learning about Africa is a great thing to do if you like political philosophy, because Africa is a laboratory for testing all sorts of political theories. Hobbes was writing about the English civil war of the 1600's,and obviously the state of nature is hardly accessible in Europe today. But look at Somalia today - there it is! And this class will help you think about why Somalia (or anywhere) is the way it is, and what there is to do about it.You barely do any work in this class, so that's a plus or a minus depending on your perspective. Do not buy any of the textbooks other than the Dowden one, which you should read in its entirety because it's really good!",
    "I would highly recommend this course to anyone looking for a general introduction to African politics. I had never taken an Africa-focused class before and so the broad nature of the course material worked well for me. However, I would imagine that this course might be too simplistic for people who have already taken more detailed courses in African studies. Prof. Simon is very nice and readily acknowledges some of the problems of trying to have a class that makes some generalizations about an entire continent. The course requirements are reasonable as well: two short papers, a midterm and a final. The reading load is reasonable and the articles are directly discussed in sections. If you take this course, make sure to attend lectures regularly, because the lecture slides posted online provide much information unless you can supplement them with good class notes.",
    "Good class for learning what is plaguing africa. It completely ignores northern Africa though. It would be more aptly named sub-Saharan African politics",
    "Nice broad-based introduction to African politics. It's for people who are afraid to talk about \"Africa.\" As for exams, pay attention in lecture.",
    "I would definitely recommend it to someone who knows very little about Africa and wants a good overview of many of the current issues.",
    "It's a good overview with minimal work. You also only have to do about 1\/2 the assigned reading to get by well.",
    "It's a good class if you're highly interested in the politics and government of modern African states. If you aren't, though, you'll be bored.",
    "It is a class which broadly covers the political situation in Africa, taking into account historical factors but mostly focusing on current events.",
    "NO NO NO do NOT take this course. It was one of the worst classes I have taken at Yale. I came into the course not knowing anything about Africa and I left not knowing anything about Africa. It was too broad of an overview of a select number of topics. We did not learn enough about individual countries. Professor Simon is a terrible lecturer. He rambles on and on and does not explain things well. Class is also very boring. Section was not good either. Professor Simon and the TAs have way too high expectations for grading. For instance to get all the points on a short answer you can't just answer the question correctly, you have to go above and beyond and give an excellent answer. The papers are also graded harshly. There are so many other better political science course, do not waste your time on this one.",
    "yes, a good polisci class, not too too much work, the papers are really minor and not that bad to write, interesting subject wish there were more polisci classes on it",
    "yes take it for sure, it's very interesting!"
