    "If the student in very interesting in theoretical physics or particle physics, this course is a must; otherwise, it is painful.",

    "I would recommend it.",

   "comments": [
    "It provided me with my first exposure to QFT, and it made me excited to take further courses in particle theory.",
    "I've already been able to understand a lot more of some phenomenology courses.",
    "I had taken an introductory class on QFT before, but this helped to make many concepts much clearer. My research is very tied to the topics discussed in the course.",
    "It deepened my knowledge, not sure how it contributes to my dissertation\/research other than giving me a better idea about physics.",
    "Although this course is not required for my field (Astro\/cosmology), I feel like this course greatly expanded my physics knowledge. I took the class for general interest and I am glad I did."
