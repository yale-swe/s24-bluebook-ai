   "comments": [
    "I learned about sound theory, media theory and the theory of the voice. I examined the role sound plays in our lives in a much deeper and valuable way due to the contributions of my classmates and Professor Peters' incredible guidance throughout the course. I will continue to search for the voice and all its sources and outcomes.",
    "It would be hard to adequately sum up just how much learning happened in this class; partially because much of media studies is brand new to me. But, to start with I got a sense of different strains of media studies from Germany, America, Britain, and France. Became comfortable with the wide breadth of theory available for use in media studies. Sound and voice was a great angle for me, as an English student, because we confronted the uses of inscription and paid particular attention to what we may consider un-inscribable. I like working at the levels below sense of signification, so this much focus on sound and sense was great. Though I tend to be less interested in histories of particular media and objects, I likes the various readings we were given detailing how media objects lives unexpected lives with purposes different from the ones they were originally conceived for . This expressed itself most clearly through technologies of war, but I was captivated by the reading on Nighttime radio particularly. To sum up one of many kinds of thinking the class offered, I learned through this class that the conditions of the world and relationship to the world that many media take for granted are not at all guaranteed, and the confrontations between technology and \"life\" reveal that there are and were always many possible ways of being int he world.",
    "The course covered a wide breadth of material that I hadn't been exposed to before, from religious studies to media theories and general questions about the nature of the voice.",
    "I think this course opened up a horizon for me towards sound and voice. It offered a subject upon which questions concerning politics and philosophy can be discussed fruitfully and differently. It makes us reflect on our beings as well. I appreciate the readings and the fact that the course allowed us to imagine the pre-industrial world. The experience is rare in my course of studies."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: excellent syllabus and amazing cohort of students! Weaknesses: none. Possible Improvements: It would have been beneficial to do the paper festival a week earlier in the term to enable more time to incorporate peer feedback.",
    "This class was a wonderful mixture of wonderment and rigor. Which is to say, the flights of play and mental adventure the class took were grounded by a serious engagement with the scholarship and thinking that the class was built on. The focus on long-term paper writing in the course was great for me! it is rare to have the chance to write papers in chunks for a class and, consequently , have much more time revise than we expect in seminar courses. I wonder if more flexibility could be introduced into the bifurcated structure of lecture and discussion halves of the seminar. More room for questions and complication during the lecture half, and more room for contextualizing and background during the discussion?",
    "I wanted closer readings of the text in class, over summaries offered by the instructor at the beginning of each session. I think this would've allowed us to develop our ideas of the voice together. My sense otherwise was that everyone had a specialty that they ended up speaking for. Also, I found discussions were often derailed as people brought in texts and materials not everyone had read\/seen or was familiar with.",
    "The course was strong for its breadth of material, and for the running questions that we continually returned to throughout the semester. It was well designed for the interdisciplinary nature of the course, because we regularly shared our material with each other and received individual feedback from the professor.",
    "I think this course is not intended to orient this way but I would appreciate more classic readings from Kittler, Heidegger, Barthes..etc."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, to every and any student interested in sound and how it moves through our world and through us.",
    "I would recommend this seminar to a similarly adventurous student who is willing to grapple with ideas that may at first be hard to conceive of. I think anyone could benefit from this class, truly.",
    "Yes, if they are interested in incorporating film and media studies into their work and research. This was a fantastic course for developing those skills and language.",
    "Yes, it was a delight to work with the professor and I learned a great deal. I would take any course offered by this professor.",
    "Yes, because it's fun."
