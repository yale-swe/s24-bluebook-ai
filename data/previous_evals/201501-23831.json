   "comments": [
    "The class is not too much work. The material is good (you read a good deal of critical race and feminist theory). While some people might not be too willing to entertain much critical theory, the class approaches the theory in what I would say is a fairly analytic way, and I heavily recommend you don't dismiss it. Understanding how Foucault's view of power departs from idealist views i.e. Mill is heavily important, but it's done in a comparative way that is very helpful and grounded. Overall, it's a good class.",
    "I would not recommend it.",
    "You can get a lot out of just doing the readings. If you have the time and the willpower to work through Foucault by yourself, there's no reason you should have to take this class.",
    "It's fine. It's well worth it to do the readings carefully, especially Foucault. The latter part of the course, which focuses on recent work in political theory and social epistemology, is a bit thin on substance, but still worth engaging with insofar as it gives you a good picture of what things are like in leftish philosophy these days."
