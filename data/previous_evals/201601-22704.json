   "comments": [
    "The course went to the major topics and themes that occupied the thinkers of the Frankfurt School. Each section was dedicated to a text prepared by the students. We went through the argument presented very thoroughly and spent a lot of time on understanding the chain of thoughts and shape of the texts assigned. I enjoyed diving so deeply and intensely into the texts and think it is utterly beneficial to anybody who truly wants to understand and critique a philosophical argument. I would, indeed, recommend the course to fellow students.",
    "The class was a robust introduction to some of the main thinking of the Frankfurt School. It felt like a privilege to focus on a handful of key texts rather than to feel pressured to sift through counterproductively long lists of secondary source bibliographies. The class does a good job in extracting and discussing important ideas from the Frankfurt School that can then be applied and analyzed in other contexts also. I would highly recommend the class to anyone interested in gaining an understanding of some of the 'core' thoughts of Critical Theory.",
    "This was a great intro into the fundamental concepts and themes of the Frankfurt school. I would definitely recommend this course to anyone interested in this Critical Theory"

   "comments": [
    "The course had no direct impact on my studies in Theology. However, the thorough analysis of fairly difficult and dense texts helped me understanding the argument and the broader trajectory it is part of. Having an insight into what the Frankfurt School is and what its concern in this world is, helps reflecting also on today's problems of social conformity and calls upon us to reflect critically on what we are confronted with."
