    "I have learned a lot about the basic knowledge of Cell Biology. It's a good start to understand this complex area.",
    "Good overview of cell biology, some paper reading skills",
    "Overview of the various topic in molecular cell biology.",
    "Genral background of cell biology",
    "I learned a lot about particular topics in cell biology. I also developed my skills in writing about experiments and thinking through possible projects. I gained a lot of knowledge about how cells work integratively and the cross talk between systems within a cell.",
    "Basic knowledge in broad cell biology topics.",
    "This course is very helpful to me. It provided a lot of useful information of different areas of molecular and cell biology. It also gave us a glimpse of the current technologies used for cell biology research. Overall, I like this course.",
    "Gained a deeper and better insight into the intricacies of cell biology, although some of the professors teaching this course did a far better job at teaching and engaging than others.",
    "Good in depth look at specific, special topics in cell biology.",
    "I learned a decent amount about the basic processes involved in cell biology.",
    "I learned how to think carefully about techniques that can be used to address a particular research question and how to prioritize one over another based on the advantages that they provide.",
    "Was a good refresher for cellular biology as I approach my understanding of other fields of biology",
    "This course provided an excellent background of cellular biology and I feel that I now possess a good understanding of the widespread nature of processes that occur within cells. I found the homework assignments to be beneficial and the discussion sections to be interesting."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strength: different professors taught their interesting topics and they did well in their own areas. But some lectures are not interesting for me",
    "Some of the lectures felt disjointed because there were so many different professors teaching the course. We also learned some topics multiple times because the professors may not have communicated with each other what they were going to cover in their class.",
    "Well organised class",
    "strengths - some of the professors were extremely engaging weaknesses - level of detail for each topic was varied and could have been more consistent",
    "I felt that the homeworks being graded each one differently made it a little tough to know what to expect. Also, more paper discussions would be useful.",
    "Strength: lecturers were very familiar with the topic most of the time so they could talk about the latest discoveries and go deeper into certain parts of the lecture.",
    "The Professors teaching this class are excellent!",
    "Weaknesses: 1) If the answer to clarifications on assignment questions is on the lines of \"but your reasoning is not what I was looking for\/that's not what I had in mind\", I feel that as a professor you're emphasizing the known rather than stimulating curiosity\/creativity or discussing with the student on how the reasoning could be improved. 2) A couple of professors teaching their topic of specialization in this course were more concerned about racing through their slides rather than engaging the students or making sure that information was actually being absorbed. Strengths: 1) A good assortment of topics, and a great coordination of these topics with discussions in the 603 molecular cell biology seminar class.",
    "I thought there was some inconsistency within the homework questions we were given. Some were rather vague and therefore difficult to answer, while others were very clear and thought provoking.",
    "Strength, multiple faculty for one course.",
    "Its strengths include the fact that most of the professors were well prepared when they gave their lectures. Additionally, the take home tests usually evaluated things that were discussed in class in some detail. The only weaknesses that comes to mind is that the grading range and the points attributed to each grade were not clearly stated and that some professors did not add comments regarding how the answer could have been better.",
    "more discussion sections maybe",
    "I enjoyed the diversity of instructors and feel that I learned a great deal from each person who taught. However, I do wish that there were more discussion sections than written homework."

   "comments": [
    "recommend. It's a good course to learn basic cell biology.",
    "Yes, I would recommend it. It gives a good overview of cell biology and some of the lectures were very good! However, some of the assignments were not very related to what we covered in lecture, so the helpfulness of the assignments really varied.",
    "Yes",
    "I would recommend this course to another student, as I think it provides useful background for understanding the basics of cell biology, which is crucial for any biologist to have a strong understanding of.",
    "Yes, it is great for getting familiar with different topics before choosing a lab.",
    "The workload was low, but I would have preferred a format more conducive to learning material presented in lecture. Each lecture set\/topic (by professor) was heavily dependent on the professor's style and effort put in.",
    "Yes, I thought this course was interesting overall.",
    "Yes great course.",
    "Yes. The course provides current knowledge to people interested in Molecular Cell Biology.",
    "While looking back I realize that it wasn't the most useful class to take for pursuing immunology, it was still a good introduction for graduate level knowledge, and in that regard would suggest it to another student that may not feel comfortable with graduate level courses.",
    "Yes I would recommend this course to other students who are interested in receiving a detailed overview of cellular processes."
