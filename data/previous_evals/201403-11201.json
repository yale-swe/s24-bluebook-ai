    "I would recommend this course for anyone with a strong interest in American Politics, particularly if they enjoy theory-oriented classes and seminar discussions.",
    "American Politics is a concise introduction to the ideas of the field. I would recommend it to become acquainted with the field, but be warned that the reading material is often dry.",
    "I would definitely only recommend this course to students outside of the political science program if they are prepared to do a lot of reading. I was definitely shocked by the amount of reading required for this course (given that I am not accustomed to the PhD program). I definitely think I benefited from a background in history and historical research from my undergrad. If someone is prepared for the work, I would recommend this class to those who want some insight into how to look at and discuss politics at a theoretical level. I loved this course, but I do not know if many public health students would find it as useful as I feel like I did. I also loved that there was no final exam!!",
    "Yes, if they have some interest in American Politics."
