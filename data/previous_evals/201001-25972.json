    "The course requires only about an hour or so of prep work per week. Discussions are much better during the second \"classics\" semester than during the fall \"current\" semester. The course is required, so the recommendation part isn't really applicable."

    "I don't feel that this course really deepens knowledge of genetics. It was nice to have the evaluation forms to help us improve our presentation skills, but I think it would be better to improve our presentation skills regarding our own science instead of unrelated papers. The classics discussions were more interesting and led to thoughtful conversation regarding the discipline, but the course does not really contribute anything to my own research."
