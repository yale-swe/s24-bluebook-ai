   "comments": [
    "A lot of reading. But really. It's a lot. Only take this class if you're really willing to spend a lot of time reading.",
    "An engaging and high-level seminar discussion.",
    "This course is really great. Its a thorough analysis of the long books of the Western tradition. Its a lot of reading, and it doesn't allow for close analysis of any of these texts, but the essays will require more focused readings that move this class beyond a survey of the Western cannon and into something more interesting that allows you to see links between epics, times and places. Its a really great course, a ton of work, but worth it.",
    "Epics is a good opportunity to read books that many learned people talk about but few have actually read.Warning: you may become one of the many that talk about them but haven't actually read them.But still it was a cool class. If you end up taking it, make sure that you make page quotas--read a certain amount of pages each night so that you finish the book by the time it has to b finished. It'll make your life so much more calm and improve your contributions to discussion. Its important.Second warning: everyone will think you're in DS, especially when you read Don Quixote.",
    "Great course!!!! The books are fantastic, and essential works you should read before you leave Yale",
    "This course has a lot of reading, and realistically nobody is able to finish it all. Hence, the course can be frustrating since you feel like you're not always learning. There's a lot of writing (4 essays and 6 reading responses), which can be tough. There's also a final exam, which is long and boring. Class was often boring since we had the same discussion over and over again. Overall, the course might be worth it for the WR and Hu credits, but there are probably better ones out there. But if you're taking Epic, shop sections (I think Len's was one of the better sections)",
    "ENGL 130 is a fast-paced survey of classical epics and modern novels that comment on the epic genre.It's a good college course to take whatever your major.That being said, only a reader with an open mind will enjoy such divergent works as Homer's The Odyssey and Joyce's Ulysses.Let Gutkin was a strong discussion moderator and very personable instructor. He provided extensive feedback on our submitted essays and made himself available to provide feedback while we were formulating our essays."
