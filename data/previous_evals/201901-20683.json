    "Strengths: The lectures are clear and well organized. Prof Sargis was always very happy to help. Weakness: The pace of the course is relatively fast for someone without prior anthropology background. There was no real homework so it was 100% up to the students to prep and review. Why is the content important? This part was not always clear and sometimes I felt like I was just learning to memorize facts about skull features. Some of the vocabs were over my head, especially specific names that were mostly in latin, so I think a review of how the names were constructed would have been helpful.",
    "I thought this course was organized extremely and what was asked of us was very understandable and rational.",
    "Combination of lecture and lab, well-designed slides"

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Yes, I would but know that the course will have grad students who already know a lot more than you do. The class moves really quickly. Mondays are lectures and Wednesdays are lab days. There isn't really homework besides reviewing and preparing to do the lab. It's a low workload for sure but the exams are hard. You'll have to identify the primates based on skull and teeth features alone.",
    "I would recommend this course because it is a very obscure topic that I don't think many people have been exposed to and I found it to be very interesting.",
    "This class was much more advanced than I thought, so if you have some basic knowledge about evolutionary biology and primates and really interested in such studies, I can recommend this class. But if you are thinking of taking this course merely for a science credit (like me!), I would not recommend it: the class is great but extremely tough, exams are so difficult that you may feel that this class takes too much time that you could otherwise spend for what you are more interested in."
