   "comments": [
    "Absolutely. Take it while you still can. The online videos are simply different from being in Kagan's presence.",
    "If you need the requirements...",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone who is interested in the subject. You do a lot of reading, so you have to enjoy the material.",
    "Good class. Most of the reading is not necessary, so don't fret! Mid-term, paper, final - quite manageable!",
    "This is a fantastic class to take- you are taught by the great Donald Kagan. However, you must be prepared to work- you must read a great deal of material and keep up with lectures if you want to get the most out of this class.",
    "Definitely recommend this course, gives a dynamic history of Ancient Greece and the influences the Greeks had on the modern world become clearly visible after taking this course.",
    "I would recommend the course to anyone who likes ancient history and is up for a bit of reading. To really do well, it takes some work but I think that it was a great learning experience.",
    "I would recommend it. Its a lot of reading and material though and the lectures are hard to follow for 75 minutes and there is no slides to structure it. but overall great class",
    "Solid class, not the best I've ever taken.If you fall behind in the reading you will die, I did, I died. Don't fall behind.Parts of it are interesting but just in general not the best history class.",
    "By the end of the semester, you really do understand the history of Ancient Greece. I strongly recommend this class to other students. Donald Kagan is great, the material is interesting, and in general the class is just a very worthwhile experience.",
    "This is a course that should be a distribution requirement by itself; alongside Hu and Wr should be AGH (Ancient Greek History). The class is fantastic in every respect, and Professor Kagan is a champion of the field.Donald Kagan is more of an authority on Ancient Greece than the Ancient Greeks themselves. His lectures are flawless, and heartwarming in their sincerity and charisma. There is a rowdy applause at the end of every lecture, and not without reason; Kagan is the undisputed best.",
    "Ancient Greek History is a great course! Prof. Kagan is very knowledgeable on the subject, and you will definitely learn a lot. He will consistently make the case for why this subject is important to study, and he's right. The Greeks are the forefathers of many modern ideas and institutions, and it's important to know where they are coming from.Note: You can get by without reading Thucydides, Herodotus, or Plutarch in this course. However, one of the questions on the final exam will ask you to quote one of these two authors. Of course, you'll have another essay option, but if you don't read the primary sources, you won't really have a choice but to take the second option. At the very least, be sure to read the Pomeroy book and the Problems book.",
    "Professor Kagan is one of the most eminent Greek historians of our time, so obviously he knows vast amounts about the subject. But more importantly, by taking his class, you are getting access to some of the world's leading opinions on questions that are still in controversy today. You don't get that kind of authority in every class.The problem is that he's been giving what seems like kind of the exact same lectures for twenty years. The downside of this is that sometimes its obvious that Kagan is reading a script he's read 20 times before. The upside is that he knows everything, and if you don't know anything at all, you can just go watch the old classes on Yale Open Courses and you won't miss any of the crucial information.",
    "This course provides a thorough overview of the Ancient Greek world, focusing around the Peloponnesian War. Professor Kagan is a very good lecturer, and this is a classic Yale course, so I highly recommend it if you have even a vague interest in the material.",
    "I would recommend this class only if you're genuinely interested in the material and not just take it because Kagan is a brilliant lecturer. The material can be a bit dry if you're not into it. And definitely do the readings to get the most out of this class.",
    "Classic history lecture. Take it to so that you can always be knowledgeable about ancient civilization.",
    "CLCV 205 was a lecture series that involved background readings in many standard ancient Greek historians including Thucydides and Plutarch. In addition to the primary sources and our textbook, we also had the opportunity to read modern historians accounts of historical events and understand some of the recent scholarship on some of the well know controversies. I highly recommend the course for any student, history majors and otherwise.",
    "Good introductory history class. The three assignments (midterm, paper, final) are very straightforward and if you do your work\/readings\/lectures you'll do well. Kagan can be a bit of a dry lecturer but he's also so interesting. Section is great and really helpful so definitely don't opt out of that if given the option.",
    "It's well worth taking. There's a very significant amount of reading; most people don't get through it all (myself included), but it's all worthwhile. Be prepared to memorize a lot of obscure names, dates, and terms for the exams, which test comprehension much more than understanding (unfortunately). However, the lecture is very good, as are the readings and section if you have a good TF.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this class - if you think you would be interested in the subject material. I love history (and am a history major), and have always liked ancient history, so I knew I should take this class. Kagan is extremely knowledgeable and tries to make lectures engaging, but if you're not interested in the Spartans, the Athenians, and the causes of the Peloponnesian War, you'll probably space out during class. The reading was manageable, but there are a lot of potential IDs to memorize for the test. Also, you do not need to read all of Thucydides, so don't freak out about that.",
    "Great class taught by a legend in his field. He may be along in his age and his lectures are sometimes a bit dry, but this can easily be solved by watching the classes online with a (somewhat) younger Kagan. Exams(midterm and final) are difficult only if you haven't kept up with the readings. I would completely recommend taking this class WITH the section, which I did not and really regret.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student, as Ancient Greece is really one of the main founding influences of Western culture. Learning about it is relevant to today, and this course persuaded me of that. It is also just a very interesting place. Professor Kagan is eloquent and knowledgeable. Lectures are 1 hour 15 minutes each though, and I always got tired during the last half hour. The courses are on Open Courses, which helps, but DO NOT leave all the lectures to watch last minute before your midterm\/final.",
    "If you are interested in Ancient Greek history then you should definitely take this class. You learn a lot and Professor Kagan is a great lecturer and made it very enjoyable to go to class. There is a lot of reading and if you don't keep up with it then you will have a hard time with the midterm and final. The only thing that I didn't like about the class were the two tests. I spent an unreasonable amount of time trying to memorize dates, names, and quotes. If you're good at memorizing this sort of thing then you should be alright, otherwise it will probably be pretty difficult for you.",
    "If you really want to learn more about Ancient Greek History, take this class. Donald Kagan is sort of a legend. Personally, though, I found lecture a bit dull. I attended every lecture, but by the end of the semester I had trouble paying attention to anything said during lecture. Keeping up with the reading is VERY important; otherwise, lectures make no sense.",
    "I am very hesitant to recommend Ancient Greek History. When he is having a good day and talking about an interesting topic Donald Kagan can deliver an incredible lecture. However, when he is having a poor day (i.e. losing his place in his notes) or talking about a less interesting topic, it can be tough not to zone out. Despite the glowing reviews from past years, I have taken better history lectures. The readings (Thucydides, Plutarch, and Kagan's \"Problems in Greek History\") are rather interesting especially if one wants to learn about Ancient Greek politics and warfare. The exams are incredibly frustrating as they are nothing but pure memorization of obscure dates and names. The final few lectures seemed little more than a thicket of names, dates, and battles. His outdated pedagogy really takes away from what would otherwise be a great class."
