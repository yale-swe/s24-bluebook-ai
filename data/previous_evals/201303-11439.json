   "comments": [
    "Took it for the SC credit. While it's certainly not a gut, it's not too challenging and is accessible to people who haven't taken any college science courses. The course was pretty good, but you should be warned that the lab is quite boring, so if you are on the fence about the course, then you shouldn't take it because the mandatory lab significantly drags down the quality of the course.",
    "Yes, recommend if you are interesting in G&G or EVST. Otherwise is an interesting, but not too easy science credit. What I liked most is that the tests accurately test on material covered in class. You won't be thrown any curve balls. However it is very important to go to class because most of the material is not covered in the textbook.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. It's an overview of atmospheric science that would certainly be appropriate for science and non-science majors (given a basic foundation in chemistry and physics).",
    "It's a really interesting course, especially the section about cloud formation and storms. Even if you're never going to need this course it's just really cool stuff to know. I would take it.",
    "Yes but only because the content was interesting. Professor Smith was a very bad professor and I do not recommend him to anyone. I know of multiple students that tried to get help from him about the class since they were struggling with the course material and he turned them away or simply told them to drop the course. He says he will help you but then does not offer advice on how to do better in the course or to teach you. The class itself was really interesting though and one of the only class that have been super applicable to my life. Now I can't walk outside or go on a plane without identifying all of the meteorological occurrences around me at any given time. Take if you need for your major or don't mind meeting a lot with your TA to help teach you the concepts!",
    "Its a basic science class about climate science, not too hard",
    "yes!",
    "I would not recommend this course, which is characterized by weekly and demoralizing 2 hr sessions in Kline Geology lab. The TA treats you like a statistics monkey, and I will walk away from this course with very little added value to the lecture material. I would not recommend this, but if you are EVST you probably have to take it.",
    "This class provides you with a basic fundamental understanding about how the earth system works. The excellent material makes this a worthwhile class to take.",
    "It was one of the most exciting courses I have taken this semester. I absolutely love it! I learned everything I was curious about and it definitely help stimulate my interest in geology and environmental studies. I would recommend it to all the students who are interested in the ocean and atmosphere.",
    "This is an interesting class in that you learn a lot of the basics of how the world works, especially with weather. You feel like you can use the information in your everyday life because you can just look around and think, oh that makes sense, the wind is coming from the west.There is more to the class though so you get a good introduction to many of the special subsets in the geology major and you can figure out which one interest you most, because there is a variety in the paths.",
    "The lecture is excellent and very interesting! I loved it. The lab section, on the other hand, is god awful boring (though extremely easy and minimal work). Professor Smith is a marvelous lecturer.",
    "Do not take it unless you have to.",
    "I wouldn't take this class if you're trying to learn fun things. It's actually not as fun as it seems.",
    "Don't take it if you can possibly avoid it.",
    "One of the best classes I have taken at Yale. You learn so much about weather, the oceans, climate change and it's all applicable to your life. My friends started getting annoyed with me because I got so excited with my newfound meteorological abilities that I would predict the weather all the time. Someone says, \"Do you think it's going to rain later?\" and you know the answer! \"Why is it so unseasonably warm today?\" You know! It's amazing.",
    "I would recommend taking the class if you are interested in being able to actually say something factual and scientific about global warming and the climate around us. I really liked this course because when wacky weather happened I could explain why. And I could explain what global warming is. If you want a science class after which you can actually walk away and be able to apply to your daily life, this is the one for you.",
    "This is a rewarding and worthwhile introductory science class for someone with a moderate math and science background and an interest in earth science. Professor Smith is a superb lecturer with the rare combination of a deep understanding of his subject and the ability to teach introductory material clearly. The required weekly lab is a bit of a drag, but the organized and interesting lecture makes it worthwhile.",
    "Not sure whether to recommend it. This class is interesting. A little basic, but material is really well presented and it is an intro class, after all. That being said, it's a lot of work, but problem sets are actually pretty helpful and tests are fair. My biggest problem with this class was that the lab was required. The lab was boring, tons of work, and had little relation to the class but everyone still had to take it.",
    "If you're an EVST major, you have to take it, and will probably come away with a lot of useful knowledge. I would freely recommend the class to anyone else, but keeping in mind that the lab is required for the class, look pretty deeply at both and decide if you are willing to take both. Also, if you take the class, the materials and videos on the Open Yale Courses website (from the 2011 class) may be helpful. A lot of the material has stayed the same.",
    "I would say it's a great overview to environmental science for those who have some prior knowledge of chem and physics. Tests were fair and I feel like I learned a ton this semester.",
    "I'd take it only if I were interested in metrology, or if I needed it as a requirement. However, it does give an interesting window into the first principles that determine the world's climate...it's useful for many disciplines, I guess.",
    "This class is definitely worth taking if you're interested in learning why weather systems and global climate exist as they do. I'm leaving this class with a much better understanding of the science behind the weather phenomena observed on a daily basis. I liked Professor Smith a lot, he handled the material very well and he definitely knows his stuff. Even though it's required for my major, I enjoyed this course a lot in and of itself.",
    "This has been my favorite course at Yale. Ron Smith is a passionate scientist who can explain complicated systems and processes to students with no background in the atmospheric\/oceanic sciences. I looked forward to lectures. Problem sets and exams are challenging but fair.",
    "Yes definitely! I'm a geology major so I found the material really interesting! Ron Smith is absolutely wonderful. However, there are 3 midterms, so that's a pain to study for. They are only worth 30% of your grade though.",
    "This course is a great introduction to geology, and a physical science class that would be accessible to non science majors. By the end of the course you'll have asolid understanding of the process which drive the earth's atmosphere, as well as a background on some of the more important geological problems of today.",
    "Good class to take if you study Geophysics or Envtal Science.",
    "This is a solid introductory class, but the problem sets and exams are pretty challenging and the grading is fair but not easy. I definitely came away feeling like I understood the atmosphere, weather, and climate change better, but the lab class that is attached to it is horrible. I would recommend taking this class only if you have to or if you really like atmospheric sciences.",
    "A good introduction to atmospheric science. The goal is breadth over depth, but you do get a good sense of things by the end. It differs from Natural Disasters in that the course is less geared toward specific weather events and more toward weather patterns as a connected system. Choose between the two based on your interest.",
    "Even though the lecture starts off super quantitative, it gets simpler and more focused on broad concepts and patterns as it goes on. If you have to take it as an EVST major, toughen up and buckle down even if you think you'll hate it, because this material can get Really Cool once you're comfortable enough with it to enjoy it. Don't stress to hard, and talk to TFs, SQR tutors, and anyone you can find to make it easier. If you are a G&G major, you might think this class is a joke- but you can learn something from it also.Smith is an absolute pro in lecture, and while he does a great job making himself inaccessible and alienating himself from students, just listening to him talk and tell stories in front of the class is something I'd pay to do."
