    "Clear and precise syllabus and assignments that afforded student exploration in all areas discussed in class. Was great to work with one 'real world' project over the course of the semester -- allowed us to personally engage with and invest in the material.",
    "I think the course would have benefitted from less in class exercises and a few additional homework assignments that helped students figure out the basic principles\/operations at work in evaluating properties. Often it was hard to follow the explanations\/arithmetic performed in class, and having exercises to do at home then discuss in class might have been more fruitful.",
    "the material was presented effectively, in a good sequence, and encouraged a good understanding of commercial real estate principles.",
    "The content and material was very interesting and a great introduction to business practices.",
    "The body of information presented was very valuable and resourceful to any graduatingarchitectural student. The sequence, syllabus and assignments were all very informative and reasonable.",
    "Great course. The later lectures could perhaps use a bit more structure.",
    "Weekly assignments were very intense, but valuable. Often it was difficult to balance studio with this class, but in the end it proved to be a success.",
    "I like the workflow in the course, from heavy in the beginning to relatively light at the end. It makes sense for our studio schedule. I would encourge student presentations, as in other seminars."

    "i wasn't quite sure what to expect - a business school class being taught in the architecture school - and to that end the course exceeded my expectations. it was useful, informative, fun, engaging, etc.",
    "This was a great course, which exceeded my expectations.",
    "I expected to get a general coverage of real estate in this course and my expectations were met.",

    "Extremely valuable.",
    "Very VERY valuable -- I feel this course should be required in the YSOA. It grants an opportunity to see the other side of architecture: HOW things get built through finance\/equity. It will allow us as architects to engage in more intelligent conversations with our investors\/developers.",
    "Helped understand the basic workings of commercial real estate. A great introduction.",
    "this class has an extremely high value to me, both professionally and personally. i think the subject matter is incredibly relevant to architects, and without doing so bluntly, was eye-opening to the possibilities of architects to engage in the business world. it encourages non traditional models of architecture's place in the world, and hopefully one in which architects can significantly contribute.",
    "Very valuable!",
    "I believe there is an inherent lack of business instruction in design academia (where in reality the profession is heavily dependent on being a business) so i really appreciated the practicality of the class. It was very helpful to have someone teach you about mortgage rates, cap rates, negotiating leases, etc. and all the baggage that accompanies \"property.\" This course has ignited an on-going interest for me in terms of the real estate market.",
    "This class was incredibly valuable. It is unbelievable to me that as architects, we don't learn basic real estate principles, especially in the current market.",
    "Time shall tell, though I think the exposure enough warranted the time invested. I'll be that much ahead of other architecture students."

    "Kevin was fun, engaging, and intelligent. His method of teaching is unique and appreciated; however, it would have been helpful if a little more attention was given to how to do many of the excel problem sets. We were sort of thrown into these in each week's quiz without ever really being taught the proper method, or the correct terminology. Out TA, Carmel spent many hours with us outside of class to make up for it. The knowledge also eventually came through homework sets and later lectures; however, some instruction from Kevin in the beginning would have been helpful. That said, Kevin is a great instructor and was able to convey what was set forth in his own unique way.",
    "Kevin was great.",
    "both kevin and carmel were highly effective, available for help outside of class time, organized, and provided lots of feedback.",
    "Kevin is very effective in keeping the class involved and interactive.",
    "The teacher's agenda every week was effective and reasonable.",
    "Kevin is incredibly effective as an instructor, and does everything within his power to hone in on our interests and help us find career paths that relate to these interests. Our school needs more courses like this one.",
    "Kevin and Carmel were great. They created a very relaxing atmosphere in which learning something new and relatively challenging were fairly easy."

    "At times Kevin is very difficult to understand. The consensus among students is that it is a strategy to keep them off balance. If it is not then I would suggest that Kevin tries to be a bit more straight forward, a little less opaque and easier to understand.",
    "Perhaps it would of been helpful to go through the real estate section of the paper every week to understand what was happening in the markets on a weekly basis.",
    "Student presentations. Re-vamped lease negotiations."
