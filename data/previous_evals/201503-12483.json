    "I highly recommend this course to anyone who wants to start learning Spanish.",
    "I would recommend it. Great, comprehensive immersion for first-timers.",
    "Yes, I believe the workload is manageable, and the course moves at a perfect pace. I also felt like I learned a lot in a short period of time.",
    "Solid introductory Spanish class. Classes are well-planned and many include fun activities to help solidify knowledge.",
    "Fun if you put in the effort necessary! I would recommend the class to another student, since I had a great time and thought I learned Spanish much better in one semester than in three years in high school.",
    "I love that it is immersive and I would definitely recommend it, I think it is very helpful as a start for the language.",
    "I would summarize this class as an awesome way to learn I troduxtory Spanish with a laid back environment that helps you learn easily and comfortably.",
    "Yes",
    "I would recommend Spanish 110 to anyone looking to learn a foreign language. However I would warn about the initial fast pace if they have no experience with the new language.",
    "Spanish L1 is a comprehensive beginners course that moves very quickly. Consequently you learn a tonne in just 4 months and are conversationally fluent, at least on basic topics, by the end of the semester. There is a lot of homework, but it's mostly learning vocabulary, and so not too intellectually taxing. The more effort you put int, the more you get out of it. Would absolutely recommend! The program is highly organized and logical. I can't believe just a few months ago I didn't know a word of Spanish, and now I could comfortably engage in conversation about a range of topics."
