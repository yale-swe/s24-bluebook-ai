    "This class was fantastic start to finish. Instructors and TA are extremely generous with their time helping all students regardless of level of prior study and experience to become familiar with the material. The ten day field trip and weekly lab components really instill a love of plants and help students to view the botanical world with intelligence and insight.While supremely useful for the tropics, I found this course was also helpful in understanding temperate plant botany as well.It was a pleasure and a privilege to have class with Larry and Fabian and I hope that FES will continue to bring them back for many years!",
    "Q 9: The field trip is vital to this course and is an excellent opportunity to learn in the field. Great mix of sites and habitats.",
    "Fantastic class!",
    "This was a fantastic class.The only thing I would say is that management of the class could have been better on the field trip. There was a persistent problem of students who would figure out the plant family first and shout out the answer, cutting off everyone else who was still thinking it through. Since thinking it through is how we really learn both the content and the process that we're supposed to learn, this was disappointing.The professors did address this issue in an ad hoc way as it occurred, but it would have been helpful for the professors to speak about this in a direct way at the beginning of the trip with a comprehensive explanation of how students are expected to participate.Overall a fantastic course. Thanks!"

    "All of it!It was a pleasure to have a graduate course that engages the intellect and the senses. Learning field characters and then examining samples by sight, smell, taste, and touch immediately afterward was not only extremely effective but also fun. I looked forward to class each week and the field visit to Costa Rica was an incomparable learning opportunity!",
    "I feel that I have a substantial botanical knowledge now, and it has greatly increased my interest in plants. It was great being able to examine live plants every class, and on the fieldtrip, rather than dealing with nature in a theoretical or abstract way as in most academic classes.",
    "The field trip to Costa Rica, the lab portion of classes, repetition of terminology, dedication of instructors.",
    "The field trip to Costa Rica!",
    "The instructors had a hands-on lab wit fresh material at the end of every class, where they showed us how to look for some of the characters that were discussed in lecture. This was awesome! The material was great, their explanation of it was great as well. The power point presentations for each lecture were also very good, and it was excellent that they were made available to the students. Field trip was excellent too."

   "comments": [
    "Maybe an optional \"botany basics\" tutorial with instructors or TA at the beginning of the course for those who have no experience to get caught up on phylogeny and terminology would help.",
    "More repetition of specimens seen during lab (maybe bringing \"a few from last week\" to every lab).While the instructors made an effort to engage every student, noting progress and giving encouragement, the favoritism expressed towards a couple of students was unprofessional and had the unintended effect of discouraging other students. This became most obnoxious during the final exam, when both instructors talked and laughed loudly with these students while the rest of class was attempting to finish the exam. While particular students will always stand out to instructors, I would hope that these instructors in the future maintain a greater degree of professionalism by not exhibiting this favoritism in a manner that is dismissive of the effort other students are putting into the class.",
    "The course was based around learning plant characters, or suites of characters which were described as characteristic of a given family, which was great. However on the exam sometimes the material provided were exceptions to the rule, or one could not see the diagnostic characteristic (either because it was not present in the specimen, or because it had dried up etc during the exam, so if a person encountered that specimen later in the exam it was not quite fair). After studying all these diagnostic characters in class, it was a bit disheartening to be tested on \"exceptions to the rule\" or \"if you are lucky you will see the character\". I understand that this is the nature of field botany, there are always exceptions, but in this first introductory course I think it would be better to present students on the exam with material that clearly demonstrate the characters that were presented in class. Or go into more discussion in class about the \"exceptions to the rule\"."
