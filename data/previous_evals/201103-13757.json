   "comments": [
    "Yes. If more books had online additions, it would be great.",
    "yes.",
    "yes. but i would like to take a book out for more than a day.",
    "Yes, all the resources are available to me.",
    "Yes. I still hate the library only let you take out one books for one day. Really lame. Who can we talk to about this!? Also they didn't have extended hours during finals weekend\/week! I have never been at a school that doesn't have their library open for more hours during finals!",
    "Yes.",
    "Yes.",
    "I think the only problem is library. I can only borrow books for one day, and it is too short for me to read it. I have to scan the book and I often have to go to library for several times if I need the same book again.",
    "The resources of the library were disappointing and I often had to use borrowdirect to borrow books from other schools. The library is one of the only resources that I find to be disappointing at the school since so many fundamental books seem to be missing from its collection.",
    "The library should have extended hours during finals\/exam week.",
    "Resources were adequate.",
    "The library has frequently cited weaknesses in its lending policies. One day\/one book is ridiculous. The time limit should be at LEAST three days, if not a week. Second priority would be allowing multiple books checked out at a time; five would be reasonable, if a limit is even necessary.",
    "resources were available.",
    "Using the library is always a pain in the ass - one of the school's worst assets.The one book - one day policy is absolutely absurd, and it a virtual guarantee that any paper\/research project will require at least a 5-20 dollar surcharge for its proper completion. It's the kind of usurious policy I'd expect from Bank of America or Citigroup, not a library whose presumed goal should be the sharing of knowledge.",
    "I am always a bit frustrated by the architecture library when doing research for final papers. We really don't have a very large collection."
