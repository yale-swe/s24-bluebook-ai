   "comments": [
    "Yes definitely. Taking photos makes you think in a way that you wouldn't necessarily get otherwise at yale. Really provides a great balance to ones schedule.",
    "You get to take time out of your day to wander around and take pictures. It's great.",
    "You take a LOT of photos and you sit in class and look at them. I would take the class because it is fun to have your own pictures at the end but I don't think I would ever take the class again.",
    "I would take this class only if you are already really excited about taking photographs. I wanted to try it, but this class did not inspire any new love of photography. It's a lot of time to invest in something you don't care about. Although I learned how to use cameras, Photoshop, and Bridge, as well as a fair amount of photography history, class time always felt too long.",
    "Digital photo is a great course for anyone who is interested in photography and wants to think about photography as art rather than simply social media. It's a really great course for someone deciding between analog and digital or wishing to experiment with color and black and white",
    "This is a great course and I totally recommend it! If you want to take better travel photos, this is not the course for you, because you will be expected to generate photos that qualify more as art. That said, it is super fun and learning to use a digital camera and photoshop are great tools. If you are going to only take one photo class, though, I would recommend introduction to black and white photography, the darkroom class. My darkroom class bonded way more than my digital class and darkroom printing is an amazing experience to have.",
    "Highly recommended to those interested in the art of photography"
