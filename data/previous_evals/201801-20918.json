    "This course gave me an introduction to English as a global language and of English literature as something plural rather than singular. I also learned of the debates surrounding the use of English in colonized areas such as Africa, India, and even Ireland.",
    "New understanding of English as a global language and its implications. Understanding of recurrent themes and techniques in postcolonial literature. Grasp of the historical contexts in which various authors wrote and how they interacted with their respective colonial settings.",
    "Improved writing, literary discussion. Learned about non-English\/American writers I otherwise would not have discovered."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I would have liked to read a few more novels from Asian countries other than India, even if it meant translated pieces.",
    "The course covered the novel from the mid 1600s up to present day and included global works in English. I enjoyed the diverse choice in texts but I definitely think Robinson Crusoe could be dropped. I enjoyed how different works were put in context based on when and where they were written. I think the course could perhaps include more help on writing the essays because it is a WR credit but also many English majors take this class and perhaps that would be annoying to them.",
    "The syllabus for this class is absolutely incredible. Having read none of the texts beforehand, I was blown away not only by their diversity but also by the way in which we discussed them. I never felt that we were reading a particular work because it came from a Caribbean or an African background. Each work, rather, merited its inclusion on its own terms. I cannot think of anything specific to improve the course. I would suggest spending more time on texts like Dubliners, but such a suggestion is impossible to fulfill. Overall, this course was simply fantastic.",
    "Truly an excellent course, potentially the best I have taken at Yale. Fascinating reading list, engaging discussions, mini-lectures by an incredibly knowledgeable professor. The only weakness was Professor Cleary's occasionally muddled feedback on essays, but this is minor.",
    "Strength - well taught, engaging reading Weakness - A lot to cover in a little time",
    "I think the syllabus could be improved by cutting a couple of the books. My class often had great discussions that we couldn't quite finish because there was so much to get to. I didn't like the two in-class assignments, which were basically exams about the books. Other than that, I liked the set up of the course. One 5-6 page paper and two 7-8 page papers was very manageable."

    "Good intro English course.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student! It was the first English class I took at Yale and I really enjoyed it! The works covered were diverse and led to interesting discussions in class. The class also felt accessible to non-English majors but not watered down which I appreciated. I also liked that the course exposed me to authors I wasn't yet familiar with.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student, regardless of whether that student is an English major or simply someone who likes literature. The texts are superb, and the workload is reasonable. Professor Cleary, moreover, is an amazing instructor to have for the class given his experience in postcolonial literature and his unparalleled ability to elicit student responses.",
    "Absolutely. An exciting and essential addition to the English curriculum that breaks free of the white canon and gives students an important outlook on global literature in the colonial era.",
    "I absolutely would recommend this to any other student. The course material on its own is near required reading.",
    "Yes! The books we read in this course were, for the most part, incredible texts I would have enjoyed reading outside of class. You basically get credit to read and discuss wonderful books from all over the world. I would also recommend taking this class with Joe Cleary, who is invested in his students' learning. He writes pages of hand-written comments on each paper, helping us improve our writing before the next assignment. Definitely study hard for his in-class assessments (basically two short exams about the books) because they are tricky!"
