   "comments": [
    "Just do it. Seriously. Take the damn class. The Friday afternoon thing definitely bummed me out for the first week, but it's so so worth it. I look forward to this class more than any class I've ever taken.",
    "Definitely one of my favorite classes I've taken at Yale, if not my favorite. If you liked 183 take this, you won't regret it.",
    "The best time you can possibly have in a classroom. Learn a lot while having the most fun. Lots of free cupcakes and sushi included. The workload is NOT light, but you are rewarded for your hard work.",
    "If you want to take this class then you already love Brad. And if you already love Brad you'll love this class.",
    "definitely take it if you can get in",
    "Don't take this class unless you know what you are getting into, and don't take this class just because the reviews say \"its easy\" or \"OMG BRAD IS DA BEST I LUV HIM.\" This class is like the new GS: basically a year long, ridiculous classmates, silly application process, crazy professor, maybe must-take \"Yale\" experience.",
    "You probably took 183 if you're taking this course. This is, at its simplest, another more intimate semester with Brad. There is a lot to be said about privacy issues that are covered. At least in 2014, the workload was very heavy - don't take this class if you're not prepared to write a four-page paper every week. The class is very loud, and you might not enjoy it if you don't want to speak over a torrent of jokes and speeches. But if you want to get to know Brad further, and take a fun seminar on important privacy issues, go for it.",
    "So you've probably taken CPSC 183 and liked it and are thinking about taking this class. I'd recommend it but you should know 2 things: 1) This class is a deep dive into privacy law. You have to make sure that this is something your'e interested in. Just because you liked the material of 183 doesn't mean that you'll like this material. 2) The weekly reading responses can be really annoying. I got better at writing them, but I really dreaded the time I spent writing them. I would've rather spent time paying close attention to the details of the readings. I would look into if they're switching back to bi-weekly responses. Otherwise, lots of perks: Getting to learn a lot about a really interesting area; Brad is great, as always; meet interesting people in the class.",
    "If you're lucky enough, take it.",
    "again, if you didnt take 183 first just go do that and stop reading this. then you will know what you need to know about the course.",
    "Yes, you have to take this class. Start with CPSC 183 and then move into CPSC 185. And, do it all in the same year because everything flows together. And, it will change your perspective on a lot of things. DO IT! TAKE IT!",
    "Yes. Do it. You won't find a better seminar.",
    "If you haven't taken 183 first, I recommend going back and taking it. It's similar to 185, but in lecture form. The difference is that this class (which is a seminar) is much more serious: you'll get the chance to really dive into the materials, and to get to know Brad and your fellow students. Look, you'll know if you like Brad or not once you meet him (he's very polarizing). It's a self-selecting group of students, and that's not a bad thing. If you're among those who like Brad and the class, you'll have a great time and learn a ton. If not, you'll still learn a ton, but it might be a bit unpleasant for you.",
    "Easily the best class I've ever taken at Yale.",
    "ABSOLUTELY. If you like an out of the box, not your typical Yale experience then you NEED to take this class. It's a hidden gem and is completely appropriate for non-Comp Sci majors.",
    "Take CPSC 185. You will gain a new perspective on how you use the Internet (and some good friends).",
    "You probably know what you're getting into. In case you don't, it's quite simple: a very fun, engaging class that meets on Fridays 3:30-5:30... But it's actually more than worth the Friday slot. Brad Rosen is very charismatic. He is able to control the flow of the class surprisingly well. His views are extremely insightful and presented in memorable ways. The class gives a lot of freedom for opinion, and a platform on which to debate issues (sometimes very loud debates occur while Brad evilly twiddles his fingers and grins). Be warned though: this class can make you exceptionally paranoid.",
    "This class is awesome! Brad is a great teacher and the discussions are a lot of fun and really informative! You will learn a lot about privacy, and you will come to appreciate just how much change needs to happen to protect our right to it.",
    "Take this class. One of the best classes I've taken at Yale. If you get into the class, your semester will be filled with lively, engaging, and interesting discussions about privacy and technology.",
    "Just hands down the best class you will ever take at Yale, ever.",
    "Just take it. You will NOT regret it. You haven't REALLY joined the Brad family until you take 185, and it's def worth it. Yes, it's not as structured as 183, but, you're part of a ridiculous community, and you also LEARN. Besides, what else are you doing on Friday afternoons? I was always thinking \/ talking about what was going in class with other people. It's a really important and relevant syllabus, and you'll be happy to know it. Very very little work, and fun. You know you want to."
