   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this course. I actually think that Math 120 was easier than AP Calculus BC, and Professor Frame teaches this course so well that I definitely recommend this course. The workload is not too much, and the exams are quite fair.",
    "Take it if you need the credit. Do not take it for fun unless you are a math-lover (which you might not be any more at the end of the course). There are much, much easier QR credits out there. Typical multivariable calculus course. Take it with Professor Frame!",
    "challenging but manageable",
    "Math 120 is a lot of work. It is difficult, but not unmanageable. And if you take math 120, make sure you shop the class -- if you don't like your professor or you can't understand what's going on, you should look for a different professor. Professor Frame is the best! I would do whatever you can to take it with him - he's wonderful (and tells jokes 1\/2 way through class!). The midterms are tough, but again, if you study in advance, they're not that bad. It's a good class, and Prof Frame is wonderful!",
    "I would recommend the course simply because I think it is useful to know multivariable calculus, but if you don't like math or science, it probably isn't worth taking. If you do take it, I can only speak for my own section, but Professor Frame is wonderful. If you can get into his section, I you definitely should.",
    "Multivariable Calculus, comparable to a Calc 3\/Calc D class in a high school or community college.",
    "This is a ridiculously hard class. Get ready to be very frustrated.",
    "Good class - take it with Michael Frame if you can!",
    "Frame is a great professor and the class was very enjoyable. He clearly loves what he is teaching, he explains the concepts very clearly, and he tells jokes in the middle of every class, which keeps things interesting. The class material was easy at the beginning, but the material at the end was more abstract and harder to grasp.",
    "Math 120 is a typical math course. I would take it if you are interested in math or if you need it for a requirement. I also HIGHLY recommend Professor Frame. He is such a wonderful teacher and truly inspirational. The problem sets do take time and you have to keep up with the work if you want to be prepared for the test.",
    "Don't take this class unless you need to use this for something. You learn a lot, but its really tough and a lot of work to go through if you're not going to use it for something.",
    "Interesting material, Frame is very good teacher.",
    "Don't take this class if you don't have to. The material is very hard to grasp for most people. Even though I was very good at calculus in high school, I found this class extremely difficult, and the subject matter confusing. Take it with Michael Frame if you can.",
    "Mathematics 120 is a strong one semester course in three dimensional geometry and an introduction to vector calculus. The course covers the basics of calculus of functions of several variables and includes the three major integral theorems (Green, Gauss [Divergence], Stokes). The class itself moves at a fast pace but Professor Frame knows what students have trouble with and how to explain the sometimes hard to grasp concepts in a simpler, more comprehensible and comprehendible way. He opens each class with a review of the topics covered in the previous class and ends with the important concepts to remember from that day\u0092s class which only help to improve general understanding of the material. Weekly problem sets (usually 8 to 15 questions) help drill the material when done in conjunction with the optional practice problems. Grading for the class is fair; although the exams are too easy which means a simple mistake could be the difference between two letter grades at the end of the semester. Professor Frame is, from what I\u0092ve heard, by far the best section teacher of Mathematics 120 and is the best teacher I\u0092ve had at Yale in terms of presentation of conceptual material, personality, and overall genuine disposition and care for his students. It is an honor and a privilege to take any Yale mathematics course with Professor Michael Frame.",
    "Very difficult, but you will learn a lot. Don't underestimate how difficult it can be, though. Sure you got a 5 on BC-calc and high school math wasn't so difficult, but you need to know that this course is not the same. Get a good teacher and don't freak out when the second midterm and final are really hard.",
    "Pretty interesting material, and though the course is challenging, it is far from impossible. I didn't take math senior year and it wasn't a big deal. Michael Frame is a great teacher.",
    "This course is a solid overview of multivariable and vector calculus. Though some may initially struggle to understand some of the concepts and theorems, both the material and the workload are certainly very manageable. By the end of the course you really will feel that you have a good command of the tools of multivariable and vector calculus.Also, class with Frame was a joy. His teaching is exceptionally clear, and his jokes during class were very entertaining. At times he bordered on inspirational. As anyone will tell you, take his section if possible.",
    "Math 120 is a very difficult course and it really matters who you have as a professor so register early. You learn a lot of concepts in a short period of time so never get behind in your work.",
    "Michael Frame is amazing for this class. I learned multivariable calculus reasonably well from this class without too much work. It is less work than ENAS 151. That said, if you don't take it with Michael Frame, it might not be worthwhile.",
    "Yes, Math 120 is a great course for any student who has a strong foundation in Calc AB or has taken the BC test. Even if a long amount of time has passed since you took the BC (I took mine in junior year), you should have no problem jumping right in as a freshman. The material is different enough that there's no overlap at all. That said, the material is pretty rigorous so be prepared to spend time to fully learn the math. Students in the class are pretty ambitious so the curve is tough at times. I had Professor Frame; he is excellent and I would highly recommend that you try to get into his section. Overall, a great class for people who love math or love a challenge.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course, the material is interesting and Michael Frame is fantastic.",
    "Take it with Frame!!!",
    "If you are taking multivariable calc, you can shop ENAS 151, but if you get Frame then Math 120 is probably your best bet. Math 120 is an overview of vector calculus which starts out simple and gradually gets more and more complicated. There are a lot of really smart people taking the class so the averages are skewed upwards, but the curve is fairly generous.",
    "cool math topics",
    "I would definitely recommend this course, but mostly because of Professor Frame. He is both a genius and one of the best professors I have ever had--not a common combination. He made this important but dense material interesting and clear. It was a little uncomfortable that he talked about his terminal cancer at least once a class, but it is understandable. He clearly loves teaching and is wonderful at it. Michael Frame will be sorely missed.",
    "I woulddefinitely recommend this class, so long as you get into Michael Frame's section. I just heard a lot of complaints from others who were in other sections. I'm so thankful that I read on OCI the summer before my freshman year that I should go early for the math registration meeting -- so here I am telling you: MAKE SURE TO GO TO THE MATH REGISTRATION MEETING SO THAT YOU CAN GET INTO PROFESSOR MICHAEL FRAME'S SECTION.The class was challenging, but the challenge of it made it so fulfilling when I finally understood the concepts. And doing practice problems, I will happily admit, was so much fun.",
    "I wouldn't necessarily recommend Math 120 unless you need to take it to fulfill pre-med requirements or if you're planning on being a math major, because most people in it are VERY good at math. That being said, it does provide a natural follow-up to high school BC Calc and if you can appreciate the concepts despite the drudgery of the problem sets, the material is pretty interesting. Definitely keep up with the problem sets, and the practice tests on the course website are very helpful for the tests. Also watch out for the increase in difficulty from the first test to the second and third; it's really easy to get behind and the second test comes surprisingly quickly.If you do have to take Math 120 or you're thinking of majoring in math, TAKE IT WITH PROFESSOR FRAME. He is an incredibly talented teacher and a funny, lovable guy ... I truly enjoyed math class thanks to his jokes and stories. Get to registration way early, because his class will fill up immediately!",
    "This course was the most enjoyable of my classes fall of freshman year. I'm am certain this was due to the quality of the instruction of Michael Frame, who made the class fly by and seem simple even though we were handling the advanced topics of the course.Michael Frame was inspirational, brilliantly smart, funny, and incredibly kind -- in other words, just about best teacher I have met at Yale. He was always open to going over something again just for the sake of one student, and made the topics interesting and fun. His Prarie Home Companion jokes were golden.",
    "Only take this course if you are willing to put in a lot of time and effort, and only if you can take it with Professor Frame.",
    "Math 120 is a great continuation of high school AP Calculus BC. It adds vector functions of up to three variables to the repertoire of functions one may work with, as well as derivatives and integrals of these functions. Two- and three-dimensional line\/surface integrals are a big focus. Really fascinating material, and an organic continuation of earlier courses in calculus.",
    "If you need a QR and can get in professor Frame's class, then yes."
