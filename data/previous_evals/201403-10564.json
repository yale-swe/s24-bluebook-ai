   "comments": [
    "The course provides an opportunity for graduate students to grapple with the process of writing a research intensive paper in a demanding yet supportive environment. Prospective students should note that to take full advantage of the workshop dynamic of the course they should have at least basic fluency in the optics of gender and\/or sexuality prior to enrolling. I will heartily recommend the course to students interested in sharpening their research and writing skills generally and\/or producing a high-quality article.",
    "I would tell a fellow student that this is a great course to take if you wish to write a paper about the history of sexuality. The syllabus moves through all the relevant resources at Yale, and Professor Chauncey invests in each project so that the final paper is the best possible result.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to students interested in the history of sexuality, and seeking an opportunity to home a research paper or topic. The class is a combination of independent work, class sessions on various practical and theoretical aspects of research in the history of sexuality, and opportunities for intensive peer feedback. These parts are all balanced fairly well throughout the course of the semester, so it is a good class for students who have some previous background in gender and sexuality history, less so for students seeking an introduction to the topic."

   "comments": [
    "This course offered exactly what I was looking for - an opportunitynto read more deeply in my own interests and to conduct original research toward a potential topic. Even if I don't stick with this material, the course opened me up to current work that absolutely will stay with me.",
    "The course deepened my understanding of the academic writing and editing process from proposal to publication. In addition to providing me the opportunity to produce a strong draft of a potential project, though likely not my dissertation, it was most helpful on thinking about issues of framing and scale in research projects, and illuminating the process of publication."
