    "MATH 120 does not cover the most inspiring of math subjects. The problem sets are, for the most part, manageable. However, the content is completely bland. Professor Havlickova often teaches faster than a person can realistically write. The examples she provides in class also tend to be special cases, which do not help in completing the problem sets. She does not contribute much to the textbook.",
    "Overall, this course was very interesting, but also very theoretical and challenging. Towards the end, the problem sets became more difficult, but the tutoring sessions are a great resource when it comes to help when one is stuck doing these problems. Nonetheless, Miki is a great professor and does a good job at answering any questions that may arise.",
    "Basic course in multivariable calculus, I recommend it to anybody who will deal with math in his or her future job. It is evident that this course is taught already for several years.",
    "Great class. It get a little tough after the first midterm but it's extremely doable. It has a nice curve so you won't die over it. The tests (except the first one) can get a little tough. But it's good skills and just overall a great class.",
    "The curve is ridiculous. Averages are in the 90s. I would recommend it for students who like math and want to learn something. I would not recommend it for students who want to get an A to show off. Nonetheless, I loved the course (even though I hadn't taken math since BC Calc 2 years prior).",
    "Yes! It is a worthwhile course mostly as a building block for other math courses.",
    "Useful stuff for lots of future studies.",
    "Math 120 is a rewarding class. The pace is very quick, and the problem sets can be lengthy at times, but the amount of material covered in the semester is staggering. The exams are tough and everyone does extremely well - the top 50% is seeminglyonly distinguished through careless errors. This can be frustrating, but if one is a good math student and knows the material well, one can expect to do well.Overall, I really enjoyed the class and feel that it vastly and quickly expanded my knowledge of Calculus, so I would recommend it to another student, but I will admit that it is difficult (I felt a lot more so than BC Calculus), so one really has to be a good math student to expect to do well - the amount of calculator-free integrals one has to do puts a premium on conscientious work.",
    "While I was taking this class, I wouldn't have said it was enjoyable, but I left with a much greater understanding and appreciation of the subject. I am glad I took this course.",
    "The class depends entirely on which professor you have. Miki is very good at explaining the concepts, so I found myself learning a lot very quickly. However, I know a bunch of people taking the class that find their professors unbearably boring and impossible to understand. They have to teach themselves entirely out of the book. I would only recommend this class if you can take it with one of the good professors (I heard Lauer is good as well). Otherwise, I would consider ENAS 151, which I have heard is a very good class.",
    "Math 120 starts off fairly easy, but gets significantly more difficult as the course progresses. I would recommend it to any student who needs the 120 foundation for other classes or just likes math.I feel that the course material from 120 really helped me become much stronger even with the single-variable calculus concepts, as doing them all with multiple variables requires you to really know what's going on.Miki Havlickova was great!",
    "Yes, it is a big class where there is not that much of an interaction with fellow students or with professors, but it is an amazing course. If you have started taking Calculus, you must take this class--multivariable calculus wraps up very nicely what you've learned so far in calculus. Also, there may be a lot of bad reviews about this course, but it really depends on how you study. If you get stuff and spend some time, you'll find the course amazing.One caveat is that, since midterms and finals are easy, the key to getting good grades it not necessarily being good at math but more like avoiding careless mistakes.",
    "Content-wise, a very good course; I learned a lot. Just know that you may not get a good grade, even though you know and understand all of the material. I understand the rationale behind the curve, but it seems a little unethical to curve grades down below their raw score values.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student; most people take it out of requirement, however, and in that case, I would be wary of an extremely tight curve and, especially with this year's cancellation of ENAS 151, a large amount of smart students taking the class. Professor Havlickova was really nice and helpful, although the class does take a significant amount of outside learning time, particularly compared with lower-level math classes which don't require as much visualization to grasp the concepts.",
    "Yes. It's a lot of fun, I loved it!",
    "Assuming your instructor for Math 120 is good, it is an excellent class. I loved Havlickova's section. She is a very good teacher, explains things clearly, has a sense of humor, and is always on top of the material and on schedule. The material is never abstract to the point of meaninglessness, and though there may be some concepts that are difficult at first, I found everything to be perfectly manageable once I understood it. The exams can be challenging and\/or tricky at times but are never impossible. Math 120 ended up being one of my favorite courses of the semester and I would definitely recommend it.",
    "Math 120 is an interesting math course, however be aware that the averages in this class are ridiculously high, at least this semester. Many people in the class will have already taken multi-variable, but did not want to take the proof based class. The average on a test will usually be within the A range, with many people getting near perfect scores. The material is certainly manageable.",
    "Math 120 is a fine course; it's a prerequisite for the Math major and Physics 200 and 260, so there is not much to say. Obviously, take it if you are interested in Physics or Math. If you're not sure whether or not you are interested in Physics or Math, I'd say go ahead and take it.Miki (Prof Havlickova) is a good professor to take it with, certainly better than some of the others I've heard about. She is a little dry, but can be really funny sometimes. And it's exciting to have a female teacher in a field that is dominated by men. If you can't get into Michael Frame's section, Miki is a good bet.",
    "If its a requirement, take it. If not, don't.",
    "It is an awesome course. Havlickova is amazing! I would say Raj is another awesome teacher, he makes things very clearly and slowly. It is the first time I loved a math course, it makes you think spatially and develops your deep understanding of mathematics. I would recommend it much better than 115 because 120 takes for granted that you know how to integrate, which means that we don't have nearly as difficul integrals as in 115. The material is much more interesting and useful. The problem sets are hard sometimes but they are definitely doable. If you don't feel very cofident about integrals but know the basics I would definitely recommend it. Take it!",
    "Mathematics 120 covers multivariable calculus in a very visual way, particularly with the aid of the mathematics computer program. I would recommend it to anyone because I think that this is the highest level of math that anyone should take if they are planning on studying anything. Multivariable calc is simply a good thing to know.",
    "Surely",
    "Math 120 is a good intro to multi-variable and vector calculus. It isn't proof-based, so it really isn't that difficult. If you like math and are willing to do the homework, you will not only learn a lot from the class, but you'll do fine as well. The curve isn't the best, but that really shouldn't be the determining factor. Overall, it's a fun class, just make sure you get a professor you feel you can understand and approach for help if you need.",
    "I would definitely recommend it. This class really helps to expand your calculus knowledge.",
    "Yes if you are a science major because the information is useful in most of the fields of science.",
    "The class is pretty straightforward, and Professor Havlickova is great. I'm not sure multivariable calculus is the most interesting topic, but if you think it would interest you or need it for a major, take it (with Havlickova).",
    "If Marketa Havlickova (Miki) is teaching Math 120 again, take it with her. You will really learn the subject! She is a very engaging lecture and is always willing to help her students in any possible way. Her review sections for the test are GREAT! And if you have any question about the subject, go to her office hours! The thing about Math120 is that it starts REALLY EASY and suddenly it gets very hard. When you start learning Line Integrals, pay attention! The course will use that till the very last lecture. The three theorems that we learn at the end of the course are extremely hard (Green's, Stoke's and Divergence). And if you dont know every single thing you were supposed to learn at the beginning of the semester, good luck, my friend, you are getting a B or a C! I am an Econ Major and even though partial derivatives were very important, I dont think that everything I learnt in this course will be very useful (like those 3 theorems). If you like Math and like challenges, take it! But rest assured that people are very intense in this class!",
    "Reccomended if you need it for a major, if its for a QR, do 112.",
    "I definitely recommend it, but it's best to take it with a few friends so you can help each other out, especially after the second midterm."
