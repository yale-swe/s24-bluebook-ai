    "Well taught and a very interesting topic -- if you are looking to learn in-depth about the history of madness in the US and across the world, from asylums to the modern-day DSM-5, this is the seminar to take! Better yet, Courtney always asked us for \/ tried to incorporate our feedback, so it should be an even better course next year. Assignments were 1 midterm paper, four short 2-page reading responses (\"Think Pieces\"), and a final paper. She incorporated a lot of alternative-style material into classes too, like film clips and a field trip to an exhibit in the Medical Library, which was awesome since most of my seminars have been straight discussion. Workload was manageable but reading-intensive.",
    "Yes!",
    "Take it. Probably one of the best HSHM seminars.",
    "HSHM 464 takes you through topics like asylums, different ways in which people have constructed and diagnosed mental illness, etc, from about the 17th or 18th century to the present day. I would recommend it as a seminar for the major, but not necessarily if you want to take it because you're looking for a good class on mental illness. That being said, I think the course will improve over the years as the professor gains more experience, because the course did improve as the semester progressed. Also note that there is a lot of reading.",
    "Yes, take it if you can get in, you won't regret it!",
    "It's a good seminar for HSHM. I'd recommend it. 1 midterm paper, 1 final paper, 4 short thinkpieces. Reading is generally manageable and good. We discussed current events sometimes, which was the best part. Lots of small group discussion. It's a difficult topic to talk about, especially since people in the class may be taking it because they ARE mentally ill and want to talk about their personal experiences, but at the end of the day it's a history course. Anyway, I'll definitely think twice before calling anyone \"crazy\" again.",
    "An enjoyable yet challenging course that trains you to become better (whether you want to or not) and also learn about yourself in the process.Yes, I would recommend the course because of Prof. Thompson and the material covered.",
    "Cultural History of Mental Illness was a very interesting class. I personally wish that we had spent a little less time on the 1800s, and more time on the 20th and 21st centuries, though i do understand that that time period is more within Professor Thompson's interest. Overall the class was very good, especially for it being the first time the course was taught.That being said, the conclusion you really come to in this course is, \"There are a ton of different ways in which one can define mental illness. This has changed throughout history, caused a lot of problems, and will never be finalized into one succinct, efficient definition.\" If having an open ended class like this bothers you, than this may not be the class for you. But I thoroughly enjoyed the discussion.",
    "Excellent! Really got me thinking historically, and I found myself applying what I learned in conversations. My friends were always interested to hear what I learned from this class.",
    "Yes! This was my favorite course this semester. The material was very interesting and while Courtney encouraged us all to pursue these topics from the historian's perspective, I thought she also presented it with great sensitivity.",
    "Yes!!! One of the best seminsrs at Yale. I learned so much and the professor is also absolutely approachable. You learn so much and she loves giving and taking feedback equally. Absolutely take it!!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course! It was super interesting and enjoyable.",
    "HSHM seminar that looks at the definition and perception of mental illness throughout history. Lots of reading, but most of it is pretty interesting. In-class discussions were also helpful and thought-provoking.",
    "The course provides a great look at the history of mental illness as an idea and a concept throughout modern history. It is a great course to take if you are interested in what it means to be mentally ill and healthy."
