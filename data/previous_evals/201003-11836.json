   "comments": [
    "if you enjoy reading latin, take this. if you dont like reading latin, dont. it is very simplt.",
    "Latin 440 is for students who have had a good amount of experience in Latin. You must be able to translate at least 50 lines within two days and be able to translate on command in class.",
    "Take this class. Take this class. Take this class!!! It's PERFECT for the AP latin kid who wants to fulfill his language requirement OR who wants to delve into the classics department. This class is a great gateway or a great culmination. Solodow is a great professor, and the readings and topics he chooses are a lot of fun and thought-provoking.",
    "A reasonably okay Latin course with an okay prof and a wide variety of texts, some better than others. If you want your Latin to improve, it probably will. Don't expect great discussions of the content of the literature.",
    "I would strongly recommend this course. It was an enjoyable way to quickly sample Cicero, Horace, Catullus, and Pliny, and to solidify one's Latin skills before leaping to more advanced work. Class time was well divided between translating and discussion.",
    "This was a good first Latin class to take at Yale. I would recommend Professor Solodow and this class, as the workload was manageable and the course material was interesting (for the most part).",
    "I would recommend this course.",
    "I would certainly recommend the class if you are looking to fulfill an L5 Latin language requirement or if you have an interest in Latin and are looking to ease into the higher level courses.",
    "A good variety of texts, a good mix of prose and poetry... Solodow is courteous, moderately but never excessively demanding, and extremely learned; I certainly enjoyed the class and would recommend it to anyone interested in Latin language or literature. It is heavily focused on the actual languageand understanding what the text is saying on a basic level; if you're a Latin genius this would probably bore you, but for most (including myself) this is useful.",
    "Absolutely. Anyone interested in Latin would very much enjoy this material. Generally we either read a poem\/discuss earlier material - much of the class is translation\/analyzing.",
    "Roman Friendship surveys some Roman (and occasionally non-Roman) works of literature that address the theme of friendship.",
    "Yes, absolutely. More than the content of the course, Professor Solodow is one of the kindest, most patient, approachable spirits I've encountered at Yale. He made the course so enjoyable. Also, the texts we translated are very interesting and much of what was discussed about friendship in ancient Rome remains relevant today.Having taken this course my sophomore year at Yale after taking both AP Latin syllabi in high school (I didn't take any Latin at Yale freshman year), I found this course just the right level of difficulty. It wasn't a gut by any stretch of the imagination, and I wasn't up late translating extraordinarily long passages, either. Granted, translating at the beginning of the semester posed quite a difficulty, but your translating abilities will surely improve during the semester simply because you'll be translating so much material.In short, I highly recommend it.",
    "Latin 440 involved several paragraphs of Latin translation each class, 2-3 short essays (2 pages), 2 polished translations to be handed in (one paragraph each), a few quizzes, and 2 exams.While discussion focused on friendship in ancient Rome as seen through the texts we read, our class time was also spent on a variety of issues which were raised, including etymology, some grammar points, history, and other matters.Take this course if your Latin is good, in terms of knowing your grammar and having a solid base of vocabulary. If not, it proves difficult and time-consuming, but nonetheless quite worthwhile."
