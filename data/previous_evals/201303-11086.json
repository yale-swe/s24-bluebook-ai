    "A really well-taught survey course about modern American novels. I would highly recommend it, as the books you read and the teaching are great.",
    "Definitely take it if you're willing to do the reading! It's a novel a week which is doable, but you might not be able to do all of it which is fine as long as you've caught up by the final. That being said, it's worth all the work and it's very enjoyable if you enjoy reading novels. I would recommend it, but watch out for the English majors who are most likely taking it as an elective\/easier class for the schedule. Other than that, it's truly wonderful.",
    "Yes I would recommend it! Amazing reading list, amazing professor, and good TAs!",
    "This is a really great class if you're looking for an excuse to have a really great list of novels to read during the semester. The grading was a little hard but I still loved it. The books Hungerford chose this year were great and her lectures were beyond amazing - there were quite a few where I felt really profoundly moved by them. Definitely definitely recommend!",
    "Amazing course. I echo all previous evaluations of this course- it's one of the best I've taken at Yale. Something notable about the course is that it's equally accessible to English majors and majors in completely unrelated fields- you just might have to put a little extra work in. If you're a non major who just wants the opportunity to read great novels, I would strongly recommend not taking it credit d but instead taking it for a grade, because if you credit d it you'll probably end up not even reading the books anyway!!! It's so worth it to get the most you can out of this course.",
    "A lot of reading but it includes a great reading list, would recommend if you enjoy doing a lot of reading.",
    "I took this class because of the books on the reading list that I had always wanted to read, but honestly, if that is your goal, just read them on your own. The lectures focus heavily on historical context and literary form, and will not necessarily enhance your enjoyment of the novels. But if you like literary analysis, these are some great books to analyze.",
    "This class is harder than you think it will be, but not too bad, especially if you want a Cr\/D course. There's a book a week, you've probably read at least one before, and some are much more interesting than others. The reading gets a little heavy and dull in the middle, but gets better in the end. There are 3 papers over the course of the term, all about 6 pages each, though 2 are on a single book + topic while the final was either a parody of a book or a 4-book, 2-topic synthesis (which is no joke and very very difficult to write well). Grading was kind of tough, but as always that depends on your TF. The final exam was reasonable. Take it if the reading list looks interesting to you and you don't mind putting a bit more work than you might expect in--but it's not as much of a \"must-take\" as it's sometimes made out to be.",
    "If you have time to read the novels.",
    "take it.",
    "I am very glad to have read all these books, and Amy Hungerford is an engaging lecturer. A little masculine, but much less than I'd have expected from a course on this period. A book a week can get rough, and there are three essays and THEN a final, but I'm very glad to have taken this class. It's on Open Yale Courses, but I would not have gotten as much out of it if I had read the books at my leisure later.",
    "Take this class! I think this is a great class for anyone who is interested in reading novels and having Amy Hungerford weave a beautiful web of knowledge from each book you read. I have a new appreciation for all the books we read and even ones I did not like I enjoyed learning about in class. Amy Hungerford is amazingly smart and you can learn so so much from her. Be warned though that the pace is a book a week and that is hard to keep up with. I had to finish several of the books during finals week to prepare for the final. If you go to lecture and read the books you will love this class.",
    "A fantastic course, I would definitely recommend it to English majors and non-English majors alike. Hungerford is a great lecturer--normally I can't pay attention to a whole lecture but I always found hers engaging. It puts the book in their historical context, but also spends plenty of time working directly with the text and doing close reading, not limiting readings to any sort of artificial historical narrative. There's a lot of reading, but it's ultimately pretty manageable.",
    "American Novel Since 1945 is a really great class. Amy Hungerford is really great; she knows her stuff and lectures really well. The syllabus is stellar, too. That said, if you can't keep up with the reading, you might want to take it Cred\/D, because it's about a book a week, and you get infinitely more out of lecture when you've read the book she's talking about. Still, a great class to take if you want to get some literature into your schedule without compromising the amount of time and effort you spend on your major. (It's probably great for English majors, too, but I wouldn't know.) Two analytic papers, one synthesis or parody paper, one final. Managable if you've read the books and paid attention in lecture.",
    "Really wonderful course with absolutely fabulous lectures! Great American credit for English majors, but a bunch of non-English majors also take it and really enjoy it. I didn't love all of the reading, but Professor Hungerford has incredibly interesting lectures on all of the material and really makes you appreciate each work. Definitely take it!!",
    "Absolutely - You'll read some fantastic authors, and learn about their mini-histories and the context they wrote in during lecture. Sure, you could read the syllabus on your own, or watch the lectures online, but the experience of this class itself is well worth enrolling. I took it because I was a perspective English or Am. Studies major, andlearned along the way that English was what I wanted to study (if that's helpful for any other perspective students of either major!)",
    "This is a survey of American novels since 1945, though I wouldn't say it's particularly representative of any sort of comprehensive canon of American novels in this time period--I guess it's a pretty difficult period of novel-writing to define, but the reading list can get pretty depressing and bizarre.",
    "Absolutely take it!",
    "I would recommend it to anyone who has always wanted to read some great American literature and learn tools to understand each book's impact on the story of the evolution of the American novel.",
    "Yes. You should not graduate having not read these books.",
    "It's tough, you know, doing a novel a week. Some of the novels are damn complcated to get through without falling asleep. One of them could change the way you look at the world. There's so much potential in this course, but it doesn't come from Hungerford or the TF \u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0it comes from the person reading the novels and the kind of attention\/interest you put into it. I mean, shit, you could just take the class on OpenCourses \u00e2\u0080\u0093 for yourself and not for credit \u00e2\u0080\u0093 if you were really into the material already. In terms of evaluation, the papers are difficult for non-English majors but worth it to sharpen\/hone your analysis of language. The final wasn't fun and was obviously not an accurate representation of how one reads novels.",
    "American Novel is an interesting class, but requires a lot of reading. I wouldn't recommend taking it Credit\/D - you won't be motivated enough to do all the reading.",
    "Great lectures and amazing syllabus, but annoying dependence on TFs. I would take it again just to make myself read the books.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. Overall, it's a really fun experience that is generally manageable work-wise. The reading load can seem kind of overwhelming, but you read what you can and skim the rest. The class is a great way to read a bunch of books you may not have otherwise read in an academic but low stress environment.",
    "It was a great class with a significant amount of reading but ultimately was very rewarding.",
    "Highly recommend this class to someone who is looking to read some good fictional books and isn't an english major. The professor and the reading list are great.",
    "Take it! This is a must take before you leave Yale. Even though Amy's course is online, it really is so valuable to have section to talk about these books because they seriously will change your life.",
    "I took it Credit\/D\/Fail in order to read some really good, important books and to hear someone smart lecture about them -- and that's exactly what I got. I was so happy to have read 9 (not all 12) completely different, historically relevant, and enjoyable novels; I probably won't do that again for a very long time. And Professor Hungerford's lectures were so thought-provoking and insightful. Great course!",
    "Take this course. The books are American classics that you should read anyways.",
    "An awesome tour of 12 important novels. There is a ton of reading, and you have to do all of it, but come on, you're reading pretty cool stuff. And Hungerford is amazing.",
    "AMAZING class, especially if you're taking it Credit\/D. The workload is substantial (1 novel a week), but if you're taking it Credit\/D it'll be ok. The reading list is always incredible, and Prof. Hungerford is one of the best lecturers I've ever had. She's so smart and is able to infuse each novel with so much meaning in each short lecture. Definitely take this class if you can!",
    "I loved reading the books. While I didn't particularly like Prof. Hungerford, she is smart and offers great insights into the texts. This is a tough course so I was happy with my decision to Cr\/D.",
    "Incredible class. Exactly what a lecture should be.Professor Hungerford is perfect. Her wit and occasional irreverence make an already interesting course just that much more pleasant.",
    "READ THE BOOKS ON TIME. It'll only bite you in the ass at the end, plus they're all great.",
    "I would recommend this class to any student at Yale. Hungerford is the best lecturer I've ever had, and I came away from the class feeling like I learned a lot. The amount of reading is a lot of times overwhelming, but that doesn't negate the fact that it's a class worth taking.",
    "This wilk be the best class you will ever take at Yale! Just be mindful that you have to read a book a week, so don't fall behind.",
    "LOTS OF REQUIRED READING THAT YOU CANNOT SKIP. SERIOUSLY BE READY TO READ YOUR BUTT OFF. Really worth it though and didn't end up consuming my life or anything.",
    "YES YES YES! Take this! I was nervous given my lack of lit background at Yale, but the professor and TAs really help you integrate into the material regardless of your comfort level.Also -- you get to read good books... as homework... what's better than curling up on your couch with a cup of tea and an amazing book and then getting credit for it?!",
    "An enriching curriculum of American novels with excellent analysis by Professor Hungerford. Challenging, but would definitely recommend.",
    "American Novel is possibly the best class I have taken at Yale. TAKE IT.",
    "Great course for people of all majors. Professor Hungerford is a very engaging lecturer. It's 3 essays and a final exam. Be warned: the final exam is hard, and you'll have to have read all the books to do well. I started this class credit\/d but then switched to a grade because I realized I was getting much out of the class by going to lecture without having read the books.",
    "If you have any interest at all in contemporary literature (or literature in general for that matter), you should ABSOLUTELY take this course. The novels are all incredible, and none are overwhelmingly long, if that factors into your decision - the book-a-week pace will not feel nearly as daunting as it seems. Professor Hungerford's lectures are incredibly compelling and always worthwhile. Even if you think you know how a particular novel works, you will always leave lecture thinking about the books in a new light. I'd highly recommend this class to anyone looking for an English course.",
    "Take this course! It's not only a great survey course in great American fiction, but you read a variety of different types of \"novels\" as well. You have your classicslike Beloved and Lolita, and then you have some curveballs like Jimmy Corrigan or Lost in the Funhouse. Plus, Professor Hungerford changes the syllabus every year, and some years you get to pick the final book as a class! Professor Hungerford's lectures are engaging and interesting, and they do a good job of putting the books in conversation with one another so that the class doesn't become a mere book club. Instead, you learn how the form changes and stayed the same over the time period, and how the authors might have been influenced by one another or by previous literary tradition. A great class for both majors and non-majors, but keep in mind that there is a large amount of work and reading that you almost definitely will fall behind in at some point during the semester. However, if you're diligent and catch up over breaks and such (and if you're taking this course, you should find pleasure in reading!) you'll end up with a great and rewarding experience!",
    "Take this class-- the reading list is phenomenal, the lectures are even better, section can be (and was for me) incredibly rewarding (with the right TF) and the workload is very manageable: three 5-page papers, one of which gives you the option to write a parody of any of the authors on the syllabus. My advice for those taking this course would be to do the parody assignment; it's fun and exciting to exercise a creative muscle that you might not often use at Yale. The final exam is tough and requires a pretty close knowledge of each of the books, so unless you're taking it credit-D, make sure you find time to read the books you missed over the course of the semester.",
    "I would summarize the class as an in-depth look at several novels that somehow affected the American novel through style, subject, or otherwise in very significant ways. I would recommend this class to another student because I enjoyed the opportunity to read novels that I hadn't been introduced to in high school and were culturally important."
