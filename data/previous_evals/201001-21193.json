    "I would not recommend it, but it is a requirement, so we all have to take it. I would describe it as a hoop we have to jump through, and explain that if you do not have a project set early on (preferably before the school year starts), and are not certain you can get the necessary data in the time frame permitted, you will not be able to be successful.",
    "For all the reasons stated above, I would not recommend this course. However, it is mandatory.",
    "Not one of my favorite courses, but a helpful forum for your budding research interests. It is worth taking, at the very least, as preparation for workshop presentations.",
    "A first, messy attempt at writing an academic paper. Wouldn't recommend it, but you don't have a choice.",

   "comments": [
    "It was good to take some time to develop\/rethink my dissertation topic.",
    "It has made me a bit more cynical about the discipline\/profession. Big questions are discouraged. It did, inadvertently, help me rule out an area of the field for my dissertation work.",
    "This course does not contribute to our dissertation research. We were pressured to come up with a topic and data in just a few weeks. Also, when discussing alternative ideas, the instructors were extremely narrow-minded.",
    "The course broadened my knowledge of the disciple quite a bit by introducing me to the research programs of my colleagues. It contributed to my dissertation research by giving me a practice run at a dissertation idea.",
    "If designed appropriately, this course has the potential to serve a crucial role in deepening the knowledge of the profession. As it stands now, however, the faculty are not committed to devoting the time and effort to redesigning it and making it useful. As a result students receive mixed signals and have a hard time taking it seriously.",
    "TBD. So far, not too much."
