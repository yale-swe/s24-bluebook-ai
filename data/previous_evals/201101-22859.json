   "comments": [
    "Absolutely take this class. Speaking as a second semester senior, I think I can safely say this was either my second favorite class at Yale. I came into this course not knowing what to expect, and left feeling like I had happened upon one of those rare jewels of classes that help to define one's Yale experience. The course readings were all fascinating and often felt connected to my own life. Professor Dudley also does a great job of picking a diverse group of students from different fields and contexts, which makes for a lively and substantive seminar each week.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. I was worried it was going to be too theoretical but Professor Dudley always kept the discussion interesting and not too abstract.",
    "TAKE IT TAKE IT TAKE IT.",
    "See above",
    "American Communities is a fabulous class. I would highly recommend that other students take it. The readings were awesome. Topics ranged from school shootings and heroin addicts to rural farms and factory workers. There were 150-300 pages of reading a week and a fairly intensive weekly reading response, but the pages and reading responses were well worth it becauseDudley runs a focused seminar during which students really feel like they are learning about the structure and tensions in communities. Seminar discussions and weekly readings make the three 5-7 page papers fairly easy to write.Tip: Professor Dudley might initially seem intimidating but she is accessible and brilliant, so make sure to go to her office hours.",
    "The course is highly analytical - stay away if you're uncomfortable with anthro-heavy work or very rigorous grading. Professor Dudley is brilliant, however, and the ethnographies are fascinating."
