   "comments": [
    "I learned lots of awesome and fun things about tonal and chromatic harmony, and about several different idioms of western music (sonatas, art songs, opera, etc). I had a couple chances to compose and did a good amount of analysis work, both of which helped me improve my understanding of the foundations of harmony in music.",
    "Musical analysis tools, basics of composition, sonata form",
    "An ability to easily analyze music at a high level.",
    "Learned a lot about music theory",
    "Learned a lot about technical music theory as well as about the intuitions and nuances a musician should grasp.",
    "I feel like I revived a strong base in chromatic harmony and sonata form. Although I still have a lot of work to do by myself over the next few years, I feel like I now have a framework from which to approach it. I understand where my weaknesses are (ear training!) and I learned where my strengths are, and how to keep improving.",
    "I gained knowledge of chromatic music theory and its usage in composition.",
    "In this class, I gained insight in the compositional methods of 19th Century composers. The class solidified my understanding of chromatic harmonies and gave me broad perspective on various musical forms of the period. The daily homework assignments strengthened my ability to analyze music more quickly and at a deeper level.",
    "Essential knowledge of sonata form, lied, opera, and more; development of composition skills and harmonic analysis; overview of chromatic harmony; insight into how composers of various time periods used these techniques in their pieces."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The course was great! No weaknesses",
    "I really enjoyed how much exposure this course offers to several pieces of the Western canon. A weakness if that the time for lengthy discussion of excerpts is lost a little as the end of the semester approaches.",
    "The Professor was amazing",
    "Structured well to include aspects of both harmony and form encompassing various styles of music (instrumental\/vocal, lieder\/operas\/sonatas, etc.)",
    "I LOVED this course. I found it fun and engaging. The only part I didn't necessarily love was the Schubert song work, but I understand why it was useful and necessary. However, I would have loved to take some of that Schubert time and go more in depth into a few chromatic topics or cover more chromatic topics.",
    "Strengths: very informative, great format Weaknesses: could benefit from some more rigid structure",
    "The pace of the course wasn't consistent throughout. Some of the material was rushed, while we spent over a month on certain concepts. The concepts we dwelled on were especially difficult either, so the class lulled at times. On the other hand, some concepts we rushed through in a week and weren't able to thoroughly discuss. Besides that, the material in the course was well taught and I felt confident in analyzing music efficiently by the end of the course. All the assignments felt like they had a purpose and benefited my understanding of the course material.",
    "The course offered a lot of opportunity to practice the things discussed in class, through part-writing and analysis. The bigger projects offered a lot of options and were fun and instructive. A large number of topics were covered in comparison to 210; I think more practice in the beginning of the semester would be helpful for those who just came from the previous course."

    "You get exactly what you'd expect from this class. Theory and Composition. If you like that stuff, go for it. If not, don't. I enjoyed it, but if (like me) you aren't a music major and music isn't a huge part of your life, expect to feel a little left out. It's getting to the point on the music track where most of the people in the class are majors with an incredibly solid intuitive grasp of music and tonal harmony and a considerable amount of experience. I came from 110 to 210 to 211, which is the \"normal\" progression, but I still felt as though I wasn't on the same playing field as some of the other students in the class. Basically, if you aren't already very skilled at theory and composition, don't expect this class to suddenly make you good, any more than 110 or 210 could. You'll come out knowing some more cool stuff about theory in various areas of western music, and that's about it, unless you're seriously dedicated to music.",
    "Yes! For everyone who wants to really get to know music theory this course is a must!",
    "Yes! This is a great course for developing an insight in music theory. A lot of chromatic techniques are discussed. Composers especially will benefit from expanding their arsenal.",
    "Definitely",
    "Yes, very much so. I found the work fun and enjoyable.",
    "Yes - it is essential for anyone looking to master music theory",
    "Yes, the course was a great way to strengthen your ability to analyze music. It's solidifies your understanding of how music is constructed and gives you a greater perspective on how composers write effective music.",
    "I'm not a music major but I would really recommend this class to any musician. Professor McCreless is a wonderful instructor and the topics covered help you gain better understanding of what's going on in music from Mozart to The Beatles. Some chromatic techniques seem really out there but you get tons of examples of how composers used them in their music. Not only did this course teach me more music theory, it also instructed my playing."
