    "I gained a thorough understanding of behavioral finance.",
    "I felt like I gained an appreciation of the current literature and history of behavioral finance and the place of behavioral finance as a field in relation to the rest of finance. Since my priors already leaned towards behavioral explanations, it was fun to see the arguments for things I had previously thought about fleshed out and given a more concrete footing. I think my favorite parts of this course were the discussions on limits to arbitrage and the discussions of extrapolative beliefs. I also had many research ideas come to me while I was taking this course which is probably one of the unofficial goals of this course accomplished.",
    "A good understanding of the field of behavioral finance and how it is organized",
    "- overview of major facts concerning financial markets - think about anomalies in a structured way - major themes of behavioral finance",
    "This course was very good as an overview of behavioral finance. The lectures are very well organized and intuition is explained well. By taking this course, you really get a good sense of the entire field.",
    "A great introduction to the field of behavioural finance"

   "comments": [
    "The class was structured in a very methodical fashion where each topic built on the previous one. While many of the topics covered were challenging, they were presented in a very intuitive manner. An extensive reading list was provided which allowed students to dive into material they found particularly interesting.",
    "Strengths: Extremely Organized - This is a rarity especially in PhD courses which seem to be taught in an extremely ad-hoc fashion. Frankly it was refreshing. Lecture Quality - This may be a trivial thing but Nick has a good cadence to his voice which make it easy to listen to for 3 hours at a time. This isn't especially rare among lecturers but it is very appreciated. Respectful of Time - I appreciate that Nick planned out his courses in such a way there were generous breaks halfway through and he never went over. I think this contributed to knowledge retention in class. Weaknesses: HW - This is a very minor one and I actually am torn on this one because I think that the HW assignments for Nick's class were actually very well done. However, I don't know if they are really conducive to what the ostensible goal of this class is. Especially for the PhD students, I feel that the goal of this class should be to immerse ourselves in the literature of Behavioral Finance and get a good grounding for research going forward. Since we are PhD students we like to do things well and I found that sometimes the time I was spending on the HW's (to do them well) detracted from my course reading. I don't know if there is a right answer to this but I would have liked to see the HW's help us to read more of the papers rather than less of them. That being said I actually really enjoyed doing the HW's. The research proposal and the second HW were my favorites. I had fun thinking about those and feel like I learned a lot. HW 1 though was a tad vague for my taste. I had no idea if what I got was acceptable or not and it almost felt like trying to pull a magic trick to match the historical moments. The whole time I was doing that assignment I was thinking, \"Man, if this was my own research project I would have abandoned it ages ago because there really is not much here to work with.\" It just felt like trying to save a malformed research project which is never fun for anyone.",
    "Strengths - I get a good understanding of the field - I get a hint of where to do research in the field Weakness - I still have not gotten my homework back so feedback is a bit lacking",
    "+ well structured presentation of material + great introduction to\/overview of literature - personally, I would have liked to see some topics captured in slightly more mathematical form",
    "Strengths: Lectures and lecture notes are clear and well organized. You don't need very much prerequisite knowledge of finance or psychology to take the course- all of the intuition is explained well. More advanced students can read the papers suggested in the syllabus to get a more in-depth view of the field. Weaknesses: If you are looking for a rigorous exploration of the models of behavioral finance, this course does not go into that much detail.",
    "The course is very well structured. Though more feedback on homework assignments be great."

    "I would certainly recommend this course to another student.",

    "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in finance. The ideas presented in this class are different from what you would see in an average finance class, but they are interesting and relate-able. Many of the concepts you will see in this course are applicable to real life and may cause you to re-evaluate your decision-making process!",
