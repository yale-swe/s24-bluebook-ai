    "Absolutely! My favorite class this year.",
    "Useful for anyone looking to learn more about legal systems, colonial Latin America, or the history of empires in the Atlantic World.",
    "The course provides a tour of recent work on legal history in Latin America. Particular areas of emphasis are the ways in which indigenous people and (ex) slaves used\/shaped the law, and the processes by which Early Modern legal codes gave way to constitutionalism. I would enthusiastically recommend the class to anyone interested in Latin American, legal, and\/or Atlantic history."
