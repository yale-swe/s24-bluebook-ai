   "comments": [
    "I definitely think you should bring back the option to exempt out with sufficient work experience. The first session content was extremely elementary. The presentation and interview sessions were great. The pitch session wasn't very helpful, I think because the coach we ended up with by chance was less effective at providing feedback than some of the others we've seen. I guess that's a function of there being 10 or so coaches - some are better than others.",
    "This course would have been more useful if students were permitted to identify and focus on specific tasks they know they need work on. For example, I feel confident in my public speaking and interviewing skills but would like more work on professional or cover letter writing.",
    "This course is truly a waste of time, and only contributed unnecessary stress. I would expect this type of a seminar at the undergraduate level, but at the graduate-level its paternalistic. I feel that if an individual needs help with an interview or working their resume, the career services office is available to them at their convenience. But to force every student, regardless of their past professional experience, to take this course is absolutely unnecessary, a complete waste of time, and it frustrated me being forced to attend such a simplistic, redundant course.",
    "I feel like this is one of those classes that we students don't appreciate while we take it, but we will really feel thankful for once we begin preparations for interviews and applications. I learned a lot, especially about interviews, body language, and how to answer those difficult questions.",
    "It was a good course and helped me develop my professional skills. The mock interviews and pitches were fantastic in my personal development.",
    "I think the best part, and more informative, was the practice interview.",
    "Covered pertinent skills for professional success I think all grad programs should have a required course like this Wish we got more thorough feedback on public speaking skills",
    "Very helpful in developing public speaking and personal marketing skill sets.",
    "This was a good course--I found the skills I learned and the information presented to be helpful.",
    "I think it was great. I felt that it helped me improve greatly on things i didn't even know i was doing during presentations and interviews. i really liked the taping and reqatching ourselves because even though it was awkward and time consuming to practice it was a good way to look at see ourselves objectively.",
    "I enjoyed the time that I got to spend with the coaches in small groups. I learned a lot from each of the sessions. I would say that what we learned in the lectures themselves was not very helpful and should either be more specific or should not be included at all and should just be done in our group sessions.",
    "I learned some valuable skills. However, would not recommend having the reflective, goal setting aspects on day 1 - instead, would appreciate more concrete experience about how to write a cover letter and a resume, as well as effective skills to network and apply to jobs, and get a response when I apply to something and do not hear back. Overall, watching myself on video was good, but the coaches were not all that helpful. Would recommend hiring more young, relatable coaches with more training on how to provide constructive feedback that's more nuanced that \"don't uptalk.\"",
    "This seminar was unnecessary, patronizing, and a waste of valuable time for graduate students who are returning to school from the workforce. I do not feel like I was treated like an fellow adult or a person with work experience. In addition, much of the advice from lecture slides or the coaches provided was out of date, patronizing, or simply not relevant to my sector. It was also rigidly structured as if the way they viewed how interviews or networking was the only way that people conduct themselves in the professional world, which is simply not true. It would have been immensely more helpful to require students make an appointment at the Career Center to focus on a professional skill area that they feel they need to develop than a weekly 3 hour course which covered basic skills that many of us have regularly practiced since high school. I cannot believe that I paid money, let alone as much as I do in tuition, to take this course. I was also disappointed that a seminar from Yale University on this topic was so out of touch. I highly recommend that YSPH no longer require this course for students with work experience.",
    "I thought the video interviews were helpful for me to watch how I am in an interview. I thought the presentation feedback was helpful as well. I thought the examples mock interviews that were showed in class (with the girl who did a \"bad\" and \"good\" interview) was not helpful at all. No one in the class would act so terribly in an interview. It would have been more helpful to show a realistic bad interview, like one where the student got nervous and didn't say anything or didn't give a good example of something, etc. That would be much easier to relate to and learn from. No one is going into an interview with food and say inappropriate things.",
    "The slides about writing effectively had typos. Did not inspire confidence in the instructors' advice about writing. What was most helpful was watching myself on tape.",
    "It's good - I learned important life skills.",
    "strengths: give us practical advice on interview preparations. weakness: i think maybe can add more lectures, 4 lectures seems not enough.",
    "Much of the information presented would have easily been found in a simple google search, or just from previous coursework prepping for college. However, the presentation practices were useful and feedback helped a lot to improve one's own skills for presenting.",
    "I love how they provided us with the lecture notes so that I can get back to the notes whenever. I also like how they let us practice the skills we've learned, and videotape our performance so that we can assess our own performance.",
    "It was beneficial to get strategies on professional skills. It could be beneficial if we had particular jobs, professional schools, or interviews in mind or coming up to utilize this to our advantage.",
    "I like that the school teaches practical skills. Thought i think it's being taught at not the best time of the year which is when the students start school & professional skills is not the priority. At least students should be given choices or taught at a different time of the year, or help students understand the importance of the skill in the nearest future.",
    "Professional Skills is a worthwhile course, but some of the concepts covered by the career services team were elementary. The interview portion was particularly useful and helpful.",
    "I wish the instructor had used examples that weren't so obviously inappropriate. For some of the examples, it would have been nice if he had consisted of some acceptable behaviors as well as subtle inappropriate ones.",
    "This course was only useful for those who have never worked after graduating from college. This course was not helpful for me because I already have professional experience.",
    "The most useful element of this course is the practice component: being able to practice interviewing, networking, pitching. I'm not sure any students learned anything radically new through the content of the presentations. But the practice is always valuable.",
    "The course is not useful for professionals. It is very basic, it is too shallow to be useful. In terms of strengths, it is nice the to have personal feedback, although it can be generic and rushed. The course demands too much time for what students gain from it. It would be much better if it were given in a workshop format over one day.",
    "I understand the purpose of this seminar, but I did not find it to be that resourceful, even as a student who recently graduated from college. Instead, maybe students can be given guidelines to study themselves, and sign up for an individual session with the team throughout the school year. I also feel as if it would be more appropriate for students with work experience to elect-out.",
    "Great",
    "Too loosely structured to adequately address ethics in public health.",
    "NA",
    "Some of the visiting lecturers in the course need to be replaced. There is too much variability in information and delivery of the material.",
    "It was fine. In the future, they should acknowledge how the advice they give us should be adapted to different situations. The course was too focused on preparing us for the corporate world."

    "Instructor: William Albert Vance \u00a0Can't really evaluate him because he only gave the introductory talks. He's a great public speaker.",
    "Instructor: William Albert Vance \u00a0William was sometimes helpful, but also sometimes made slightly inappropriate comments to students that could be taken very offensively.",
    "Instructor: William Albert Vance \u00a0Mr. Vance did a good job of providing good overviews of the different subjects, but I feel the coaches and their feedback was even more helpful.",
    "Instructor: William Albert Vance \u00a0He was good. He knew what he was talking about and relayed his message and strategies very effectively.",
    "Instructor: William Albert Vance \u00a0Very engaged and helpful with information and tips.",
    "Instructor: William Albert Vance \u00a0Great. very knowlegable. obviously cares about his work and wants us to do well. very good at imparting information to a group of students.",
    "Instructor: William Albert Vance \u00a0Mr. Vance said some concerning things during our small group break-out sessions. He seemed to judge non-English speakers differently even before hearing them speak. He also commented on several girls' appearances and commented how \"smart\" or \"not smart\" their hair and glasses made them look. This impeded my ability to learn from him, even though I imagine the content provided was very helpful.",
    "Instructor: William Albert Vance \u00a0The instructor was often patronizing in how he talked to students and assumed that we had never been introduced to basic skills in the professional world, rather than assessing what we knew. I did not feel like I was being treated like an adult who was returning to school after years of working. Instead, many of us felt like we were being treated like high school students who had never had an interview or wrote an email to a colleague. Much of his advice was also out-dated and not relevant to my sector.",
    "Instructor: William Albert Vance \u00a0I thought that William Vance was at times insulting. I don't think that he meant to be but he was condescending. I don't need William Vance to tell me that I need to wear makeup to an interview, that was unnecessary.",
    "Instructor: William Albert Vance \u00a0He did fine!",
    "Instructor: William Albert Vance \u00a0Strengths - made powerpoints interesting.",
    "Instructor: William Albert Vance \u00a0William is perfect, no matter the way he taught or the contents he included in the lecture. I really like him!",
    "Instructor: William Albert Vance \u00a0Instructor was adequate, but he often monotonous during some segments of the presentation.",
    "Instructor: William Albert Vance \u00a0He is really passionate about this course and provide very good suggestions!",
    "Instructor: William Albert Vance \u00a0Mr. Vance is excellent. He seems to enjoy teaching the professional skills course and he does it well. Most of his assistants are good too.",
    "Instructor: William Albert Vance \u00a0The instructor presented on interesting topics, and did a good job at conveying good public speaking skills.",
    "Instructor: William Albert Vance \u00a0Great",
    "Instructor: William Albert Vance \u00a0Insightful",
    "Instructor: William Albert Vance \u00a0NA",
    "Instructor: William Albert Vance \u00a0Both Professors Stowe and Redlich know a lot and were lovely. But the other drop in professors were extremely variable. One gave no notes, another gave a talk that they used perhaps for residents or MD classes, a third gave a talk that seemed to be directed to high school students without a lot of information. Industrial hygiene, injuries, disaster, war\/VA were very good. Pulmonary and Agriculture\/Food industy were poor I would have preferred a little more consistency, so that I could come out feeling i got my money's worth and that I had gotten solid knowledge in the field. Rob Klein's lecture was, I think the best and most educational."

    "I wouldn't recommend this course if it's offered in the middle of the semester like ours was. I would have gotten much more out of it if it was offered during winter break when there are no other assignments to worry about and I could have actually put effort into preparing all the presentations\/pitches\/etc. That's not to say the experience was completely obsolete, I just didn't get as much out of it as I would have liked because in theory this kind of seminar is invaluable in the real world! People pay thousands of dollars to partake in a weekend seminar like this.",
    "Professional skills is so important and has so much potential, but the current structure of the course isn't conducive for being very beneficial.",
    "You won't see the results of this class immediately, but its very helpful!",
    "This course was very helpful in resume feedback and interviewing skills so I definitely recommend it. I do think it could be cut down to 2-3 sessions.",
    "I would highly recommend this class to fellow students and recommend that they take advantage of the professional assistance to improve their brand.",
    "Great! EVen though it feels time consuming it is very useful and the skill set you get that you can look back on and improve on in your own time is invaluable.",
    "Required. Helpful in that you learn how to answer the question \"tell us about yourself\" and get to watch yourself talk in a mock interview. Definitely not the best use of time, but I get why they have us do it.",
    "Remember, we are consumers and we pay thousands of dollars in tuition for our courses. Please advocate for yourself and demand that we have better quality in the professional skills seminar or that students with work experience not be required to take this basic course.",
    "A little helpful to learn craft your pitch and see your body language in an interview. Overall, as someone who has more than 4 years work experience post college, not very helpful.",
    "Easy, no worries.",
    "It is about learning professional and speaking skills - I would recommend it since it is a good skill to have in their toolbox.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend to student who are also willing to find a job after graduation.",
    "Some of the information and skills sets learned are useful, but others are repetitive. If you have never taken a course on career or college prep then this course will be extremely valuable. Otherwise, the course was a lot of information that could have been found elsewhere and did not require the large amount of time set every week to go over it.",
    "I waived off this course",
    "I would recommend this course to fellow students, because I think it was really helpful in assessing my own performance in professional skills, which would be really helpful during job hunting:)",
    "I would only recommend it to a student if they had an idea of what their next step was or were interviewing for a position. Otherwise, it is difficult to utilize effectively.",
    "I would recommend the the professional skills course to all students. It is essential for students who have never held a full time job., in particular.",
    "This course doesn't really teach you any professional tips or tricks that will be new to you. However, it does provide a valuable opportunity for you to practice elevator pitches, networking, and interview skills with fellow students, which is an invaluable opportunity that you should take somewhat seriously. You get out of it that which you put in.",
