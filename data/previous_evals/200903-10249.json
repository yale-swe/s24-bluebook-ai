   "comments": [
    "It is a course that deals with how ethnography, fieldwork and theory are mutually entwined and are indispensable elements for anthropology. I would definitely recommend this course, because it allows students to have critical and creative thinking and turn into something of their own, while receiving what one must know of anthropology.",
    "Anth 500 is an in-depth look at the development of anthropology in general, and ethnographic writing in particular, through the 1960s and early 1970s. I would certainly recommend this course to any first-year anthropology student. In addition to being required for exams, it's a great way to develop an understanding of what the \"project of anthropology\" is and has been over the last century, and where one's own research fits into it.",
    "I wholeheartedly recommend this course to any student interested in a career in anthropology. I think it is impossible to contribute to the discipline without an understanding of what came before us.",
    "I would certainly recommend it for anyone entering the field of anthropology, regardless of their sub-field. In fact, it would be great if the department could somehow coordinate a few required courses that were shared by all of the incoming doctoral students across the subfields."

   "comments": [
    "This was an introductory course intended to introduce students to historiography of anthropological method and thought. It was a very helpful foundational course.",
    "It helps me to understand and rethink that the development of anthropology is not a sequence of ideas or various labelled categories of theories, but instead, a refined yet creative process. Not only does it provide anthropological knowledge that is must-have, this course also serves as a solid foundation for future research and exploration of the discipline.",
    "It expanded my knowledge of the discipline immeasurably, as this was the first time I had read many of these texts. As-yet, I can't assess the contribution it will make to my own research, although I anticipate it will be significant.",
    "It gave me a great introduction to the development of the discipline and provided me with a framework for assessing ethnographic writing.",
    "extremely useful in introducing me to some of the important works of early anthropologists."
