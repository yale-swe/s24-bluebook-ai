    "Yes this was a good seminar.",
    "Absolutely take it! The lessons I learned in this course will stick with me for a long time. It's a really important class that I think everyone could learn a lot from. More men should take this!",
    "This was a really cool class that allows you to interact with historical medical materials and analyze them from a gendered perspective. You'll really enjoy working with the old texts and instruments. The feminist perspective of the class is a unique spin on WGSS. Definitely take the class. It will open your eyes to gender biases that influence the medical and science fields.",
    "Weekly readings about various topics from dissection to taxonomy. Not too much work. Would definitely recommend.",
    "Yes!!",
    "HSHM 425 was a great seminar focusing on the role of gender in the medical field from around the 13th Century to present day. We covered topics from invitro fertilization to dissections and hermaphrodites. This class was so incredibly interesting and it helped me think critically in ways that have really transformed my way of thinking about science as a whole. Also, you learn how to write a stellar historical research paper because Courtney really focused on making sure each student learns how to \"think like a historian.\" Overall, the class grades include a midterm paper, final paper, and 4 short 1-page responses to the readings (you get to pick which readings you want to write about, and you get to choose your own deadlines!) This was one of the best seminars I've taken here and I would highly recommend it to any HSHM major, or any person who's interested in science and medicine."
