    "good class, very interesting. would prefer if the instructor took a little bit more active role in week to week discussions. too much detail in the papers",
    "This class was amazing! I loved what we learned and the way that it was presented. Having each group present a topic though, was not as effective as either having a guest speaker of Dr. Levy present the material.",
    "Overall, I did not enjoy the course as much as I was hoping to. The room was too crowded for the number of students that were in the class. The seminar style of the class was good in concept but not in implementation. Students presented most of the class material rather than having any lectures from the professor. When it was my turn to present on the material, the professor did not afford much freedom. This frustrated me because if she had a certain point she wanted to get across, I would have liked to have her present on it.",
    "Great course! It is a seminar-style course, so students essentially teach each other, but it was the best way to learn the material. Dr. Levy was very knowledgeable and did a good job of facilitating conversation when necessary. If you have an interest in aging populations, I really recommend it.",
    "The readings are very carefully chosen.",
    "This is an excellent primer for those interested in geriatrics or gerontology. Includes a variety of perspectives and incorporates statistics, biology, policy and theory in one practical course.",
    "Fantastic! great readings every week and lively discussions",
    "I was a little disappointed in this course. I had heard such wonderful things about Becca, but the majority of the class was student led. I would have liked to listen to Becca and her research a little more. The student-led presentations were not completely student led. I appreciated meeting with Becca for feedback with my group, but unfortunately, she really pushed for the way she wanted it. Students do not do all the readings, so trying to do a discussion strictly on the readings is no fun and not effective. This class could be so cool if we were allowed to think outside of the lengthy readings.",
    "Health and Aging is an excellent course in introducing topics related to geriatrics that I'm sure many us have not been exposed to before. It was interesting to have a different class structure; discussion based and run by other students in presentation format, rather than a lecture style class. It was a nice change from the typical classroom settings.",
    "Strengths: Love that it is seminar based, readings are very interesting, people of very different backgrounds Weakness: some readings are a bit dull",
    "This course involved a lot of reading on my own so that we could have a lively and engaging discussion during class. There were at least 5-6 readings every week which at times, were too much to handle.",
    "Not what I expected. Based on the course listing, I anticipated a course that discussed chronic illnesses pertinent to old age such as Alzheimer's or osteoporosis but this class was strictly theory based and frankly uninteresting. The class did a good job giving students a chance to instruct and lead discussions but the primary instructor never actually taught which was interpreted as very low investment from her end in regard to the course. This course ought to be listed as strictly an anthropology class or something of the sort because it does not accurately incorporate epidemiology into the course topics.",
    "strengths: - great course for anyone interested in the epidemiology of aging and in particular studying the social factors influencing the health of the elderly",
    "Good overview of public health issues related to aging, but no deep dives into any particular topic. One strength is the reading list (very diverse), but a weakness is the lack of opportunity to explore topics beyond cursory discussion. I didn't like the format of student-led seminar since it is hard to know what is most important. Would have preferred more professor-led discussion with student interaction."

   "comments": [
    "Instructor: Becca Levy \u00a0very responsive to students and gives great feedback on student writings",
    "Instructor: Becca Levy \u00a0Dr. Levy pays so much attention to each and every student it is phenomenal! She managed to get papers back to us the day or the week after they were turned in. She provided in depth feedback and was always ready to respond to questions or meet with us to further discuss them.",
    "Instructor: Becca Levy \u00a0Becca is nice, competent, and knowledgeable. However, students presented more in this class than she did, so I didn't get to learn from her the way I would have wanted to.",
    "Instructor: Becca Levy \u00a0She's great! Very nice and helpful. Always encouraged students to set up meetings with her. She's very knowledgeable in aging subject matter so a great resource if you want to work in the field.",
    "Instructor: Becca Levy \u00a0Prof. Levy is always available to her students and she is the expert of Health and Aging.",
    "Instructor: Becca Levy \u00a0Levy is truly an expert and confident to answer any questions that arise, and confident enough to redirect students when she doesn't have the answers, too. She is excellent with feedback and in individual meetings to help guide students when things aren't quite coming together.",
    "Instructor: Becca Levy \u00a0Very knowledgable and professional. Facilitated great discussions in class every week. Very approachable and willing to help her students in anyway that she can!",
    "Instructor: Becca Levy \u00a0People rave about Becca and her bio seems to be lengthy in the amount of research she has done on the topic. I wish she would teach more and guide us a little more. I get that it was student led discussions, but I would appreciated her expertise in the discussions.",
    "Instructor: Becca Levy \u00a0Dr. Levy is terrific and very kind to all her students; she also offers constructive criticism in assignments and is readily available to provide feedback or help us out when we are confused.",
    "Instructor: Becca Levy \u00a0I loved Dr. Levy. She is very understanding, and brings up many interesting discussion points during class. Her style of teaching is very open, and I felt comfortable with sharing my opinions during the class. No weaknesses!",
    "Instructor: Becca Levy \u00a0Becca is very helpful when it comes to figuring out our research proposal. She's always willing to answer questions via email or in person in her office. I hope to get to know her better because she really wants her students to succeed.",
    "Instructor: Becca Levy \u00a0I feel I did not get to know Dr. Levy much during this class as she assigned students groups or had visiting speakers instruct every lecture. Her class could be improved by incorporating more focussed discussions around areas of research pertaining to chronic illness rather than philosophical theories of aging which seemed inappropriately abstract for an epidemiology course.",
    "Instructor: Becca Levy \u00a0Dr. Levy is an amazing professor. As this was a seminar, majority of the classes were discussion sections led by students. Dr. Levy often guided these sections in a way that encouraged students to think more creatively about issues faced by the elderly. She also provided very helpful feedback to the students on the weekly response papers and research proposal, and ensured that everyone in class got a chance to speak and share their thoughts on the readings.",
    "Instructor: Becca Levy \u00a0Would have liked more professor-led discussion rather than student-led in order to leverage Dr. Levy's expertise."

   "comments": [
    "good class, good instructor, interesting viewpoints",
    "This is a seminar style class with a fabulous professor. Although Health and Aging requires a lot of writing, there are no tests, and I guarantee that you will have a greatly improved understanding of the unique challenges associated with aging. Come ready to work, and you will learn a lot through in-depth discussions, presentations, and papers. Also, you have to do the reading for this class, but it is all very interesting, and critiques are encouraged!",
    "I would probably not recommend this course. The readings were helpful, but the class time was not as useful.",
    "Yes! It doesn't require much work outside of the final paper, and Dr. Levy is great. You probably need to have some interest in aging though, otherwise the content might be redundant for you.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to my peers who are interested in aging.",
    "I would highly recommend this class to my friends, this was one of my favorite classes so far at YSPH",
    "I don't think I would recommend it to other students because it definitely was not what I was expecting. The room was too small for the class, which made it rather uncomfortable. Becca was incredibly nice and kind, but the readings made it rather boring and the constant student-led presentations just got a little old. I would suggest maybe reworking the class, posting newer more prevalent, up to date readings, and allowing students to present on whatever topic they want!",
    "I would recommend this class because the field of geriatrics is definitely under-studied, and this class really highlights the importance in research in geriatrics.",
    "This course is a course on health and aging, and its style of lecture is seminar based. There are a lot of readings required, but they are very interesting and necessary to participate in class. Overall, the course is easygoing and fun to take as an elective.",
    "This class is quite a bit of work but if you're interested in health and aging, gerontology, or geriatrics in general, it's definitely an informative class! You have about 4 response assignments regarding the readings and a big research proposal at the end (you can come up with anything and it need not be carried out).",
    "I would not recommend this course to another student because I feel I do not know anything more about elderly nutritional health or chronic disease in older age than I did when I started the course. The weekly reading was overwhelming in its quantity and not impressive in its quality either. I would much prefer to offer Dr. Perez-Escamilla's course on maternal child health or Dr. Mayne's (or her successor) course on nutrition which give a far better overview of senior health than this course did for me.",
    "Highly recommend this course to anyone interested in epidemiology of aging. Even if you're just looking for an interesting course to take in epidemiology, Health & Aging is a great break from the biostatistics courses. The grading is based on 4-5 response papers, participation in discussion sections, leading the discussion section as a group and research proposal.",
