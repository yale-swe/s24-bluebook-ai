    "This is a great course and the professor is fantastic.",
    "The professor was just excellent - his enthusiasm, energy, and careful examples made the material, well, come alive. Regrettably if I drifted off I often lost track of where we were (class moved fast) but on good days I learned SO MUCH, which is the mark of a damn good class. My final project was also a delightful experience and I learned a ton.Terrific.",
    "The TAs were not familiar with all of the software platforms and how they work. At some points it was a bit difficult to get help on how to run the packages and analyze the results from consulting the TAs. At the end of the semester, I realized that I had not very effectively been able to keep the multivariate technique apart from one another. Perhaps more clicker review questions (another jeopardy in the middle of the semester - post spring break) would have been useful.",

    "The class was huge. A smaller class would of been nice.",
    "Perhaps a lab session with the whole class.",
    "Sometimes it's confusing to know which methods to use.",
    "The course is a bit fast paced. Perhaps requiring reading or having some review sessions throughout the semester could have aided the retention of information.",
    "Deeper understanding of the methods. Maybe from mathematic perspective?",
    "Maybe another TA if the class is so big, because the professor had to dedicate a lot of time to all of the students.",
    "The class is way too large. 100 students in an advanced graduate-level course is just not acceptable. Something has to be done to keep it under 30, maybe recruit another professor to have a beginners and more advanced version. For a subject this complex that requires so much focus on the details, I was totally lost because of the large lecture format. There's simply no incentive to engage, and I definitely lost out because Jonathan had to teach a rapid lecture style for material that needs to be much more deliberate and interactive.There need to be several more pre-packaged data sets that we can use for the course if we don't have our own. I spent 2 months trying to find an appropriate data set in various databases, which was a waste of time because it is very hard to find datasets in a useable formate. A little more time on data preparation would be helpful.The use of 4 different programs is a bit overkill, although realistic to working with these tools. But honestly, it was very hard to focus on learning one well, when we were expected to jump around a lot. Maybe an ecological and a social science version of the course would be appropriate?Extremely dense and unhelpful reading. There were 6 or 8 books we were advised to look at; impossible to keep track of what was important, or what was useful, so I ended up reading almost nothing.",
    "Less students for more interaction.",
    "Nothing",
    "I personally needed more homework assignments, because that's how I come to understand the material and the large gaps in-between homework assignments feel like vast expanses of staggering through the desert in confusion.",
    "I was able to get the intro stats course waived, and went straight into multivariate. It might have been a bit too steep of a jump without the intro to stats, but then again I also wasn't digging in with vigor to try to refresh myself of the stats I took almost 7 years ago as an undergrad, either. I guess maybe a refresher workshop at the beginning would be good. The \"R\" tutorial was good, though."

    "Absolutely great. JDRS' extensive office hours were hugely appreciated and he had a great attitude even after seeing students back-to-back-to-back. One of the TA's office hours were quite irregular (like a Friday evening? something like that) and that wasn't very useful, but when the other TA held hours and floated around the CSSSI, that was a good resource and I utilized it."
