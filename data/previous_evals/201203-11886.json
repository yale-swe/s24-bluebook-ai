    "Yes, I would recommend this course to any student who wants to learn more about women writers of Spain. It is excellent!I would definitely recommend this course. You'll start off reading some poetry from Florencia Pinar, and then eventually move on to novels like SAB by Gertrudis Gomez de Avellaneda. Most of the literature you'll read during the first half will be from the great 19th century writers and poets like Emilia Pardo Bazan and Rosalia de Castro. The second half is dedicated to the works of 20th century writers such as Carmen Laforet and Carmen Martin Gaite. You'll appreciate class time as Professor Valis will make sure that you feel enlightened every time you come out of there.",
    "This class explored the role of women in Spain through the novels of female Spanish writers, beginning in the 19th century and ending just after Franco's regime. The class basically entails reading novels, short stories, and poetry in Spanish, along with published essays analyzing them. Each class discusses the historical context, literary style, and themes of the works. The class includes three short papers and a term paper, all of which offer freedom on topicality. I would recommend this class to native Spanish speakers or those with experience reading and writing in academic Spanish."
