   "comments": [
    "A great course that teaches you how to read complex and important material from the Spanish renaissance.",
    "I would describe SPAN 060 as a renaissance literature class that allows you to refine your analysis skills. The seminar style allows one to do this in a relaxing environment. I would recommend this class to other students because the literature analysis that takes place causes one's skills (both discussion and writing) to improve tremendously.",
    "Any freshman with a working background in Spanish should take the class. You get to meet and work with other similarly minded freshmen and get more deeply exposed to a culture vastly different yet surprisingly similar to our own. The format of the seminar is ideal for learning this kind of material. Take the class if you can--you won't regret it.",
    "This is a great class for those interested in Renaissance Spanish Literature. Taking this course, you will read not just what are considered the most important works of the time, but some less obvious ones that Professor Byrne personally likes and wants to share. The class goes over works in prose, theater, and poetry of all different kinds, and some historical context is also learned along the way. I really enjoyed the class and would recommend it to another student.",
    "The course provides a good selection of texts from the Golden Age. Professor Byrne is deeply passionate and knowledgeable about the material she teaches. She comes to class everyday cheerful and full of energy, approachable and with a great sense of humor. However, I would have liked more of an emphasis on analyzing the texts that we read. Especially for the poetry section, we talked more about form than content at times. Also, I wish we as students were more challenged to think analytically during class about that we were learning (ideally through student debates). Currently, Professor Byrne would talk (very interestingly) about the work and but then only ask mostly plot-level questions. Especially as the class was an hour and fifteen minutes, this meant that sometimes I had trouble focusing for the last half hour (though this might also have had to do with the fact that the class was schedule from 4:00 to 5:15).",
    "This course was amazing. the professor was great, and I learned a lot about the material."
