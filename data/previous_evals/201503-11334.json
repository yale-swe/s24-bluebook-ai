    "I would recommend the class to another student.",
    "I would wholeheartedly recommend this course. It is one of the best classes I have taken at any University ever.",
    "The course looked at the use of photography as a research tool, a means of documentation, and a method of communication in a range of scientific disciplines including medicine, physics, and astronomy. I would definitely recommend this course to anyone, regardless of their general area of interest, as it was helpful to think through the many possible uses of images."

   "comments": [
    "Photography and the Sciences has helped flesh out my understanding of photography, which until this point was shaped almost exclusively by exposure to art history texts. Before taking this course I didn't even know that I didn't know about photography as it has been used and discussed in the sciences, and now I can't imagine writing about it without the knowledge I gained in taking the course. In addition to a deeper understanding of photography--one that should be required of anyone who wants to write about it professionally--it was also a crash course in Yale's rich photographic holdings, spread out across the university's many libraries and museums. This course got me researching objects accessible here, that have yet to be written about, and my work is all the better for it. To have done all this in my first semester at Yale is amazing and I owe a huge thanks to Professor Ramalingam for making that possible.",
    "The course was very relevant to my area of interest and I appreciated the opportunity to read some key texts that have long been on my list, as well as get to know a range of collections on campus.",
    "As a graduate student in the history of art, it was extremely helpful to take this seminar in order to understand how a related, but separate discipline engages with and understands images. The course provided me with a new set of images and theoretical approaches that has expanded my knowledge of photography, and will be very useful as I continue to develop a dissertation topic that will engage with the relationship between art and science."
