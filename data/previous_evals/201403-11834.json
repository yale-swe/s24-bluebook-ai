   "comments": [
    "The course was interesting in regards to economic anthropology. It was a lot more theory than I anticipated, but overall, the class was not bad.",
    "It's a very easy-going course with very interesting lectures. If you're into learning about the marginal economies of the world, this is for sure a class for you.",
    "Take as a gut",
    "Definitely take this course! If you want to learn about economic anthropology, this is a good course to consider since it bridges cultural studies and economics. Though theory-heavy at the beginning, it is worth it, since the theory helps you understand the ethnographies so much better. Professor Erami is also wonderful.",
    "Overview of economic anthropology with short forays into many different topics related to \"invisible\" economies.",
    "A key introductions to Economic Anthropology, that offer a interesting alternative view point to raw economics.",
    "Super gut. Anthropology is so easy",
    "An interesting topic taught in a fairly uninteresting way. Depending on your initial intentions for taking the course but you'll either arrive at the end of the semester and either be happy you took a class with so little work, or disappointed you didn't really achieve anything.",
    "I would recommend this course. It can be very easy if you want it to be, but you can also get a lot out of it if you want to. It's entirely what you make it to be.",
    "take the course",
    "Professor Erami is really nice, down-to-earth, and helpful. The course is generally economic theory in the first half, and then we learn about smuggling, trafficking, etc. in the second half. Two exams, two papers, and a paper or presentation, in addition to weekly reading responses. Easy to do well if you study for exams. I definitely recommend this.",
    "This class had nothing to do with its name. We went over a lot of boring theory- and the theory we did go through was not a part of our readings. Maybe Professor Erami would be better in seminars but the lectures were painful to sit through. She just read out her typed notes verbatim and did not make any eye contact with students. Moreover, her material never related to readings and was extremely random Tests were extremely easy though.",
    "Great 5th class. Good grades with minimal work, especially if you're good at cramming.",
    "I would recommend as a great 5th class, or easier class.",
    "I really enjoyed this class. I found the material to be very interesting and the readings as well, both made for interesting discussions in section. Very little work",
    "A good course",
    "Overall an interesting topic, but the class was a little confusing and lacked structure. Focused more on economics than I had expected. If you take it seriously and do the readings you will learn a lot. It is a fairly easy course, which makes it tempting to do little work.",
    "I would take it Cr\/D\/Fail.",
    "great but useless class!",
    "It's more of an introduction to anthropology than a class on crime. With that being said, the information is still interesting. You really don't have to do all the readings and the tests are very manageable. Definitely take this class if you need a SO credit.",
    "It is fun and a good 5th class",
    "Disappointing but a relatively easy class."
