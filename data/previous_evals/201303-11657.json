    "This class is a great way to fulfill EPE's social theory core requirement, and it is very different from most other, stuffy, EPE core classes. I would definitely recommend it to another student! The class is not extremely work heavy, and you will learn a lot about sociology in general.",
    "This course led a thorough engagement with social movement theories. The readings gave us the foundations for these theories, which led to the application of them in class. The class discussions can be easily led by one predominant example and tended to stray from the theoretical analysis that we covered in the readings.The term paper was a wonderful opportunity to explore a subject or movement of your choice.",
    "yes, if you are willing to handle a lot of theory.",
    "This course is a broad overview of what social movement theory consists of. Take this course if you are interested in learning from social movement theory and understanding their development. The greatest asset of this course is the discussion that is led by an amazing professor, however, there are not many readings of specific case studies which makes people center discussion around 1 or 2 movements. Sometimes, this can be frustrating if you want to analyze social movements beyond a US perspective (eg.the Middle East). This is overall a great course and I would definitely recommend it if you are interested in learning more about social movement theory.",
    "Absolutely! Whether you are an activist yourself, an observer\/student of contemporary movements, or simply looking to understand past movements from a sociological perspective rather than an historical one, this class is for you. Prof. Eyerman is the bomb and this semester the class was great - diverse backgrounds, articulate people, passionate activists!",
    "I would recommend it.",
    "This was not a WGSS class-- it was a capital-S Sociology class that happened to look at the women's movement\/the civil rights movement etc. Prof. Eyerman is wonderful and enthusiastic and knowledgeable but not a great discussion leader. His expectations for the class's larger assignments were very vague and he does not grade them himself. The textbook is very dry. The work is manageable-- I kind of wish it had been more rigorous.",
    "Social movements are alternatives to the democratic process and have shaped history all around the world. Sociologists are just recently understanding the changing dynamics behind social movements and their participants so it is difficult to determine the most precise measures of their successes or failures. For this reason, there will rarely be a completely right answer to any of the questions regarding the impetus of a social movement. You will have the opportunity to make many interesting connections between culture, historical context, the ability to communicate and mobilize, and the social movements that these factors allow. This course stimulates an appreciation for this form of collective action and helps you realize just how much social movements are shaping the course of history."
