   "comments": [
    "Would definitely recommend to any person interested in photography, or visual representations in science and history in general.",
    "Great course! I would definitely recommend it to anyone studying the history of science in the nineteenth or twentieth centuries.",
    "Without any doubt, I would recommend this course to a fellow student. The course significantly expands the knowledge about how images and sciences intersect in modern culture. It is extremely helpful to formulate new questions and develop new research interests. Images are relevant in the understanding of our contemporary world, and this course provides rigorous grounds to analyze and understand the basis of their importance in the realm of science. I can assure that the course will change the way in which people perceive images in their professional and personal lives. It is an invitation to interrogate the delicate border between subjectivity and objectivity that anchors our existence.",
    "Yes, I would recommend it to students of both history and art history.",
    "I would certainly recommend the course. It offers an excellent introduction into scholarly work on photography and the sciences, and perhaps more importantly it provides a pretty comprehensive introduction to theoretical work on visuality and the sciences more broadly. Its extremely helpful for familiarizing oneself with the Yale collections as well."

   "comments": [
    "This was an excellent course, though I sometimes thought it would be better as a lecture course. A person needs a lot of background knowledge in order to fully appreciate the history of photography and the sciences, and a lecture course would have been a great medium for imparting this information.",
    "As I expected, the course have had a positive and important impact in expanding my knowledge on images. My dissertation project focuses on political violence and images during the first half of the 20th-century, and the course allowed me to conduct research in the field of medical photography. It opened my mind to analyze images with new questions. My previous education in the history of art was not enabling me to understand medical photography with all its complexity. This course and the appropriate guidance offered by Professor Chitra Ramalingam have provided me with historical basis and critical tools to approach my research with successful results.",
    "As someone engaged in interdisciplinary work, the course was really helpful for mapping out and orienting my work towards this sub-discipline of HS. It was fundamental to the development of my dissertation topic and helped me to begin planning\/framing my project."
