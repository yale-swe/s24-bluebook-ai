    "Fun class. Enjoyable to take. Great discussions.",
    "I would recommend it to anyone who doesn't have a lot of science background and is interested in protecting health and the environment on a big scale. As a senior ENVE major, it was pretty redundant.",
    "Definitely take this class! It is one of the only science classes at Yale that consistently applies the course material to real-world scenarios. Very interesting and not too difficult.",
    "This was a great course for those interested in chemistry and applications to sustainability. However, if you are just interested in sustainability and not so interested in chemistry, I would not recommend this course.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS! Professor Anastas in an INCREDIBLE teacher. You will look at the world in a whole new light after taking Green Chemistry. The workload is super super manageable, assignments are interesting, and the lectures are interactive and energizing. Take this if you have any interest in chemistry, engineering, sustainability, or what anything around you is made of! Great for science or non-science majors"
