   "comments": [
    "No I would not recommend it. Fairly boring class without a lot to gain from it.",
    "Once a week meeting for two hours to discuss class reading\/project. Not too much work, and not too difficult if you aren't good with technology! Interesting material, but sometimes difficult to understand where you were in terms of grading for this class.",
    "Digital Humanities was an odd course. You learn about digital humanities tools (softwares for analyzing texts, creating networks, etc.) and look a lot of examples of other digital humanities projects. The class is minimal work (the readings are not necessary and there are three short responses). I'm not sure I'll ever use what I learned, but it's a great fifth class for someone who's interested in trying something new!",
    "Great intro class with interesting material and light readings. The responses were fun to write and the instructors were very approachable. I've never heard of digital humanities before shopping the class and (while now I'm still not entirely sure what it is) I definitely walked away from the class with a useful set of tools like Open Refine, Gephi, Voyant, Mallet. I feel like this would be a great class for an underclassmen who wants to get more exposure to using digital tools to study [insert topic] and possibly even get involved with Yale's new digital humanities lab.",
    "I love intersections, and this class was great about pulling together a multitude and disciplines and tools. I enjoyed learning and using different tools that I wouldn't have had a chance to experiment with otherwise, and always enjoyed the latter half of class which was structured like a \"lab\" to teach us the tools. The first half was class was slightly less enjoyable, as I felt the discussion was rather unstructured and always circled back to the same types of questions. My favorite project was mapping our spatial coordinates over the course of the winter, and plotting it using CartoDB and Odyssey.js. I loved learning how to play around with the tools, and finding out more about my spatial patterns as I go around campus. The final project was done in groups, and structured as a proposal for a digital humanities project rather than producing an actual visualization. Choosing topics was a little scattered and hectic, but it was great to hear other groups' presentations and how they approached their topics.",
    "Very interesting class. Much more useful than it seems. The material is interesting. However, you are not given a single grade throughout the semester... not the best structure in that sense.",
    "Intro to the Digital Humanities covers a wide range of approaches to the digital humanities and explores those approaches through a combination of readings, discussions, and small projects. I would certainly recommend the course to a student curious about the intersection of computing and the humanities (although I would strongly advise that the student have some knowledge of programming and \/ or graphic design).",
    "Do not be mistaken: this might be digital humanities, but the humanities still have the home turf. The class anticipates, and sometimes explicitly provoked, the fight between humanities kids and STEM kids. Humanities kids make snide comments about putting the body back in the humanities, STEM kids argue that many of the showcased works fail to accomplish anything. It can be fun if that is what you are looking for; it can be annoying when you are not. At least in this first iteration of the course, most attention was paid to the existing tools and their immediate products, not to ways in which they can be used to produce meaningful results. (To be fair, some readings illustrated ways in which this can be done.) That was still plenty interesting, but hopefully it will get even more so in the future.",
    "Yes, if you are interesting in understanding how the big data revolution is affecting the humanities realm, you should definitely take the course."
