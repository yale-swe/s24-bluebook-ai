   "comments": [
    "I learned comparative skills: how to understand causal accounts and adjudicate between them. I also acquired a large trove of the most salient arguments in contemporary comparative politics, across very important and interesting topics such as gender, regulation, trade, and electoral systems.",
    "I learned the foundational texts of Comparative Political economy and how to compare and analyze them. I also learned how to apply them to real world problems.",
    "My in depth reading abilities were greatly improved as well as my ability to critically evaluate and discuss text.",
    "I developed skills in interpreting and analyzing political theorists at a deeper level.",
    "Through this course, I gained a great deal of substantive knowledge into the the theory of political economy and had the opportunity to delve into the literature in more depth, learning substantive models of materialism, institutionalism, and socioculturalism. I also had the opportunity to learn how to apply those models to relevant policy scenarios such as financial regulation, development, and inequality.",
    "A stronger knowledge of the concepts and theories that structure modern political economy and political science",
    "I got a great understanding of political economy as a discipline. I hadn't been exposed to the subject before, and Professor Rosenbluth did a great job curating scholarly research as well as stimulating discussion.",
    "I got a comprehensive understanding of the field of political economy, as well as the skill to analyze and synthesize arguments.",
    "Developed much more comprehensive knowledge around Political Economic theory and thought.",
    "The seminar has challenged me to think about policies from a market perspective, and has introduced me to really some of the most influential writers in the field of political economy. Professor Rosenbluth challenges students to think about the casual mechanisms and competing arguments -- which I found to be a very useful approach to social sciences in general.",
    "Theoretical overview of political economy, including materialism, institutionalism, and culturalist perspective. Focusing on different themes each week.",
    "The Rosenbluth three-levels of knowledge: facts, reasoning, and adjudication of debates in political economy.",
    "lots and lots. how to think and also the political economy material itself. The facts, the understanding casual arguments, and then adjudicating them. Professor is very clear about encouraging learning in these capacities.",
    "Like no other class, EP&E 253 taught me to adjudicate competing politico-economic arguments. Professor Rosenbluth made sure that we understood the premises and assumptions inherent in the readings. She taught us to spot loopholes as well as to relate the points made to broader schools of thought. After EP&E 253, I can confidently understand the world through the lens of a political economist. The theories and models are not only inherently fascinating, but also extremely helpful to follow international politics, and understand current events.",
    "I learned more than I have in any other class about how to write effectively and academically. Professor Rosenbluth taught me 'unlike any other professor the ways in which material, institutional, cultural, and psychological arguments both play out and interact with each other.",
    "Understanding about major theories in main political economy issues."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The course was very well-taught: Professor Rosenbluth is both highly learned in the material and very skilled at leading a good discussion. She is a rockstar. I also like that she recognised with a heavy reading load, the writing load should be \"correspondingly light\": Yale undergraduates often have many things going on with their lives, and courses that are overly ambitious tend to underdeliver. Finally, I would like to point out that the weekly reading responses served to keep every student engaged: there was a higher participation rate and evidence of critical and informed thinking during class sessions.",
    "Excellent class discussion and reading list (and Professor Rosenbluth is excellent at leading discussions). I think it would have been nice to have a little bit less\/more focused reading, but it is useful to be forced to write about difficult articles. I also gained so much from the weekly writing assignments.",
    "The open discussions that took place every seminar were extremely rewarding and were by far the greatest strength of the course. The Socratic nature of it allowed for the free flowing of ideas that I haven't had in any of my other courses at Yale.",
    "Strengths: Excellent reading list, engaging, thoughtful, and very accessible professor, strong peer group within the seminar, good workload with weekly responses. Weaknesses: No major weaknesses in particular, though I suppose perhaps making weekly responses due later in order to allow for deeper engagement with them might be the only thing.",
    "It was incredible out and out. Great discussion, great readings and a rewarding final paper.",
    "I think the course is very well structured.",
    "It's definitely a lot of work you have to write a weekly response paper, on top of a final project that is 60 % of your grade. But it's so worth it; You will learn so much!",
    "Strengths: very well-organized lectures and intellectually challenging class discussions, the weekly response papers really encouraged students to engage in critical thinking and practice analytical writing. Weakness: the syllabus could be updated to include more recent literature?",
    "Strengths: Well-curated reading in political economy. A professor who is not only committed to teaching but also able to distill students' interests and knowledge into a coherent and conducive class environment every time. Weakness: Too-heavy emphasis on trade and political economy of developed countries and little on political economy of developing countries.",
    "Sometimes, I just didn't know what to look for in the readings. I think a quick line or to would be helpful or else I just get lost and the readings take forever. I also think the reading responses are important, but I wish that we had more assignments that ask us to tell us what we learned from the previous week. I would alsmost say make post-seminar responses mandatory. Even the process of regurgitation of class material would be helpful..",
    "Comparative Political Economy had exceptional strengths and no weaknesses. First and foremost, Professor Rosenbluth taught the material and motivated the discussions brilliantly. She made sure all thought about the positions presented critically, that each and every one of her students understood what was going on. The course design guaranteed a high-level and -quality engagement. The application of the frameworks to current events--Trump, the Turkish Referendum and French Elections--made the seminar fascinating at all times. Finally, Professor Rosenbluth's commitment and brilliance is quite possibly unparalleled at Yale. Not only was she exceptionally approachable, but also a teacher of incredible pedagogic might and humor.",
    "Teaching and seminar discussions are enlightening.",
    "Strength: Very intellectually-stimulating course, not too hard even for students without economics \/ mathematics background."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Yes. It provides the theoretical lens needed to understand comparative political questions of the day: materialist, institutionalist, cultural\/psychological; and then brings you through very salient questions on gender, trade, regulation, and electoral systems and gives you the opportunity to apply the lens while learning truckloads about those hot topics. More importantly, Professor Frances Rosenbluth (who just won the Lex Hixon '66 teaching prize) is a superb teacher who both facilitates very productive seminar sessions by engaging all students critically, and effectively delivers concrete learning points by frequently organising our disparate thoughts into coherent arguments and giving fresh but substantiated perspectives on those contributions. (P.S. she is also very funny in class.)",
    "Yes! This course is an excellent way to learn about comparative political economy (and in turn political science) in a rigorous way. I really enjoyed it.",
    "Absolutely, particularly if they're interested in learning more about the intersection of politics, economics, and culture and the role this has played in molding the society we live in today.",
    "This is a great course on an interesting topic and Professor Rosenbluth is a fantastic professor. That being said you must be deeply interested in the topic to really get the most out of it.",
    "Without questionthis has been one of the best courses I have taken through the EP&E major and at Yale. Never before have I been as prepared to engage with social science research and scholarship; the reading responses, while challenging, allow you to fully engage with the literature. You also get great experience thinking about future political economy research and research for senior theses through the final research plan project, so this is an especially valuable course for juniors to take. All in all, a highlight of my semester and a course not to be missed, both for the content and professor.",
    "Incredible! Take it, Professor Rosenbluth is amazing.",
    "Definitely recommend! Professor Rosenbluth is excellent and the course is a must-take for EP&E majors as well as anyone just interested in political economy",
    "Yes! This is a great course taught by one of the best professors I have had here. Professor Rosenbluth is and expert in the field and does a great job of facilitating meaningful discussion each week.",
    "Definitely would recommend for anyone looking for a theory-intensive, comparative approach to political economy.",
    "Yes, especially if you are thinking about going to graduate school and want to explore the theoretical underpinnings and possible applications of political science, economics, or political economy. Also gives you a good comparative perspective by looking at examples from Latin America, Asia, Africa",
    "Absolutely. This class is a gem, a must-take of any students interested in the intersection of political science and economics. Specifically this class looks at how instruments of political science, e.g. collective action, transaction costs, electoral system, are used to answer substantive economic issues, e.g. trade, inequality, macroeconomic functions, etc. You will learn almost everything you need to know in the field.",
    "DEFINITELY TAKE IT!!! This course is the #1 political economy course at Yale. Not only does it convey the most relevant concepts of political economics; it forces you to think critically and teaches you to adjudicate among competing arguments. Expect to be challenged beyond your comfort zone. Expect to learn how politics and economics interact, to change your mindset, to strive and struggle in fascinating discussions. You probably don't know Professor Rosenbluth. If you did, you would not be hesitating and reading course evaluations. You would know that she is the absolute best. Not only does she teach the quite challenging material in an exceptional way, she also truly cares about the success of her students. In short, definitely take Comparative Political Economy. Otherwise you would never even dream to know what you missed out on.",
    "Yes anyone looking to improve their writing will greatly benefit from the consultation of Professor Rosenbluth.",
    "Recommended to anyone studying political science. It will give you a new perspective in understanding politics."
