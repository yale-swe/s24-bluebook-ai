    "I believe this course really opened me up to the possibilities of painting. It allowed me to experiment with many different subjects and techniques, allowing me to develop greater painting skills in the process. On top of that, it was a great sort of break to have in my usual routine of classes, which gave me the chance to express my creative side.",
    "I learned how to really look at things in order to figure out how to render them accurately. I gained a much greater appreciation for art and knowledge of many different painting techniques.",
    "This class taught me how to paint in acrylic.",
    "painting techniques, comfort with new tools and media, how to talk about others' work"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Overall, it was a fun class with interesting assignments. I would say, though, that there was a high demand for out of class work time. Being that sometimes, we'd only have a day in between classes to get things done, I found myself struggling to find time to commit to art homework while still juggling my 3 other classes.",
    "Kati is an awesome teacher, and I feel like my painting and drawing improved a lot over the course of the semester.",
    "I thought that the class was good because we spent a lot of time in class critiquing our work, seeing demonstrations and painting. I think that the only suggestion I'd make is that the instructor could have let the TA be a little more hands on, although both my TA and instructor were great.",
    "not much room for improvement, it does exactly what it claims to do and is very enjoyable"

   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this class to anyone who wants to explore painting and fine art. Though the workload can be a bit much, overall it's a fun class.",
    "Heavily. Easy class...no skill needed. Just show some level of acceptance and improvement. Co sult professor before beginning work. You will get A . Simple",
    "Great Class! Kati was wonderful and definitely gave me tips on how I could improve my paintings. The class was more of a free painting session but I preferred that. People definitely ranged in experience so if you have no painting experience it won't be an issue. You have to put in the work but assignments never got too stressful.",
    "Definitely recommend! I really enjoyed this class and feel like I improved a lot over the course of the semester. I gained a much greater appreciation for art; I actually like going to museums now! I spent a ton of time on my paintings, but I had a very low workload semester, so it was perfect for me. Kati is an awesome teacher, and Simon is a great TA.",
    "I'd strongly recommend this class to anyone who wants to take it! Especially if it's with Kati. I think that this class is slightly more work than a typical Yale course (it's about 4-6 hours of painting a week outside of class), but it is definitely worth it.",
    "yes, it's good for your soul"
