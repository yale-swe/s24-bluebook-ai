    "JAPN 140 is a rigorous class that tremendously improves one's Japanese skills. I recommend taking it.",

    "If you plan on continuing Japanese this class is excellent and the gains made are very obvious at the end of the course. The instructors are both great and approachable. Be prepared for a lot of homework though. Ultimately, it is worth it, but it is still quite a bit.",
    "Yes! Great way to learn the language"
