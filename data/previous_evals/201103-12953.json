    "If you have to take a language requirement, Italian is great. It is quite a bit of work, but you do get 1.5 credits. I'm really happy to be learning such a beautiful language.",
    "Tests more often than every other week, but a very fast way to learn a new language!",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to another student seeking a foreign language. It is a beautiful language and I chose it because I would like visit Italy and be able to carry conversations. No matter which language class you take, there is going to be a lot of work going into the assignments but it is not overwhelming.",
    "A quick and intensive way to learn the very basics of Italian. I would recommend this course to anyone looking to satisfy a language requirement or take learn an interesting new language.",
    "L1 Italian is not too difficult, and it is fairly easy to follow along. The language itself is not hard, but the quizzes and tests and assignments are numerous. I would recommend to a fellow student.",
    "A lot of work, but if you manage your time well, it is not too bad. The class is very interactive and fun, and it is also great to learn about Italian culture.",
    "I think this is a fantastic class if you are looking to learn Italian. It is well-balanced and well-paced I learned a huge amount in only one semester. I look forward to continuing Italian next semester.",
    "Yes. Great class, especially if you already have some experience with languages. It's super easy and pretty fun!",
    "Italian 110 teaches you enough italian to thoroughly understand the language and converse about common and important topics. I would recommend italian as it isn't too difficult of a language, but is a great deal of fun to learn.",
    "The best language class I've taken (it's my fourth, btw). Prof. Buonocore really cared about her students and kept the class fun."
