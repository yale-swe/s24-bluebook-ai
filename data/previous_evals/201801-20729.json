   "comments": [
    "I felt that this course lacked an emphasis on vocabulary. Though we were learning how to speak more freely, I felt that I was not learning the vocabulary equivalent to my speaking level in a way that would allow to learn it permanently. There was a lot of learning vocabulary on the fly, which didn't help me memorize it in the way that quizzes would have.",
    "Strengths: daily conversation practice with the instructor was very helpful. The small size of the class meant that students got a lot of personal attention. Grammar handouts were useful, though more sustained practice with the grammar constructions in class would be helpful. Weaknesses: reading practice was fairly minimal",
    "is a wonderful teacher, and she definitely made the class very engaging! My class was fairly small and definitely places a big emphasis on speaking practice, so we were able to get a lot of feedback on our speaking from her for each class. We also had short writing assignments fairly frequently, which I thought were pretty helpful because we got frequent feedback that way, as well. I think that sometimes it would have been helpful if we had spent a little more class time on some of the grammar structures that we learned, just because there were so many of them and I think that would help them sink in better. Overall this was a really great class, made it a lot of fun and I feel like I learned a lot."

    "I would definitely recommend this course to others. This is one of the classes that kept me sane this semester. It is not easy work, but it is doable and the teacher is really nice and understanding. As a STEM person, this was kind of an escape for me from my other classes.",
    "Yes. Though Yale only requires language study up to level 3, I believe that this course was essential to making me comfortable in my speaking skills. Therefore, I would highly recommend this to another student.",
    "Yes",
    "Definitely! If you've been taking Korean and is teaching the course, then I'm sure you'll enjoy it."
