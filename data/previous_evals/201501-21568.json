    "I think I would if you're really desperately trying to get a fifth class in and don't mind taking a credit d seminar once a week where discussion is rambling but if you're really interested in the material and hoping to get a lot out of it you'll be disappointed.",
    "Fantastic. I'd say the best class in any of the humanities offered at Yale. In-depth, difficult, interesting, wide-ranged readings, well-led and open discussion, and great essay direction. Utopia\/Dystopia is such a great topic that can be both incredibly specific and very general. Combines the close-reading of fiction with the analytical specificity of sociology and philosophy. A brilliant scholar who obviously knows his stuff, Dr. Berger brings a depth of reading and analytical thought to his teaching that is remarkable, well-organized, and makes for a fantastic class. He can get people to talk in class, and brings out student's ideas in class discussion. He assigns a difficult, in-depth, and eclectic mix of readings and comes to class with questions and ideas prepared, while still remaining open to students' ideas"
