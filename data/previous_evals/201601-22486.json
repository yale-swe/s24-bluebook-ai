   "comments": [
    "I would say that you get together with other PEB students to discuss interdisciplinary papers and use your different backgrounds to work together and figure them out and discuss them with faculty. I would definitely recommend it to another student.",
    "Great exposure to other topics and projects in biophysics. Can be time consuming trying to understand the papers on your own but two discussions are helpful.",
    "You read papers, discuss them with just fellow students one day, and discuss them with experts the next. Really trains you on how to read different papers and extract key ideas efficiently",
    "While this course was required for me as part of the PEB program, I would recommend this to other students if they have a lot of background in cell biology (since that's what most of the papers were about)and don't mind talking a lot. But if you are uncomfortable with the subject matter of the papers and don't like being forced to talk about subjects you don't know much about, then I would not recommend this course. It covers a lot of interesting topics and I learned a lot, but I found the experience of actually being in class (particularly on Wednesdays) to be a bit painful.",
    "517 was overall a great course. I learned a lot about a wide variety of topics, but most importantly, how to read and come to understand scientific papers. Each week was a bit like an oral exam, which was stressful at times. Meeting with other students on Mondays was extremely helpful."

   "comments": [
    "I got exposure to a broad range of projects in biophysics",
    "Most of the papers were very unrelated to the field that I plan to do my dissertation research in, but it was still good to get an idea of the type of work that other research groups at Yale do.",
    "There was a large variety of topics covered in the course. It provided a great sense of methods available for research and data analysis."
