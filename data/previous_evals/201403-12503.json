    "Prof. Hepokoski, the man, the legend. If you geek out about music, you can't get any better.",
    "The hype is real. I have played classical music my whole life, and worried that there would be redundant material. But I learned SO much! From the opening lecture on Beethoven to the last lecture on serialism, Hepokoski teaches so much about music, cultural\/intellectual history, and the 19th-20th century in general. He does zip through the centuries, but manages to balance broad narrative with close analysis of musical works in a way that made it a lot less scattershot than it could have been. The best part is that Hepokoski is interested in *arguments* about music history which makes you realize how complicated, controversial, and political music can be. MUSI 352 doesn't teach you everything about music history (it can't), but it gives you context and concepts with which to think about art music. The listening quizzes introduce you to a canon that you've likely not listened to before (Esp. for 20th century) and from which you can explore other 20th century music. Note: It is DEFINITELY manageable without theory background. It is definitely a history class, not a theory class. Hepokoski refers to some difficult concepts, but none of them are necessary to fully understand in order to do well in the class. Finally, homework never felt like work, which made every part of this class such a pleasure. Listening to music or reading about composers?? By far the most fun assignments I've had for an academic class.",
    "Music 352 is ana amazing course, and I highly recommend it to anyone with any interest in music. It is very work heavy, but it is worth it because Hepokoski is amazing",
    "MUSI352 is a course on the rise and fall of Western art music from 1800-1950. I would highly recommend it to another student, as the material is fascinating, and getting to learn about the history of classical music is very fun!",
    "There is a ridiculous amount of work for this class-- so be prepared if you want to take this class for a grade. That being said, if you are a classical musician or a big appreciator of classical music, it's extraordinarily worthwhile. Professor Hepokokoski is a phenomenal lecturer and makes you want to attend every single class.",
    "A truly amazing course. Challenging - very challenging if you are not accustomed to music history already - but enjoyable, informative, and more worthwhile than most any course I can think of at Yale. Professor Hepokoski is a god among lecturers. For those who have not taken MUSI 350 or 351, this course does not have history prerequisites. I took it without 350 or 351. The only preparation that would be useful (aside from the ability to read music) is preparation to read a lot and listen to a lot of music for the course. Falling behind would not end well. Overall, though, this course is excellent and doable.",
    "Required for music majors, but still a great course if you are a musician interested in the music of the time period. Hepokoski is a fantastic lecturer. It's a considerable amount of work that can kick your butt if you're not careful the exams and listening quizzes cover a lot of material and they can sneak up on you. Give yourself plenty of time to prepare for them and you should be fine.",
    "Music 352 is fantastic. Professor Hepokoski's lectures are engrossing and beautiful, the material is extremely interesting, and the section complements the lectures. I only wish there had been more time, as we had to skip over many composers. This class sparked my decision to major in music. However, it is a lot of work. There are three written exams, three listening exams, two papers, and around 200-300 pages of reading every week. Only take this class if you have the time to dedicate to it: all of the assignments are definitely rewarding, but they are incredibly time-consuming. (I loved this class so much that I don't want to submit this review because that will mean that it's over.)",
    "Great class-- definitely take it. A history course of musical aesthetics beginning with Beethoven and ending in 1950, more aptly titled \"The Rise and Decline of Western Art Music.\" Wonderful class.",
    "MUSI 352 is a FANTASTIC course. It is probably one of the hardest courses you can take at Yale (3 very hard listening quizzes that require hours and hours of listening, 3 factual exams that require probably over 1000 pages of careful reading--or at least skimming or very efficient cramming..., and 2 pretty difficult papers). However, this is definitely a course that is 100% WORTH THE EFFORT. Professor Hepokoski is a legend--do NOT miss the opportunity to learn this material from him. You'll learn about the essential works and historical context surrounding composers all the way from Beethoven to Ives (even a bit of Louis Armstrong) and this is stuff any educated person should know. The lectures are fun, well-organized, and incredibly interesting. If you get a good TA, sections are relaxed and very helpful. And you'll come out of this course not able to listen to music the same way ever again. TAKE THIS COURSE. this is the kind of class that makes Yale so unique. You can't get this anywhere else and you'll regret not putting in the work to take this for the rest of your life. If you are a musician or composer or historian or artist of any kind, there shouldn't be any question about taking this. But really--everyone else take it too. It's essential.",
    "An absurdly large amount of material to be covered, but definitely worth taking the time to study it all. This class is probably one of the hardest classes at Yale, but it is also one of the best classes I've ever taken at Yale.",
    "Good class, probably a lot of fun to credit\/D, but there's a tooon of material (musical and written) that you're responsible for. Also distressingly German-centered until the last few weeks of the class.",
    "If you are looking for a great Yale class, take this! This is one of those classes where you learn so much and have something to always talk about with other people. Beware, there is a lot of work.",
    "A must take! Professor Hepokoski integrates musical examples into every lecture, tying them together and telling their stories in an incredibly engaging manner. That being said, know that it is a lot of work (3 factual exams, 3 listening quizzes, 2 papers) and the papers are really tough.",
    "Every musician MUST take this class. IT IS SO IMPORTANT. Even if you don't necessarily agree with every aspect of Professor Hepokoski's approach (which he acknowledges is essentially centered around the rise and decline of German art music), he is one of the most best lecturers I've experienced at Yale. I've found it so enlightening to so intensely think about all of the institutions and historical factors that have shaped what we perceive as the \"Western Cannon\" of classical music. The listening quizzes and factual exams require lots of time (LOTS of time) - but at the end, it is pretty satisfying to not only be able to identify so much music - but be able to intelligently discuss what factors went into shaping WHY it is what it is, and how it has been used\/heard\/perceived throughout history. SO GOOD.",
    "You're probably taking this because you are a music major. If not, this is a very intense music history course in terms of workload and expectations. The factual exams and listening test require you to memorize and consume a ton of content. Other than that, the class is a joy to take. Prof. Hepokoski is super passionate about the material and you will learn a lot about the music and philosophy of music from the Romantic era to 20th Century. I got to know a bunch of new composers like Francis Poulenc that I really liked but had never heard of until this class.",
    "The only thing I can add is from the perspective of someone with no musical background. I took this Cr\/D\/F hoping to get an overview of classical music. 1) The lectures and readings (not that I did any) are mostly accessible without musical background. 2) Everyone else taking this Cr\/D\/F will be YSO and have lots of musical background. 3) There is SO MUCH WORK. There will be an assessment almost every week of the 14-week term. Overall, 3 listening quizzes, 3 factual exams, 2 essays. Basically, you have one week of shopping, one week of grace, then the assessments begin. The last assessment is due on the last day of class, so nothing during finals period. 4) There is too much work to get a really good *survey* of music history. Rather than listening to all of the music, for instance, you'll be playing catch up with other work. That said, I did leave having heard of many more composers than I ever knew existed and I can now tell you rando factoids about many of them. Through the class and listening quizzes, I have also been exposed to much more classical music than I had before (currently listening to Tchaikovsky). Moreover, I know *how* to listen to classical music and what to listen for. Hepokoski puts a bit emphasis on this, and it pays off. 5) Hepokoski is amazingly passionate. He really believes in the redemptive power of Art Music. He clearly was born two centuries too late, but it's a gift for all his students that he lives among us.",
    "Overall, Music 352 is an intense overview of the rise and decline of the western art music tradition in the 19th and 20th centuries - Professor Hepokoski is an inspiring, artful lecturer, and he delves deeply into the history of art music in the West, not only touching on the music itself but on the sociocultural and political context for the music. Hepokoski's masterful and impassioned lecturing style is the main strength of the course. With all the exams, readings, and papers, you also come away knowing that you learned a lot. I would recommend this course to people who are really into classical music or who are super committed to learning more about it! It is a very tough course- 3 factual exams, 3 listening exams (that involve a ton of memorization), and 2 papers. So you definitely have to stay on your toes all the way throughout. But if you want to learn about some of the most beautiful and powerful classical music throughout history, learning from Hepokoski in this class is one of the best ways to do it!"
