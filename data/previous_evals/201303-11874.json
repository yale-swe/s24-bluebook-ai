    "Do take this course if you're interested in a literary exploration of war. Professor Clark is refreshingly excellent--she takes no meaningless comments and directs productive conversation without seeming to. The reading is mostly undemanding, though you might have to watch out when it suddenly escalates from short stories or excerpts to entire novels for a few weeks out of the semester. (This latter proved to be annoying when the film-oriented folks simply forwent the readings and only watched the films.) The films are illuminating, if not always the most nuanced."
