    "As far as I know, there are only two ways to take multivariable calculus at Yale: through Math 120 or ENAS 150. While I did not like Math 120, my friends in ENAS 150 rave about it. I felt as if Math 120 breezed through the material without really focusing on its real world applications (for example, how is finding the volume of a sphere using triple integrals related to economics?). I understand that learning the foundation of the material is very important, but I also believe that being able to apply the material outside of the classroom is key. After taking Math 120, I do not think that that's possible. It failed to engage me, and unless it's a requirement for a major (or if you really love math), I do not recommend that another student takes Math 120. Also, the class' graders are harsh and make me enjoy the class even less when I get my grades back and can't contest them."
