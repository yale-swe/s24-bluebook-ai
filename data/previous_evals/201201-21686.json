   "comments": [
    "Chill class, spend most of the time listening to music or watching videos and talking about what we hear. It gets a little old\/repetitive after a while though.",
    "Absolutely. Certainly don't expect it to be a gut but this class really gave me a unique glimpse into the past which was so much more interesting than any other history class you will ever take.",
    "More Beatles than Dylan, but that makes it more accessible. The Beatles arguably deserve more attention anyway. Great class.",
    "I would recommend this class if you have the opportunity to take it. The material was always interesting and homework, whether listening or reading was enjoyable.",
    "I would recommend this class but with caution. Don't set your expectations too high. I came into class knowing a lot about the Beatles and little about Dylan, and I learned a lot. The main issues with the class are a) that it took a little while to pick up speed, and b) that the seminar was kind of awkward. I think the second has a chance to improve from year to year, but in general the class was rewarding. It was fun to take alongside other, more demanding classes. The readings are great, and definitely worth reading even if you don't take the class. Just be careful: Tomlinson is a hard grader, there is a decent amount of reading, and the seminar atmosphere might not be all that you expect it to be.",
    "Fun freshmen seminar class to take with a fair amount of reading and some random but short writing assignments. The 9 AM class time made it diffuclt for people to get into class discussions because everyone was tired or missing class. Not as exciting as I would have liked but it was still cool to chill out while listening to the Beatles and Bob Dylan. Would have liked more dicsussion about the impact the Beatles and Dylan had on the 60's though. Not have a musical background made it slightly (and I mean slightly) harder than I had expected.",
    "Yes, by far the most interesting class I took this past semester.",
    "If you are fortunate enough to get into this seminar, take it! Whether you are interested in the Beatles, Dylan, music, or pop culture in general, you will really enjoy this class and get something unique out of it.",
    "Take it if you're genuinely interested in the material. Readings are interesting, but if you don't enjoy the topic, they could potentially be quite time consuming. It's a very different class in that it's relaxing and low stress - it's great break from your other intensive core classes.",
    "This class was awesome. You learn a lot about what life was like in the 60s and how that influenced what life is like today. And more than that, you get to listen to awesome music. The White Album is still stuck in my head. Take this class.",
    "yes, awesome class, great for musically-inclined students"
