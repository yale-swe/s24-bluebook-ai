    "I would recommend it, but only if you are prepared to do a lot of homework. If you have to take it, I totally recommend taking it with Profesora Alexandrov because she is really really awesome.",
    "If you want to polish your Spanish grammar, learn all the little rules that we were never taught before and learn all the old rules in more comprehensive way, this is the course to take. Professor Alexandrov is an absolutely amazing professor, easily one of the best Spanish professors I've ever had, and I would take it with her if at all possible.In terms of workload: the amount of work in this course is very evenly spaced out. The weekly \"carpetas\" took me at least a good three hours to do, and there is usually another assignment each week, such as additional exercises, in class or take-home compositions, or a test. So yes, it is a decent amount of work, but an amount of work you can develop a routine around. Take it Credit\/D if you're worried about the grade."
