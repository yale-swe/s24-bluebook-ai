    "good class to have",
    "It was a very nice class, and I am happy I took it. I learned a lot about myself through it and made some good friends. I'm also glad it was a writing credit because I hate English classes, and this class was certainly much more interesting than any English course I could've taken in its stead. I would not, however, recommend this class to staunchly conservative people. Your head might explode.",
    "a great freshman seminar that covers interesting material, with a very reasonable (3 papers) workload. if you can get in, take it!",
    "Would recommend this course for someone looking to take an interesting seminar.",
    "WGSS 032 is a great freshman seminar, especially if you are interested in topics of human sexuality. It covers case histories to theory, so it's not just philosophy or medical texts. The class is discussion based, so if you like discussing with other students about your ideas this class is for you. The readings get a bit heavy sometimes, but they are manageable.",
    "Not what you expect. Its very abstract \/ high brow but as long as you get to know your class and are comfortable pontificating about sex, you'll enjoy it. Papers are enjoyable actually, never really felt like it was a chore.",
    "Lots of reading, some writing, but the professor and the discussion topics easily make it all worth it.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course. The readings don't feel like busy work and classes don't feel like a waste. The workload is pretty light in comparison to many seminars, but you learn so much. The topics were so interesting and applicable to everyday life. It seemed like people were happy to be there.",
    "I totally recommend this class; it's an eye-opening approach to oft-taboo subject matter, and the discussions can be both light-hearted and incredibly deep. One of the best freshman seminars Yale offers.",
    "Take it if you get into the lottery; not only is it a WR credit, but the subject material is very interesting. Only three papers and participation, so the workload is one of the lightest you'll find. The readings can be long, but we break it down in seminar, and Prof. Trumpler is so so so knowledgeable. You won't find a better professor.",
    "Great class to take no matter your background on human sexuality.",
    "I would absolutely recommend it."
