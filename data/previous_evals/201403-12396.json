    "A great philosophy course -- more practical than almost any other material in this area, and gives you a solid view of how regular people think about morality (which, to me, is more appealing than knowing how one particular 19th-century German thought about morality). As a psych course, I'm not so sure; you look at some interesting studies, but you'll need pretty solid interest in philosophical\/abstract things to feel engaged. I consider myself to be about midway between psych and philosophy in my interests, and this felt a little too handwavey for me at times -- but Josh is very open to taking new directions in the conversations, and I was able to start a couple of class discussions about the practical applicability of abstract concepts. Bottom line: I'd recommend this over just about any other philosophy seminar, and most psychology seminars.",
    "Cognitive Science of Morality is a superb course. It provides a solid foundation in moral cognition, and is extraordinarily well taught. Josh Knobe is an incredible instructor. He not only knows the field inside and out, but is conducting much of the research at the core of moral cognition.",
    "Cognitive Science of Morality is very interesting and very intense. Each week we discuss an area of moral cognition, including where morality comes from, why our moral values are the way they are, and how morality develops. It is very heavily philosophical, so if you don't like philosophy that much, this course might not be for you. The readings are hard but interesting. During our seminars, we get to critique the studies that we read and get to talk about how we might design our own to test particular concepts. It's really fun to take a course with Josh Knobe, who is one of the people who is very involved in conducting this research.",
    "Absolutely. Not too much work, really interesting ideas, great professor, solid discussions. One of my favorite classes at Yale so far.",
    "Pretty simple: take it if you're interested in it, and you'll know if you're interested in it by the end of the first meetup. Lots of interesting questions in cogsci of morality, and lots of room for people with different backgrounds to contribute to the field. Be open to new ideas and this course will be very rewarding.",
    "This is an absolutely fantastic course. If you're interested in contemporary work at the border between philosophy and psychology investigating moral issues, this is the seminar for you. Josh Knobe is very supportive and does an incredible job presenting the material and leading discussion. There is a reasonable amount of reading per week, and the only assignment is a significant project or paper that really allows you to pursue your own interests in the subject.",
    "I had always brushed philosophy off as a nebulous field of knowledge completely beyond my comprehension and something that I would never touch during my time as a cognitive science major at Yale. But two-and-a-half years later, and here I am, having taken two philosophy courses, both with Josh Knobe. Josh is quite simply one of the most brilliant minds to have graced the world of experimental philosophy. But more than that, he is one of the greatest professors to have graced the classrooms at Yale. He cares deeply about his students, and takes time out of class to help hash out ideas, give suggestions, and work out kinks in a study. No idea is too stupid or too insignificant; somehow, Josh always finds a way to connect it to a bigger question and challenge you to think more deeply. He is also one of the best seminar leaders I have had the pleasure to learn from, giving everyone a chance to speak and making everyone's contributions seem important to the discussion. Beyond that, this course was also a great opportunity to brainstorm, design, run, and analyze an experimental study from start to finish. While the 100% weight on the final project was daunting, working on it in chunks through the latter part of the semester and having Josh's support throughout made it manageable and even fun.",
    "TAKE THIS SEMINAR! It is an excellent way to spend two hours of your week, and the final paper is the best way to end the semester. Knobe is an excellent teacher, leading discussions well, and the weekly readings are actually interesting (despite having difficult roots in philosophy). Be prepared to be surrounded by students who come from significantly different backgrounds from you, and be prepared to learn a lot. Also, start that paper early. It can be tiring."
