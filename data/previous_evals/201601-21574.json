   "comments": [
    "Take it. The content itself is fascinating to begin with but Professor Johnston adds so much more by delving into the historiography as well as the biases of modern society's perception of the Roman Empire. My only regret is graduating without having taken his accompanying course on the Republic. Also don't let the class's workload rating scare you off. It's very reasonable even if you're not a history, or even a humanities, major.",
    "A class that will make you consider switching to the history major. Professor Johnston is an amazing professor and the nicest guy. Section was enjoyable and the reading was light (although there was a lot more you could do if you were interested). You could tell that Professor Johnston and his TF Andy really cared about the course. It is taught as a part two to the first semester course The Roman Republic. It is fine to only do this course though!",
    "An amazing course that I would absolutely recommend to any student is interested in the Roman Empire and its decline, history in general (the Romans partly form the basis of our Western history!) or if you just want a great, engaging professor. Take the course!",
    "Definitely take this class. It's fun, fascinating, informative and quite thorough given how much ground it covers. Professor Johnston does a great job relating the Romans to current debates and events as well, which is always interesting!",
    "I cannot recommend this course highly enough. HIST 218 is a fantastic survey of the Roman Empire from the rise of Augustus to the split of the Roman Empire and start of the Byzantine Era. Professor Johnston is an extremely engaging lecturer - he's obviously brilliant and personable, too. (To use his words - \"I like to think I'm not as awkward as most academics... but don't worry, I'm still awkward.) You get out from this class what you put in: you can get by without doing most of the reading, but the class won't be as rewarding. The exams are straightforward, and the grading on papers is reasonable: Professor Johnston wants his students to succeed and will always give you the benefit of the doubt. If you are looking for a course that will change the way you look at the world, make sure to take The Roman Empire.",
    "There is a lot of reading and writing, but if you enjoy history definitely take the class. Professor Johnston is great and the material is very interesting. Especially the first part of the semester about the early Roman Empire.",
    "Absolutely recommend, in addition to History of the Roman Republic!!",
    "The course is an excellent survey of Roman history. We started off where the Republic left off with the civil wars of Octavian and Augustus. We then traced the history of the Roman empire from the Principate into the Dominate, noting key figures along the way like Vespasian, Trajan, Diocletian, and Constantine. The material was comprehensive covering not only the political aspects but the socio-cultural and economic as well. We looked at Roman religion and the rise of Christianity, women in the ancient world, trading, games and entertainment, etc. In short, an excellent and comprehensive course on the Empire. The professor is amazing. I would highly recommend the course.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class for those seeking to learn about how the Roman Empire really operated. The class is packed with information, but you really learn as much as you are willing to put into the class.",
    "If you came to Yale for a liberal arts education, you must take this class. If you didn't, why are you here?",
    "Yes! Roman Empire is great. So is Johnston!",
    "The Roman Empire with Prof. Johnston is fantastic! If you're worried about the fact that you didn't take The Roman Republic, don't be. I didn't have any trouble adjusting to the course. If you pay attention and take notes during the lectures and study for section, you don't even have to do the readings and you will still learn a lot. I liked the course in that way in that the workload was variable to how much work you wanted to put in (but you could still do well and learn a lot either way). Professor Johnston was an extremely engaging lecturer. Highly recommend!",
    "This is a rare opportunity of a class to learn about a truly fascinating civilization. Professor Johnston's lectures are extremely well-researched and prepared. The breadth of topics covered feels comprehensive. The readings are not what you could just pull off the internet, and the textbook is great for getting the big picture nailed down. The workload is not that bad, and the atmosphere of the course was really laid back throughout; this was a class I was not stressed out about but which I learned a ton in. Down to the end, I actually enjoyed writing the final research paper even though it was in the midst of a reading period full of work. I recommend this class to anyone who would like to learn about the Roman empire (note this is just from Octavian onwards) in a way that you really can't get through just reading on your own."
