   "comments": [
    "Hawkins is fantastic--a tough but fair grader, but wonderful in class. He loves having us read the texts aloud and doing close readings of smaller sections. His voice is incredible and when we got to Dante, his Italian really helped my understanding.",
    "It is really a survey course of Greek and then Christian literature. I would absolutely recommend it.",
    "Lit in the fall was one of my favorite classes. The sequence of texts makes it easy and fun to see how one text builds off another. What I also liked about lit is that we read most of the books in their entirety, something we don't really get to do in either H&P or philosophy (for good reason). Professor Hawkins was a great section leader -- we had a great mix of reading passages out loud, a discussion where everyone was equally engaged, and Professor Hawkins always provided interesting insights without dominating the discussion. As he is a Dante scholar, he made that part of the curriculum energetic -- and it's cool to have a professor from the divinity school. He is a bit nebulous in terms of essay grades, and I didn't really get the sense that my writing improved because his comments were always very too specific to apply to future essays, but in spite of that, he was a great professor and I would definitely recommend taking lit with him.",
    "If you like to read, take this course. Hands down. Be prepared to be intimidated by prep school kids who have already read all the works twice through in Greek, but you will grow tremendously as a reader and writer. If you have the good fortune of getting Hawkins as your section leader, do not switch. For anything. He is a wonderful teacher who will take a personal interest in your development in the course. His comments on papers are extremely helpful, and his grading is generous. He goes out of his way to be accessible to students and will meet you wherever you are in your development as a writer. Do not switch, if you didn't get that message before.",
    "This class is essentially a basic survey course of Ancient literature, where you have a broad, but not in-depth look, at a lot of books in the western canon. You'll learn how to read really fast and write really fast, but there is little room for novel analysis or research. The course mostly emphasizes exposure and a broader analysis of sorts.If you're not going to put in the work, don't take the class. If you are, and you are interested in getting exposure to the ancient canon, then definitely take it.",
    "Directed Studies is a very unique program that no one else besides accepted freshmen get to take. There is a good balance between lectures and seminars to expose you to the different formats of courses, and all the professors are very qualified. Jump on the opportunity--it'll only come around once.",
    "Yes. Professor Hawkins was an amazing professor, and an amazingly caring, professor to have, especially first semester freshmen year. My only sadness is in the fact that he is not teaching DS next semester.",
    "I would recommend this course. It's a great way to get some exposure to the Western classics, especially if you haven't read any of them before.",
    "The first semester of Directed Studies Literature is a chance to read and discuss the major literary works of the ancient Western world from extremely qualified and passionate professors. If you put in the effort to read and learn the works, you will get so much out of it!"
