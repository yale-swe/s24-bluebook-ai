   "comments": [
    "I would summarize the course as an advanced introduction to the mechanics of econometric research. The course was advanced in that the level of mathematics was higher than many introduction courses, but it was still an introduction that assumes little prior knowledge and doesn't push too hard on proofs or technical issues. Finishing this course you would feel comfortable doing basic econometric research.I would strongly recommend this course to another and I have. Primarily the reason was Thad Dunning. His presentation was very clear and informed.",
    "Yes, I would recommend the course.",
    "PLSC503 is an introduction to linear regression. At the end you\u0092ll understand the key theoretical proofs underlying regression, be able to spot some likely problems in using regression for certain research questions, and know basic Stata programming code to run regression analyses.I would definitely recommend PLSC503 to another student in the social sciences who was planning to do applied quantitative research because it covers both theoretical concepts and applied programming skills. If taught by the same instructors, I would highly recommend the course just for the quality of teaching.",
    "If there's any chance that you are going to do quantitative work in Political Science, you should definitely take this class.",
    "The course is an introduction to the main themes, concepts, and techniques of statistical and causal inference as they are used in the social sciences.I would definitely recommend the course.",
    "Yes, this course is as about as clear of a presentation of regression as you can possibly get.",
    "it's a good introduction to the basic mechanics and assumptions of linear regression and related econometric methods.I would recommend this course to other students if they're interested in using quantitative methods and did not take advanced statistics as an undergrad. In fact, they still might want to take this course even if they did take advanced statistics to make sure they really understand the core concepts of basic econometrics.",
    "Everyone should take this course. Thad asks students to work in groups, and to hand in one problem set per group, which allows you time to actually do the reading before class, an utterly reasonable stance that takes some pressure off for the non-quantitative among us. This class should definitely be taken before 504."

   "comments": [
    "I am sure I will use econometrics many times in my career. I feel this course was good basic preparation. I am thankful for having taken it overall.",
    "I feel like I have a better knowledge of the fundamentals, but don't feel prepared for actually conducting an analysis.",
    "The course deepened my knowledge of the underlying assumptions of statistical models that are used by most of my discipline as well as highlighted the possible issues with causal inference. I am far more prepared to evaluate whether methods that are widely used are actually useful in answering our questions.I already knew many of the methods before the course, so the only contribution to my dissertation\/research is that I will be more careful in laying out assumptions of methods that I use and rigorous in attempting to argue for their validity.",
    "This was an important course for my future research because it introduced me to the pros and cons of different research designs and the statistical techniques that might be necessary or appropriate for analyzing certain types of data. We used many examples where the units were countries, which was very helpful for me as I anticipate doing cross-country comparative research in the future. (However, for students who might be working with data sets in which the units are individuals, it might have been helpful to have some more applied examples with data sets of this nature.) Even though the course content was quantitative methods, the instructors also helpfully pointed to the linkages with qualitative methods that can provide evidence for the assumptions underpinning the quantitative analysis. Overall, the course gave me a better understanding of the value and potential applications (and misapplications!) of regression analysis in the social sciences.",
    "The quantitative methods we studied are used by most practitioners of political science, and I will be using them in my dissertation."
