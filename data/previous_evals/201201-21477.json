    "KAPUSTIN KAPUSTIN KAPUSTIN KAPUSTIN. Or in other words, this is a great class that has deeper analyses of really cool readings than most, and Prof. Kapustin's style (which is fairly unique) helps drag most of the important information out of the texts, some of which were very hard but handled excellently. Take this class if you like political philosophy or thinking about intellectual structures.",
    "Just take it. Simultaneously very focused and very wide-reaching.",
    "Good class but you don't do very many case studies at all. Very heavy philosophy base.",
    "YES, hands down one of the best and most thought-provoking courses I've taken at Yale. Prof. Kapustin has such a rare combination of brilliance and willingness to engage his students with complete sincerity. I have never seen a seminar leader command so much respect when speaking, and yet elicit so much enthusiastic participation from a group. The result was a deep, challenging, and satisfying engagement with the texts, and a strong class rapport. Absolutely take it.",
    "Depends on who you are. If you're into throwing around random philosophers just for kicks (even when they aren't actually relevant) go for it. If you're thinking about it because you're interested in actual instances of political violence in the world and want to figure out how theories relate, don't take it. It's abstract to a laughable degree for a class about such a down to earth problem.",
    "Fantastic. Nuanced, rich, and engaging, the course provides a strong analytic toolbox for analyzing issues of political violence. Professor Kapustin is not to be missed.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to any student interested in the theory behind violence and the relationship between violence, reason, and non-violence. Despite a limited background in theory and contemporary philosophy, I found the course manageable and enjoyable. What is more, Professor Kapustin is a deeply knowledgeable teacher who's virtually mastered the seminar format.",
    "It's a thorough introduction into different understandings about violence and to a good extent, transformative politics with a focus on continental authors and more recent political theory.Absolutely. If you like political theory or philosophy, this is a great course.",
    "Excellent course led by Professor Kapustin, an amazing seminar director. All the readings were carefully selected and, together, made for an engaging intellectual journey. Discussions were well paced so everyone could learn something; I never felt lost although this was my first political philosophy-esque course. I would highly recommend it if you can get in!",
    "I think every student should take this! Prof. Kapustin is not to bemissed. It is extremely informative, and the reading covers an impressive and useful breadth of topics and authors. However, if you are not very in to political philosophy - beware!"
