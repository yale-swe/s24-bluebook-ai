    "This is a great course if you are interested in learning the basic concepts of music theory. It gives your course schedule some variety since the work is pretty different than for any other type of class. The work is manageable because it is spread out over the whole semester. Your final grade comes from a lot of different components, which is nice. The teacher I had (Jamie O'Leary) was really great!",
    "This is a great class. It is really enjoyable. If you have just a very basic knowledge of music in some capacity, you should definitely consider taking this class for fun. The class will probably be pretty different from most of your other classes, which will be refreshing. You'll learn more about reading\/writing\/understanding music.",
    "Take it if you're in some sort of musical group on campus and want to learn how to arrange or just the general structure of music. Be warned, if you actually know nothing about music, this will be a struggle. However, if you've ever played some kind of instrument or sang, it will be a fun and not too difficult good grade.",
    "Great course. Not difficult or a lot of work. Very enjoyable and teaches basic concepts of music that I find to be very useful. Made me want to continue taking music courses.",
    "Into music theory.",
    "Yes.",
    "Music 110 is a great class if you love music. I took the class because I've been doing chorus since for every and fell in love with music through singing but never really knew the \"why\" behind what was happening in a song. Music 110 teaches you an amazing amount of material in one semester and you leave feeling so much more knowledgeable and very accomplished. However, if you (like me) treat this too much as a \"for fun\" class and don't read the textbook and do the assignments like you should then you will definitely have moments of stress and frustration (just like in any class). The only thing that is different is that it is easy not to realize how difficult certain topics are until it is too late. Contrary to popular belief, music is not easy and parts of it are almost mathematical. Also many people in the class play instruments and sing so they actually already read music. However, this should not scare you away. If you don't have music experience this class will be harder for you, but not impossible. And if you love music, it's so worth it.",
    "Take it - especially if you can get James O'Leary as a teacher! The course goes over a lot and it is pretty difficult, but as long as you keep up with each unit, you shouldn't have too much trouble or get behind. I am really glad I took this course at Yale and expanded my horizons.",
    "I found Music 110 to be a great class to take as Humanities requirement. If you have the slightest ear for music, the class isn't difficult and the grading is divided into a number of small tests and performances, none of which take more than a few hours to study for. Jamie is an unbelievably great teacher and makes sure that every student is involved and is learning. The weekly workload isn't too much either and you emerge having learnt a lot about the internal workings of music. Like I said, a great class."
