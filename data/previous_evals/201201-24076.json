   "comments": [
    "Fun balance of science and real world applications and information, but not really for those that are very inclined to explore scientific concepts very deeply. Concepts are generally explained quite clearly, and Professor Ramirez will support you going into greater detail if you choose. Assignments are straightforward, but can be a bit challenging so that you apply ideas in new ways. Because the main projects ask you to explain things in a simple way, you actually need to understand them quite well to do so, which is an interesting process. Only real complaint is that the pacing of the course was a bit slow, so not all the material that could have been included was actually covered. Great course with fantastic energy though.",
    "Take it if you need an easy science credit! Don't take it if you're already familiar with physics or chemistry!",
    "It was a really great. Prof. Ramirez is wonderful - very nice, caring, easy to understand. The midterm and final were harder than the problem sets. But Prof. Ramirez explained things well.",
    "A class for non-science majors related to the field of MSE: Materials Science Engineering. It was slightly hard for a non-science major class, to be honest. It was fun though. There is a video project assignment, which was nice. Take home exam was really hard. Good learning experience. Not entirely sure whether or not I'd recommend to another student- it was a good learning experience but for students wanting to get their science credit out of the way, it might either be not so interesting of subject matter\/ kind of hard.",
    "Let me wax hyperbolic about this course for a moment: TAKE IT TAKE IT TAKE IT TAKE IT. First, materials science is actually a really interesting and cool field. But Second, Professor Ramirez. She is without doubt the biggest reason that this course was so successful. Not only is she down-to-earth, really freakin' smart, and pretty darn funny to boot, she is also the most considerate and caring professor I have ever learned from after four years of Yale. She is determined to make sure that everyone understands everything she is saying, to the point of not continuing on in her lecture. She will review, repeat, refresh, as many times as is necessary to get people on the same page, and excited. She made this class a joy to take and to attend, and as a result, it's not even important whether it was \"hard\" or \"a lot of work.\" (Though it never felt that way, because of her tireless care for her students.)",
    "Highly recommended. Professor Ramirez enthusiastically creates an engaging seminar environment. You will get a good grasp of basic material science, and I found that I understood key chemistry concepts better after learning them from a material scientist's viewpoint. We had weekly problem sets and two take-home midterms, a video project, and a fairly brief final written project.The work is very manageable, and the course is extremely rewarding. Take it!",
    "If you have a chance to take this class, take it. Professor Ramirez is a great teacher who really cares about her work.",
    "This class was fantastic. It is a small seminar, rare for science classes intended for \"non-science majors\" but absolutely fantastic for it. We had the opportunity to ask questions and proceed through the material at a rate that was challenging yet comfortable because Professor Ramirez could gauge our progress. Professor Ramirez also works hard to make the class extremely interesting, performing demonstrations, incorporating movies, and designing assignments that require creativity. More classes should be taught this way---I feel like I genuinely learned something.",
    "The Science of Materials is a great overview of Materials Science. It includes some components of chemistry and physics, but without it being overly complicated. I would recommend this class to anyone who wants to learn about science and materials and take a science class that actually teaches you something.",
    "A great science class, interesting material, taught by a wonderful instructor."
