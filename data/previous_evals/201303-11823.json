   "comments": [
    "I really enjoyed the class and the readings. Sometimes the assignments can be a bit unclear (including the final paper), but Wallace is really helpful if you go to him with questions. If the topics on the syllabus are interesting to you, you'll get a lot out of taking this class.",
    "Highly recommend for those interested in democratization and development. Do not take if you cannot stand poli sci papers, as you will read a lot of them and some will be quite dense.",
    "Great seminar, not too difficult, but I found it very interesting. You get a theoretical\/quantitative view, and for me it was the first time encountering more academic and quantitative works on a regular basis and in such large quantities. Readings are fairly manageable--you are expected to understand the argument and the evidence in each piece, and be able to engage with it, but there isn't a need to do really really deep reading.Each week's readings are like a dialogue between different scholars. Discussions are led by students, which can be nerve-wracking but it's also great for learning about one aspect of democratization (or lack thereof) very well. Clearly this is a really broad topic but I feel like I've gotten a pretty good preliminary grasp on it so far.",
    "Yes",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. The class is small-ish (about 15 students) so the discussions are always great. Professor Wallace is an amazing professor who's knowledge, especially in terms of Chinese politics, shines in class. He does a great job of adding to discussion without becoming a lecturer. The work in the class centers around some very interesting readings (100 pgs. a week max) and writing on a class blog (3 times for the semester). Students are also required to lead a week of discussion which allows you to learn a lot about the readings. The final is pretty standard for seminars (15 pg. essay) and Professor Wallace is always available for help during office hours. Overall a great class for those wishing to learn about dictatorships, definitely recommend.",
    "Yes, especially if the student likes discussions led by peers."
