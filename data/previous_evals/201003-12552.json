    "Very intense course that marks the official beginning of studio life. Each model is more of an exercise than your \"work\". Don't aim tooooo high, try to learn one thing from each exercise, and do ONE thing well in each.",
    "It's studio. You have to take it. Just don't be intimidated- it's possible. It's even possible to do it without pulling a single all-nighter (I did).",
    "If you're taking Junior studio then you are already an architecture major, and you already know what you're in for. This class will consume your life but you will learn a lot about what results are.",
    "You have to take it. Sorry.",
    "You have too if your in the major, good luck",
    "The Junior Studio this year was disorganized but laid the fundamentals for future work. Ask for clear assignment definitions before the assignment is underway. Rely heavily on the TA's and try to always talk to the professors. I've never been so disappointed in a course by the professors (showing up late, missing classes repeatedly, etc) but they are smart people and everyone has something to teach.Do you work well and it'll be a fine semester. It gets old, but studio is fun.",
    "A necessary junior studio, it will take a lot of your time but after a few weeks you will get used to it. A lot of abstract assignments.",
    "This course is required for the major. It serves to introduce students to the studio working environment. this is, however, not completely relevant with the new curriculum as the sophomore class now has an opportunity to work in the studio the semester before this course. Perhaps the assignments should be refocused to account for the curriculum change.",
    "Just be prepared for a lot more weekly work than you ever imagined possible. If you don't know how to manage your time and gauge your progress, you'll learn or die trying. Remember that work in architecture is all about what you show up with at review; nobody cares what happened in the seven days before. So whether you pull four all nighters or show up four minutes before class, make sure you have something you can be proud of.",
    "Junior studio emphasizes the basics: simple, clear drafting and clean, well-crafted models. You're expected to produce a model and drawings for each week. By doing so, the hope is that you learn how to think on your feet, make only purposeful decisions, and work more efficiently. These were accomplished to varying degrees just by working in the studio environment, but it's really up to you to talk to the professors and TAs to get more help. In the end, the most important things you learn will be self-taught. They bring in critics\/ other professors for the really important projects (mid-review and final), so you should not feel compelled to adhere to only the professor's or your TA's aesthetic and preferences."
