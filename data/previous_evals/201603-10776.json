   "comments": [
    "I learned more about analyzing literature than I have in most of my other English courses, I learned so much about Charles Dickens (the author and the man), I learned how to look at and analyze art from critical and historical perspectives. I learned again the value of putting different artworks, text and picture, in conversation. Also, I learned the value of writing multiple drafts of academic papers.",
    "Wonderful to explore the British Art Centre, and fun to really spend the time on Dickens that you want to - normally English classes speed through the material, it was really pleasant to give it more focus.",
    "This course made me better able to understand the complex relationship between visual and verbal forms of communication as well as how literature and art influence one another. It also gave me a broader understanding of victorian art and culture.",
    "This course was a wonderful way to make use of the newly renovated Yale Center for British Art. I hadn't spent much, if any, time at the YCBA prior to this course and am so glad I was able to explore it as well as the Beinecke. Reading and discussing Dickens novels while exploring the YBAC was a great way to spend Tuesday afternoons.",
    "Prof. Carlisle is extremely passionate about Dickens, and knowledgeable about the period in general. The course greatly developed skills of comparison between visual works and texts."

   "comments": [
    "I loved meeting in YCBA and really valued our time in the gallery bays. The only improvement I'd suggest is the impossible one: that the class meet for longer or more than once a week so we could have more time with the books, too.",
    "Fun to spend more time on the books, but also it was very fun to be able to explore the things that were interesting without feeling 'sidetracked'. Being able to look at wedding rings, or certain paintings or engravings that we found interesting was a real treat.",
    "The choices of Dickens texts were wonderful. I wish the class discussion had had more of a direction and that we had spent more time discussing visual art.",
    "It could be improved by a clearer syllabus, with a more focused understanding of what we'd be talking about each day."

    "Yes, yes, yes! English majors: take this course! Although, unfortunately, it may not be offered again.",
    "Amazing, interesting, different. Would recommend.",
    "Wonderful course if you have any interest in art and literature, or victorian culture in general. Great choices of Dickens books. It was amazing to have a class in the British Art center surrounded by paintings.",
    "Highly recommend, although I believe Professor Carlisle is retiring after this semester.",
    "This class is awesome. Dickens is fun and engaging but can also be problematic, and Professor Carlisle doesn't shy away from either side of him. The art breaks up the otherwise long discussions, and having class in the YCBA is an amazing experience.",
    "Yes, especially for those that haven't read Dickens. It leads to new ways of thinking about Dickens' role in Victorian culture."
