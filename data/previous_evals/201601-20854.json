    "Professor Valis is wonderful and clearly cares about the material. The workload consists of three 2-3-page papers plus a final research paper at the end. Don't feel intimidated if you've never written a long paper in Spanish before. You'll surprise yourself! Definitely make an effort to give the readings some time and thought.",
    "I enjoyed this course. The selections were beautiful, and Professor Valis's analysis of the works was lovely. There aren't any bells and whistles: the movement of the course is outlined clearly in the syllabus, and all the works are covered. It's a good course overall, but not my favorite course in the Spanish department. I took it because it's a requirement for the major, so if you're looking for something to fill a language requirement, I would suggest at least shopping some other courses. It's nice, just not life-changing.",
    "You'll get the most out of it if you're already fluent, but if you try, it's very doable.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class! The three short assignments allow you to be creative, which is really refreshing.Professor Valis definitely knows what she's talking about, while also being genuinely interested in what ideas her students have to bring to the discussion.",
    "Good class. Read some interesting works in Spanish that span about 2 centuries. The works are thematically unified and they play with each other well. I spent about 4 hours on the readings\/week.",
    "Absolutely",
    "I would recommend the course to anyone who feels that have a proficient grasp of not only the Spanish language in an academic setting, but also literary analysis.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class for someone who wants to improve their reading comprehension. I truly feel that I saw a difference in my comprehension form the beginning to the end of the course.",
    "Overview of important Spanish literature",
    "Excellent survey class of post eighteenth century Spanish lit. Reading workload is uneven (some weeks it will be just a few poems, others it will be a novel), but the writing workload is very manageable. Be sure to get a head start on the final paper! It is considerably longer than the other essays."
