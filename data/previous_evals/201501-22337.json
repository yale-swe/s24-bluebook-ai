    "This course is a unique opportunity to access the YUAG collection, understand art, and to conduct original research on a piece of artwork. Further, in this class you have incredible access to the top level researcher in the YUAG conservation department and the Center for Preservation of Cultural Heritage. Not only will you learn about the practice of technical research in art you will be able to practice what you learn.",
    "This is a class not quite like any other class. You get to handle paintings, learn about conservation work, and learn about and emploiy analytical techniques such as x-ray, IR and UV imaging. Very chill--5 minute midterm presentation, 10 minute final presentation, 3000 word final paper. Ian is very helpful and pleasant, and it is co-taught by the rest of the conservation staff and scientists. Definitely accessible to people of an art background, and those of a more science background (like myself)--everyone is encouraged to approach the individual project, where you choose a painting and carry out analyses\/write about it, from whatever background. In summary, take this class--you will never have the chance to see behind closed doors of conservation studios or handle paintings from the gallery. Low workload overall."
