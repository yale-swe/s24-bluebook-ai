    "Chem 560L is a laboratory course that consists of four modules, each covering a particular technical skill commonly employed in physical chemistry research.",
    "Very practical laboratory course covering programming\/quantum mechanics, electronics, Raman\/lasers, vacuum technology. Make sure to pace yourself correctly and do not leave things for last minute. Do not be afraid to ask for help. Keep your notebook tidy and do what the module says and then use some common sense and what else should be included.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student as it provided useful hands on experience.",
    "Awesome :)",
    "great course with a lot of work but each module feels like a great accomplishment and was highly related to the research being performed in the labs. I would absolutely recommend it.",
    "I would recommend this course",
    "Yes. It is a great class. The four modules are like four rotations!"

    "This course has really helped to alleviate my anxiety in dealing with experimental aspects of physical chemistry research, especially programming and electronics for which I had little prior experience.",
    "Opened my eyes to how true experimental work is done and how it is not sobad. Very practical lab skills are taught so I feel prepared to join a lab.",
    "This class was useful to open my eyes to aspects of research and research methods that I may have not previously seen as an undergrad.",
    "It helped me increase my practical skills and knowledge",
    "The course brought me to details of how the machine works, and how the computer calculations, which is very helpful."
