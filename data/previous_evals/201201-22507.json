   "comments": [
    "Yes, this is great class! It was a great opportunity to dissect research papers and really learn about the field of neurobiology. The workload is very manageable, and Professor Stein as well as the guest lecturers were all phenomenal.",
    "Pretty easy course. One presentation, one 500 word midterm paper, one 3000 word final paper. Not very difficult, but you get out of it what you put in.",
    "This is probably the most chill science class I have taken at Yale. Some of the lectures are pretty interesting, but paying attention seems somewhat optional because there are no tests on the material. The paper assignments are really open and they are what you make of them (you can pick an interesting topic, put in a lot of effort, and learn a lot, or you can not). I don't feel like I learned a ton in this class, but had I put more efforts into paying attention and doing the reading, I probably would have learned more.",
    "I would recommend this class to students who want to receive an in depth knowledge about key parts of the neuronal system- quite detailed so maybe it is worth simplifying the material.",
    "Definitely recommend as essential biological upper level class, especially for those on the neurobiology MCDB track",
    "I definitely would recommend it; it's low workload, and writing the papers makes you feel like a real scientist. It's a little hard to follow the lectures, but you don't need to understand everything to do well in the class",
    "This class is a great way of learning a lot about a fairly specific aspect of neuroscience (cell biology and it's role in neural development is how I would summarize it) that isn't covered in Neurobiology, and it does so in a much less information-heavy and approachable manner based on reading and presenting papers. It is true that there isn't often much incentive to read the papers for days you aren't presenting but one can still learn a lot from Professor Stein's lectures if you turn off the laptop and participate.",
    "This was a wonderful course. I learned a lot about the cell biological principles of neurology which was very interesting after taking cell biology and learning about neurology through research. I also enjoyed the student presentations which allowed us to engage with a particular topic. Finally, I thought that the final papers were greatways to synthesize the information we learned particularly the news and reviews paper. Professor Stein was wonderful. She was so personable and funny which helped make the classroom environment comfortable. This is important because it was a discussion based class and because the material was quite difficult so it made us more willing to speak up and ask questions. It is obvious that she put in a lot of time preparing her presentations which were very comprehensive. I hope she continues to teach in the coming years.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student that wants to learn more about cell biology of the neuron. The topics are presented clearly along with relevant papers. On top of that the material itself is very interesting, ensuring that each 75-minute lecture will keep your attention.",
    "Definitely. You will learn how to read a lot of scientific studies and how to think critically about them. Overall, a low time commitment but the assignments cause you to draw on skills you have been developing over the entire semester."
