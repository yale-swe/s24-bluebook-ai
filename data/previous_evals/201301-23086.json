   "comments": [
    "Take this class! People think they know enough about the Holocaust, but the fact of the matter is, there is so much more to it and surrounding it. It is incredibly fascinating and heartbreaking, but riveting material. Professor Saperstein is wonderful and taught us to look at historical events as if we are currently living them, i.e. not judging people for choices they made without having any idea about where the future will take them. Great, great class. Very manageable work load. Interesting assignments and fascinating readings. TAKE IT!",
    "Take it. Not hard. 3 short papers and a final",
    "Good overview of the holocaust, although final exam is a lot of memorizing",
    "Absolutely.",
    "I don't think I would recommend this course, unless you really need a Humanities credit, or a class that's fairly easy until the final, which you'll have to study like mad for because you have no idea what will be on it. I'm not sure I learned very much about the Holocaust, and I don't have a clear timeline of what happened. What I do have is a recollection of what a lot of historians thought about the Holocaust, and a bunch of accounts from survivors.Saperstein isn't the best lecturer, and many classes it just seemed like he was saying the same thing from the lecture before, but slightly differently. I know there's enough material on the Holocaust to merit a full course, but this class certainly didn't make it seem that way. In short, it's fine if you want a fairly easy class with light reading, or if you really want a classroom setting to learn about the Holocaust, but in general, if you really want to learn about this subject, just read a book on it. You'll probably get the same amount out it.",
    "A lecture. Not too exciting with a ton of reading and a hard final",
    "This class is a great survey of topics pertaining to the holocaust. It offers you a chance to engage with primary sources from both Nazi and Jewish perspectives and raises several controversies among holocaust scholars. The final was surprisingly hard but the material was manageable and interesting overall. Take it!"
