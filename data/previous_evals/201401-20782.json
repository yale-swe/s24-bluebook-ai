    "Absolutely. Amazing (and really important!) reading, and Prof. Jacobson is a very talented discussion leader. Favorite class at Yale.",
    "If you do most of the reading, and are comfortable participating in discussion, The American Color Line is a great introduction to modern US racial history.",
    "Yes definitely! Only take it if you are willing to engage with discussing race and all that entails. Also if you are able to read a whole book a week (sometimes it's a long book) then definitely take it. Great class, really worth all the reading and not much work outside of that!",
    "Great class with an interesting syllabus and good professor",
    "TAKE THIS COURSE!! There is so much reading material but it is all SO SO SO GOOD. Literally everyone should take this class. The syllabus is hard to beat and Jacobson is a champ.",
    "Yes! I hope Professor Jacobson will be at Yale to teach this course again. He's a great professor and allows us to really and critically engage in issues of race that are still very relevant today. The books we have to read are fantastic.",
    "It's an amazing exploration if race and history in America mainly since the 20th century. You learn a ton without having to do a ton of work. This is how all Yale classes should be.",
    "Overall, this course is pretty great. Workload is low (just a 15-20 page final paper and weekly current events entries), and Jacobson is incredibly chill in seminar. While the course can get slow at times (and like other Am St courses, the reading is mostly fiction with supplementary history lectures in class), the reading list is really great, and Jacobson flashes brilliance many times through the semester. This is his area of interest, and if he's still around teaching it, he's the one to learn about the history of racial politics with. I came away from the semester real happy- the workload and reading was extremely manageable (just a book a week), and I see political and cultural moments\/aspects\/events enmeshed in racial politics in a way like never before. As Jacobson says, race more than anything else defined the 20th century, and to situate anything historical in a proper context, an understanding of race and how racial politics operate becomes necessary. Take this course! It's significant, eye-opening, and Jacobson is a legend.",
    "Yes! Great discussions, interesting texts and an interesting essay.",
    "DEFINITELY TAKE THIS COURSE. Whatever race, gender, or ethnicity you are AFAM 210 will cause you to look differently at American history and at daily American life today. Professor Jacobson is a brilliant man, and just to hear some of his insights on a weekly basis was an honor for me.",
    "If you thought Jacobson was an incredible FORMAC teacher then you will be blown away by the quality of his seminar. It's an absolutely fantastic class (with an incredible reading list that I wish I could've covered more of) and the conversations we had on current events relating to race were very insightful. Really, really great class."
