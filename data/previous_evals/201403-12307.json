    "The class is a great survey on Chinese foreign policy, with a lot of opportunity to frame your own questions and analyze critical text on the topic. Although you may learn more basic facts from rote memorizing names of leaders and key international relation events in a lecture format, this class allows you to engage with greater depth. I would recommend this class to another student, but I would first urge the student to gain a basic understanding of the issues facing China since the seminar is geared towards more experienced or advanced students on the topic. My favorite part of the class was when we could integrate current events into the more general political science texts, whether the Hong Kong protests, APEC, etc",
    "Only if you want to learn scholarly perspectives on China. If you're not willing to academically engage with these subjects, it won't be worth your time."
