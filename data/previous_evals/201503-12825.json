    "Arch History I was a great survey of architecture from the Pyramids to Piranesi. I would definitely recommend the course to anyone interested in architecture, history, or art history (as it is a fantastic way to learn about world history through the perspective of the built environment). Although the class is predominantly upperclassmen, I found it very manageable (and inspiring!) as a freshman. Also, the flexibility to choose essentially any work of architecture for the midterm\/final was really refreshing.",
    "It is a great class to take if you want to know more about classic architecture in a fun way.",
    "Unless you are an architecture major or have a deep interest in this specific topic, I would recommend you take a different survey class. There is only two papers and no final, so very little workload. But lectures are nothing out of this world.",
    "I would not recommend this class to another student unless he is an architecture major.",
    "Would definitely recommend."
