    "This was my first real introduction to sociological approaches to networks. As such, I feel that I became much more familiar with the literature, the reading list compiled on the syllabus itself made me feel much more comfortable about asking novel questions relevant to the literature. The primary insight for me was understanding how sociologists think about networks beyond doing network analysis.",

   "comments": [
    "In a course like this, there is a tension between approaching networks from the technical vs \"theoretical\" angles. However, I don't know how to integrate them more effectively.",
    "I think the readings are very good. I wish that there is more time for peer discussions about projects so we can hear ideas and collaborate more. Emily does a great job engaging students, hope that there was a chance to collaborate with peers more and learn more from each other.",
    "Spend more time up front in the first couple classes developing a common background and understanding of the jargon\/terms for everyone in the class before diving into the theoretical and applied work."

   "comments": [
    "I think that this course is a great addition to more technically oriented courses that teach students how to do network analysis, who may feel confused about how to translate those skills into social science research. I don't know what the background of the other students are, nor what their projects are on, but I could imagine that it's daunting for someone who doesn't have much statistical experience to complete the project for the course.",
    "Yes! This is a wonderful class in a field that will become increasingly important.",
    "I have recommended this course to anyone interested in networks or data science. The material we covered was consistently interesting and novel enough to keep me engaged with the readings and in-class discussions.",
    "Yes!",
    "Yes, it will develop the beginnings of understanding a field that most people dont know about AND add a skill to your toolkit at the same time, something that doesnt happen very often in Yale classes."
