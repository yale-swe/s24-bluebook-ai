    "Cashore is lively and does a good job using the tricky 3 hour lecture block, but his disorganization takes away from his intelligence and nuance as a professor.",
    "On Question 10, all the concepts were pretty foggy to me until about the 11th or 12th week of the semester when writing the policy memo helped tie it all together for me. I'd recommend requiring students to begin their policy memos sooner in the semester.",
    "Overall, I enjoy the instructor's presentation style and approachability. I also think he explains things clearly.I think collectively the teaching team can try to be a bit more organized in executing things.I would also encourage a bit more experimentation with the class structure and pedagogical strategy, as there are things that may work more or less well than the current one. We discussed them in our last session.",
    "This course offers a theoretical explanation of the policy process. For much of the semester I was disappointed that it was not more practical. However, by the end of the semester I came to appreciate the theory more (I still would liked more practical experience). Writing the 12-15 page policy memo was one of the most valuable learning experiences I have had. Very similar (and more practical) experience can be had in F&ES 610 Science to Solutions but I actually enjoyed taking both courses together.",
    "I was absolutely impressed with this class. Cashore is a fantastic professor! It is apparent that he puts a lot of energy to prepare classes, and loves what he does.",
    "Regarding the lecture: Two make up classes were scheduled back to back. The first make up class was on a Friday afternoon and the location of the class was not announced until about an hour before the class began. Very disorganized. The second make up class was the Monday immediately following the Friday make up class. To add insult to injury, this make up class was scheduled immediately after the existing Monday evening class. So we had class from 2:30-8:30pm. Next semester someone else should be tasked with scheduling any make up classes.",
    "This class is very helpful for people without a background on environmental policy. People with a science background might find this class of the outmost importance due to its content and how it links both science and social sciences.",
    "I got the most out of the class by one-on-one interactions with the professor.",
    "On several occasions I found the readings for this course fairly frustrating. First, many were fairly badly written and therefore hard to read. A number were also very dense and difficult to decipher for students new to policy studies. I was not a fan of our primary text (The Public Policy Primer) because it was aimed at public managers and as someone who worked in the government I did not feel it was relevant or useful."

    "It covered the whole policy process.",
    "Lexicon of policy formulation. for all of its difficulty, doing the policy memo was awesome.",
    "The cultivation of broad thinking and of asking questions rather than answering them. Good to foster a healthy skepticism of the theories of policy.",
    "case studies readings were helpful",
    "The in-class group discussions were an excellent way to check that we were understanding the material, especially to have us immediately apply it rather than waiting for an exam or TA section. I liked the structure of the class and the organization--keep it a 3 hour class.",
    "the policy memo is a good assignment, and the lectures were always interesting (if long).",
    "The policy memo.",
    "Builds a strong conceptual framework to understand how things happen in the policy world. Good to understand certain relevant policy cases. Ben is enjoyable to take class with.",
    "Professor Cashore's energy and enthusiasm was very much appreciated. Michael Stone's discussion section were also very well organized and informative.",
    "Lectures were very engaging.",
    "The structure of the course made it very easy to follow our learning process. I liked how we were able to apply the policy process lectures in the policy memo. Classes were also very engaging.",
    "The instructor. Cashore prepares the classes in a way that they run smoothly while we learn a lot! He is obviously very confortable in talking about every single issue he touches, and he makes all of them completely interesting. Cashore is the first professor\/professional in politics I have been in touch with that talks about real life.",
    "The primer textbook.",
    "I loved the material and the frameworks that Ben presents for understanding the policy process. The exams and memo were great for getting us to absorb and analyze the concepts. This was my favorite class this semester.",
    "I thought the policy memos was a useful exercise, and I learned a lot from writing it. However, I wish it was due earlier, and that we had a chance to re-work it. I would recommend having us submit a draft much earlier in the semester, which would be graded, then we would have a chance to address the comments in the final draft. Also, I think emphasis should be placed on policy memos that can actually be submitted to someone\/ an organization, to make it a more practical exercise, and students should be encouraged to submit them.",
    "Lectures, readings, and assignments",
    "Being able to write a memo for a real world client and receiving detailed comment\/help on the draft.",

    "The professor and TAs are passionate about helping you learn the material.",
    "Ben is excellent and engaging, and a clear expert in this field. He",
    "The policy memo that we wrote in this class was far and away the most useful and interesting part of this course. Not only was this a very useful exercise in applying what we had learned in the class, but Professor Cashore also provided impressively detailed feedback on each person's memo. The guest lecture in the final class by Maria Inanova was exceptional. I also really appreciated that we were given a choice of what topics we wanted to address on the final exam so that we could focus on the topics of the greatest interest and utility to us.",
    "The broad introduction to the concept of policy and the politics of policy agenda setting and formulation, implementation and evaluation. The equally broad understanding of Professor Ben Cashore regarding the subject matter of policy and the adept and able support of Michael Stone."

    "Cashore's powerpoint slides are a mess. He needs to proofreed them- it is unnacceptable to have glaring typos and grammatical errors on slides, in my opinion. it is distracting to the point where it feels like Cashore doesn't care his lecturing- which i know he really does. He truly is a good and smart lecturer, but with some better framing and organizing of the slides (using consistent headings would be GREAT), it would really improve the course.",
    "Organization of the syllabus, schedule, etc.",
    "- as someone without any experience or prior education regarding policy or politics, this course was a bit difficult for me because of the jargon and numerous terms that were not always clearly explained- some of the readings seemed more appropriate for people already very familiar with the policy sciences, not for students just beginning to learn",
    "I did not see the point in reading the scholarship literature assigned. It was dense& difficult to understand, yet was never explained or explored in class.",
    "coordination between the prof and the TAs could have been better, particularly with regards to the policy memo.",
    "I think the case studies should be walked through step-by-step in conjunction with the theory. For someone who hasn't been exposed to REDD+ and other forest issues, the examples were a little difficult to tie to the theories when the link wasn't explicit.",
    "Trying to link more or discuss more the cases would be a benefit. I feel that we spent a lot of in-class time going over every detail of the materials that students should have read, and left much less time to really talk about how the frameworks apply to the cases presented. I also think the little presentation groups cut into this time... those were good to change the rythm of the class, but I'm not sure how much we got out of them every single week... felt like some weeks we really went \"aha!\" and some weeks we were treading water. I would suggest experimenting more with that structure, as well as with the discussion sections.",
    "I would have appreciated spend more time on the practical exercises at the end of lecture.The Wu readings were useful but the other \"scholarship\" readings were dense and not accessible. I ended up skipping those readings after the middle of the semester. I did appreciation the case study readings and kept up with those.",
    "Readings and organization. It was difficult to know which aspects of the readings were important, and there was often confusion about when things were due, or when we had section. I also often got different responses from the professor and TA (e.g., what should be included in the policy memo). I know they don't like to be too specific about requirements, but having a little more authoritative directions might help. There should also be more guidance for the policy memos.",
    "The questions after the break could be done in another day. Sometimes, I could feel that the groups did not take advantage of it, because the lecture was intense and we were a bit tired.",
    "Real world application and grounding beyond huge issues like climate change and global deforestation. Scale of policy issues was limited.Structure and OrganizationImprove final structure. In class essays with prior knowledge of the questions is less than ideal. At home essays or unknown in class essays- not a mix of the two.",
    "The PowerPoints. Some have trouble with Ben's lecturing style since it is more circular than they are used to, but I thought his lectures were great. The PowerPoints, however, took away from the lectures sometimes. They need to be edited, because they were full of errors to the point that it impeded understanding of what he was trying to say. The bullet points were usually not distinct points, and instead were often parts of the same sentence or thought.",
    "Ben's lecture notes are very difficult to follow, and could benefit from being better organized with proper grammar\/ punctuation, so that they are easier to understand. It would be helpful to get the notes several days in advance, so we could review them in advance of the classes.The concepts covered in this course are very high level and abstract, and often difficult to follow, and Ben might overestimate the students' ability to follow them. It was often difficult for me to make the connection between the readings, the concepts we discussed, and how they related to policy.There were far too many readings - it would be better to focus on a few key readings, because the sheer number and length of readings seemed unfeasible to tackle, and made me just decide not to read most of them for this class, as it would take a lot of effort to make a small dent. It would be better to have at least half the number of readings, or better yet a third of them, but to focus on the very important ones, so that students are more likely to actually read them.It was great that Ben left the second part of each class for a group exercise, but unfortunately he never left enough time for us to do the exercise appropriately, which was very stressful for our group, who always felt unprepared and dreaded speaking up. We need at least 45 minutes for the exercise, so that we actually can discuss the concepts and come up with a decent solution and not just feel like we have to throw something together very quickly just in time to present.Because the lecture is 3 hours, we need a solid 15 minute break halfway between the class or two 10 minute breaks that are not part of our group work time, because after an hour, it is very difficult to focus on the lecture any more and I didn't get any value out of it as I was very tired and needed a break. Many other students felt the same way.It would be much more interesting if we got to switch up our work groups each week, so that we could get to know other people in the class and hear different perspectives. Especially considering some of the groups ended up being very small when people dropped the class.",
    "The lectures should not be so abstract. The discussion section at the end of class was not helpful.",
    "Organization regarding review sessions",
    "Unfortunately, the linkage between the theory and the cases was usually glossed over and very weakly established. The case readings were usually only very loosely related to the scholarship readings and the material covered in the corresponding class. Many of the readings were barely covered in class. Many times the readings were very long, which would have been fine if they were really central to the expected learnings, but often the readings seemed only peripherally relevant.",
    "More clear understanding of the concepts. They were too theoretical at times.",
    "The powerpoints were really awful and unclear, and it was hard to keep up with Ben's jargon at times. Theoretical readings were not useful for me, and an incentive to do at least the case study readings would have been helpful rather than just the one big project at the end. In terms of the final project itself, it was helpful, but very hard to adjust to exactly what Ben's idea of the project was.",
    "I honestly found the lectures in this class pretty confusing. The power point slides were rather hard to follow and often had many grammatical mistakes that made them hard to re-read later. I did not find the group discussions in the second half of each class useful. Professor Cashore solicited feedback on the last day of class and I thought that a number of the suggestions that were made on how the class could be improved were excellent. In particular,there should be integration of the policy memos into class discussions. Since the memos were the most valuable aspect of this class in that they applied what we learned, I though it was a big miss to not have people share what they were writing about. As someone suggested, it would have been very useful to have people explain the different sections of their memo in the relevant classes (for example, everyone would share their problem definition in the class immediately following the class on agenda setting). Additionally, I would have gotten even more out of the policy memo if we had a mandatory rough draft due several weeks before the final draft was due. That way would every student would be sure to get comments from Professor Cashore and\/or the TAs as well as possibly their classmates on how their policy analysis could be improved.",
    "I feel that the introduction of the policy memorandum that we were required to prepare could've been made earlier in the course so that the students will have been guided better. If it coincided with the pace with which the different policy stages, beginning from policy initiation to evaluation, the students may have been able to space their questions throughout the length of the course, and the lab sessions will have been more relevant.Also, given that an hour was spent at the end of the lecture for group discussion, I feel that the group discussion was not maximized given the rushed discussion that ensued every time we sat down to go through the topic assigned to my group, as may have been the case with the other groups.I feel that the lecture, the lab section, the required policy memo and the work group at the end of the lectures should have complemented each other."

    "I think the discussion section should be more structured. Instead of just having a free-for-all discussion section, the discussion section should have specific objectives. Often, the discussion wouldn't take off because noone knew what to talk about or there wasn't a good prompt.",
    "Yes, discussions were most often used to clarify the lectures (which could be unclear at times). I would have appreciated more discussion than just asking questions of the TA and getting responses (though they were very good and useful responses!)In the future, discussion could be more of a practical exercise than re-hashing of lecture.",
    "Section never really had much to do with the lectures. It was complementary, and we could ask questions, but I think maybe some more formulaic approach would be useful (e.g., working on policy memos) and would also even out the different sections.",
    "In discussion section we would sometimes just get together to talk about the previous class. I think we could have made better use of the discussions if we had assignments or workshops in this time. Like suggested in our in-class comments for the course, I strongly recommend to use discussion sections to work on policy memos.",
    "Cashore is a great lecturer and I did not feel the need to attend to TA's discussion sections to clarify the material. Instead, I preferred to take advantage of that time to go more carefully over the readings and lectures' presentations by myself. I suggest that the TA's sections is used for discussion the memo through the semester.",
    "Devin was an excellent teaching assistant but the discussions were of limited use and I often felt Devin was operating under very unclear expectations and objectives.",
    "I greatly enjoyed the lectures, but felt that the discussion section was unnecessary. I did not understand why it was required to go to section, since it was more of a forum to ask questions if you had trouble with the material. Why not make it optional so that the people who need help can choose to go?",
    "The discussion section was very helpful, and it helped me to understand the concepts taught in the course.",

    "Very little-- but it was a space in which to ask questions, which was good.",
    "The weekly discussion section absolutely helped to clarify what we were supposed to be learning from lecture. I think it was hard to have a discussion section on Friday afternoon, however, and so sometimes I felt like the hour was not used as effectively as it could have been.",
    "I feel the lab sections may have been improved if it was clearly identified at the start that we had to identify a separate one hour section separate from the lecture. Also, while the lab section is suppose to support the lecture by providing clarity to topics in the lecture that were not fully elaborated upon, the lab sections may have been more valuable if it allowed the TA to provide more in-depth guidance on the policy memo throughout the course."

Devin was great at leading discussion and engaging us, and from our discussions we were able to learn the concepts from the lecture better. He also devoted part of our TA session time to having different students pitch their ideas for their policy memos and we would allprovide feedback, which was very helpful for all of us.

    "Instructor: Michael William Stone \u00a0Michael Stone is a very good and knowledgeable TA. He was accessible and very helpful in elucidating what was left unclear by the lectures. He will make a terrific professor some day! My only complaint is that he can dominate the discussion. If he turned questions back to the students more often it would make for a more engaging session.",
    "Instructor: Michael William Stone \u00a0Michael was helpful and quite knowledgeable, although not the most responsive to email.",
    "Instructor: Michael William Stone \u00a0Michael was always very accessible. Thoughtful on discussion sections and willing to give his personal opinion to the topics we were covering. I think it is valuable to get a second opinion on the course material in order to be able to critically learn the course content.The grading system of the course was very fair to me. I liked how Ben, Michael and Devin would grade the exams separately and then students would be graded upon the average of the three gradings.To improve Michael's contribution I would suggest him to come more prepared to discussion sections. Bringing some questions about the readings beforehand would be helpful to give a structure to sections.",
    "Instructor: Michael William Stone \u00a0Michael is very knowledgeable, approachable and friendly. He succeeded in explaining difficult theoretical concepts.",
    "Instructor: Michael William Stone \u00a0Strenghts: willing to listen, approachable, well trained, very well organized and ready to discuss",
    "Instructor: Michael William Stone \u00a0Michael was great to work with and does a good job of trying to clarify the course material. As mentioned above, however, our time in the discussion section was not always used as effectively as possible. Sometimes we seemed to go off on narrow tangents. It would have been more helpful to ensure that a thorough overview of each week's material was provided in the discussion section rather than just asking students what they wanted to talk about\/were confused about.",
    "Instructor: Michael William Stone \u00a0I believe very strongly that Michael Stone is the epitome of an excellent teaching assistant given his in-depth understanding of the different topics included in the course and that he showed his ability by delivering a lecture in the class and the adept handling he had of the lab sections assigned to him. He made himself available outside of the lectures and the lab sections if there were any students who needed more time to appreciate the lecture. He also was always present in the lectures. This especially made a difference as he also contributed during the lectures to further elucidate on the lecture topic.I would really appreciate it if how Michael Stone conducted himself would be presented to other TAs as an example of how TAs generally present themselves to the class."

    "This was my favourite course for the semester. Since I want to work with policy-making, this work is the basis for my studies here at Yale. Very valuable.",
    "I didn't have any strong course in politics during college, and that was a must-take for me. I am a very logical person and usually learn from practical experiences, so I was a little concerned of spending the whole semester talking only about theoretical issues. However, I was surprised how much I could from this course. Cashore links the theory with real life examples in a way that everything becomes interesting.Also, I am interested in ecosystem valuation from tropical forests, and this courses fits perfectly as it uses many cases in this field.",
    "While not my focus, the policy invades all spheres.",

    "I am interested in sustainable land use policy in developing countries.",
    "As a person with a Biology and science background this course was very helpful. I was able to apply scientific knowledge and learn what is the process of policy making.I also learned key terms of environmental policy to apply as a potential policy maker.",
    "It is a foundation course.",
    "I think this course could be very useful in understanding the human element in policymaking, and understanding how organizations work and how to work with and within them.",
    "In theory, this was a theoretical grounding, but I actually needed to learn more about the background of environmental policy, not just the theory so i can participate in discussions in my field. The approach is useful, but not enough, especially as it is a very specific one developed by a few political scientists.",
    "I was very interested in transitioning my career from law to policy upon entering FES. I hoped that this course might provide me with an introduction and good foundation in policy analysis.",
    "As an MESc student, I am expected to take courses on research since that is the final output we are suppose to make. Thus, given that I intend to conduct research on a policy-related environmental topic, F&ES 525 would be very useful in providing the foundation to the research I will conduct. While it is a foundations course for MEM students and I am not expected to take foundation courses, it was relevant for me to take this course."

Unfortunately I was disappointed by this class and it honestly left me feeling less excited about policy studies. Perhaps this was in part because it was my first introduction into this field and hence there was a lot of theory and jargon to get used to. Overall, I finished this course feeling confused about what I had really gotten out of it."

   "question_text": "If yes, what were the advantages and disadvantages of the group work?",
   "comments": [
    "Good change of pace in a 3-hr session. Good to discuss these kinds of ideas.It felt like a lot of what we discussed in groups was stuff that we kind of already knew... I honestly think people in FES know enough about some of these environmental issues that they can easily BS their way through a 1-2 minute answer to the posted question. I.e. they can put together something decent without even having done too many of the readings, and it will still sound ok\/good. I think varying this structure to pre-assign topics and have the presentations be longer\/beefier might yield a more tangible result. I.e. don't have each group present every class. Have 1-2 groups present per class and give them 5-10 minutes each, with time for the class to really interact with and develop the ideas presented. I some someone in class said \"but they would then not do readings for other topics\" (during our feedback session), but I find that an insubstantial risk. I can tell you that in one or two class sessions, the bulk of us in my group had not done the readings for that week and we still came up with something that sounded decent. That's not reason enough. Also, people will get out of the class what they put into it. There will always be missed readings every here and there... it's not avoidable. But at least this way, you force each group to really do a deep dive on some of the readings to understand them and lead a deeper discussion in class. Might be more interesting. Different approach to mile-wide inch-deep.",
    "We were asked to discuss about each lecture right after Ben finished the class. I think it was a good way to get aditional points of view in order to complement my learning of the course.",
    "Advantages - questions sections made as think quickly for a solution in a very complex arena; the interaction with other students was really interesting; listening to others groups responses was interesting too.Disadvantages - after a long (but awesome!) lecture, we were many times tired to participate in the questions sections. I suggest to alternate groups every week (not all groups every class) or taking this section to another day.",
    "Interesting discussions among students of various backgrounds. Seemed very forced at times after a long lecture and students were tired.",
    "We had groups to answer a question at the end of each class. I loved the groups and thought discussing a question with peers did a lot to help us understand the concepts presented that day.",
    "I got together with some fellow students to review concepts in advance of the final exam. I found it to be helpful to discuss key concepts\/ theories with other students.",
    "The discussion group with the TA was helpful to illustrate examples of the theories discussed in class.",
    "Idea exchange, feedback, and getting to know new people.",
    "The group work was a good break from the lectures for the 3-hour class. It was very disappointing that we had to stay with the same groups throughout the semester. It was a large class and it could have been more productive to get to interact with different people. It was absolutely ridiculous that, towards the end of the semester, we were polled by vote in class to be given the option to form new groups. Of course nobody will vote for it if all their long-time group members can see how they vote.",
    "We had group discussions in class as well as weekly discussion sections. There was not as much dialogue generated between students in the discussion section as I would have liked and it often ended up being more of a back and forth with the TA. This could in part have been due to low energy levels in the Friday afternoon time slot we had. Although I enjoyed my group for the discussions in class, I often felt that we were grasping at straws trying to apply a new theory or theme to specific case studies.",
    "The work group allowed the different members to share their knowledge depending on the topic that was assigned to the group. The students were assigned to groups that I felt were random but then allowed the groups to take advantage of the knowledge brought to the table by the different students and thus made for very interesting exchanges.On the other hand, the disadvantage working with the group stemmed from two things. First, not all group members were present or did not make themselves present throughout the length of the course. While members were present for the lecture for most of the time, some members decided to absent themselves from the discussion.Second, the topics for discussion were only presented to the group prior to discussion and the discussion was largely hurried so that some aspects of the presentation by the assigned group member sometime were not done in the discussion but while other groups were presenting their output. Again, the work groups may be more useful if the intent for the groups were more thoroughly developed.",
    "Some of the students did not always do the readings, and it compromised the quality of the group."

    "be prepared to be confused by Ben at first, but it isn't that intense in terms of work load and you get out what you put in. Ben's a good dude. every first impression you get of Cashore's teaching style\/(dis)organization is correct- so think about that when considering the course.",
    "Extract what you can from the readings, and use the professor's lecture as commentary on it.",
    "Be selective about which readings you feel are most necessary because there are a lot of readings! Start early on your memo, and have Ben or the TF read through an early version!",
    "it's an interesting course and worth taking. It's definitely important to read the assigned papers before class to get the most out of them.",
    "If you're considering a role in policy, or policy significantly affects the particular area of your interest (which it likely does), this course is worth considering.",
    "This is a theory-heavy course. I came to appreciate the theory by the end of the semester. For a more practical course, check out FES610 Science to Solutions.",
    "Start on your policy memo early!",
    "This is a very good foundations course if you have interest to work in policy making. I strongly recommend to take it.",
    "Before choosing - Take it! It was my favorite class in this semester and Cashore is a really good professor. I strongly recommend taking this course for international students, and those interested in tropical forests issues.When taking - Take the readings seriously; they are key for your understanding and participation in class, and open your mind for a learning process. Do not miss classes unless you really need; you will feel behind. Take REALLY advantage of your policy memo to learn!!! It was the main learning point for many of us, and it fun to work with it since you can use an issue of personal\/professional interest. Also, discuss your drafts with Cashore and TAs; it is impressive how much you learn from them.",
    "Be prepared to think differently. Policymaking is not a linear process where 1+1=2 and you cannot always follow a set of steps to get to a guaranteed outcome. It is circular, riddled with feedback loops, and not entirely rational. Ben presents great frameworks for understanding how things get done in that context, but you have to be open to his nonlinear style.",
    "Recognize that this is a very conceptual and theoretical class, and is not as practical as some might wish for. There is a lot of reading, which can be difficult to keep up with. If you don't dothe readings for a given week, it is difficult to contribute to the group work as part of the class or the TA session. Start your policy memo early and you will get the most out of it. Focus your policy memo on an organization\/ problem that actually needs addressing, and plan to submit it, and you will find it a more useful exercise.",
    "This class is extremely theoretical. Unless you are interesting in delving deep into the theories behind policy this is not the right class for you.",
    "Don't read everything, be selective and make the most out of each class by doing all of the exercises in group as if this were cases from real life.",
    "Definitely, one of the best courses taught at F&ES. Very useful concepts, and an opportunity to write an actual memo for a real client.",
    "Try to really understand what Ben says in class, and then apply this actively to the case studies, etc. Develop your own opinions and your own case studies throughout.",
    "Although I definitely respect Professor Cashore and Michael Stone and think they are talented teachers, I think some major changes need to be made to the structure of this course before I would recommend it to other students."
