   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this class if you really want to learn Hindi. It is often a class where you have to be very disciplined, just because of the nature of the class - it is relaxed and determined by your own needs\/wants.",
    "Although this class covers a great deal of material in a single semester, it has significant drawbacks. It lacks a coherent structure, which is a vital aspect of language instruction. Vocabulary is not organized whatsoever, and it is taught without any specific theme or goal (a single vocab list can talk about anything from nature to alcoholism to politics, instead of coalescing around travel or school or relationships). It takes a month to learn the simple present tense verb conjugations, but four or five verb forms (including past, subjunctive, and future) are thrown at students in the final two weeks. No consistent speaking practice is incorporated into the course, and the class itself is conducted entirely in English. The biggest strength of this course is the fluency you gain with the Devanagari script. Aside from that, the course desperately needs more focus and structure to be effective.",
    "Excellent but a little disorganized",
    "Excellent class. Really focused on making the students learn and absorb as much as possible. I was shocked to realize how much I learnt by the end of the semester. Professors are relatable and helpful.",
    "Yes!! It is a great class where we learned a lot.",
    "This class is a fun and interesting way to learn Hindi. Compared to most romance language classes, which focus on lots of drills, you will be learning Hindi mainly by absorbing what you hear and see around you in class. This can be exciting, but can also be frustrating if you are used to learning in a very structured way. At the end of the semester, you will probably be amazed by how much Hindi you know. You will also realize that your Hindi is very imperfect. The instructors really emphasize trying new things out rather than saying everything perfectly. If you want to learn Hindi, go for it. Realize that going to class 5 days a week can get to be a lot. Get a Hindi tutor from the beginning, it will make things much easier for you."
