   "comments": [
    "You read the books on which all of western literature is based. You see parallels that you had never dreamed of. And Peter Hawkins makes you have fun doing it. There is a lot of reading out loud which borders on acting.Totally a fun class.",
    "I would definitely recommend DS Literature. This class gave me the chance to read classic Western texts that have shaped Western history and literature with a knowledgeable professor and intelligent and passionate students in a small class setting. You do have to be committed as there is a lot of reading, and depending on how good your writing is coming into college, you may not get the grades you want, but that is far outweighed by what you gain in this class.",
    "Definitely recommend. Reading the passages aloud in class certainly helps you develop an appreciation for the texts beyond what you would have just reading it in your head.",
    "Yes, take (and love!) DS Lit. Professor Hawkins is amazing as a section leader, and his voice is the most beautiful thing I've ever heard. Literature readings are probably the best of the three sections, and they always inspired very passionate discussion in my class. Professor Hawkins' grading is very fair, although it may focus perhaps a bit more on writing style than on the merits of your arguments. If you're lucky enough to be in his section, gloat to all your friends, because he's fantastic.",
    "Take it!! So good!",
    "In short, Directed Studies Literature is a chronological survey of the so-called Western Canon. It's definitely not for everyone, but if you're the sort of students who's interested in the great works of the past and enjoys reading, then their is no better thing you could do freshman year than Directed Studies.",
    "It's hard not to fall in love with these texts, and it's so great to have the time to probe them further.",
    "Directed Studies is a fast paced course in the great books of Western Literature. I highly recommend it; the lectures are fascinating and the subject matter could not be more interesting. After taking Directed Studies, you will have a changed world perspective and a more highly developed approach to reading and writing.",
    "I'd say that DS lit is a great introduction to western literature, and an awesome opportunity to read the classics if you haven't been able to yet. DS is definitely not for everyone, though. I would recommend it to anyone who is seriously considering going into the humanities and has a vested interest in the history of western literature.",
    "I would recommend this class to a curious and motivated student. It is a rigorous but highly rewarding class if you put in the effort. You will come out with refined perspective on the evolution of literature through genres, characters, themes, etc.",
    "I would say that DIrected Studies 001 07 is an excellent class. As intensive as it is, you would not regret all your efforts because it truly gives you a better understanding of human nature. Its corpus is delightful and by the end of the term, you really feel getting something out of it.So I would recommend for all those reasons this class to anyone who is ready to work hard to study all those masterpieces.",
    "I took Directed Studies to become a better writer, but that was a terrible mistake. There are no drafts, so the learning curve is very steep. If you're already an elite writer when you enter the course, then you will be fine. Anything below that and you will get slammed probably harder than any other course here; the expectations were just ridiculous."
