    "I learned about the language and history surrounding royal and dedicatory inscriptions- I especially enjoyed seeing how Phoenician language differed from other Semitic languages and the history around inscriptions.",
    "How to recognize and translate Phoenician inscriptions",
    "I developed knowledge of the Phoenician language and also the tools epigraphists use to decipher inscriptions.",
    "I really enjoyed the hands on experience.",
    "I learned about the morphology and grammar of the Phoenician language, as well as how to directly read the inscriptions themselves. These inscriptions served as a vehicle for learning about the history ancient Phoenician rulers, city-states, and religion.",
    "I learned a great deal about the Phoenician language and the methods used in the study of ancient inscriptions, and I became familiar with the scholarly resources available for epigraphic research. I also gained a greater understanding of ancient Near Eastern history more generally, and of the ways in which epigraphy and other material evidence have helped shape current knowledge of that history."

   "comments": [
    "The only thing that I think would have strengthened my understanding of the language is a little more organized of an approach to the different verbal systems and their characteristics, as I found the original treatment a bit quick and a little confusing.",
    "Strength: hands-on approach was very helpful for acquiring skills we were learning in class",
    "I would say that the main strength of the course was the focus on actual physical inscriptions rather than modern transcriptions. I feel well prepared to read Phoenician script across several centuries. I cannot think of any significant weaknesses.",
    "The overall organization of the course was good, as were the individual classes themselves; the time spent working through inscriptions together in class was especially helpful. The main weakness I can identify is that the expectations for homework assignments were not always entirely clear, especially at the beginning of the semester. Although these expectations became much clearer after we had worked through some inscriptions in class, it would have been helpful if they were explicitly laid out in writing, either on the syllabus or in some other capacity at the start of the course."

   "comments": [
    "Totally! It is a great course for a student interested in understanding epigraphy applied to Northwest Semitic languages, but has no previous knowledge on the epigraphy topic.",
    "Yes! It was fun, challenging, and useful.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to other students who are interested in learning more about epigrahy and how inscriptions are deciphered.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to anyone with some background in Semitic languages and an interest in more hands-on experience with the history of the ancient Near East. Learning to ancient artifacts is a difficult but rewarding process.",
    "I would recommend this course to any sufficiently advanced student whose studies would benefit from increased knowledge of ancient Near Eastern language, history, and culture."
