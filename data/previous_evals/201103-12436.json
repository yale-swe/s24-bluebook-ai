   "comments": [
    "I would not take the class unless you are an East Asian history major or an art history major. It really requires a background knowledge of the area.",
    "The class is unorthodox. Come in with an open mind.The whole seminar is image and visual record basedBut that doesn't mean you should approach it like an art class.Check out visualizingcultures.com, see if you like what you find in there. If it seems like the type of thing for you, you will be rewarded!",
    "This course will prove memorable and a valuable use of time while at Yale. Those used to film studies courses or art history courses may have preconceptions about courses that treat historical themes from various critical standpoints. This course is unique in analyzing the role of various forms of imagery and their historical and social contexts as well as the significance of those media (engravings, newspaper and magazine illustrations, paintings,anthropological photography, propaganda artwork, satirical cartoons, paintings, lithographs, daguerrotypes, photographs) not only within their contemporary settings but in their ongoing role in shaping perceptions of various events and themes in history, in this case specifically the history of East Asia.",
    "Material wise, I didn't learn much compared to other history classes(because I already had basic knowledge of modern East Asian history), but I thought the seminar was still worthwhile taking it, because I got to learn how to use pictorial materials to describe history.",
    "This is not a conventional history class. This is a history that makes almost exclusive use of images[photographs, prints, paintings]to study important historical issues\/actors\/events. This is also not a introductory\/survey class. If you dont already have a strong interest or robust foundation in Asian History, I would not recommend this class. However ,if you have an interest in Asian history and want to experience an interesting and differnet approach towards studying it, I would recommend this class. Workload is decent. Three papers [4-5 pages, 8-10 pages, 12-15 pages) in total."
