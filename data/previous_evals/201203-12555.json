   "comments": [
    "This is what an introductory calculus course should be; no assumptions made until you are taught, and then every assumption made that you've actually learned. You can't slack, but the course is accessible to those who haven't taken Calculus before.",
    "I would recommend it.",
    "Mathematics 112 is the equivalent of Calculus AB in high school. The lessons are taught quickly so you must have a basic understanding of calculus or be very good at following along and understanding the lesson quickly.",
    "This class was great! The early hour was sometimes a pain, but the class was relatively short and only met twice a week so it was worth it. Lessons were taught well and it was easy to follow along. I would HIGHLY recommend this class over other math classes.",
    "Good class. Take it with Prof. Logan.",
    "I would summarize it as an intro class that is a good starting point for collegiate mathematics. If you're lucky enough to have the same instructor I had, then it will be an engaging and interesting experience.",
    "I would definitely recommend it if you enjoy math and want to learn basic calculus. It is a lot of weekly homework but if you keep up t=with the material, the exams and the work load aren't too bad.",
    "If you didn't take BC in high school, definitely take this course before tackling 115. I had to drop down after the first midterm even though I had taken AB in high school and it was definitely helpful to thoroughly review some of the Calc 1 concepts before trying again. Take the course with Miriam, she's incredibly dedicated to her students and you'll never go into a test or hand in a homework with a single doubt if you reach out to her.",
    "I would recommend the class for someone with little calculus background because as far as I know, this is the most basic math course. I feel the work load is significant but you definitely learn the concepts.",
    "Overall, I would not recommend this course to anyone without SOME knowledge of calculus. I did the IB programme, so I had some basic understandings of the theorems from SL, but I found that many of my classmates had AB or even BC.If you do take it, having a good section teacher is crucial. Miriam Logan is fantastic! She's very sweet, easy to understand, and willing to work outside of class. The other TAs I have met are also nice, but sometimes, their accents make it difficult to understand what they're saying.",
    "Yes - if you are looking for a nice and not too hard QR, not if you are looking for something interesting or exciting. Miriam Logan is amazing! Take it with her if you can!!!",
    "TAKE IT WITH MIRIAM LOGAN. If you don't get into her section, wait and take it a different semester and get into her section then. Miriam is an amazing teacher and she makes this surprisingly difficult class work well. Homework could take some time, midterms were easy, final was pretty hard. If you have to take Calculus, Math 112 with Miriam Logan is the way to go.",
    "If you want to learn calculus, Miriam is the best person to do it with.",
    "This is an easy math course and does not require much work however it is important to pay attention because the class moves quickly.",
    "Math 112 was very fair in its grading and the material is pretty straightforward. Just integrals, derivatives, etc.",
    "This course was excellent because of my instructor Miriam. She was very accessible and willing to help students. I would recomend this course to those who want a good understanding of calculus.",
    "This class was an absolute delight! The course material was genuinely fascinating, and was taught effortlessly by the brilliant Miriam Logan! The class begins with a review of pre-calculus (functions, trigonometry and so on), and then deals exhaustively with differential calculus, ending with an introduction to integral calculus. The workload is absolutely manageable \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the weekly homework can be challenging (but never frustrating), and the exams (two mid-terms and one final) weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t too difficult either. Most of all, Miriam Logan is an impeccable teacher. Not only can she explain difficult concepts thoroughly and with ease, but she is also extremely generous with her time. She is very helpful and accessible, both in and out of class. In fact, I enjoyed this class so much (mainly because of Miriam\u00e2\u0080\u0099s teaching skills) that I decidedto enroll in Miriam\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 115 section next semester \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s only because I thoroughly enjoyed this class, and not because I need 115 as a pre-requisite. Take this class! And take it with Miriam!",
    "Good way to learn basics of calculus. I would recommend it to a fellow student and suggest they try to get in Miriam Logan's section!",
    "I would recommend this class to another student if they had Professor Logan. This is NOT the class to take if you are just looking to fulfill a QR requirement!! I say only take it if you need it for a major or prerequisite.",
    "Not a particularly thrilling class, but a good math credit and something you probably will need to take eventually if you aren't placed into a higher level. I wouldn't recommend it for enjoyment but it's definitely not a bad class to take if you need it, which you probably do.",
    "If you've taken AP Calculus AB, the course will be easier and much more manageable for you than someone who has not taken it. That said, if you haven't taken Calculus before, you'll be fine. Just utilize office hours and try to get in Miriam Logan's class.",
    "Good entry level math.",
    "Yes, I would recommend 112 to another student because I think that it is a very solid foundation for Calculus.",
    "This course is the equivalent to AP Calculus AB in a high school curriculum. A person who takes this class will gain a sound understanding of derivatives and will touch on integrals briefly. I would absolutely recommend the course to another student, given that the students seeks to become proficient in calculus.",
    "Math 112 is a mathematics course that covers all material starting with a quick review of precalculus and then straight through to the middle of AB Calculus or integrals.I would recommend it to a fellow student because it gives a clear introduction to calculus. The quick review of precalculus also helps."
