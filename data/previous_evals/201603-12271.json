   "comments": [
    "Lecture needs to have content! As of now, it was useless to attend lecture as the professor would never answer any student's questions. He would talk about it for an hour somehow but never actually give away an answer. We need someone who will give an answer and move on to the next question so we can learn more efficiently. IT would also be helpful for the professor to actually cover material (even if it is similar to what the book says) and do practice problems. It is not feasible to just learn everything from reading the book. Many students don't learn that way! It was also be helpful to be assigned concrete problems in the book AND to be given feedback about the homework. Otherwise, if a person does something wrong on the homework, he or she may not find out that was wrong until the test! And that is not helpful! IT will only allow bad habits to continue. Also, this class needs to be more reasonable in the amount of material that it covers. It is way too much in a short amount of time - this should at least take one year instead of one semester. It doesn't allow students to learn the concepts as well since it's trying to go over so many concepts. Additionally, there shouldn't be TWO exams (in class and take home) per midterm. That is way too much given students also have three other classes to contend with. The TF, Allen Lu, however was amazing. In section he would actually do practice problems and I learned so much during that time!",
    "The course covered a wide range of topics, which was good. However, the class was not well structured to cover all of those topics in the allotted amount of time, so I did not feel like I learned anything thoroughly. I was only introduced to the topics on a superficial level. The exams also did not reflect the level on which we were learning the material. They tried to take the material a step further than what was presented in the book when we had hardly learned the material well enough to know how to do the problems in the book. The exams also took much too long. With the in class and take home portions, the exams would take several days. The course could be improved by having the instructor give an overview of each chapter and presenting example problems, done out step by step, in class. This would give us a basic foundation on the topic, and then we could fill in the details by going through the chapter and doing practice problems from the book. The exams should also be constructed with problems that reflect the practice problems we should have done, with the expectation that we would use the methods presented in the book or in class to solve the problems.",
    "We are expected to zoom through the dense material in the textbook with absolutely no help from classroom teaching, and no elimination of sections in the book as unnecessary for the course. The exam questions are fair, but without 'teaching', it's like expecting a toddler to run a 100-m race without going through the process.",
    "This class surveyed a wide variety of mathematical concepts that could prove helpful to engineers in their graduate education. However, there was a major disconnect between the professor's belief of the students' understanding, and the students' actual understanding. This disconnect appeared to be rooted in the fact that the professor declined to \"teach\" the class. Early on, the professor expressed that he desired the class to be \"student run\", where students would teach the class. A novel concept, perhaps not the best idea for a graduate mathematics course. This concept faded a little, with students no longer presenting on concepts, which was seemingly for the better but turned out to make things worse. With the professor not formally teaching the class, he would simply ask if the students had any questions. Many students put the effort into reading outside of class and trying to understand everything, and therefore had good questions to ask; however, the professor would never answer the questions. He would sort of walk around the answer without actually answering it, so the students remained unenlightened. This was disappointing, because there were many instances where the textbook was inconsistent and unclear, and the was unable to shed light on the issues. Another major weakness of the course was the professor's repeated insistence that the course was \"an experiment\". From a professor so senior in his teaching, this was a red flag from the beginning. I had expected to be taught by Dr. Van Tassel, the veteran instructor of the course, whom I had heard good things about; Dr. Vaisnys should have inspired this same level of confidence based on his long-time experience at Yale, but instead approached it as if he had never taught it before and that our learning wasn't of high importance. Surely, one might think that wasn't true; after all, he claimed on multiple occasions that he was open to our feedback on the course if we thought there was any way to improve it. This was something we greatly appreciated, as his initial class format wasn't working for us. We first approached him with a suggestion that classes might be better spent working on problems in groups and then discussing as a class; it was clear that he wasn't planning to teach an actual lecture, so we proposed a solution we felt might fit in with his unconventional style. Nothing changed. Dr. Vaisnys insisted on both in-class and take-home portions to each exam; one might expect this to be helpful, but they were not. We only had book problems and self-teaching to boost our abilities, since the classes became less and less helpful over time, evidenced by the number of students who stopped showing up to class. The exams would frequently include very abstract ideas that were unrelated to how the book taught concepts, and since Dr. Vaisnys had a method of \"teaching\" that focused on minimally important minutiae than the concepts themselves, students generally felt unprepared for the exams. Our TF, Allen Lu, was very helpful in actually teaching us concepts in a very clear manner and helping us work through problems similar to those he had seen on his previous exams; but our exams did not look remotely like what he prepared us for, as they focused on very arbitrary and abstract concepts that did not adequately test our knowledge of the subject. Adding insult to injury, the take home exams often featured the same problems, with the addition of several more. In short, the same problems we already had no clue how to solve, which neither the book nor the professor could have prepared us for, were given to us one more time while we also contemplated new unrelated abstract concepts he invented, such as a \"pulsating universe\". These take home portions, which he provided about a day and a half in the middle of the week to complete, were extremely time-consuming due to the nature of the questions...(please see the next box for continuation)",
    "Strength - The handouts were useful tools to learn Mathematica Weakness- The curriculum was too much for students. The lectures were not very organized.",
    "The teacher could teach it instead of having us teach ourselves by learning it all from the book."

   "comments": [
    "No, I would steer all students away from the course as much as I can. It was the worst class I have every taken in all of my time as an undergraduate and graduate student.",
    "No. I didn't feel like I gained much from taking this class. I feel like the topics that we should have learned would be useful to know for future classes and potentially for my research, so I would have liked to learn them. The class was just not structured well enough for me to accomplish this goal. Dealing with the professor and the workload was also extremely frustrating since he did not respond to student questions directly and did not change his approach after being given student feedback.",
    "Please don't take it unless you're already kind of familiar with the material and want to improve on Mathematica skills.",
    "(continued from previous box)...because we had not been adequately prepared to answer them. After the first exam, we had some suggestions to the professor, since he claimed to be receptive to feedback. For one, we requested that the take home portion not be so intensive, as we had other commitments as first year graduate students (something he often had little respect for when it came to length of homework\/reading, but was especially important because he wasn't teaching us). Second, we made the reasonable request that he not use Mathematica syntax when he gave us our in-class exams; it is quite simple to type equations in a format that is easier to understand, and we did not feel like that was asking too much. Third, we expressed that the wide variety of content required us to memorize equations rather than focusing on learning how everything works. He assured us that 1) the second take-home would not be as long, 2) he would not use Mathematica syntax, 3) he would provide an equation sheet. Dr. Vaisnys failed to deliver on each one of these points for our second exam, leading to even more frustration than the first exam. We felt betrayed, that the professor had claimed to be understanding our concerns and was going to work to mitigate them, but then did not make any effort to address them. As I have previously expressed with regards to his inability to understand and answer student questions in a helpful manner, Dr. Vaisnys has great difficulty understanding the problems of students and either does not wish to be a helpful resource as is expected of a professor, or simply does not care about the learning of his students, as evidenced by his common remark of \"this class is an experiment\". Toward the end of the class, we expressed that his idea for a 3-day take home final exam, followed by a written exam, might be going a little overboard; with regards to the in-class portion, the scope of the class was so broad that we felt that there were too many equations to memorize, and would lose points for forgetting small details. It took much explaining for Dr. Vaisnys to understand this, as he was more interested in solving examples of certain problems where constant factors were forgotten. This underlines my point; while we would try to express to the professor the issues we were having, he simply could not connect with us, as if he was incapable of thinking on a common level with us and added several degrees of abstraction to everything that was said. This led to much dissatisfaction when students would ask for help with particular concepts or problems as well. To his credit, Dr. Vaisnys let us have the final exam that we had preferred, a 72-hour take home exam rather than the same take home exam with an additional in-class portion that he originally proposed. However, like the other exams he administered, the exam asked questions about concepts that were not in the book that he had only vaguely mentioned in class. There were few problems I felt confident enough to fully solve, and in talking to other students after the exam, I found that most were in agreement. In sum, I had high hopes for this class, but was left feeling disappointed and frustrated due to Dr. Vaisnys' lack of direct teaching, inability to answer student questions, and administration of exams that did not adequately reflect the course material. I would not recommend this course to another student. I would very much suggest other students wait for a semester when Dr. Vaisnys was not the professor teaching, and I would hope the department takes the student feedback for this class seriously and acts accordingly. I'm very disappointed that this is my first exposure to classes at such a prestigious university.",
    "I would not recommend this course because you are most likely not learn much about math.",
    "If this course is taught by the same teacher, I would not recommend it. If any other person in the world taught it, including someone who has never seen the material before in their life, I would recommend it."
