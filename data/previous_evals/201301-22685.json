    "Advanced Conversational really expands one's vocabulary and ability to have serious conversations in Spanish. It goes beyond the typical \"hi how are you\" conversation of past classes and addresses questions of justice, ethics and morals. I liked the class and if you're interested in cementing your Spanish abilities, definitely take this class.",
    "If you want to have a class to maintain your Spanish speaking skills, this is the class for you.",
    "Yes. Great L5 class.",
    "Good class, not a ton of work. Good for maintaining fluency but might not help you improve all that much.",
    "It was a solid course that was pretty straightforward if you have a good hold on spanish. There are still homework assignments and quizzes, as well as a lot of on-the-spot talking. The midterms and finals are all oral. Class participation is a huge part of your grade. Professor Carballal is one of the less animated professors in the department, so shop around to see if another one fits you better and makes the class more fun.",
    "I have already recommended this course to several fellow students. As well as being one of the more enjoyable language classes I have taken, it is a great way to focus on one's speaking skills.",
    "Good way to maintain Spanish speaking skills. May not result in strong improvement."
