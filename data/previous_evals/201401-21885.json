    "Really solid class. Not a whole lot of work or time and you learn a lot about film itself and obviously about the progression of film in Russia and the Soviet Union. Good mix of films that both film majors and laypeople (I'm one of the latter, as were most of the people in the class) can enjoy and learn from. Very solid 5th class.",
    "A nice, sweeping survey through decades of Soviet film (and some post-Soviet too). Light readings, relaxed discussions, enough time to write two solid papers and get yer sealegs in the discipline of Film Studies."
