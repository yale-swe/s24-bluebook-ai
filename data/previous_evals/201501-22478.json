    "It's a great course for giving a broad overview of aspects of reproductive biology.",
    "I think that the class fell a little flat for me. I found some of the lectures to be extremely engaging and well taught, but that others were very difficult to follow. I also thought that the assessment method led to an unrepresentative portrayal of what I had (or had not) learned with tricky multiple choice and particularly detailed questions. However, I do feel like I learned a lot. I had heard that the class was a must take at Yale for biology majors, but I am not sure I would recommend it to another student.",
    "This course is somewhat of a mixed bag. The lectures were usually cool, although the quality varied because it was always a different lecturer. The workload was also pretty low aside from right before the exams. That said, a class with three multiple-choice\/true-false tests sounds like a good idea, but it's really easy to get burned. The tests mostly focused on trivia and seemingly random facts, so you need to be ready to memorize a ton of stuff.",
    "Yes - interesting and relevant. Not much work (just three tests)",
    "This is a course with interesting subject matter and terrible execution. There are too many lecturers, the exams are a mess, and the material is not presented in a very efficient way. I would not recommend this course to a fellow student until the course is revamped and the department gets itself together. This is one of the worst courses I've taken at Yale, which is unfortunate because the subject matter is actually very interesting.",
    "A class that is just ok. It's a part of human physiology that is incredibly important, yet not really discussed in a standard biology undergraduate curriculum. As a biology major, especially as a male biology student, I learned a great deal about reproduction and enjoyed many of the lectures. The problem is that there are just too many lecturers. This is a real issue with the MCDB major and it's bad in this course. Professors repeat the same information across lectures, there is no standard of depth for their lectures (some feel like real academic biology lectures while others feel like a trip to the doctors office\/completely dumbed down facts about diseases). MCDB really needs to do away with the practice of having 12 people teach a class. Also the exams are truly frustrating and require you to memorize the most useless information imaginable (e.g. demographic statistics about reproductive diseases which cease to be accurate every year).",
    "I would recommend this course with the warning that the material, while it can be put off, is quite high volume. That the class is based only on three exams makes it possible for one to put off the course load for a week or two, and catch up before the exam. Do not fall for this temptation. The exams test a students knowledge of highly obscure details from the lecture, and require high amounts of studying to do well. Do not put off the work.",
    "A science class for those that can memorize the most information. The tests come straight from the slides and are irritatingly detailed, but not with important details - it always seems like the tests asks very random questions about things that aren't important. So, this definitely is not an easy A - to get that A you need to put in SIGNIFICANT amounts of time memorizing pointless material so you can recall it on the multiple choice tests. There is no synthesis required. It's very interesting material, in my opinion, but the tests sucked.",
    "Great elective for MCDB or MB&B",
    "I do NOT recommend this course to another student. It's a frustratingly disorganized, unfair, mess. I'm not saying this because I didn't put forth any effort [I studied a week in advance for the exams; made outlines&study sheets]...just don't put yourself through this.",
    "Solid class, hope there is a curve.",
    "Plenty of students are going to give summaries of the entire course, and I think that's great. It was a good class. But there's something I think you should know before you enroll, in case changes aren't made for next year: I felt humiliated by the contraception lecture given by Dr. Aileen Gariepy. She shamed any form of non-implant birth control, including the Pill, barrier methods, and fertility awareness methods. Dr. Gariepy repeatedly called these methods \"dumb\" and made jokes at the expense of people who use them. Plenty of women don't want implants for a variety of reasons. Furthermore, there are plenty of fertility awareness methods that depend on temperature recording, evaluating cervical mucus, etc., and these are much more effective than \"bead counting\". But Dr. Gariepy chose to ignore these methods (which many, many women are very satisfied using) so that she could continue with her Pill\/condom\/FA-shaming lecture. I would go so far as to say her behavior was bullying, and it would be a great disservice to future students if she were invited back as a lecturer next year.",
    "I'm a senior premed, and in terms of the in-class experience, this was by far the best science class that I've taken at Yale! The material was almost always really fascinating; and it was really cool to have doctors as professors. Plus, they were almost all really, really great lecturers! However, the midterms really sucked - like high school, we were tested not on concepts but on our ability to regurgitate facts off of a lecture slide. That in itself was annoying, but what made the experience REALLY REALLY FRUSTRATING was the uselessness of the TAs review sessions for preparing for the midterms. (1) It was abundantly clear that they put no effort into preparing for the review sessions - they would basically just scroll through the lecture slides, saying \"memorize this\" at every slide. (2) They incapable of answering really simple questions about the material, and would frequently contradict each other at those - leaving us all confused. (3) Finally, they REPEATEDLY told us that we would not be tested on certain material that was then included on the test. IT WOULD HAVE BEEN MUCH BETTER IF THE PROFESSORS LED THE REVIEW SESSIONS INSTEAD.",
    "Take it if you want to learn about placentas.",
    "I would recommend this class. The material is interesting and the guest lecturers are all fantastic. The tests can be tricky, because it'll be a fill in the blank picked from one slide of one lecture.",
    "I would recommend this class to someone looking for a more chill MCDB class. For premeds, taking MCDB 240 and its lab MCDB 241L is a great option for fulfilling your bio lab requirement.",
    "I sincerely regret taking this class. When I read the reviews for this class, I had high hopes. People said the workload wasnt too much (no psets, quizzes, etc.) and that you only needed to study a couple of days before each test. My actual experience couldnt be further from the truth. I would absolutely not recommend this class to a fellow student or anyone else interested in actually learning something about reproductive biology. If you must take it, I would do it credit\/d\/fail. This class was by far the most anxiety producing and stressful class I took this semester (Im an MCDB major for reference). The material tested was completely arbitrary at times and was not at all indicative of what you actually learned. The format was well suited for people who can memorize random details but not for students who can synthesize information. I used to think that I was good at memorizing but after the average on the first two tests was in the 80s and I was either right at the average or below it, I realized this was not the class for me. I wish I had listened to the reviews telling me to take it credit\/d\/fail. I really think everyone should start it off like that and after you get your first test back youll realize it should stay that way.",
    "This is a class which should feel like it builds from conception to birth, but instead feels utterly disjointed. Although the lectures were in order, the way it is taught almost entirely by guest lecturers makes it more difficult to build off of each previous lecture. A lot of them would start from scratch and add too much background or go to the other extreme and assume too much learned already.",
    "Definitely take this course! You get to cover so many topics in biology and current research just through their connection with the reproductive system. Take this if you want a physio, evolutionary bio, genetics, and cell bio course all in one with reasonable exams (3), no psets, and no final! Definitely go to the review session though. They help a lot in helping you figure out what to study for the exams.",
    "You learn really empowering information that is applicable for a broad array of majors not just premeds!",
    "Until Dr. Kliman teaches the entire class, absolutely AVOID this class at all costs.",
    "Do. Not. Take. This. Class. Find another science class for non-science majors because this is just bad. This is absolutely the worst class I have taken in my time at Yale and I am certain I will graduate with the same opinion. Having different professors teach the course seems like a great idea but in practice, has been proven to be a failure. Because none of them have gone to a lecture before or were even briefed on what the students know, the overlaps in material are constant and occasionally confusing. The slides from previous years were never updated leading to students scrambling through the slides to find the material and if not, copy it down word for word. The new information needed to be copied down word for word because the exams were just sentences from the slides with specific words blocked out for students to fill in. You are not expected to think in this class, only to memorize and regurgitate the information. The facts that they chose to test you on were arbitrary and ridiculous, to be frank. Many students are told that it is a good class for science and non-science majors alike but I do not agree at all. As an MCDB major, I hated this class and don't know how non-science majors were able to bear it. I did learn a lot about reproduction but nothing I couldn't have learned on my own time, and it would have been much less confusing.",
    "This course was great! I really appreciated the broad survey of so many different aspects of reproductive biology. I liked that we got so many different guest lecturers from experts in the field. Great format, very accessible for biology and non-biology majors. No homework, but you should absolutely attend the optional section to avoid having to cram for the exams. Three multiple-choice\/short answer exams are your basis for the course grade, but the material is very manageable. I'd definitely recommend it to underclassmen.",
    "Easiest bio class at Yale and an interesting subject too. It's a good low-commitment bio class to take as a senior. Take concurrently with the lab if possible because it really helps out with the lecture material.",
    "terrible. bad lecturers and annoying exams. this is not a biology class. can you memorize all the words on 600 slides for midterms?",
    "This is a wonderful course. A lot of memorization but you learn some really important things and lectures were really fun! Maybe cred D if you are able.",
    "Just make sure you know hella details. The TAs will tell you in the review sessions that you dont need to know the details, but when the test comes, you will need to know them, trust me.",
    "Unless there are significant changes to how this class is taught, no one should take this class. As an MCDB major, I thought this would be a good class to take to learn more about reproduction, but I was mistaken. And while I learned a few things, it was definitely not worth it. I felt like not much was actually taught in lecture and then you were expected to know very specific and and trivial details that were not really talked about during class. These tests were not fair. If you do take the class, take notes on everything. Even if it seems insignificant. The most inconsequential details are fair game on those tests. I'm really hoping that there will be changes because reproduction is very interesting and it is nice to hear from so many Ob\/Gyn physicians. Even though I took it as Cr\/D\/F, it was really stressful towards the end because I had no idea where I was going to be. No amount of studying could have prepared me for those insanely specific questions.",
    "Repro Bio is a great course that introduces students to the complex reproductive system. The guest lecturers are engaging and passionate about their subjects, and the material is fascinating! I would definitely recommend this course to students who are interested in the topic. Even if you are not familiar with the reproductive system, you will learn so much and the information will be surprisingly relevant to other aspects of your life.",
    "Repro Bio is a straightforward MCDB course. The exams are fair and shouldn't be too much trouble as long as you study a few days in advance and don't try to cram everything in one day.The lectures were mostly all enjoyable, with topics relevant to everyone such as fertility problems and contraception.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in reproductive biology, whether you're a science major or not.",
    "Biology of Reproduction covered interesting material, but the lectures lacked cohesion. Given that every lecture was taught by a different lecturer, we ended up going over the same material over and over again. The exams were fair, but required a large amount of memorization.",
    "The class is really great. Though I got a 5 on AP Bio, I hadn't taken biology in two years, however, I was able to keep up with the class (when talking about mechanisms, however, which was rare, I had to look up some terms). Very low workload, but you have to know everything (literally) from the slides for the exams, because the exams can ask a question from any of the slides. Kind of hard to gauge what your grade is.",
    "Memorize everything. Put in the work to memorize. It's literally regurgitation.",
    "Hit or miss lectures, depending on the guest speaker of the day. TAs are hopeless - they don't know the material well, they mislead students into thinking details will not be tested on the exams, they don't care about the course.",
    "Honestly the course is too difficult for non-science majors and not well taught enough for me to recommend a bio-major to spend a credit on it.",
    "I definitely recommend repro bio. The material is fascinating, the work load is minimal, and the tests are very fair. Take it!",
    "Easy science class to follow with unnecessarily difficult exams. Take it Credit\/D\/Fail if you can.",
    "Recommend! You learn lot of hilarious dinner topics."
