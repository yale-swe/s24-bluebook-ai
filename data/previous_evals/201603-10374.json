   "comments": [
    "I learned insight on many different architects that have worked at Yale and designed for Yale. I also learned about many different architectural theories in exploring different buildings and projects.",
    "This was a great introductory class to the world of architecture and to the built environment of Yale's campus. The knowledge I gained about prominent modern architects like Louis Kahn and Phillip Johnson has helped me appreciate my surroundings at Yale and at home. This course helped me go from knowing nothing at all about architecture to being able to navigate a discussion about architecture with relative ease.",
    "I developed a kind of close reading skill but for architecture, which was new and exciting. I also expanded my knowledge of freeform \"reaction\" writing.",
    "ARCH 005 taught me to look at the built world with a careful eye, to question and inspect everything. The course also provided a good knowledge of the history of architecture as it applies to Yale's campus and former faculty.",
    "I learned about realizing the importance of the details of the world around me. I became much more appreciative of the details and the thought process that goes into creating spaces. I am much more aware of how, why, and for whom spaces are made, especially those of the Yale campus. I also appreciate the freedom we were given to explore our own topics."

   "comments": [
    "The readings were very interesting and the one-page weekly responses encouraged you to think deeply about the content. Class discussions could sometimes lag, and could have been helped with more specific discussion questions from the professor or TF. The field trips were wonderful! Getting to actually see and touch the buildings we were talking about made a huge difference. I really appreciated the room that Professor Britton allowed for individuality in the final projects and in the discussions. Everyone brought very interesting and different perspectives to the material. This class is also a great way to get to know the Yale School of Architecture. I went to probably 5-6 lectures and other events at the school throughout the course of the semester just for fun."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this class highly to anyone who has any interest in architecture. This class was a great introduction to different aspects of architecture.",
    "If you're looking for an introductory course to the field of architecture this is not a class for you. If you're really into architectural history and want to learn about buildings at Yale, then you'll enjoy it. This course doesn't go into design or technique at all, it's actually a history course. The ONLY grade you get the entire semester is when the final one is posted at the end of the semester, and the only feedback you receive is about other resources to take a look at rather than comments about your work. You really have no idea how well you're doing unless you specifically ask. I definitely didn't improve at all as a writer or presenter since there was no constructive feedback. Overall, take this if you're interested in the architectural history of Yale, but not for any other reason.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who has even the slightest bit of interest in architecture, cities, or just places in generally. This class will help you learn to be aware of the world around you. You will become much more observant and knowledgable about the campus and city you live in.",
    "I would highly recommend ARCH 005 to all freshman looking to explore architecture. The course requires no previous knowledge of the subject and is a great way to immerse yourself with art outside of an art studio. The architects one learns about and their history with Yale's campus and the greater architectural world are fascinating, and the trips the class takes are fun and insightful. Professor Britton is great at teaching the subject and inspires her students to examine the built environment with deeper understanding.",
    "I would recommend this course. Though its focus is on history of Yale architecture, it challenges the way you perceive the world in an enlightening way. Coming out of this course, I see the world indifferently from an architectural perspective. I think more about the details and thought process of the architect."
