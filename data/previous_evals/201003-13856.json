    "I wish there were more books on traditional Japanese spatial concepts. It was bit of a challenge to find the books on this subject matter in English.",
    "Yes. Trips to Beinecke to see original 17th C. maps of Kyoto and travel logs were especially helpful. I would have appreciated some flexibility with the final assignment, namely the opportunity to pursue interests using techniques other than writing. For example, the history of origami could have been understood and challenged using the school's modeling software and laser cutters to produce a series of studies. Or, the tradition of joinery could be reinterpreted using our CNC-milling machines.",
    "Extended library hours during the final weeks of the semester would have been a boon to my ability to adequately research and write, especially in light of the checkout policy of one book per day.",
    "yes.",
    "The books that were most important for this course were placed on reserve. However, the readings were not made available online, largely because Yoko Kawai did not have a teaching assistant this semester. It would be helpful in the future to place the readings on the Classes V2 server at the beginning of the semester, as a resource for the entire class.Also, the Arts library\u0092s policy of one-day checkout was most frustrating when writing the final paper.",
    "The resources were more than adequate to fulfill the assigned paper.The instructor's use of the Yale Art Gallery and the Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library to show us material we would not have come to, nor really known where to look for, was highly appreciated.",
    "There were enough books\/articles in the library to find the material I needed to write my papers. I think they had everything I needed from the bibliography I put together."
