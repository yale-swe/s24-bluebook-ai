    "Opportunity to meet and network with practitioners in the land use planning field. The after-class dinners with speakers are a wonderful opportunity for students to engage. John Nolon is obviously very interested and committed to the professional development of his students (perhaps more so than many of the academic-y professors at FES). He goes out of his way to give students the opportunity to meet mentors, suggest internship opportunities, and engage with the LUCY SIG; this is very much appreciated! Nolon is also very perceptive and open to adapting the class to the changing needs and interests of the students, and he is quite proactive in soliciting feedback.",

    "The wide variety of speakers, particularly Professor Shansky, and the Project for Public Spaces.",
    "The range of speakers and the interesting topics were great and can inform what other topics you may want to pursue while at FES."

   "comments": [
    "The trip to Pace Law School was originally listed as mandatory, but very few of the students ultimately ended up attending. The law conference was at a point in the semester when most of us had heavy workloads, and it was difficult to set aside the time. I appreciated the effort to bring everyone to the conference, but didn't find the experience as useful as I would have liked because we had already heard many similar presentations throughout the semester from the same speakers.",
    "More class time to get into material and ask questions of the speakers. Perhaps additional assignments and interactive presentation formats to engage more on the readings and substance.More diversity in terms of speakers.",
    "Provide more opportunities for discussion - Q&A with speakers was good, but sometimes short (and often didn't fit into the 4-5 pm time slot). Also, would have liked to hear more from classmates about their backgrounds, experience, and interests.",
    "It would be better to have more of an introduction from the professor at the beginning of the course, for example by examining a case study. I didn't feel like I got a good foundation of land use planning, but just some different perspectives on frameworks. I also walked away feeling very overwhelmed, because the field just seems like a breeding ground for polarizing discussion, and not a solution to environmental problems. One way to fix this would be to have a theme each semester. This semester's theme could have been sea level rise, which would have been very relevant in light of the severe hurricane season.",
    "Alternate guest speakers with traditional lecture \/ discussion - many of the speakers were repetitive.",
    "Other days, I got little out of the lectures because of the lecturer's style or not being as interested in that topic.",
    "Several of the speakers were not interesting or valuable. I think the class should prioritize interesting speakers.",
    "A). Perhaps include a greater proportion of speakers from the private sector land development sector. Maybe even include a typical strip mall\/residential subdivision type of developer to provide a different perspective to the class so they could understand the perspectives, regulations, and incentives (for better or worse) that promote this type of land development. B). The changing real estate market (trend towards more urban living\/less sprawl) is fascinating. We touched on this in the last class this semester, and it would be interesting to hear more on this trend as it continues to develop.",
    "More interaction and engaging students with speakers.",
    "the readings",
    "Some more overall structure would help students get more out of each speaker."
