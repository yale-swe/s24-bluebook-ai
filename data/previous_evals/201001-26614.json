    "There is no sequence for electives.",
    "This was not a requirement and while most of us in the course were graduating students, I think it would be valuable to have mostly upper year students in the future as well. The subject matter could be intense at times and students who have gone through the history\/ theory courses would have more to offer the class than first year students."

   "comments": [
    "Expansive body of material. Sequencing was hard to follow because the three main points art, exhibition, cold-war blended after a while.",
    "The material presented and course sequence was very well spelled out in the syllabus and made good sense. The subject matter was very interesting. I really enjoyed our trip to the Beinecke Library. I think the course could be better in the future if it were taught from there and we had access to the material on a weekly basis. That would be incredible!",
    "the concept of art and architecture was interpreted in many different ways and therefore the material was somewhat scattered and unfocused. the student presentations were interesting but were not so cohesive as a whole. it was the intention from the start to have different areas of focus, so it was intentional.",
    "The material was interesting, however sometimes i found it hard to follow a coherent thought logic on the presentation of the material. I found it very compelling on some aspects but did not understand the relationships of what we were supposed to follow or a clear thesis within the subject matter. The visit to the archives was amazing and the class as a whole was very compelling and thought provoking"

    "my expectations were met. stanislaus was helpful in assisting with research and was somewhat available to speak with us. his knowledge of the material was great and he himself is a great resource."

   "comments": [
    "Good fun but at the end of the day it remains an elective.",
    "Overall I enjoyed the course and I particularly enjoyed the professor. Stanislaus is great and could surely bring great things to Yale.",
    "It was valuable to me as the material coincided with interests of my own. it was great to be able to explore those interests further with the assistance of Stanislaus.",
    "This course was valuable since i was not familiar with the subject matter. The integration of art and architecture was invaluable as well, and i found it strenghtened my knowlege in this subject matter. I think that the course was very informative on a historical basis, however synthesis with a modern-day context was a little vague. I think that the amount of reading was unprecedented an much more than other classes i have taken. If there is a way to distill some of the readings to focus on a discussion in class it would be helpful."

   "comments": [
    "Stanislaus was a very knowledgeable professor. Sometimes straying and not making the best use of the period of time, the class became tedious.",
    "Stanislaus is a brilliant man. At times I think he might be rather scattered and not very organized but overall I think is great. Our TA was wonderful and participated in the course which was nice.",
    "I think the class lectures and syllabus could have been more structured. we didn't always know what was going to be discussed in each class and there was a little bit of overlap from class to class.",
    "Stanislaus was very comprehensive and thorough in his presentations and brought an amazing amount of references to the class for our use and perusal. However I think that a focus in material and presentation could have been helpful. At times I found the course or subject matter to be too broad and encompassing where focus and direct correlation would have been critical."
