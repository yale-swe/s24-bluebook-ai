    "I was very excited about this course because there is a lab component and there is a strong emphasis on applied molecular biological techniques in an epidemiological setting. However, the lectures felt very long and the students were not really engaged in the material. There was very little discussion even though it was a very small class.",
    "This is a fair introductory level course for molecular epidemiology. And the 3 lab sections make this course very unique. You'll get some hands-on experience in \"wet-lab\" experiments. Pretty cool.",
    "Interesting material regarding the intersection of molecular-based mechanisms relating to public health. Can get pretty technical, but Dr. Zhu is great at explaining. The labs are super fun and a great and unique way to get outside the classroom, that made this course my favorite this past semester.",
    "I really enjoyed this course, particularly the laboratory component.",
    "I appreciated the course given the heavier workload this spring with the thesis and other responsibilities. It's a huge survey course, and I felt like there were still some sizeable gaps in understanding the material very well by the end. Not sure how to improve on this other than having the class meet more than once per week and having a good textbook students can refer back to. The lab component was really nice.",
    "Molecular epi is an emerging field and very scientific oriented course. I thought we spent a considerable amount of time covering specific molecular methodology and principles and would have liked to have seen more epidemiology concepts\/applications. Labs were fun and interesting components of the course and were the primary reason why I took the course, although maybe there could have been bigger and longer experiments than the ones we did so we had more data. The subject matter can be rather dry and it's hard to listen to for close to two hours. Maybe there could have been a break or summary exercise or an interactive exercise to help break up the time. I enjoyed the final presentations. I also thought that the guest lecturer and PhD student were good lecturers as well.",
    "Good as a general overview of molecular epi methods. The labs are rewarding."

    "Instructor: Yong Zhu \u00a0Very smart and knows his material. Answers questions well. Applied what we learned in a few lab sections. His lectures were very long, and he was not very engaging though. Very little discussion to get students excited about the material. No deadlines for homework assignments and never received feedback on it. I think we are supposed to receive feedback eventually, but it is the end of classes and I am still waiting on a paper I wrote the first week of class, literally.",
    "Instructor: Yong Zhu \u00a0Professor Zhu's enthusiasm for the course and materials always made the class worth attending, even though some of the material was very condensed and even then, very complex at times.",
    "Instructor: Yong Zhu \u00a0Dr. Zhu's teaching style is really good.",
    "Instructor: Yong Zhu \u00a0Dr. Zhu is one of my favorite professors at YSPH. He's funny, intelligent, and thoroughly answers any questions you may have. He is also very accessible and holds open office hours, a pleasure seeking help and also just chatting with him.",
    "Instructor: Yong Zhu \u00a0Very thoughtful and helpful. Really appreciated his approach in terms of flexibility, and the assignments were generally useful.",
    "Instructor: Yong Zhu \u00a0I would have appreciated more directions prior to assignments and written feedback after assignments. Other than comments read to the class, there really wasn't any feedback in this course which I find rather problematic.",
    "Instructor: Yong Zhu \u00a0Very good at helping students understand the topic and always willing to help."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend it if you are looking for a low key course with emphasis on molecular biology techniques in epidemiology studies. It really isn't rigorous, it's more just what you make of it. I think the quality of the lectures could be improved. It also might be better for this course to meet twice instead of once a week for shorter amount of times.",
    "Even though the material at times may be difficult solely due to the scientific theories and details involved, anyone with a background in the sciences should be able to thrive in the class and even better if you come from a molecular biology\/genetics background.",
    "Definitely a good course to choose.",
    "I recommend this course to gain a more scientific background on epidemiology, and to participate in labs that you otherwise will not be able to during your MPH experience in other classes.",
    "Generally interesting course, could have been done better, but provides several benefits, especially for graduating seniors. Dr. Zhu is very approachable and helpful. Overall, enjoyed and appreciated the course.",
    "This course might interest you if you are looking to learn more about genetic markers and biomarkers for cancer and other chronic diseases.",
    "I would recommend it if the student has a background in biology\/genetics as a basic overview of molecular epidemiology."
