    "I absolutely would recommend it. It is a relatively easy language, very structured, and very well taught.",
    "This is the first language class I genuinely looked forward to each day. I strongly encourage anyone considering Hebrew 110 to take it with Prof. Dvoretzky.",
    "Hebrew 110 is a great class if you want to learn Hebrew! Ayala is a wonderful teacher to learn from. It takes a lot of consistent work, but you will surprise yourself at the end of the semester by how much you have learnt.",
    "It is a hard language and the class has a lot of work, but I learned an immense amount."
