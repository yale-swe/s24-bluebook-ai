    "The course is split into two parts. The first part covers background information (measure theory, exponential families, etc.) and point estimation: sufficiency, minimal sufficiency, and Rao-Blackwell; loss, risk, and admissibility; Bayesian estimation - i.e. conjugate priors, empirical Bayes, hierarchical Bayes - and Minimax estimation; high dimensional estimation - James-Stein, SURE, and thresholding estimators, and hypothesis testing (likelihood ratios, Neyman-Pearson lemma, composite alternatives, multiple testing and false discovery, etc.). The second part covers asymptotics: Convergence in probability vs. distribution, Law of Large Numbers, Central Limit Theorem, Continuous Mapping Theorem, Delta Method, Slutsky's method, MLE and Fisher information, hypothesis testing in high dimensions (qmd and local asypmtotic normality, local alternatives, likelihood, score, and Wald tests, limiting normal experiments, etc.)."

   "comments": [
    "Strengths: very nice and caring professor willing to help students, Sheng (TA) was awesome, lecture notes posted were super helpful, grading is generous, very well-run and organized class The only qualm I have about this class is that sometimes it can run 5-7 minutes over, which can make it hard if you have another class right after. Oh, and the TSH textbook is a total pain. The questions are poorly worded -- it's so hard to understand what they are even asking of you. You should probably start working on problem 5d of homework 9 if you are a student reading this. Even if you start now, there is a chance you may not finish by the time the homework is due.",
    "The class goes really really fast... Be prepared to do a lot of work after class. But the class is well structured and well taught",
    "The main strength of this class was the homework. It relied a lot on the material covered in lecture while also challenging us to think one step beyond the lecture. I really appreciated this because in many classes, the homework is much harder or seemingly unrelated to the lecture material, but the homework in this class is a natural extension of the class material. It was instrumental in solidifying the material in lecture. Both Professor Fan and Sheng (the TA) were helpful with the homework and concepts from lecture during their office hours. Also, lecture notes were uploaded to Canvas, which was very helpful. The weakness of this course is that the lectures are hard to follow. Professor Fan lectures very quickly and continuously writes notes for the whole lecture period and it is very hard to keep up. However, having lecture notes on canvas and the homework made up for this."

    "Yes if you have the math background and are prepared to make it the primary academic focus of your semester. Do not take it if you are unprepared to do that, or if you have significant other time commitments.",
    "Yes only if you have good math background and are interested in studying theoretical stats in the futuee",
    "Yes, but this course is quite a bit of work. I think you really have to want to learn the material and have some interest in statistical inference. This course is quite different from 242, so taking 242 should not deter you from this course. Also, this course is similar to the level of a proof-based math course. You need to comfortable with calculus\/analysis and be able to explain your ideas rigorously."
