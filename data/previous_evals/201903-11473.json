   "question_text": "What knowledge, skills, and insights did you develop by taking this course?",
   "comments": [
    "I gained fluency in writing in the Arabic language, and I improved in my reading and verbal comprehension of formal Arabic.",
    "My Arabic writing got better but everything else got worse.",
    "I learned to understand, read, and speak Arabic better.",
    "As opposed to introductory and intermediate levels of Arabic that focused on grammar and vocabulary, this course was geared towards improving our reading, listening, writing (and to a smaller extent, our speaking) skills. Every week, we watched a short video\/read an article, wrote weekly essays in response, and then prepared and presented info-graphs.",
    "I learned more Arabic!",
    "I improved my reading and listening comprehension through Al-Jazeera learning content, and wrote many 1-2 page essays. I learned a handful of new vocabulary and reviewed some old grammatical structures. I also learned a lot about various aspects of the Arab World and societies in the Middle East, through Al-Jazeera.",
    "I learned crucial Arabic skills and expanded my vocabulary knowledge and grammar lessons as well.",
    "We learned about different themes and topics as they relate to the Arab world and had bi-weekly writing assignments and tests where we could improve our writing",
    "ARBC 150 was all about understanding, organizing, and presenting information in Arabic: that was the purpose of the info-graphs. For anybody who doesn't know, there's an info-graph due every two weeks throughout the semester so that you end up making something like 7 or 8 info-graphs. Info-graphs are small, crammed with info, and colorful; they're all about getting the main idea to your audience quickly and effectively, which is basically what communication is about, no? So in that respect, my Arabic listening and speaking greatly benefited because I was constantly forced to listen for main ideas, important info, big themes. Even if I didn't understand every metaphor, detail, or nuance, I was forced to listen for the meaning of the video, that is, what I'm taking away from this video, article, info-graph, etc. My Arabic became more concise, and straight to the point. In some respects, more effective. All of this is of course supplemented by the tons of vocab words and expressions and structures I learned."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "As with most Arabic courses at Yale, this class focuses extensively on Modern Standard Arabic, and engages very little with dialects. This course is not useful for students who wish to gain fluency in a dialect.",
    "The course was writing-focused and I do feel like my writing improved. That said, the speaking aspect was just not up to par. The course was divided into 2-week themes. Every Monday, we had to have watched a video to discuss in class. Wednesday, we would have a writing assignment do relevant to the video\/theme. Every Friday, we would either have an infographic due or an exam (so for each theme: video, writing assignment, infographic, video, writing assignment, exam). It was painfully repetitive and did not facilitate speaking in the least. I did learn culturally about different things, but I feel like I could have learned more if the class was more varied. Cuttie-cutter classes are just not great for languages.",
    "I don't think we can improve our speaking by speaking to other students in the rote question formats paired off in partners. Some of that is ok, but the bulk of the speaking time that would be really helpful is if we were in larger class discussions led by the instructor who could then correct us as we make mistakes or help build our vocabulary in the moment. Those moments in the classroom are when I feel most improving, whereas the smaller conversations with partners who are at the same level as you don't really feel like chances to grow.",
    "Strengths: Ustaaza Sarab is experienced, kind and quite flexible to student requirements, and chose some interesting topics for discussion. She was also prompt and clear with feedback. Weaknesses: The class size was rather large, and we didn't get much time to speak. We could also have been pushed further, and I think the drive to do so was not the strongest among both students and the teacher. Perhaps that was because the abilities of students in L5 varies so tremendously.",
    "Strengths: You get to discuss a lot of diverse and pertinent topics in class. Weakness: Not enough speaking compared to L1-L3.",
    "This classes focuses on language acquisition by using real sources such as new articles or videos.",
    "A weakness was that there were so many people in the class that it was often hard to have good speaking practice, both in pairs because the room became so loud, and as a group. A strength was that the content was interesting and I feel like my listening comprehension dramatically improved. Also, Sarab is a wonderful and kind teacher who never made the class feel overwhelmingly difficult or stressful.",
    "This course was very efficient and effective in learning Arabic. There were a plethora of speaking interactions with the instructor, the students in the class, and even guest speakers. Many projects and assignemnts also enhanced the knowledge of the Arabic culture.",
    "I think the course is chill, but at the same time I think that makes it feel boring bc the discussions on topics were not very exciting or debatable. It was just regurgitating what the video or articles talked about",
    "I think that the course did a really good job of trying to approach the golden trio of language-learning: listening, speaking, and writing. Listening was bolstered by the numerous, numerous, numerous documentary videos that we watched throughout the semester. Speaking was developed by small voice clips that we recorded to accompany our info-graphs, and discussions within class. Writing was developed by the writing assignments that were due every week. I particularly liked those. The class was too big. That's an issue you always have with language classes, and this semester that issue was a big reality in our class. Too many students means not enough people get to talk, and to use their Arabic in new and complicated ways. I think that Professor Sarab tried to challenge and navigate this issue really well, but it was always an issue. This is perhaps an issue less with the actual class and more with the department at large. Nevertheless, it should be faced. I would also like to add that the Friday sections were a little unnecessary. The Teaching Fellow was great, but I think that the class could have done without them. Instead of reviewing vocab every time there's a new video, for instance, more time could be dedicated to speaking (as is done on Fridays). But they can be done without, I felt like."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, if you wish to learn more MSA.",
    "My Arabic got worse overall, but it's better than nothing at all. The course was divided into 2-week themes. Every Monday, we had to have watched a video to discuss in class. Wednesday, we would have a writing assignment do relevant to the video\/theme. Every Friday, we would either have an infographic due or an exam (so for each theme: video, writing assignment, infographic, video, writing assignment, exam). It was painfully repetitive and did not facilitate speaking in the least. Having invested my summer in learning Arabic (and seen drastic improvements), it sucks that I regressed on that progress, but honestly I wasn't expecting much.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. I think it's very hard to teach a language course once students are past the basic grammar and vocab learning stage, but Sarab does it well. My writing skills improved a ton over the course of the semester, and I got the chance to learn about different Arab countries and their cultures. I do hope that we have more opportunities for practicing speaking in the future.",
    "Yes! It was great to learn about current topics in an engaging manner.",
    "Not really - I didn't notice my Arabic ability change much over the course of the semester. Unfortunately there are not too many alternatives available.",
    "Yes!",
    "Yes!",
    "Yes, it was definitely a refreshing break from the grammar-heavy L1-L4 sequence, and is probably good and necessary preparation for more advanced Arabic courses.",
    "Yes! Take Arabic with Professor Al-Ani if you can.",
    "Yes, I will certainly recommend this course to anyone who seeks to learn Arabic and potetnially become fluent at it.",
    "Yes. I took it with Sarab and it was chill and she is really nice",
    "Yes! Take Sarab for Arabic 150. She's very kind, helpful and committed to student-learning. Additionally, the entire format of the class (info-graphs, videos, articles) was a very effective attempt at harnessing the power of technology to facilitate foreign-language learning. A smaller class, however, always produces better results. At a certain point, no matter how effective the format of the class is, a large number of students is an impediment to deepening language skills."
