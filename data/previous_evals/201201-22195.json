    "Surprisingly, one of my favorite courses ever :)",
    "Great class.",
    "It's a math course, content-wise you get what you're promised. Basic coverage of lin alg and multivar, good for intermediate micro and just a solid math class to have taken if it's going to be your last one. Marketa is engaging, accommodating, and articulate. Low level math classes are often made or broken by the teaching, and Miki (Marketa) is a very good argument for why you should take this class.",
    "Yes.",
    "Math 118 was pretty straightforward. Go to class and do the homework and you'll be fine. Miki is also an awesome instructor - really funny and the tests are always fair.",
    "Yes.",
    "You cover alot of important material but it is taught great",
    "YES! It's really a great course-well organized and the material is challenging but not impossible at all. Marketa Havlickova is a great professor and is always available for office hours and extra help. TAKE THIS!",
    "Math 118 is intended as an option for social science and econ majors. The first half of the course is linear algebra, and the second is multivariable calc. During shopping period I was looking at the other basic calc courses (115 and 120), and basically chose 118 because it was the most clearly (aka best) taught class of the bunch. Profes Havlickova (Miki) is great - she teaches well, is very willing to hold a million and one office hours and meet with students about any questions, and she has a nice attitude\/energy that keeps the class going. I totally recommend this course.Disclaimer: I am a poli sci major, and the last math class I took (other than stats) was Calc BC three years ago as a senior in high school.",
    "Take MATH 118 if you plan on pursuing an Economics major, but don't want to tackle MATH 120 - you're taught everything you need to know to be an Economics major, nothing less. If you have the opportunity, take it with Miki, who is a fantastic instructor that will be sure to help you out if you find the material difficult.",
    "The best math class I have ever taken. I am interested in economics and I feel like I learned many useful techniques applicable to the field of economics. I would definitely recommend this class when Professor Havlickova is teaching it!!!",
    "Take it. Everything you need to know for Econ and nothing else.",
    "Miki is amazing. This class was amazing. Take Math 118 if you do not intend on being a math major. Personally, I have always been \"good\" at math in high school but knew that it wasn't something I wanted to pursue at the proof-based level. This was a great introduction to multivariable and linear algebra, and I learned so many \"big ideas\" in these 2 subjects that I can confidently say that I have internalized. You get as much as you put out of it, and if you care about understanding a concept more deeply, Miki will be there for you and help you make the connections.Miki is very dedicated to the class, responding to emails very quickly and clearly. I have had ongoing conversations about math questions with her via email. She also has abundant office hours, and is readily approachable before and after class. She is willing to bend over to help you, and she explains concepts in multiple ways so that you will definitely understand. She spends a lot of time trying to come up with creative ways of elucidating concepts, and I will never forget these. One day, she came into class with a colorful triangle that she had spent a long time preparing the night before, and used it to explain WHY the inverse of a cycled permutation matrix was equal to its transpose. This is just one example of how Miki infused creativity into her lessons. She also created a forum on classes v2 so that all of us could post questions anonymously and have her respond.Miki really cared about Math 118 and our class, and as a result, she made me care a lot about the class and about learning the concepts. She introduced new topics by sitting down with us and giving real-life examples of when these abstract ideas could actually be used. I love how she introduced big ideas as \"here is the next great big idea in multivariable\", and how she walked us through the derivations of the LaGrange multiplier. She ended the course with an amazing lecture, in which she synthesized linear algebra and multivariable, answering a single problem in five different ways. I've learned a lot from this class and in terms of improvement, I would just encourage Miki to keep up all of her amazing work and wish that the rest of the Yale math department could have such dedicated, clear, thoughtful, caring professors so that some of my friends who are in Linear Algebra or Math 120 could have similarly amazing experiences!",
    "This course is half linear algebra and half multivariable calculus. The beginning of the calculus uses a lot of the linear algebra learned in the first half. I recommend this class if you are an econ major because it skips the integration that you will not use in economics",
    "I reccommend this for econ majors certainly. It covers the important things that you need to know.",
    "It covers the material in the description (linear algebra, multi-variable calculus) well. It was moderately challenging, but if you have a decent understanding of calculus you should be fine.",
    "I found the course to be quite difficult, especially in comparison to Calc AB\/BC, but I am also not so great at math.",
    "This is a great class. Miki is an engaging teacher, and she presents the material in a way that makes it really easy to understand. She is also really good about offering lots of office hours, if that's your thing. Definitely worth it if you want to take some more math."
