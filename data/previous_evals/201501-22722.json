    "A good L2 language course that is easy to do well in if you work at it.",
    "I would highly recommend this course. Russian is a hard language, there is no secret about this, but I can't think of a better professor to learn it with. The course also proceeds in very regular, very small steps so even if languages are not your strong suit you just have to persevere and in time you will make significant progress. The workload is significant, and continuous, but it's worth it.",
    "It is so fun and it is like having a family!",
    "If you took RUSS 110, you should take RUSS 120. Professor Titus is an absolute joy to have as a professor and her passion for teaching shines through in every lecture.",
    "A great class that I'd really recommend. Whether you want something to fulfull your language requirement or want to truly learn the language, I would definitely advise anyone to take Russian.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone needing a language credit or anyone interested in learning Russian. Wonderful teaching, upbeat atmosphere, and a very manageable workload.",
    "I would definitely recommend it.",
    "Russian is a very useful and important language to learn if you want to truly participate as a global citizen on the world stage. The first two semesters will be extremely difficult for students studying a foreign language for the first time. It appears that students who took French or Latin previously were able to grasp the concepts of Russian grammar much faster than the rest. You will also need to have a firm handle on English grammar as well. Expect to put in hours worth of work every night to keep up with the pace of the class, and plan your semester course workload accordingly.",
    "Yes, good course. Lots of work, but the professor is good and you will learn quickly.",
    "Take Russian!!!!! I love it and will definitely be continuing!"
