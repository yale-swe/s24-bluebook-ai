    "MUCH BETTER THAN FIRST SEMESTER. If you were turned off by this course first semester, know that the second semester is much more laid back. The labs are shorter, usually no more than 2-2.5 hours a week and the lab reports are also much shorter.",
    "Although second-semester pchem lab is somewhat easier than first semester, don't think it won't still be a significant amount of work. The lab report format is the same: extensive. That said, if you're interested in spectroscopy, take this class. I'd recommend to anyone planning to do chemistry research, because this class is much more applicable to modern research methods than chem 330. You'll learn to apply NMR, IR, UV-Vis,and Raman spectroscopy- all essential skills."
