    "I'm amazed how much Portuguese I was able to learn over the course of a semester with Fabi. I'm speaking, writing, and reading much better than I had been able to before.",
    "My Portuguese grammar as well as my oral speech improved this semester. I also learned more about Brazilian culture.",
    "You review a lot of the grammar you learned in L1\/L2 to help solidify it. I think my reading comprehension also improved as we started reading more advanced works by actual Brazilian authors.",
    "I learned so much in this course - new verb tense that furthered my ability to convey my thoughts in Portuguese through speaking and writing, new vocabulary that allows me to learn how native speakers really speak, and the confidence to use my language skills to discuss world issues.",
    "Moderate proficiency in speaking and writing Portuguese. Advanced proficiency in understanding basic portuguese",
    "practice with grammar, better fluency, Brazilian culture and customs",
    "In taking PORT 130, I learned more about the grammar learned in PORT 120 and it helped me perfect my pronunciation.",
    "I learned subjunctive! A lot! I learned how to get more comfortable speaking Portuguese and some about Brazil and other lusophone cultures."

   "comments": [
    "The course had a wonderful teacher who effectively and patiently helped us learn and a fun class environment that facilitated good discussions and conversations in Portuguese.",
    "The course overall is very well taught. There are no obvious weaknesses since the class is very well designed for learning Portuguese.",
    "This is an amazing course for anyone wanting to improve their Portuguese skills! There are a variety of ways that are utilized to help students learn; reading articles and stories, watching videos, listening to Brazilian music, writing, etc. that will allow every student to find something that works for them. Fabi is such a caring teacher and is always willing to help with any questions! I don't think there were any weaknesses!",
    "Less daily homework, since the class already meets every day",
    "Fabi is great",
    "A strength of this course is that it adds to what we learned in 120, where we talk more in depth about culture and issues in the lusophone world (and it isn't just about the grammar). We put the language in practice more than before. A weakness of this course is that it still is grammar, which I'm not a huge fan of.",
    "I enjoy learning Portuguese and Fabi is a joy to be around. She makes class fun and interesting. I just think there's room for improvement in study tools and organization--maybe if there was a list of terms\/vocab at the beginning of the year, or some packet\/resource that serves as an overview of the whole course. It was hard to stay organized or take notes, so maybe if there was a tool\/packet to take notes in for each week. That would've been good for my learning because I'm a visual learning and I learn from writing things down. I also think we don't need to focus so much on subjunctive if native speakers barely use it. It creates less room to focus on speaking how native speakers would. I often found myself forgetting basic stuff because I was focused so much on subjunctive. Sometimes the notice was too short for reading assignments--like the night before at 11pm. I don't think we can be expected to complete HW with such short notice. Otherwise, I enjoyed taking class with Fabi as our professor. She really makes Portuguese more fun and interesting."

    "I'd absolutely recommend this course to another student: I looked forward to class every day. Fabi was a joy to work with and one of the best instructors I've had at Yale.",
    "Great course overall and your Portuguese will improve. I'd recommend it.",
    "Overall, this is a good course with less work (I think) than most other intermediate language courses. Fabi does a good job bringing in aspects of culture to the classroom. However, I didn't come out of the course feeling that my Portuguese had made as much progress as I would have liked.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to any student that wants to improve their Portuguese skills quickly!",
    "Yes",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who wants to learn portuguese",
    "YESSS!! It will help your Portuguese in sooo many ways.",
    "Yes! I would recommend. You just have to be prepared for a lot of inter-communication with your peers in class, so choose your seat wisely. Fabi is a joy to be around though, so I would recommend."
