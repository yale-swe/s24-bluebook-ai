    "There is a deceivingly a lot of work but since the class is great i would most definitely take it! ...I may even reconsider my major now.",
    "If you are someone who wants to improve your speaking and writing skills, take this course! But to be warned, this is a big jump from L4, at first. The L5 teachers are much more strict but their strictness pushes you to rise to the occasion and master french grammar and vocabulary.",
    "Great way to refresh all parts of French. Not much grammar teaching, but that is expected to be known by L5 anyways. Very fun conversations and you really get to know your classmates.",
    "Take it! It's a great course. It's hard but rewarding but that's expected out of the amazing French department.",
    "i would definitely recommendstraightforward course, learn a lot",
    "I definitely would recommend taking this if you've taken 140 or 150 previously and if you really enjoy French. I took it without having taken any French at Yale, and since many people in the class had already taken 150 (even though they're supposed to be the same level), I found it a little difficult to keep up at first. If you put in the time though, you'll do well and it's a great class. You get a systematic review of all French grammar and I liked the texts and films we studied.",
    "Great class! I really felt like I got a hold of the main grammar points. Take it with Audrey Hoffmann if you can!",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone interested in improving their French! Not too hard, great quick grammar review, and lots of practice in every area of language learning.",
    "I think it is the bridge- course between L1-L4 and the upper level French courses. It is not super intense in literature and reading and everything else individually but overall you would need to devote a lot of time. There is at least one big assignment every week.",
    "Absolutely recommend it. A great course. Will definitely improve your French."
