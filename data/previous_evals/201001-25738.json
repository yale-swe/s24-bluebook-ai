    "Math 120 is liking listening to an audio version of the required calculus textbook. It leaves you wondering why you're listening, and even more, why someone would make something so useless.",
    "Absolutely do not take math 120 unless you have to. Even if you have to, try to avoid it. Take multi-variable calculus in high school so you don't have to take 120. I took the class because I loved math in high school and I wanted to be able to take higher levels of math after 120, but 120 has done a lot to squash my love of math. Certainly, if you take it, do not take it with Professor Rabin. She is completely removed--there were two kids who ever showed up to my class, and she didn't even bother to ask us our names--and she's bad at explaining things. She makes a lot of mistakes in class, ranging from arithmetic mistakes to language mistakes to integration mistakes to teaching us the wrong formulas. She didn't answer my questions adequately; for example, she often stepped around questions about why something worked or why we were doing it. She would also often answer questions by reexplaining something that I already understood instead of answering the question I had actually asked. It often took three or four tries to get something resembling an answer. She had no interest in making math fun or interesting, and, as a result, it was very far from fun or interesting; it felt like torture. She never pushed me to understand anything beyond the bare minimum of what was expected; she always geared classes towards the exam, whether it was in three days or five weeks. The material itself is also not exciting if you like math rather than physics. There is very little proof involved; the class is much more about memorization and the ability to answer questions than about really understanding what's going on or appreciating the beauty of the math. This is by far the worst class I've ever taken.",
    "You'll know whether you should take math 120 or not. I'll add I didn't take a math class for 3 years after taking the equivalent of math 115, but I really didn't want to take BC again. I played a bit of catch up, but it wasn't too bad. Try to get a good TA; I lucked out with mine."
