    "AFAM 390 gave me a new set of eyes. It is one thing to acknowledge racial inequality, but taking on the point of view of those that live \"on the other side\" transformed my mild feelings of empathy into urgency. If not this particular class, I encourage everyone to take an Ethnography course.",
    "I learned the basics of Ethnographic study and developed my close reading capabilities.",
    "I developed an expansive knowledge of me and my community.",
    "I think Professor Anderson did an amazing job in providing the primary tools in conducting an ethnography. We learned how to use primary and secondary sources and often person experiences to understand the unwritten set of rules that govern cultures and society.",
    "Prof. Anderson's course provided me with a framework to better understand how race (and particularly blackness) has been woven into the fabric of American society. The strengths of this course came less from the factual information I learned, but from the tools that have allowed me to analyze and explain the role of blackness in American social structure."

   "comments": [
    "Strengths: the reading list was really great, feedback on essays was really helpful Weaknesses: This was structured more like a lecture than a seminar; students were not really given a chance to contribute int he seminar.",
    "Prof. Anderson needs more variety in his teaching examples and points.",
    "Strengths: Meets only once a week, and classes seem to go by quickly since Professor Anderson has decades of wisdom to share. Uses various works to reinforce the prevailing themes in the course Elija speaks at an easy pace. That allowed me not only to write most of what he says down, but also think of his point a bit before he moves on.",
    "Overall I thoroughly enjoyed the course. A few more outside of class events, maybe a museum visit or another movie screening would've been nice.",
    "I think the syllabus could be a bit more clear, because many of the works listed as required were not discussed in class.",
    "Greatest strength - diversity of readings and coherence of themes throughout Weakness - no discussion of ethnographic methods, this would have been helpful in the context of our PHiladelpha Negro, Black Metropolis, Sidewalk, Canopy, etc."

   "comments": [
    "This was a really interesting class. It is a seminar, but Professor Anderson structures it more like a lecture; there is not much opportunity to contribute. The class is also quite unstructured; Professor Anderson does not follow the syllabus very carefully. On the other hand, the reading list is really great, and Prof Anderson is really familiar with all the material. Professor Anderson talks a lot and repeats himself a lot, but if you listen carefully there are a few nuggets of fold each lecture. I definitely learnt a lot from this class; it gave me a really useful framework to understanding the African American community. This class was quite an experience, and I would probably recommend it.",
    "Prof. Anderson gives the same lecture every week. If you show up to the first class shopping period, you've basically taken the class for the entire semester.",
    "AFAM 390 gave me a new set of eyes. It is one thing to acknowledge racial inequality, but taking on the point of view of those that live \"on the other side\" transformed my mild feelings of empathy into urgency. If not this particular class, I encourage everyone to take an Ethnography course.",
    "Yes. You will definitely learn a bunch and the course is not overly demanding.",
    "This house is a great course to really learn about the black community",
    "I think the course is provides an amazing foundational understanding of the place and position of African-Americans within America--detailing the structures and systems that solidified their place. The course also presents many of the challenges within the African-American community and how it has become a stratified group with various objectives, as opposed to a monolith that many assume it to be given its minority status.",
    "I would absolutely recommend AFAM 390 to another student, especially if he\/she wants to apply concrete definitions to various social constructs pertaining to race."
