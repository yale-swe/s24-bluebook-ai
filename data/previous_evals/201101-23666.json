   "comments": [
    "It's a fantastic class. Doug does an excellent job of teaching and keeping the class fun, and the material provides good exposure to econometric methods. The format (short presentations and small group discussions rather than everyone talking across the table) is conducive to getting to know your classmates and really learning from each other. You also get to start writing an economic research paper which is helpful if you're planning on doing a senior essay or want to do real economic research.",
    "Prof. McKee is an awesome, chill guy. The workload is very reasonable so you can really spend time understanding the readings if you want, and the final paper is actually fun to write. You can really learn a lot about research and data analysis in this class--something that can be hard to find in the econ major. Definitely recommend it as a follow-up to Dean Karlan's Econ of Developing Countries.",
    "One of the most useful Econ classes at Yale. You actually learn things frameworks that you can use for life!",
    "Classes typically consisted of 1 or 2 people presenting a paper that was an assigned reading, with McKee's help. Then we would would, as a class raise some policy questions and discuss in an open forum or smaller groups. Every class was interesting and dealt with differnt aspects of human capital in Latin America, for example how to increase school attendance or stop drug trafficing.",
    "HIGHLY recommended.The professor is awesome. The material is interesting. The work is manageable. Class is fun.",
    "Great choice for an ECON senior seminar, mostly because you will never have a cooler or more helpful professor than Doug. The actual seminar is kind of boring since it is usually student-led (bring a laptop), but Doug spices things up withfun discussion questions. The readings are pretty dry since most are empirical, but if you just skim them you will be fine and the actual concepts behind the research papers are interesting. The bulk of the workload is a presentation (Doug totally holds your hand and you will be fine) and a research paper proposal. The paper is imtimidating at first, but you'll end up getting really into it, and you'll learn how research economics actually works.",
    "YES, definitely take this course!!!",
    "Do it. There's a lot of development economics courses at Yale (which is basically what this is) and I think they're all fairly similar, but this one has a great professor who will be really happy spending two hours with every week, and will encourage you to think originally and creatively. Final project makes you writehalf a research proposal, which is really educational. Also, really not all that much work.",
    "Would totally recommend it, even if you do not know much about Latin America or think you don't have a particular interest in the area. What you learn goes beyond a geographic region.",
    "This is a great econ seminar to take. Professor Mckee is an awesome teacher, I've taken both of his seminars. The workload is not bad, there is a final paper, midterm paper which is the first half of your final paper, a presentation, and weekly responses that are not graded. The material is interesting, nothing bad to say about this class, it's awesome.",
    "Take this class for McKee. He's one the best professors I've had at Yale.",
    "A class where you learn how to make economic models.",
    "A really great course. Maybe a little redundant if you have taken a ton of econometrics heavy work and Latin America econ classes but overall excellent.",
    "Doug is great. Take it.",
    "Yes. There are few interesting and well taught seminars in the econ department, and this is one of them!! You will learn a lot and it's not that stressfu. Do not be put off by the sentence in the syllabus that says \"students will develop an empirical model,\" i get the sense that many students are put off by that statement but really Professor McKee provides you with all the guidance you will need and at the end you will be proud of your brain child.",
    "You learn to read economics papers and understand many of the statistical techniques behind them without delving into the derivations.",
    "The Human Capital of Latin America is a great course that will expose you to academic research and teach you how to read (and even write) such papers; in the process, you'll also learn about the field of human capital and learn more about Latin America. The weekly writing assignments (a short worksheet per paper) are a great way to understand how to read papers quickly and efficiently. Moreover, the class presentations complement the reading; your own presentation will really help you understand the material. The research proposal is a great way to really delve into an original question and understand how to write a research paper. In fact, if you really like your paper topic, I'm sure it could be fodder for a senior research paper (if you're a junior that is).I would definitely recommend this class to anyone who is interested in learning how to read and write econ research papers and who wants to learn a bit about Latin America. I would caution those really interested in learning about Latin America or about human capital because the papers provide only a fragmented picture: the papers are loosely connected in theme, not all nations are covered, and there was no historical context.",
    "A Must take! Best econ class at Yale! Very fascinating, yet full of econometrics concepts!",
    "Doug is the best economics teacher at Yale. He doesn't have a big name like Swensen or Zedillo, but I guarantee you will take a ton out of his class. He's very approachable, teaches the material well, and unlike most teachers in the econ department really understands what he is teaching. So for all of you people out there who (like me) are feeling distraught about economics as a major and are looking for a light at the end of the tunnel, take this class."
