   "comments": [
    "You learn SO much about birds, and it's great if you're interested in it. But it is NOT a gut. It's just a cool class to take if you need a science credit. Though it will be much easier for you if you are a science person.",
    "Interesting science credit. You wont get bored, but be prepared to put in some work.",
    "It's a lot of swallowing information, regurgitating on tests. The paper is relatively straightforward. It's an entertaining course, but don't expect to learn to think scientifically so much as absorb information that you may or may not retain.",
    "This course was really good, and I learned a lot. It has a lot of work though: 2 midterms, a final paper, and a final exam, and most of that work is weighted toward after spring break, meaning that the already-crazy month of April is crazy with Ornithology stuff. But I loved it overall! I learned so much about birds, and I appreciate them in entirely new ways. Everyone should take this at some point. One other caveat: This course gets rave reviews every year and maybe I was expecting too much, but I think it deserved just a touch less of enthusiasm. It's a good course and I certainly learned a lot but it often seemed like it wasn't Professor Prum's priority. He would forget the connections between his slides and admit that he hadn't looked at them since last year. He seemed less prepared than he perhaps has been in previous years.",
    "I think this is one of the best classes I've ever taken. The strengths are Prum, Prum's arguments, and Prum's stories. I don't know if there are any weaknesses from my point of view. I loved this course, even as a major in the humanities. I cannot recommend this highly enough. I have become totally obsessed with ornithology and wish I knew so much more about birds than I do. I think it's prepared me to understand more serious conversations about evolution, animal behavior, evolutionary development, and even some physics. It's fantastic. Absolutely take, even if you don't think you'll ever be interested in birds.",
    "Take it! Favorite class at Yale so far.",
    "Very fun and interesting but the exams were rather difficult. I would definitely recommend the course.",
    "Ornithology is an interesting science credit as it combines many different sciences under one course -- there is some physics, chemistry and of course, a lot of biology. I would definitely recommend it.",
    "For those doing it for the Sc: take it only if you really think you care about birds. Like you care enough to get up to Science hill on FRIDAY mornings at 9:25. And to do a lot of work. People go on and on about how life-changing this class is, but sometimes I wish I'd just done issues approach to bio or something. Consider your options.",
    "A really good class. I wouldn't have taken it if it wasn't also a science credit, but I would recommend it. I've got to say though, I never quite understood what the big deal was about birds.",
    "'Twas an excellent course, and I would highly recommend it! You will come to know and understand birds so much better than you would have ever thought possible; now, whenever I see a feather lying on the ground, it conjures up so many thoughts about how it grew, how it got its, color, etc., etc., etc. (However, I do fear that I've become insufferable when it comes to birds; I think that all my friends now try very hard to avoid mentioning birds when I'm around because they know I'll launch into a rant about how cool birds are). The lectures were very interesting, and although I do like science a lot, I think Professor Prum made the information very accessible to those who are not so into science. Lastly, the field trips were very enjoyable, and I highly recommend that you go on them regardless of whether you are in the lab.",
    "Please take it! This has got to be the best science class at Yale, and one of the best humanities too (though it's not listed as such; I learned so much about human as I did about birds.) There is no reason not to take it. Don't cheat yourself out of this awesome 9:25 AM Science Hill experience.",
    "Hard for non-science majors. It's more interesting than a science gut but maybe no interesting enough to justify the bad grade.",
    "Ornithology is a fascinating class, if at times a kind of haphazard one. For a curious English major like me, it seemed less a course on birds and more a course on ethology in general, and on current practices in scientific research and theory, through the lens of ornithological examples. (I consider that a good thing, as if it were a course in algebra that turned out to be introducing you to calculus, too.) Rick Prum has a wonderfully fertile and diversely enthusiastic mind, and an engaging, entertaining lecturing style. The course was well-structured and the workload was both substantial and manageable (three equally weighted exams, one research paper, a few trivial quizzes, no other homework). He does have a tough time staying on track to cover his whole syllabus, and lingers too long over the topics he's currently researching or just fascinated by, and occasionally presents his opinions in ongoing scholarly debates as Correct Answers. Not the easiest SC credit, not for those who don't want to make it up Science Hill at 9:25 three times a week, but consistently thought-provoking and doable with no EEB experience.",
    "BIRDS, birds, also birds. Not sure if you realized, but this class is about birds. Take this class if you know you won't get sick of learning about birds; they truly are fascinating creatures, and Prum knows them like the back of his hand. Prum is perhaps one of the most qualified individuals in the world to teach this class, and he does so excellently. But don't take this class for an easy grade, since it's hard to constantly deal with birds for a whole semester if you're not really that interested. (It's also not really an easy grade.) Take it for the birds! Also, it's about birds, if you didn't know already.",
    "No worries if you're not a science major; many people in the class aren't. You don't need previous physics, chem, or bio experience to jump in - but that said, it will help. This is not an ornithology class such much as a \"birds according to Professor Prum\" class, and he has done a lot of research on the mechanisms of feather development and color production. You will spend weeks on these two topics. I'm an EEB major, so I ended up helping many of my friends in the class from arts majors with the hard science involved. I think they ended up enjoying the class at least as much as I did, though.",
    "Yes, this course can change your life, especially if you're a non-science student.",
    "Yes, it is a cool lecture. Not a ton of work and you learn a lot about birds.",
    "Great science credit. You learn science. Beware the midterm after tap night if that happens again, also field trip the morning of spring fling if you're in the lab.",
    "You'll learn about birds and life! It's a great class. The midterms and final are reasonable, and the paper is fun if you get into your topic. I'd absolutely recommend the class!",
    "Take this class! As an English major, I was worried about this but decided to take it because it looked really awesome and fun. It was!!! Study and go to class and you'll do just fine.",
    "Take it you will learn so much- I did not initially have a big interest in birds but loved the class.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone interested, and encourage people to take the lab as well.",
    "This lecture was great. Super interesting lectures and great professor. The subject matter was surprisingly interdisciplinary; Prum draws content from an array of disciplines, from physics to feminism. The midterms were totally reasonable, and had a lot of extra credit.",
    "Take it! It's an awesome class even if you know nothing about birds. Go on the field trips too!",
    "I really enjoyed Ornithology. The lecture is fabulous, and I didn\u2019t get bored once during the entire semester. Professor Prum is a brilliant lecturer and does a wonderful job of keeping every student engaged, no matter their interest. He really knows the material well and does a great job of conveying complex ideas in simple, understandable ways. The class as a whole is supposed to be a general overview of current and important topics in ornithology, and for the most part it is. However, Professor Prum clearly spends A LOT more time on the topics that he has researched and goes quite in depth with these. As a result, many topics get skipped or rushed. However, all of the information is interesting, even if it is very specific. I would definitely recommend this class to anybody who either needs a science credit, or to anybody who is interested in avian diversity and history, including avian evolution from dinosaurs. The class made me see not only birds, but much of the natural world through new eyes. The class itself is not very much work, and the readings are not necessary. Go to lecture and pay attention and you\u2019ll do fine. The only drawback is that Professor Prum is hard to work with one-on-one. He has a hard time relating to students and is very unreceptive to questions. He often acts very defensive and seems self-centered at times. However, if you can see past this, and focus on the material, the class is truly wonderful. Take it with the lab if you can, however I think the lab needs some significant changes as it is kind of archaic.",
    "Great class! Take if if you get the chance. It's definitely not a gut science credit, but if you do all the work, you'll get a lot out of it. There are two midterms, a final, and a final paper, but note that the final is only worth the same as a midterm, so make sure you do well on the first two.",
    "Some people really did not like this class; others did. I was one of the latter, but some of my friends really resented the work and the tri-weekly trudge up science hill. It's not a gut, but I thought it was fascinating."
