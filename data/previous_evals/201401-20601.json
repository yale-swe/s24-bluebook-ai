   "comments": [
    "Fast overview of French Lit with a lot of reading, but really helpful with improving your French very quickly. Take it with Pinzka!",
    "A great survey of French literature. Not too much homework, but several essays that require attention. Good class!",
    "Absolutely. If you are interested in learning about French lit or just improving your French writing, this is the course for you.",
    "FREN 170 is a great way to improve your fluency and begin to write academic papers in French. You'll read a bunch of influential texts and discuss them in various formats. The workload is very manageable and Pinzka always ensures that class discussion remains lively. Overall, a very good course! I enjoyed it much better than other French classes.",
    "If you are an L5 student and are at all serious about improving your French, I would say this class is *must*. Your vocabulary will improve through the readings, your written French will improve through the assignments, and your oral French through class discussions. Plus, the language has such a rich literary tradition... Take it!",
    "FREN 170 was such a great class - definitely take it with Madame Pinzka! It was a great way of introducing students to the craft of writing literary papers in French, and it did so in a way that was accessible to people like myself who have never written literary analysis papers on a regular basis. It also got me to enjoy all different kinds of French literature, and the pieces that were very dense were broken down appropriately. Also, Mme. Pinzka is the best! She is always enthused about the readings and is very helpful in breaking down scenes from the works so that all of us could deeply analyze. She was also very open to helping after class, and was just in general an upbeat person.",
    "We read about a book a week, sometimes two if they were short. Wrote one \"forum post\" and responded to another based on questions Mme. posted, then had in-depth class discussions about each reading during class. There were three essays spread out during the semester and a final oral exam. There is definitely a lot of reading, and it was hard for me to read quickly in french, but by the end of the semester I could feel it getting faster\/easier. This was my favorite class this semester by far and I feel I got a great sense of French literature and even a pretty good overview of French history.",
    "The course has a great reading list: the content spans centuries and genres. I feel like I was exposed to a lot of literature that I hadn't yet encountered. Madame Pinzka is really enthusiastic about the material: it's clear that she's picked each book for a reason, and is passionate about getting its value across to the class. I think the weakness of the class might have been in its format. Each class had basically the same structure: a student would give a \"redaction\" at the beginning, which was essentially a ten minute mini-presentation on the book. This, and the two \"ripostes\" or responses to the redaction, often got somewhat tedious. Also, breaking into groups and responding to questions in pairs got a little tedious. I think if the class size had been smaller the participation would have been more lively. Books were good, class time was a little boring, lots of reading.",
    "A good survey of french literature (not of which is really great but interesting nonetheless). I would recommend this class to someone who really wants to improve their written french because there is a lot of required writing with very high standards for vocabulary and grammar.",
    "An introduction to literature - many overarching themes of society, social roles in general, and of course, the changing views of love (and it's role in marriage).",
    "French 170 seemed daunting at first, but it is a great course to improve all aspects of your command of French. Madame Pinzka was an excellent, enthusiastic instructor who assembled an intriguing collection of works that contrasted well in order to demonstrate the evolution of French literature. Through her questions and management of the class discussion, Madame Pinzka sparked very thoughtful analysis of the works while keeping the discussion primarily student driven. As a result, I leave the class more confident in my ability to comprehend the French language and to convey my thoughts in writing. Additionally, my literary analysis skills are also greatly improved. Madame Pinzka was excellent at pointing out a particular passage to prompt further discussion on a certain literary technique employed by the author. This class was conducted entirely in French while maintaining an advanced level of literary discussion and analysis. That aspect of the class frightened me at first, but I can say that this class was certainly one of the more rewarding courses that I have taken so far. In terms of the workload, it was constant (it is a literature class, so there's a lot of reading) but not excessive. The longer essay assignments do require more preparation (of course) but are manageable."
