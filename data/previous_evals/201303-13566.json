    "Assignments were time consuming, did not really apply to course learning, and were a small percentage of our grades. We would have benefitted greatly from working with risk assessment software. However, Professor Khalil knows a lot about risk assessment and was very kind and receptive to student feedback.",
    "The content of homework assignments did not match the lecture material. I felt that the information was extremely brief and did not go in depth for students to get a firm understanding of risk assessment in practice. The instructor was hesitant to explore more scientific\/math contact with the students for fear it would be above some students' heads. I felt this was unfair, as it is an engineering course for risk assessment; this discipline by nature requires a firm (although not expert) understanding of scientific principles.Furthermore, at no point did we cover risk assessment software. I used this software (At Risk and Crystal Ball) in two other courses. Of all courses, Risk Assessment should have been the first to teach this skill.Homeworks would have been an excellent opportunity to teach students these skills; instead we did independent research on water issues for every assignment except for ~2. I have a background in water, and had I known this was going to be the content of homework assignments I would have not taken the course. I felt that my faculties were not pushed in this course whatsoever and that the professor was afraid to push students too hard.However, I do feel that the content of lectures was great, and perhaps tried a little too hard to fit a broad range of material into too few lectures. This is a shame because the professor had impressive knowledge to share with us and just too little time.I would also recommend that in the future, the lecture match more closely with the syllabus. That was the the case this semester, and made it difficult to track the semester timeline.",
    "Prof. Khalil is a very smart, nice man and some of his lectures were good. The class, however, lacked structure and the assignments were poorly planned exercises. I did not learn anything valuable about \"risk assessment\" in the class.",
    "Professor Khalil is lovely, incredibly smart and knowledgeable, and good at explaining complex material, but the course isn't fully living up to its potential. The assignments do not reinforce the in-class material, and there are no assigned readings. The course would be much better if the professor covered all of the material on the syllabus. It would also be very helpful to practice the quantitative skills introduced in class through out of class assignments and exams.",
    "I thought that the instructor was very knowledgeable and cared a lot about his students. However, I felt like there was a significant disconnect between the material taught in class and the homework assignments. I understand that this was probably due in part to student feedback about assignments in the past, but I would have liked the course to be a little more quantitative and have the homework assignments be based on the material covered in class, rather than independent research."

   "comments": [
    "More quantitative lectures and examples are needed.",
    "Assignments. Need actual risk assessment exercises.",
    "It needs to be more technical. I was hoping for a professional course where we learned quantitative skill sets or at least get pre-professional training, but it ended up feeling like a survey course on a broad range of topics that honestly could have been done with similar effect by reading Wikipedia for each sub topic covered. Depth needs to be emphasized over breadth.Illustration:Instead of telling us what a Monte Carlo simulation is (i.e. something wikipedia can do fairly well), let's practice doing one!",
    "There must be a syllabus with readings. The class had virtually no required reading and the assignments seemed irrelevant to the course subject. The assignments--7-page research papers--were also too big in scope and too few in number. Five days is not long enough to write a good research paper. The class would have been better if there were more, smaller assignments. Also, the TA and professor should have given more feedback for each paper because so much work went into them.",
    "out of class assignments",
    "Professor Khalil is one of the least clear lecturers I have ever been around. He mumbles through slides, repeatedly skips slides that appear to contain important information, and fails to provide clear explanations for the systems and tools he discusses. What is worse, the assignments, though long and time intensive, had next to nothing to do with the purported topic of the course.",
    "The class lectures were technical beyond the scope of the class; could tailor them",
    "Some reinforcement of the lecture material, perhaps through short reading assignments, would be nice. However, I really appreciated that this survey course didn't delve too deep into the technical concepts previewed in lectures. I think that broad rather than deep dive approach was critical to my enjoyment of the course. And, while others may bellyache about the writing-based assignments for this course and how they were sometimes just tangentially related to the lectures, I found them enjoyable to complete and think that they covered important real-world application of the broad course concepts, since in reality, most of us will only deal with risk assessment in a conceptual--not technical\/equation-based--manner.",
    "Again, I would have liked to have more quantitative homework assignments that are directly based on material covered in class. Also, the professor wanted to teach us how to use ERA software, but the school doesn't have it, so that limited his resources to teach us an important skill"
