    "I would recommend this course for those who are serious about a carer in science or research. I say only for those who are serious because this class is truly a lot of work if you wish to produce high-quality reports. If your goal is to learn, and this class can truly teach you a lot, then you will mneed to spend a lot of time on this class. The reports are long and cumbersome, but also teach you to pay attention to detail. Highly recommended for serious science majors, but do not take if you have a loaded semester.",
    "Chemistry 330L is a lot of work. Of course I read the previous course evaluations, but even still I think I underestimated how much would be asked of me. DO. NOT. PROCRASTINATE. Take this course only if required to do so, and even so prepare to set aside an almost-absurd amount of time for each lab report (there are 5). The professor, though, is great; make sure to go to him for help, since he's definitely willing to help you.",
    "This class wasn't anything you wouldn't expect. It was by far the most work I've had for a single class at Yale, but I definitely learned a lot. The biggest downside was the enormous amount of data analysis that accompanied each experiment. If you have to take it as a Chem or ChemE major, I think it will serve you well, but take it with an otherwise light schedule. If you don't need it, definitely don't take it - it's way too much work to be taken as an elective.",
    "Only take it if you have to. If you have to take it, realize that it will be a lot of work, but you will also learn a lot. This has been emphasized so much, but really do the lab reports on time. The back-to-back due dates of some reports are murderous, so the more on top of it you are from the start, the better.",
    "This is literally the most awful experience ever. There's a \"15 page limit\" on reports, however with appendices, figures, etc. a report can be about 50 pages.The experiments are all tedious, monotonous, and boring. Avoid at all costs!If possible, get Conrad for your TA...best TA I've ever had.",
    "A tough class but required for a major. If you start early each lab report and pay attention to technical details how to write it, you'll be fine.",
    "Start the experiments ahead of time and you will be fine. Start them at the last minute and you'll want to switch to PoliSci.",
    "Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be afraid of pchem lab! Yes it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s regarded as one of the hardest\/most work-intensive classes at Yale, andyes I produced 200 pages of lab reports for it (only 65 pgs of text, though). I would say that the work I put in was proportional to what I learned, and you do learn a lot of useful stuff in the class. If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re taking this it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s because you have to, so, survival guide:1) Reports: Take it seriously when people tell you to start labs early. For lab 1, write up the section of the report for the experiment you completed on that day. Write labs 2 and 3 over October break and as much of labs 4 and 5 over Nov. break as possible. Pace yourself and you may actually find that the data analysis is enjoyable! I paced myself and the labs were not bad at all. Those who didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t pace themselves had were in a living hell for ~4 days at a time. Give yourself about 4 days to write reports (I mean 4 days of doing nothing but reports and sleeping). START EARLY.2) Lectures: Lectures may not seem relevant to the labs, but they are essential for the exam. The exam is all theory and incredibly difficult. Go to lecture and take good notes and study them well for the exam, and you might just survive it.3) TA\u00e2\u0080\u0099s: Talk to your TA\u00e2\u0080\u0099s! They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re really fun people, and they will work hard to help you. Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t sit there with excel trying to figure out how to turn a blob into a straight line for two days like I did. They will help you and save you precious time.4) Graphs, tables: Learn excel! This course will be impossible if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not adept at using excel. Ask friends, TA\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, or google (Youtube has good excel tutorials). Save yourself hours and lots of frustration and spend some time learning excel (you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll need to know how to use it eventually anyway).5) Make friends: It will be a lot more fun if you have sympathizers. Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t spend hours mindlessly typing numbers into a computer program \u00e2\u0080\u0093 get together with partners and split up the busywork. Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t try to figure everything out on your own \u00e2\u0080\u0093 ask others for help and give help.6) Prep\/manuals: You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll need to read the manuals, but don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t stress too much about lab prep. Except for the first lab, your TA\u00e2\u0080\u0099s help you with everything, so it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s OK if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not really sure what you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re doing.7) Lab 1: This lab is hard. You sit there staring at an oscilloscope and a mess of wires and feel totally lost. Read the manual well, ask your TA\u00e2\u0080\u0099s for help, and try to have fun playing with circuits, because that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s really what this lab is about. It will get better after the first few lab sessions (lab 1 takes 4-5 weeks).8) For chemE\u00e2\u0080\u0099s: At least my year, we could take orgo lab instead of pchem lab. I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t take orgo lab, but pchem lab really isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t that bad. I would definitely do pchem lab instead of orgo lab if I had to decide again.",
    "This course is a lot of work, no matter how you view it. It is impossible to slack off on reports, because there is no possible way to finish each one without spending MINIMALLY 20 hours on it. Even with that, it takes a lot more work to get a great grade. I did worse in my other classes because of PChem Lab, and now, as my grades come in at the end of the semester, I resent the class even more. I enjoyed most of the experiments, but it's hard to justify spending countless exhausting hours on the reports, only to find out that they make up a mere 55% of the total class grade. The only advice I can offer besides the obvious (start working early on reports) is to keep all the class materials and lecture notes well organized, because there is a written final at the end of the course.",
    "If there is one thing to learn from this lab it's this: DON'T PROCRASTINATE. On the day you have lab follow this schedule: Lab, Dinner, Write up. That being said, this lab earns its reputation. The hours are long but you do learn a lot, and not necessarily about chemistry either. You learn most of EENG 200 and 201 in the first lab, a large amount about statistics and even a bit of programming. The labs themselves aren't very exciting though. The Friday lectures from Vaccaro are well taught, and can help you when doing some of the more quantitative parts of the lab write up. This class is tough, but doable.",
    "Please don't take this class unless you are required to. Everyone else, you will get through this, just try to do the lab reports early, it will take you over 15 hours to do each lab.",
    "You've probably heard a lot about this lab, it is pretty infamous. Use your grace days wisely, absolutely do NOT procrastinate, and be prepared to spend at least a few nights up late. And be prepared to spend a good portion of your time either on this lab or complaining about the workload."
