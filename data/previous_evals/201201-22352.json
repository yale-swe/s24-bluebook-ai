    "This class is required for the major, however I would not recommend it to anyone who does not have to take it. I find other aspects of E&EB much more interesting.",
    "If you're an E&EB major, you need to take this course, which I did without having taken E&EB 122. It's definitely doable without the prereq, but the beginning half of the course is very, very theoretical (neutral theory, population genetics, etc.) and hard to follow since the info is presented with very little application. Professor Turner's topics were much more interesting and better presented than Professor Moran's, but the lectures often felt inconclusive. If you're looking for a Sc credit and have some science background\/don't want to take a \"gut\", you're probably better off taking a specific organismal E&EB course or the new intro class.",
    "This is a very thorough course in evolutionary biology, that covers much more than is taught in E&EB 122. The course spans topics from the origin of life to virus evolution. I would highly recommend this class to anyone interested in biology or evolutionary theory.",
    "This class is pretty easy work-wise, only two midterms and a final paper. Lectures can be pretty dry, but Paul Turner makes them interesting, so take it with him if you can. The class feels sort of disjointed between the first and second half of the year. It's a very \"meh\" class that I took to fulfill the EEB requirement, so only take it if you're really interested in the subject material or have tofor the major.",
    "Interesting but some lectures do drag. Grading curve is also not very good.",
    "Don't take this if you don't have to! I was majorly disappointed with this class. Evolutionary biology is the reason that I am E&EB major, however this class was not at all what I was expecting. I felt that it was very cursory in what it addressed and that the professors were not excited about what they were teaching\/did not do a good job teaching the subject matter. This is upsetting since the subject is SO interesting. This class was basically a repeat of EEB 122",
    "Yes. You learn a lot of very important concepts. It's a lot of fun.",
    "if youre a bio major you should take it. it's interesting and fun.",
    "This class taught some important principals of evolutionary biology, but overall it was a huge letdown. The class was not taught in an especially engaging manner, lectures were rarely given the appropriate contextual introduction or contextual grounding necessary to properly understand the material, and the material learned did not feel particularly groundbreaking, novel, or even important. After E&EB 122 with Stearns during spring 2010, this class was not rewarding. However, the exams were pretty easy overall and the class required very little work from week to week- studying for exams and writing the term paper was the only intensive work required (the term paper was an unruly amount of work, however).Paul Turner was quite energetic, a very skilled speaker, and very knowledgeable about the subject he taught. He made lectures much more interesting than Professor Moran, although he still did not give any of the topics we covered the necessary contextual grounding or introduction to make them seem relevant and important to learn.Nancy Moran was a very poor speaker, and her lectures were unbearably dry and uninteresting. Her lectures seemed much more like a random collection of facts than a cohesive coverage of different topics in evolutionary biology. She was clearly knowledgeable and meant well with her lectures, but Professor Moran's general execution was very poor.",
    "Okay, so the thing is, both the teachers are like world-renowned in their fields. The problem is, they can't really teach that well. Most of the class, I was on gchat\/facebook, as were people in front of me. The teaching needs to be changed to 1. Introduce the theory 2. Provide examples 3. More discussion in class. All in all, just a necessary evil as is EEB 220 for majors. That said, all MCDB majors should def take an EEB class to place the MCDB material in broader context. It is really important, especially since Evolutionary thinking is becoming a greater part of medicine and biology.",
    "This wasn't really a great class. If you're in E&EB, you have to take it for the major. It rehashed material from E&EB 122 and genetics. Professor Turner was more interesting, but I think he might not be teaching next year. Not too much work--2 exams, reading for section, and a 15 pg paper.",
    "Interesting if you love the material. Covers a huge amount. Harder than 122. Quite a bit of work. Get to read lots of primary literature and go over it which is valuable and interesting.",
    "This course was an excellent discussion of evolutionary theory. It was a step up in depth and difficulty from the introductory E&EB course, and it delved deeper into some very interested topics. Professors Moran and Turner were really excellent lecturers; they complemented each other well. Further, they both were extremely organized, which made it a lot easier to navigate all aspects of the course (readings, exercises, section, etc). Professor Moran had an excellent way of explaining WHY, which made it way easier to learn all the relevant facts. Professor Turner was great at engaging the class and was always offering alternative interesting explanations which really made you think. They were great!Grading is based on two tests (final isn't cumulative), some exercises which are difficult but are not harshly graded, and a big paper which your TA can help you with. This is a great course if you like E&EB, and you get the chance to read and understand a lot of landmark papers in the field!",
    "stay away.",
    "The course provides an overview of micro- and macroevolution. If you are a non-science major looking for a science and with an interest in evolution, I would recommend EEB122 over this class. As an EEB major this class is of course required and it is enjoyable one, for the material is always interesting and not too difficult, but I would urge for greater student involvement and\/or greater in-depth exposition of material.",
    "A recommended class for anybody entering the field of evolutionary biology with a little background. The amount lf materials covered is decent.",
    "Given its material, this class has the potential to be awesome and engaging. However, the class sacrifices depth for breadth, and is taught in a way that does not allow for much active thought or class participation. I preferred EEB 122 to this class.",
    "Hard. Don't take it if you don't need to."
