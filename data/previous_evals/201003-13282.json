    "A very interesting class, especially for those who are interested in how science is actually performed\/those interested in going into biomedical research. Work comes in waves - so be prepared (6 take home questions). Also, class is at the medical school, which is a little inconvenient.",
    "This was a great course if you are interested in modern biology research. I had never taken a genetics course, but was interested in learning what was actually important to know. In this sense, the course fulfilled my hopes, as the lectures were almost all fascinating and relevant to understanding modern genetics. There are no exams, only six take-home essays. These were not easy, but no more than 5 hours of work, and were often fun to think about. All the undergrads in the course (6 or 7 of us in a 50 person course) would get together and go over the questions (collaboration was encouraged by the professors). The course is half lecture and half section, and while the lecturers varied, they were mostly good. My section was TA led, however, and was mostly a waste of time. Try everything you can to get into the professors section, as you might actually learn something in them.",
    "This class is basically a thorough introduction to the field of modern genetics research, why it's important and what sorts of biological questions in can answer, the tools and techniques used in various model organisms (flies, yeast, worms, mice, humans), the data those methods generate, and how to interpret that data. The lecturers are all experts in their field and know an incredible amount about the subject. One paper is usually assigned every week, and is the topic of the discussion section that week (which meets during one of the class sessions). Reading these papers is an excellent complement to the concepts learned in lecture and is a good immersion into modern genetics research, forcing one to understand the concepts and approaches to solving biological problems. The take-home questions, which make up the vast majority of the grade, can sometimes be difficult (especially if lecture was boring and you drifted off...) so be prepared for that - however, if you have the initiative and the time, you are free to ask anyone or consult any resource, so there's always a way to figure it out."
