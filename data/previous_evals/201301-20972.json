    "Recommended.",
    "Yes. It's really helpful to those who will use numerical methods in their research fields.",
    "Very useful for engineering students. Needs some programming knowledge to successfully complete this course. And definitely recommend this course to anyone with interests in discrete mathematics and engineering.This course might be of less value to mathematics students who are generally more interested in abstract concepts, which I believe are not the only solution to engineering problems. It is very hard to come up with a precise mathematical model for some complex engineering problems, and it is even harder (more impossible) to solve those problems analytically. We need numerical tools like those taught in this class to perform those tasks.",
    "Yes, I would recommend it.",
    "I would recommend this class to fellow students. It was very informative and I learned a lot from the course.",
    "It's not an easy course and even a little time-consuming, but I'm sure you will learn a lot through this course. I recommend it! I think this course is very useful for the future research of engineering students.",
    "I would not recommend this course to students without solid coding and math background, and if someone is not patient on doing the homework, it would be better for he\/she not the take this course. However, if the students don't mind deal with tedious homework and would like to learn something about the numerical method, this course is their best choice.",
    "I recommend this course because the quality of the course is quite high.",
    "This course is an overview of general solution techniques for ODEs and PDEs focusing on both the theoretical considerations (assumptions, derivation, etc.) as well as practical implementation (code) of the algorithms.I would recommend this to students who will be using computation or simulation in their research. The course provides a foundation that exposes students to basic ideas and allows students to understand algorithms better when they are encountered during their research."

   "comments": [
    "Useful for modeling work",
    "I learn a lot from this course about numerical methods, which I was not very familiar with before.",
    "It is definitely useful in a lot of sense.As an engineering student, I have learned to solve problems numerically using programming and numerical methods.As a person who is interested in data and analysis, I realized computers are not as powerful as we thought. They have limitations such as memory and computational limitations. If we want to get the best of it, we need to seriously consider how we could optimize and reduce memory usage as well as computational cost.",
    "Excellent course.",
    "In my research, I have and will encounter non-linear differential equations. This course provided me with the knowledge and skills to be able to solve differential equations. The course also provided fundamental knowledge about the derivation and development of numerical methods that I can apply in the future. More specifically, concepts such as LDE, GDE, computational cost, and others are universal, and thanks to this course, it will be easier for me to understand numerical methods not covered by this class when I will need them in the future.",
    "1. I learnt basic concept of numerical method and also many ways to solve different type of ODE\/PDE, I believe it will be helpful for my future work and study.2. My programming style got improved. Now when programming, I will not only just focus on the function implementation, but also pay great attention on the efficiency.",
    "Helped to understand better how many of the algorithms function that are currently being used in my research. Although it does not have a direct effect on the outcome of my dissertation, it helped to shape my thinking on practical implementation of numerical methods that are currently being used and adapted."
