    "I would recommend it, but be aware that it is time-consuming, you will undergo much suffering, and if you aren't Prof. Reed's favorite, you may end up having more than a miserable time. However, the studio is a great place to bond with other people who care a lot about art. I made a lot of great friends because we would stay up late at night working in the studio together, with music playing. I really enjoyed spending time in the studio and would highly recommend a studio course such as this.",
    "This is THE BEST COURSE YOU CAN TAKE AT YALE.If you care about art, want to grow, and want a challenge, this is the course for you. Prof. Reed is so devoted, so smart, and such a talented teacher. The class is very hard and requires a lot of work. There were plenty of times that I was painting in the studio at 3 am, even though I'd been there since noon. The course attracts devoted artists, so you really need to throw yourself into the work if you're going to take on the course.This class will change your life. It changed mine.",
    "This is one of the best classes at Yale--however, ONLY take this class if you really, really love painting or if you want to be an art major. If you do decide to take it, you will learn an absolute ton and will get to spend 6 hours a week in a really creative, inspiring class atmosphere. Be warned: there is a ton of work (I was often in the studio for 2+ hours a day), but if you have a good attitude and love to paint, you will really get a lot out of the class.",
    "If you want to get better at painting, take this class. It is one of the most work-intensive courses you will take, but you get what you put in to the class. The class is incredibly close-knit and encouraging, and everyone in the class improved.",
    "Introductory Painting is a fantastic class. The first half of the semester focuses on basic technical problems with paint such as edge manners and mark-making, while the second half (like Professor Reed's drawing class) allows students to choose and explore a subject\/idea of their choice. Don't be stubborn when Prof. Reed suggests something to you. You must listen to Robert Reed's suggestions even if it means making a lot of paintings. In the end if you trust Prof. Reed you will learn a lot. Don't resent making a sufficient amount of work. It turns out this is the best way to learn about art-making. Overall I recommend you go in with a good attitude and get excited that you'll be spending a lot of time in the studio.*Be prepared to spend a decent amount of money",
    "yes as long as you are serious about art.",
    "YES!!! Take it! The studio is a great place to be. You will do a lot of work, but if you enjoy painting it is a great use of time.",
    "I would recommend the course to any other student, whether or not they intend to major in art.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone who is even remotely interested in art. For potential art majors, Robert Reed is someone you really need to take a class from before you graduate, and this was my favorite course that he teaches. For those who are interested in art but not seriously pursuing it, this class is an interesting glimpse into what it means to create art and develop ideas visually. I would caution non-art majors that this class requires a lot of extra work, so only take it if you are dedicated to putting in the time and effort needed. It is definitely not an easy gut class."
