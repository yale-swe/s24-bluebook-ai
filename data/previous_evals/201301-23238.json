   "comments": [
    "Classes like this are the reason you came to Yale. Take it. And do the reading, don't sit there like a lump. (Read Moby-Dick over spring break...seriously. It's a big book, and not just because it's long.)",
    "I recommend Readings in American Literature with Deming. I felt a bit mixed about him as a professor but came to like him a lot; he did a masterful job of creating a reading list that built on itself, and gave me a sense of working towards larger conclusions over the semester. For the most part, the readings are quite enjoyable. 5 essays was a lot but manageable. Deming has a definite style he likes to see in writing, so once you figure that out, the papers aren't bad.",
    "RECOMMEND ABSOLUTELY. ABSOLUTELY. MUST TAKE before leaving Yale.",
    "This class is a memorable and strong exploration of some foundational texts of American literature. The class focused on various types of literature - including poetry, short stories, essays, and novels - and didn't feel too rushed or condensed. If you get a chance to take this with Professor Deming, do it. He isa professor that will challenge you in your writing, will help you improve as both a writer and a thinker, and will lead discussions in a welcoming and rewarding manner. The readings were great, the discussion never dragged, and the professor was top notch - definitely worth taking.",
    "This class was a ton of work--easily spent 10-15 hours on each essay. But it was really rewarding as well, as long as you're willing to put the time in. Also, realize the full implications of reading Moby-Dick. It's 600+ pages and awful.",
    "Do whatever you can to take this class.",
    "English 127 05 was a great course. It's a decent amount of reading and writing, not so much that you feel overwhelmed, but enough that you feel like you're learning a lot. The texts lend themselves to a lot of high level discussion. The class drew from a lot of different genres across American history from transcendentalism to postmodernism. If you like English and want to delve deeper into American literature, definitely take it!",
    "Absolutely take this course! This is the best course I have taken at Yale - the texts are great, and Deming is amazing. He is one of those rare professors who makes you want to do your very best work.",
    "Maybe. I would not take this class again because I realizes that I really don't enjoy writing literary analysis papers. If you do like that, I say definitely take this class! And take it with Deming!! He is amazing! If you don't like that, then maybe look into other writing credits.",
    "Highly recommended for anyone interested in reading monumental American works."
