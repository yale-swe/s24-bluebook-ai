    "SPAN 140 is the next step in the series. It's intensive but it really hones in on the skills that comprise a competent Spanish speaker. I would recommend it to any student that is at this stage in the development of their language skills.",
    "It is more work than L3, but you learn a lot and it is pretty fun.",
    "Yes, I think it is a great way to improve your spanish skills and really enjoyed the class!",
    "Definitely recommend taking this class with Professor Asensio-Manrique.",
    "Span 140 02 is an enjoyable way to learn Spanish here at Yale. I would recommend the class to other students because the workload is manageable, the curriculum is interesting, and I feel like I genuinely became a better spanish speaker throughout the course of the semester. I never enjoyed taking language class at my high school, however, I found Span 140 to be a productive and great way to spend my mornings learning Spanish.",
    "Standard Spanish class. A lot of grammar and vocabulary. Engaging culture and art activities."
