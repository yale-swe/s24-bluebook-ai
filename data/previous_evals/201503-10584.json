    "A great chance to read Csaire closely and get a feel for teaching the material. Yes, I would recommend the class, whether or not Professor Miller chooses to continue teaching it as a student-run seminar.",
    "I think the syllabus provides an accurate summary. I would recommend it for the general experience - particularly that of having to teach a seminar. I remain in two minds about Csaire, but that is perhaps a subjective response."

   "comments": [
    "The course \"deepened\" my knowledge in a few ways: we read a lot of poetry, which is something I haven't gotten much of at Yale; my knowledge of Caribbean francophone literature was rather poor before the class; I had never taught a two-hour seminar, so pedagogically speaking the class provided me with useful skills for the profession.",
    "The experience of teaching literature was very useful, as highlighted above. When it comes to writing a prospectus, having done a comprehensive survey of a single author may come in useful as a model of how to focus in on a single author or topic."
