    "With all the vocabulary words that we needed to memorize, I learned how to use Quizlet effectively.",
    "I learned to speak much more fluently; I better understand french listening and to pick up keywords from audio programs.",
    "I am now confident in my ability to write, speak, read, and understand the French language. Yale's program is very effective, if a lot of work. I'm glad that I can read French novels and watch French films now.",
    "I improved my French reading and listening skills a lot by taking this course. I also learned a lot of new vocabulary.",
    "A much greater understanding of the basics of the language",
    "Greatly improved French writing, reading, speaking, and listening ability",
    "This course gave me a lot of valuable practice in using and understanding the French language, and developed skills in grammar and comprehension.",
    "Reading, writing, listening!"

   "comments": [
    "The class revolves around the daily homework assignments. These are usually two 15-30 minutes audio recordings that cover grammar, the novel w'ere reading and some other stuff. I like that it's all in French. I get to practice my listening skills daily making it easier for me to mimic the sounds. However, it DID NOT help me with grammar, at all. The placement test focuses a lot on reading comprehension. I think I was placed in L3 because I could read and understand what was going on in a given passage. We did not spend anytime doing this in class. Sure we read a couple of books, but you could have passed the tests without reading them. All you had to do was do the homework and memorize the character descriptions from the audio recordings. So my greatest skill was useless, it wasn't really tested. I suffered with grammar because we covered the material too fast. It seemed more like a review more than anything else. The audio recordings go about grammar in a weird way.",
    "The audio programs can sometimes feel more tedious and less conducive to more learning or even settling of ideas. I would sometimes just get really demotivated by the amount of work that felt menial was there but the exams were nicely made and were really helpful in seeing my progress and such. The one section of the exam that I do not agree with is the vocabulary section which, often times, I would know all the words but because of the sheer amount of them, recalling them would get a bit hard. Strengths were meeting everyday, the personal atmosphere of the class and the literary material that we were given.",
    "I think the Yale French program has the structure of these courses down to a T and that they are perfect.",
    "The small seminar style of this course helps with improving one's speaking, but I still found the class too large to have productive discussions, sometimes.",
    "I thought overall it was a great course but could be improved by more directed discussions about the literature to actually improve our intellectual understanding as well as just basic french discussion.",
    "the tests were impossible to understand, as the audio was always muffled.",
    "The instruction was terrific because it was varied. In the homework and classes, we had discussions, lectures on grammar, listening and dictation exercises, writing practices etc that all helped develop different French skills. The only issue of the course was how vocabulary was tested. Each unit had 40-80 terms from the reading or film that student's were asked to learn for the exams. The exams consisted of a sentence that was read aloud with one word missing--the vocab word students had to recall. The essential problem with this format is that in addition to testing whether students understand the meaning of the word, it tests students ability to recall which words were assigned. Being forced to remember which 80 arbitrary words might be tested does not seem to be a useful skill, and can lead the best student--one who may know the meaning and how to perfectly use every word on the list--to lose significant points. This issue could probably be solved with a word bank.",
    "Having the course every day was good because it held me accountable for practicing the language. Because of this, I think my skills greatly improved. I enjoyed the selected texts and felt comfortable in the teaching style of the course in general as well as the teaching knowledge of the instructor.",
    "It is a lot of work--so much so that I often just didn't do it at all. Further the tests are very difficult and particularly the vocabulary sections seemed somewhat unfair. Strengths of this course are that I feel like a much better french speaker, writer, and listener."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend any student to take a foreign language. For this course in particular I just don't like how they teach grammar. I would prefer if they emphasized how to speak better.",
    "Yes, very much so. This class is perfect for increased fluency and practice in french, along with meeting and learning new material.",
    "You probably have to take this course to fulfill your language requirement but it is pretty enjoyable and you watch good films and read good books. It is a very heavy daily workload and I defiantly fell further and further and further behind on daily homework, but if you do do it it is apparently very helpful. Solid class but hard as all languages are.",
    "I would recommend this course to someone who wanted to learn French - I think the French department at Yale has a very good system in place to teach a lot of language skills quickly.",
    "I feel that the format of this course helped me become comfortable with the language more so than other courses in French I have taken previously, and for that reason I would recommend this course to other students.",
    "Of course--french is amazing and I improved a lot!"
