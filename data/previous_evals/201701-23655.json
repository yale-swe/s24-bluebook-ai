    "Strengths are the teachers' dedication and patience when teaching Spanish a weakness or a part I personally see no benefit in is the culture learning.",
    "Strengths--great teachers Weaknesses-- sometimes moves too quickly on grammar subjects",
    "While the course claims to be at an elementary level it is designed for students who already have experience with the language. To take more time going over grammatical points and initially explaining them in english would also be helpful.",
    "I think too much material is covered in what should be an introductory class. It should focus more on building a strong basis in grammar, and less on vocabulary about weddings.",
    "It moves very fast, which makes it difficult to process and implement the information we are learning.",
    "Strengths: the variety and utility of activities each class; the conversational nature of the class; the trust the teacher put in us towards understanding instruction in Spanish Weaknesses: Went a bit fast - more review would help solidify knowledge of grammar and vocabulary",
    "There should not have been a test the day after we came back from spring break, we should have been tested on the material before we left."

   "comments": [
    "Yes because I think Spanish is an important language to learn and the teachers here, well at least at my teacher, really facilitate the learning process. You get a lot of feedback on speaking, writing and reading. The only downside is the amount of reading practice our homework assignments felt more like busy-work except for the cat story that was the best assignment by far.",
    "Definitely would recommend. Grading is fair, and you actually learn Spanish.",
    "I would, but explain to them that it is set at a very accelerated pace.",
    "Yes, especially if it is taught by Professor Alexandrov.",
    "Absolutely",
    "Yes, good for a language requirement."
