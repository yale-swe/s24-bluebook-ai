    "I learned a lot of calculus that I didn't get the first go-around in Calc BC back in high school.",
    "I learned how to use the skills given in class to solve problems even if they didn't directly say use this method.",
    "I definitely increased my knowledge in calculus skills, especially in the areas of differential equations and finding convergent\/divergent functions.",
    "A more complete understanding of calculus",
    "I feel like I understand the mathematical techniques we learned rather than just memorized how to do them. For example, in high school we learned how to find the volume of rotated solids, but we were just taught the formulas for specific methods. In this class, we were taught how to find the volume of any solid. I also learned a lot of material I was never exposed to before.",
    "Basic understanding of calc 2.",
    "Basic Calculus tools.",
    "Knowledge in basic calculus.",
    "I have acquired a better understanding how to approach various math problems, as well as gained critical thinking skills.",
    "I learned to apply integration to broader concepts.",
    "I became comfortable with integration, sequences and series. I also got a good introduction to differential equations.",
    "I learned how to do calculus."

   "comments": [
    "I really am not sure whether the flipped classroom method works better than a lecture scenario, but I did appreciate the flexibility it gave me in learning the material.",
    "I think the Canvas videos could be better and in class we could do less proofs.",
    "I think the structure of this class is really well done. The flipped classroom allows for exposure to the material before it is taught and then it is explained in detail in class. I think the exams were challenging as the questions asked were the \"exception\" type problems.",
    "The class was too early. I like how the class offered both in class, and online resources for learning.",
    "I liked the overall design of the class--watching videos\/reading the textbook before class and then having the opportunity to ask questions and practice what we learned in class. However, the videos were not always as helpful as they could've been. I found reading the textbook way more helpful. I would always watch the videos anyway, but sometimes it felt like a waste of time.",
    "The flipped classroom was difficult and the class seemed to presume that you had taken calculus 2 before.",
    "They did a good job making sure you understood the topics, the test were jut a lot harder then anything we did in class.",
    "I feel that certain topics are not gone into enough detail.",
    "Strengths: material is covered well and problem sets are helpful weaknesses: exams do not always reflect the mastery of material (they are too difficult and are graded harshly)",
    "I personally enjoyed the fact that the class was \"flipped\" because it allowed me to notice problem areas before class. Instead of teaching the material all over again, we focused on the trouble areas we had.",
    "I think the flipped nature of the course is a weakness. The theory of getting introduced to general concepts by watching the videos but they were often confusing and the practice questions difficult. I wish we did more practice questions similar to what we would be tested on during class. My professor was very helpful and always willing to explain things and answer questions.",
    "I wish the grading system was more transparent. The question of whether things were curved or not was always kind of vague, and in a class with such high enrollment they could've been clearer about grade distribution. I also hated the prep problem quizzes. They were only a couple of points, but getting graded on a strategy you'd only just been introduced to was actually really stressful--even with six attempts, I could usually only get half credit or so, which adds up. And since we went over the exact same strategy from the video the next day in class (when we could actually ask questions and get things clarified) I didn't really see the point. I think grading the prep problems for completion rather than correctness would be more helpful."

    "This is a straightforward calculus course; nothing incredibly interesting or revolutionary.",

    "Yes, i hadn't taken a math class In a couple years and it really helped me realize how much I enjoy and appreciate math.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class! I never at any point felt overwhelmed. The psets were tricky at times, but if you don't put them off until the last minute they are totally doable.",
    "This class is hard and challenging but necessary to move onto higher level math classes.",
    "Only if you have to take it.",
    "I would recommend it as long as you're interested in the subject and willing to work hard. Brett Smith is an amazing teacher and class was always fun and engaging!",
