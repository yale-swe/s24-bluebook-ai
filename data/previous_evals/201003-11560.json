    "The last two classes.",

    "Elliott's expansive knowledge of environmental law, lawmaking, and policymaking (as former general counsel of EPA), as well as his perspective as a current practitioner.",
    "The lectures are very good and though-provoking.",
    "Extremely well qualified instructor, engaging and interesting lectures, bright and informed fellow students, and excellent text book.",
    "The professor is very engaging and has been directly involved with many of the statutes. He also comes at it from a very moderate point of view.",
    "An opportunity to receive direct input and critique from two very knowlegable legal professors.",
    "Discussion in class and in the readings of how different developments in environmental law connect.",
    "The text book was excellent and I learned a great deal about a few large environmental laws and also about environmental regulations generally. Professor Elliott is well prepared, well spoken, and very knowledgeable. I would recommend this course to any FES student."

   "comments": [
    "Elliott tried to get two classes per week instead of one three-hour block. This certainly would have been preferable.",
    "The in class exercises could have been better structured.",
    "Stream-of-consciousness lecture style can sometimes be difficult to follow.",
    "I felt that we often spent too much time going over the particulars of environmental statutes. Perhaps that was valuable for the law students but I was hoping to cover more topics and discuss law and regulation more generally. Instead we were often mired in the particulars of a given law, some of which were irrelevant to me."

   "comments": [
    "The law that underpins the political environmental framework is not something an FES student must learn, according the curriculum, but it is something every FES student certainly should learn. This class, by working through the major environmental statutes of the seventies, offers perspective on how the legislative, judicial, and administrative machinery thinks about environmental issues and enacts environmental remedies.",
    "Being interested in law, this course was a no-brainer and absolutely vital to my program of study.",
    "The legal content complements my environmental interests, and my specific research topic was on point with my overal program.",
    "This was my first exposure to law and regulations and I have found it useful for every other class I have taken. I plan to work in environmental policy and as such found this course invaluable for understanding how environmental laws work and are made."

   "comments": [
    "There were advantages in bouncing ideas off others, having them assit on my sections, and me reviewing their parts. The hardest part is coordinating our work schedules. Also, our group paper did not go in the exact direction that it would have if I was doing it alone. It was more polished and comprehensive, but the content of the paper was not in my total control."

    "Get an outline from somebody who has already taken the class, and use this to inform the reading as you do it. There is much to read, and focusing attention would be helpful.",
    "B\/c the final is the only grade, it's very easy to fall behind in reading. Thisis dangerous b\/c there is an enormous amount of it, and it's hardly possible to simply put it off until the week before the final.",
    "Start you paper early, and push your client for information. Although they are the ones that you are working for, the final paper has the students name on it and it it how you are graded, so take control and don't let your path be totally dictated.",
    "Be prepared for a LOT of reading - but it's a really interesting class and well worth taking."
