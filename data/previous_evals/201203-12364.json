   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend it as an easy 5th class. Not necessary to be an architecture major to get a lot out of the course. One 12 page paper and a 4 minute presentation is about all of the work required. The reading isn't super necessary.",
    "ARCH 341 is a great class to take. The class provides an interesting perspective on how to think about different types of systems, and the logistics that must be considered.",
    "The course's strength was also its weakness. In trying to tackle everything, it at times failed to address many things adequately. I greatly enjoyed the lectures and Prof Easterling always presented interesting material. However, the connection to the readings was somewhat ambiguous. Admittedly, the sections were meant to link the two, but the link was extremely difficult to make. All in all, I enjoyed the course and it made me think. But, after 15 weeks participating in it, I'm not sure what I have left with. A stronger structure would be nice, but I'm frankly not sure whether it exists.I would recommend the class to a student who is dedicated to learning about the topic and engaging with the material. This semester, it could easily have been a class where you slide by without much effort. But if you delve into the topics, you stand to gain a great deal from Prof Easterling and the issues she presents.",
    "I have NO. IDEA. what this class was about. And I went to about 98% of the lectures.In all seriousness, though, it's a great Cr\/D: ludicrously abstract but potentially intriguing\/though-provoking if you want to dig through to try and find the point of it all. Basically like going to story time twice a week, and I'll certainly remember some of the things we talked about--I just wish I knew why we talked about half of it.",
    "one paper due at the end of the semester",
    "A bizarre blend of architecture, sociology, history, and political science - definitely take it if you're into learning an alternative history of the systems that make up the world.",
    "You learn about the relationship between architecture and infrastructural tech, culture, and politics. You read a super wide range of readings, Keller has perfectly times lectures with tons of visuals, though you inevitable stay superficial with such a huge range of topics. You are expected to care and to want to pursue things in the paper and in section.",
    "Globalization Space teaches you about a lot of things happening in the world that you never fully knew about or understood. I started out very enthusiastic about the course, but lectures grew increasingly repetitive and the lack of factual information was frustrating. I wish we delved more into how these spaces and networks work specifically, possibly bringing in more politics and less theory.",
    "It depends on what you're looking for: it's not a class of hard facts, but much more theoretical and larger picture thinking. This class provides an alternate perspective that you can use to approach your own studies.",
    "Interesting fun facts. Makes you think about the way the world works, but don't be hoping for too many concrete explanations.",
    "Yes take it. You'll learn a lot about the modern world in way you never imagined.",
    "No. I payed attention in class and did all the readings, but I still didn't get what this class was about and how all the different topics that we discussed are related to each other. Professor Easterling is a great writer, but when she starts talking, it's impossible to understand what she means to say. Moreover, the course was stressful, because the only requirement was the final paper, which we received very little guidance on.",
    "Take it! This is a wonderful and interesting course to take as an undergraduate. Professor Easterling is a great lecturer, makes class interesting, section is just discussing the readings and is very chill."
