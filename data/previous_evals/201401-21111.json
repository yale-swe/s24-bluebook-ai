   "comments": [
    "Solid core bio class. Don't take if you can't stay awake in the mornings, though.",
    "Your normal Mol Bio class. Not easy, not terribly hard. Do the work and you'll be fine.",
    "You basically learn everything there is to know about DNA and RNA. There's a lot of information, and it's useful if you're interested in biology moreso than premed. Genetics is probably more relevant than premed. Three midterms and weekly research paper article summaries is basically the structure of the class. The midterms were bad though, they were real bad. If you don't have to take it, don't take it. If it's this or genetics, then that's a tough choice. Cell bio is definitely better though",
    "This class was interesting, but required a lot of memorization. Sometimes it wasn't so easy deciding which topics were worth focusing on while studying. However, course content was very good and professors were very approachable.",
    "See number 1",
    "Molecular Biology is an overview of DNA and RNA figure processes at a more specific level than in AP Bio. There is a focus on listing steps and knowing enzymes and other factors, which makes the exams a bit frustrating, and between being at 9am and reading off of PowerPoints it's sometimes hard to pay attention during lecture. There are only three exams (no final) plus weekly assignments from reading papers, and the exams generally don't cover the textbook reading. I've heard from other people who have taken Cell Bio (MCDB 205) that Cell Bio is more work but is more rewarding as an intro\/intermediate bio class, but I would recommend Mol Bio if you're looking for something fairly low-key.",
    "A better option than genetics, and an okay course.",
    "it's easy once you take some other bio courses. better than dev and genetics",
    "I went in taking the class because I had to, and left pleasantly surprised at the amount that I learned. The course has improved in structure and material in the last few years",
    "Pretty interesting class on molecular biology. It would be hard to recommend it to a student that wasn't majoring in biology.",
    "A challenging course but worth it. There was a LOT of material covered but it was really interesting and was definitely a good introduction to the world of molecular biology. Be prepared to put in a lot of time (read the book!) and you will learn loads. Reading the research papers for section was a valuable learning experience."
