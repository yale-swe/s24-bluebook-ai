    "English 125 with Professor Nicholson was great because we read such amazing literature, but I could also tell how much my skills of analysis and writing increased throughout the semester. I would highly recommend Professor Nicholson's section, as she helps to create interesting discussion but also greatly improves one individual skills. If a student was interested in the English major, I think Professor Nicholson's class is the right section to take.",
    "-pretty difficult but forms important foundation for future english classes-would recommend for potential english majors",
    "Yes! These poets are amazing. Professor Nicholson is amazing. An important educational experience for any lover of literature.",
    "I feel like I'm repeating myself but YOU MUST TAKE THIS CLASS. WITH THIS PROFESSOR. It made me question everything I came to Yale thinking I'd take and seriously consider dropping everything to become an English major.",
    "Take it if you're into really analyzing things. If you have the tendency to think that some parts of English are just made up and subjective, then maybe this class isn't for you.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class. Take English 125, and definitely take it with Cathy Nicholson.",
    "Approach it with an open mind. It was difficult for me at first, having a limited interest in poetry, but I grew to appreciate it."
