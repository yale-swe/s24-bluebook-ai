   "comments": [
    "Probably not- good as an easy 5th credit but still kind of a waste of time. I'm sure it would be much better as a seminar.",
    "I would take it if you know very little about HIV\/AIDS. For the most part, the readings were really great. I especially enjoyed the novels and memoirs.",
    "HIV\/AIDS in absolutely worth taking. It introduces the social problems surrounding the epidemic in Africa and changes the way you think about the disease. The reading is definitely manageable and truly very interesting. I would recommend this class to everyone.",
    "I would definitely recommend it! I learned a lot. The papers were interesting to write. It was well organized and had interesting section.",
    "This class used to be a seminar, and this was the first year it was a lecture. Lectures were pretty dull- I think Professor Reid may be more accustomed to teaching seminars? He still had a lot of valuable experience and information to offer, though. The readings were really interesting, and overall this is a subject I think everyone should study. The class really opened my eyes to the gravity of the situation in sub-Saharan Africa. AIDS in Africa is an extremely important thing to learn about, and so relevant because it is happening right now.One note- I think section makes a big difference in this class. Because lectures were a little slow, my section really made up for it. I got lucky with a really great TA and group of students.",
    "Take it. Loved it.",
    "I would only recommend this class to students interested in the enthnographic study of HIVand AIDS. You will absolutely dread class if the material is not enough to keep you interested. I find that it is harder to learn and to succeed in a course where things seem to be lagging. The student who enrolls in this course must be proactive about making the course the best experience possible for them. I have many friends who shopped this class and hated Professor Reid's lecture style, and, in my opinion, they missed out on a great course. But if it's not for you, then it's not for you. I just say shop it and read through the syllabus to see whether you like it.",
    "For those with a strong interest in the topic, yes!",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student because it is such an important topic.",
    "Yes definitely.",
    "Highly recommended. Great way to learn about something that everyone MUST learn about.",
    "Good intro. First couple weeks are interesting and the rest is just a repeat of the same info with different case studies. Lecture is mostly a waste of time.",
    "pretty good if you are interested in HIV\/AIDS in particular or Africa. the readings were really interesting and manageable although weren't totally connected with lecture. good guest speakers although they sometimes don't talk about things related to the class.",
    "Yes I definitely recommend it. HIV\/AIDS is something everyone should be aware of.",
    "It is only after I've taken the course that I realized how little I know about Africa in general. The course enables us to understand much more about the cultural and social aspect of the disease, as well as the individual's own understanding of HIV\/AIDS. I truly enjoyed all the readings, and we have great guest speakers from AIDS doctors to AIDS activists. I will surely recommend this course.",
    "I would highly recommend this class to a wide variety of students; anyone interested in Africa, public health, cultural anthropology, and sociology would appreciate and gain insight from this course.",
    "would highly recommend, great class.",
    "Only take it if it becomes a seminar again. Lecture is bad but the readings are great.",
    "No; not unless it is a seminar again or has been vastly restructure or you are deeply interested\/devoted to the material. It is a perfect class to take CR\/D though."
