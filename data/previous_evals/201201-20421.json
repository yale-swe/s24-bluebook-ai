   "comments": [
    "I would not recommend this class to another graduate student. I think overall my pre-existing knowledge of most of the topics over qualified me for the class. It might be a good class for undergraduates to take, though I think it needs considerably more oversight and organization to generate a more cohesive structure amongst the different professors.",
    "broad overview into topics - learn a lot of detail into these topics since the course is broken up into different professor's lectures that specialize in the topic",
    "Informative class, a bit too fast-paced and not in-depth enough. Guest lecturers interesting.",
    "Yes - an interesting survey style course that covers a lot of what it promises to cover.",
    "This course addresses several broad topics in the biological sciences, ranging from environmental remediation to the development of treatment for HIV\/AIDS, with specific emphasis on the tools and methods available to the scientists pursuing such goals.I hesitantly recommend this course to other students because of the value of learning about such tools and techniques. Whether they will use these techniques in their own research, or are just curious as to what's out there, the course will be of great benefit. My reservation comes not from the material but from some of the lecturers who delivered this material."

    "It did not. I was way too over-prepared for this course and I wish my DGS had discouraged me from taking it.",
    "Helped increase understanding of molecular cell bio techniques.",
    "I learned a lot about disparate technologies that I probably wouldn't have learned about otherwise... but there could have been more material.",
    "I liked the course because it went over current and upcoming technology that could be used for my experiments. It gave me ideas on what I could do for my experiments and ways to approach different questions.",
    "The course brought insight into techniques that are invaluable to those in biological research, yet was also useful simply by stimulating thought as to how existing methods might be improved in the future."
