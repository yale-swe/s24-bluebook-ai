   "comments": [
    "This course offered an excellent intoduction to conducting original historical research. Our only assignment (aside from an in class presentation) was a term paper which we were expected to complete in parts: first a list of topics, then a proposal, a draft, and a final draft. At each stage, I received substantial feedback that helped me narrow my focus and the scope of my research. The paper required that we balance close primary source analysis with proper contextualizatiom via secondary source material. The books that we read each week for class provided strong examples of the sort of writing we were expected to achieve in our papers.",
    "I practiced skills of primary source research and writing. By stretching our final project over the course of the entire semester, we were able to reflect on and practice skills of research, project proposals, writing drafts, editing, and producing more polished final papers. The reading was also focused enough for us to learn many of the arguments and facts of the United States history of forced labor early on. This allowed us to be able to analyze methodologies and arguments of later books. In all, the class was useful in identifying historical connections to modern day systems of forced labor and imprisonment.",
    "I got better at reading quickly, and synthesizing a lot of info in a short amount of time. Also, honed research and research writing skills.",
    "I loved this class! Learned a lot about neoslavery in the South as well as how to have a respectful seminar conversation about challenging topics.",
    "I learned a TON about a subject that I thought I knew way more about than I actually did. While slavery studies are well incorporated in most American school systems, we don't talk nearly as much about the forced labor and prison systems that build the foundation of modern American racial and socioeconomic divides. The coursework was extremely interesting and I also really improved in my critical reading, discussion, and writing skills."

   "comments": [
    "The primary strength of the course was the scaffolding that was done for the term paper, which we completed in several well defined stages. Professor Ingram provided remarkably specific feedback at each stage. Another strength of the course was its focus on more recent scholarship that questions the assumptions upon which earlier scholarship was predicated. The primary weakness of the course was the lack of rigor and specificity in class discussions. Although we were expected to read a book every week, I do not think it unreasonable to ask students to cite specific page numbers of passages when making comments. Too often I felt the conversation in class failed to analyze the specific examples presented in the text. I also felt that conversation about contemporary matters dominated too many of our discussions; this is not to say what is happening now isn't relevant to what happened in the Jim Crow era, but why not focus on the scholarship right in front of us and leave contemporary discussion to the last bit of class?",
    "The class had a wonderful reading list and created a stretched out schedule for writing our final papers. I wish I knew the grades I recieved on my earlier assignments before I wrote the final so i could get a sense of how I was doing in the class. The professor was ver good at providing quick comments on our work and met with us many times. I also wish there were more guidelines for our weekly presentations. Sometimes they were summaries that ran very long, and other times they were short and the student led the discussion for the rest of class. While it did not unduly effect how I presented, I wish we had more consistency with those presentations. I also wish we had focused on systems of forced labor like sharecropping. Most of the class focused on the early twentieth century. I would have liked to see more connections to contemporary times.",
    "Can't think of a single weakness, which is telling. The reading schedule is somewhat brutal if you've got a bunch of other coursework, but that's normal for a higher-level history seminar. Prof. Ingram is fantastic, the discussion is engaging and enlightening, and at the end of the day I felt as if my eyes had been opened to a part of American history I'd never been able to see before.",
    "A book a week is too much! It should be excerpts that we can really focus on and delve deeply into.",
    "Sometimes discussion was limited by people who did not do the reading and instead just tried to divert the conversation to tangential topics they knew about. Otherwise, however, I loved the course, my classmates, and the readings\/discussions.",
    "Strengths - reading selections were awesome, discussions were awesome, prof was awesome Weaknesses - heavy reading, so important to budget time well in the course"

   "comments": [
    "This course features texts that present an important counternarrative to much of the scholarship done on the Jim Crow era until very recently. This counternarrative, in the end, might need a corrective of its own, but for anyone who wishes to engage with it, I can imagine few better settings at Yale to do so. Professor Ingram is an able discussion leader and an even better guide for the final research paper. Seek out her feedback frequently, as her comments are often incisive. Sometimes class discussion veered away from the text and towards contemporary issues a little too often, but this can be easily corrected. An excellent first History seminar, if you haven't taken one yet (though obviously worth taking if you are interested in these issues, no matter your class year).",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone who is interested in the historical progressions that led to today's criminal justice system and institutions of forced labor. The class is particularly interesting if you would like to track the criminalization of blackness through time.",
    "In a heartbeat.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to another student. Great readings. Great discussions. And Professor Ingram is amazing! It's a lot of reading each week but only one paper so very manageable.",
    "Definitely take this course if you can!!! It is a really cool topic and a really important area of study, and the way that the course explores it through primary and secondary literature is so well done. The professor was awesome and discussions were always super thought-provoking."
