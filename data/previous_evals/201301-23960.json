    "Harmonic Analysis on Graphs was an awesome class. Basically, the whole idea of the subject is to think of some processes as diffusion-like processes, or some distributions as steady states of diffusion processes. Then the discrete approximation to a diffusion process is a random walk on a graph, according to affinities based on the distance between the points. The class is then about exploring the link between the discrete and continuous, considering different formulations of the problem, and interesting results. It's incredible how many different fields the class draws from. The class incorporates ideas from stochastic calculus, spectral theory, differential geometry, information theory, and signal processing. And then you get to see this stuff applied successfully to very real problems. Definitely take this class!",
    "This class is a good summary of the application of diffusion maps and other sophisticated methods of harmonic analysis to the analysis of discrete empirical data. If you plan to do anything in the real world, this would probably be a useful class to take and understand. I recommend this class to anyone who can follow the math.",
    "I recommend the class. It gave me a taste of what I should know"
