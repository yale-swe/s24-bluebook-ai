    "Good range of topics covered, but not nearly enough depth and content for a graduate level course. Since the class is a graduate level class, I was expecting the professor to be an expert in the topic area, but it became clear that he was not. Towards the second half of the semester, the material petered out and we spent too much class time figuring out project logistics. Improve the course by spending more time on the fundamentals (don't be afraid to go through mathematical derivations and thermodynamics). Flesh out each of the topics more. Perhaps present recent publications. It would be helpful to prepare and share a syllabus with each class date and topic to be covered on that date, to help with class organization. Also, I don't think it's fair (or within GSAS policy) for the TA to grade projects\/presentations\/papers since these are qualitative assessments.",
    "There was a wealth of material, but it was presented in a generally effective manner. Each topic was discussed with a good amount of depth, without going into too much unnecessary detail. The range of topics was appropriate and broad enough to give a good general understanding of many properties and applications."
