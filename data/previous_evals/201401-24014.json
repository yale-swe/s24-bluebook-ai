It is so helpful that she is currently practicing - it makes everything we are learning feel that much more relevant.12: This was perhaps one of the best courses I took at FES.

Great classroom dynamic conducive to learning that isn't about wrote memorization. Very useful approach and information.",
    "Instructor was very approachable",
    "The professor is engaging and enthusiastic, and fosters an environment for discussion that is helpful in gaining an appreciation for the subject of land use law and environmental planning. Her ability to use real-world current examples from her own work really brings the material together, and guest lecturers were both informative and interesting.",

    "The professor seemed quite biased and subjective in her explanations of law.",
    "We got behind a bit on the syllabus, so it wasn't always clear which cases we would be discussing on which day.",
    "The pace of class was too slow. More effort to work through the cases at a regular pace would have been helpful.More background material in basic legal and land use law fundamentals would have been helpful as well.",
    "Syllabus needs a better organization",
    "I learned a lot in this class and thoroughly enjoyed it, but I would have appreciated a slightly more organized approach to discussing the material. The syllabus for the class outlined a progression for subjects that would be covered, but in-class discussions were relatively loose and it was sometimes unclear when we were moving from one subject to another. Having case-based discussions in class was great, but I think it might have been improved by the addition of short lectures introducing each broad subject and providing some background as we moved through the topics.",
    "If it relied less on cases and had more of a framework in which to read those cases, it would be better, I believe. More organization and clearer goals about what is covered each session would be useful, and would probably allow for a deeper understanding of the subject."
