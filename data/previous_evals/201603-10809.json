   "comments": [
    "This course teaches students how to approach a research assignment, and is very helpful in guiding the early stages of thesis development. The assignments, though sometimes difficult at the time, were important later on in the process.",
    "This has been an excellent way to be introduced to long-term research. The early discussions about Evidence, Lit reviews, research questions, and IRB stuff all have been very helpful in helping me grasp what is needed\/expected for thesis research. I can't imagine what it would be like doing this for the first time on my own! The deadlines are also very helpful for ensuring I continue to work on it my thesis even though it is a full-year project.",
    "This course developed independent research skills as well as presentation and writing methods."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "As much as you may want to resist the exercise of writing a thesis, this course keep you going.",
    "This structure of this course is helpful in guiding the early stages of thesis development. Another strength is teaching students how to approach research questions and how to present material. Maybe one more small assignment before the December rough draft submission would have been nice. Completing these small assignments along the way made me feel more productive and less nervous about the magnitude of work ahead of me.",
    "I think the best thing about this is the amount of support you get from the faculty and the students. Being a small major, EVST is the perfect size of a major where yo don't get lost in the advising process. I don't think I could have done any of my current work to date without this kind of well-organized and structured system.",
    "Senior colloquium is fantastic and overall a great course. However, I feel that we jump right in to our senior essays and have to pick a topic very early on. It would be nice to have some time to develop the topic of our essay. The EVST faculty do recommend people select a topic over the summer but I think it would be helpful if that process had more guidance.",
    "The structure of the course is extremely helpful to organizing the research project. Breaking into smaller sections allowed for intimate feedback from instructors and peers. It might be improved by moving back to junior spring such that research opportunities fit more logically into the summer break."

   "comments": [
    "You have to take it.",
    "Yes, it is required of the environmental studies major! Even if it wasn't, I would recommend the course as it aids in your thesis development and keeps you more on track of this work than if you were doing it on your own.",
    "It is a required course for EVST majors, so not much choice there. But I would definitely recommend putting your all into this course because the returns are great.",
    "Choosing a research topic and narrowing in on a research question can be overwhelming as it really defines the rest of your senior year. However once things got rolling I found the writing to be quite rewarding--You will grow to become somewhat of an expert (or at least vey well-read) on your chosen topic. This colloquium is set up with deadlines to keep you on track and theoretically reduce the workload\/stress of 2nd semester, though realistically I doubt any of us will be cruising to the finish line come April. We met as a seminar group several times in the beginning of the year and then switched to individual meetings with one of the two advisors, which I found to be helpful. Amity and John are both full of thoughtful advice, but don't expect them to give you all the answers to your research challenges. One of the cool things about this project is that you're mostly on your own, from start to finish, in terms of figuring out how you want to conduct your study and organize your essay. It's painful, but I can already sense a lot of self-growth and confidence in my ability as an independent researcher.",
    "If you are an EVST senior you have to take it so...",
    "Absolutely! Senior colloquium is the best thing about EVST. It is challenging but rewarding and the weekly meetings are so fun.",
    "You have to take this course, but absolutely! It's a great course with solid feedback on your work.",
    "Yes- the small group setting is an extremely helpful way to build upon previous experience in the environmental studies major and work toward delivering a significant research project."
