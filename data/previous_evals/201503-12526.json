    "It's a good course. I really enjoy literature, so it was a lovely time for me, though there aren't really any bells and whistles to liven up the material if you don't already have an affinity for it. Some students in my class were excited about the material, but others were not, and I wouldn't recommend this course if you just want to fulfill a language requirement. If you want to get everything out of it, Profesora Byrne will definitely help and encourage you, but you get out of it what you put in to it. Also, it's a LOT of reading, and it really needs to be done. The class is very participative, so your other classmates and the Profesora will know if you don't do it. But, if you have an interest in literature, or if you're a Spanish major (in which case you have to do this one or 262), take it! It's a good time.",
    "Make sure you're willing to tackle some difficult Spanish in large quantities. If you are, this is a rewarding course. It's taught well and is surprisingly fun. I'd recommend it.",
    "Spanish 261 is an introductory course in old Spanish literature. I would recommend it to any student who was interested in gaining a general introduction to some of the more important old Spanish authors and who already had a basic level of proficiency in Spanish. The readings could sometimes be difficult, especially when we were reading old Spanish which often had very different spelling from modern Spanish.",
    "This is a good survey course and a great introduction to Spanish literature. It also functions as a general introduction to the cultural history of Spain. It is a worthwhile course for anyone interested in the literary origins of the Spanish speaking world. I greatly enjoyed the course",
    "Good overview of early Spanish lit",
    "This was a great course and it was definitely different from some of the other courses that are offered. I thoroughly enjoyed it!",
    "I would highly recommend SPAN 261 01 to another student. It was a good survey of early Spanish literature, and was always fun to actually attend.",
    "A great way to get an introduction to Siglo de Oro literature in a safe supportive enviornment which also helps your spanish skill. I would definately recommend this to another student because it a very fun and effective class.",
    "SPAN 261 01 is a great course on early Spanish literature. I would highly recommend it. I will say that some of the earlier texts are hard to understand without a background in Latin, but both professors explained the them so well in class. Take it!",
    "Yes, yes, yes. This is how a Yale class should be taught.",
    "This is an interesting survey course on Spanish literature, with a very reasonable workload. It's a great way to learn more about Spanish culture.",
    "It is a good balance between a history class, examining different social aspects of the different time periods, and literature course with a good degree of analysis"
