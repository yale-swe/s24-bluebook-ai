   "comments": [
    "I learned to expand my knowledge of different ways to think about and theorize sound and I learned about how colonialism functioned culturally",
    "I gained research and writing skills through the two papers for this course. I also had the opportunity to develop new ways of thinking about how sound and music are integral to societies and cultures rather than being simply an add-on or extra.",
    "How to talk about music, how music and religion are deeply tied up with colonialism, what it means to do archival research and how to honestly engage the subjects, how to skim readings and get the point better.",
    "As the title suggests, the course examined the intersections of sound, religion and colonialism, drawing from examples from around the world. We learned to unpack the nuances behind ethnographic and historical accounts of sound and music. The course covered a lot of ground, and I can safely say that I walked away with a deeper understanding of the cultures and imperialism.",
    "The course changed not only the way I think about sound, but also my sensitivity to sounds, music and sonic ideologies around me. I gained a deeper appreciation for religious music around the world, as well as the fluidity of musical sounds and practices throughout history and cultures."

   "comments": [
    "I thought the strengths were that the class integrated both theory and specific case studies. Maybe focusing on some overarching themes explicitly in the case studies would have been good.",
    "Strengths: Interesting lectures and readings; I appreciated the modules format with videos and listening in addition to reading for each week; I appreciated the opportunity to present on a book and on final project material Room for improvement: I wish that we had more time to discuss the readings and student presentations; Also, I think for the format of the class that combined lecture, discussion, and a media component\/video\/listening in class, it would have been a better format to meet for two shorter classes each week rather than one 2-hour time slot.",
    "Talked about sound and religion and colonialism from all over the world and really illustrated well how they are tied together and what the issues are. I think students' interests in different parts of the world widened my understanding. The class was basically a summary of the readings though without deeper engagement with the tests or the societies we were reading about.",
    "The course covered a wide range of topics so it was a little disjointed to follow, although we were all flexible with the schedule. The instructor knew his material well, having taught the class before, and set fair exams and essay questions for us. Discussions drew from our readings and personal experiences.",
    "Strengths: ideas about sound, music, religion and culture, such as the binary between western and non-western ways of thinking about music. the first half on south and southeast asia was super interesting and very informative. I also liked that we talked about quite a lot of countries around the world, though I felt some could have been more in depth. Weaknesses: the historical parts of the course (a lot was info that could be read quickly by the students before the class so as not to squander class time), as well as a slight lull in the the second half of the course, as there weren't too many new ideas\/not as theoretically interesting"

   "comments": [
    "This is a great class if you're interested in ethnomusicology. It addresses a wide range of places and traditions but unified them with the interesting lens of religion and colonialism.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student who is interested in colonial and postcolonial studies because it provides a different angle from which to consider colonial encounters. The papers also gave students an opportunity to explore areas\/time periods that were of particular interest to them.",
    "Yes because you can study what you are interested in. If you're not interested in sound music religion or colonialism, this won't change your mind. But if you're interested in this, you can really study what you want which is cool.",
    "I would recommend it - it was a lot of fun and I learned a lot from it.",
    "yes! fantastic course, too bad you will be going back to upenn!"
