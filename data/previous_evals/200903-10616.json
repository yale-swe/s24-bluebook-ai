   "comments": [
    "If you want to learn Old English quickly and acquire a good introductory reading ability, you should take the class. Focus was on original texts, and we knew enough by the end of the term to read more complicated poems such ad Judith. If you're willing to do the work, the class is really great, and you will feel like you learned a lot by the end of it.",
    "It's a great class if you enjoy the linguistic aspects of English over the course of history, and Roberta Frank is a very good teacher, and one of the kindest professors I've ever encountered. There is a lot of grammar to push through at the start, and the language's inconsistencies can be annoying at times, but you get to read some fun stuff. I would definitely recommend it.",
    "English 500 is an excellent and essential introduction to Old English which not only includes a full review of the grammar of the language, a close reading and translation of a number of shorter works of prose and poetry but also a review of the historical period in which the language flourished and a discussion of the many manuscripts in which the language survives. The relevance of this course is not limited to an Anglo-Saxonist or Medievalist, indeed those interested in periods as disparate as the early-modern to the modern may learn much that is relevant to their field."

    "This course filled a significant gap in my education, for as far as I had learned or understood prior to this course, English vernacular poetry began several centuries later than it did! As my interest (in this early stage in my graduate career) is in vernacularity, I think it enormously important for me to understand that the foundation of English vernacular poetry lay much much deeper than Chaucer and his contemporaries. In addition to the language I learned a great deal about the history of Britain, about the spread of Latin, about the foundation of Christianity on the Island, the history of the monasteries and so much more that is essential for my scholarship. Finally (and perhaps most importantly) I discovered that I love Old English and hope that this is only the beginning of a lifetime of reading and enjoying Anglo-Saxon literature."
