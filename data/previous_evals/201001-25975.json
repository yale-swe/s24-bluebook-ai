   "comments": [
    "The curriculum is tough, but the works are worth the work. Professor Bloch is incredible. He's not a good teacher in the sense that he doesn't really teach in the conventional sense. He embodies the spirit of literature, and you learn by virtue of his brilliance.",
    "You will read some of the best works ever written and really smart people will explain them to you. You will get the chance to talk about them with your peers. Great scholars will help you improve your writing. Honestly, could it be any better?",
    "If you get Professor Bloch, be happy; he's probably the most intelligent person on the DS faculty. He's also immensely kind, although you have to put in effort to establish the teacher-student bond. Classes sometimes become like lectures, but only when the section is composed of passive students, as mine was, so be willing to make bold claims and argue them before the professor and other students. It'll make things much more interesting, especially if the class is at 9 a.m. again!",
    "Don't fail to take this class! Move mountains to get into Professor Bloch's section! If you are fortunate enough to be assigned to this section, don't change it. You will even begin to enjoy waking up at 8 every morning and preparing for some of the greatest discussions DS has to offer.",
    "Definitely take this class!",
    "I would recommend this course without reservation.",
    "War and Peace in two weeks. Don Quixote in two weeks. Like the Boy Scouts say, 'Be Prepared.' This, more than any other DS class, has reading that you NEED to plan out in advance if you want to do it. You have no choice but to read Don Quixote over Christmas break, and you have no choice but to read Madame Bovary and War and Peace (or at least, 600 pages of it) over Spring break. The books make up for the workload, however; the only book I thought I didn't like - Madame Bovary - ended up growing on me after two class discussions and a lecture; looking back, I feel like I learned a lot more about literature from this class than any other lit class I have ever taken (including my awesome Freshman English class with Miss Downy back in HS and DS first semester).",
    "I highly recommend DS lit. The works are incredible, and the course's inter-disciplinary and seminar nature make it special. Professor Bloch is amazing - get into his section if you can. The works are dark though - beware.",
    "Yes, absolutely. Even for someone who did not enjoy first semester of DS as much, second semester will amaze you.",
    "DS literature in the second semester includes works from Petrarch's poetry to TS Eliot's poetry. In between are Don Quixote and War and Peace, among many other things. I am so glad to have taken this course. It is a lot of reading - I did it all (not as carefully as I could have, of course), but I have peers who skipped entire books - which might be a downside, but thebreadth is integral to the quality. I feel that I have a grip on the narrative of the second half of the western canon, and I have a sense of the really important themes that run throughout. Studying for and taking the final exam for this class was immensely fulfilling - I spent the time writing about ideas that felt fully relevant to my life, interpreted through works of literature."
