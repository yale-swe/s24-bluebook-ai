    "Solid cap on the French program at Yale. In addition to the semi-daily course packet homework and biweekly exams, there's also a \"final speaking project\" which is a 5-10 minute presentation about a subject relevant to WWII in France; this presentation was a lot more relaxed and less difficult than I first thought--you will be surprised by how well you can do at L4, which is great. Exams are straightforward (same as L3, at least) and homework is as well. Readings are a mixed bag. You read two novels--one an older, more difficult to read \"classic\" piece of French literature and the other a newer (and longer, but easier) piece that is about two French Jewish kids in WWII. Other than that, you read a lot of selections from a compendium of stories from the whole French-speaking world called \"Diversit.\" About half of these are pretty interesting and the others are fairly boring. I think overall the reading is about the same mix of good and bad as L3, but there is more overall.",
    "Natural continuation\/reinforcement of grammar skills from FREN130 with a focus on some very compelling short stories from the Francophone world.",
    "I would recommend this course but only with Koizim."
