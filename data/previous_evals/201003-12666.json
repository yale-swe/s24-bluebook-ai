    "Due to scheduling issues, I couldn't take fourth-year Russian, so I took this instead. I still learned plenty of language and got opportunities to practice my speaking, reading and writing, and it was very enjoyable.",
    "definitely take this if you're looking for a low-key but still effective way to keep up russian-twice a week is the perfect amount of time-good to build confidence speaking-fascinating texts",
    "Great class! Great professor, and an interesting way to look at both Russian language and literature. It's one of those courses -- the more you put into it, the more you get out of it."
