   "comments": [
    "Definitely take this class! There's a lot of reading, but you really only need to know current events to participate. Plus, you get the chance to hear lots of amazing stories from Professors Negroponte and Wittenstein.",
    "very comprehensive assessment of intelligence community",
    "Great class- Professor Wittenstein is the man and Ambassador Negroponte's insights are worth listening to. Not too much work assignment wise but the reading got somewhat heavy at times. I think the class woulda been better if it was a bit smaller (it was maybe 40 people but run as a seminar), and the 930 meeting time on Mondays is rough. Otherwise, though, this was a great class, the Professors are great, and I recommend you take it if given the chance.",
    "I absolutely loved this class. The subject was fascinating, and I really enjoyed all of the readings. Great syllabus. That said, a lot of the class was discussion based, and most of the people in the class are really not as smart as they think they are and ended up just blabbing on. Wish the profs adapted more of a lecture style, there's so much to learn from both of them. Wittenstein is organized and goes out of his way to help you. Negroponte is hilarious and fantastic. If you're interested in the subject matter of intelligence, I could not recommend this course more highly.",
    "Great class, very cool readings, great professors. Fairly work-intensive, but worth it.",
    "This is a course that will outline how intelligence has worked historically and how it influences policy. It is very interesting to get a sense of the structure of the intelligence community and how gathering, collecting and analyzing information leads to certain decisions. This class is based on the intelligence approach, NOT the policy approach. Understanding these differences is very important as well as what constitutes intelligence failures. The structuring of the IC is also viewed. Recommendable course if you are interested in the workings of the IC in general.",
    "This course was incredible. It's strengths lie in the two professors who were so knowledgeable about the intelligence community. I thought the seminar style was conducive to great class discussions and allowed everyone to grapple with real-world problems affecting the intelligence community.",
    "An overview of national security issues and an explanation of the structure of the intelligence community. You will read government documents as well as a few more academic works, and you will do a simulation of a briefing on a topic of your choice. The final paper can cover pretty much any topic related to the intelligence community or national security.",
    "This is an excellent class. I'd absolutely recommend it.",
    "As much as I wanted to love this class, I really didn't. I expected more from this class. The fact that it was at 9.25 on a Monday morning probably didn't help either, but my main issues with it were the size (around 25 for a seminar), the break up of the final grade, and the content of the course itself.The size was a problem as it made balanced discussion hard \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the limit is usually set at 18 for a reason. This contributes to the next problem. When participation\/attendance is worth 20% and the class is too big for even discussion, you end up having the discussion dominated by just a few people, putting everyone else in the lurch a bit when it comes to grading later. There was also very little feedback given during the semester on grades for things, leaving you pretty much in the dark until after all assignments have been turned in.I don't know exactly what I was hoping for from the content of the course, but wasn't as exhilarated by it as I hoped I would be. Also, discussion, besides often being unbalanced, was not as stimulating as I would have liked.I know this sounds very negative, but it wasn't a terrible class at all, but it needs big improvements. Take the class if the subject is of strong interest to you (it is to me), because you do learn a lot on the academic side of things, and particularly Professor Negroponte has a lot of amazing stories to share. It's a fine class, just not what I was hoping for.",
    "I would strongly recommend this course to any student interested in national security without reservation.",
    "Yes.",
    "Interesting topic, but the large seminar size had a significant and frustrating impact on class discussions.",
    "I think this course has both major strengths and weaknesses. The strengths are extremely knowledgeable and experienced professors, and a great supporting reading list. The wide-ranging focus of the class gives an excellent introduction to the IC.I think that the class sometimes struggled from being unable to maintain focus on intelligence. There was too much discussion about questions of foreign policy, I thought - particularly the hours whiled away discussing U.S. policy on Syria. I also thought that the class was way too big - it could have benefited significantly from a more intimate class size.Overall I enjoyed it quite a lot though.",
    "Good class. Both instructors are extremely interesting. Workload was a bit uneven.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student.",
    "I would absolutely take this class if you are interested in foreign policy and the Intelligence Community. The seminar provides a forum for two insiders to candidly teach the class. I will be sure to take the discussions and the lessons that I learned in this seminar with me in any future related careers."
