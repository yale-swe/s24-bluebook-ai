    "Yes, definitely.",
    "I enjoyed the course. Getting up for a 9:25 class every morning is a bit of a struggle, but Professor Safille's zany enthusiasm woke me up every day. I always got the impression that she really cares about her students. Professor Safille does a great job of conducting the entire class in Spanish. Make sure you carefully read the syllabus every night for assignments (you have to do the assignments in both column 2 and 3 every day!) as they are not mentioned in class. Since the class is everyday and there are assignments essentially every night, it is a lot of busy work, but I personally settled into a rhythm in which I'd plow through the whole week's worth of supersite activities in one go and then be done for the week. If you've heard about a 20 minute presentation it's really not that bad - you split it up with a partner and get notes and a power point. I really appreciated her flexibility accepting a few late assignments. My speaking skills are still not where I'd like them to be, but they improved greatly in this class. I wasn't sure how much Spanish I wanted to take, but after this class I would like to go to L5.",
    "No.",
    "I would recommend this class to a student that is willing to do a substantial amount of busy work but would like to continue in their knowledge of Spanish. This is not an easy class, but it gives you a greater know she of grammar and gives you more room for actually speaking than other classes I have taken.",
    "Would definitely recommend if you want to have a better grasp on how to speak and read with more ease. Be warned, the coursework takes a LOT of time.",
    "It's about what you would expect--the next (and last) in the series of intro spanish courses. Keeps pretty much the same structure as L3, though it changes up in the last month or so with a novel to read and analyze. Expect small online assignments daily, frequent quizzes and other assessments, and periodic oral projects. Definitely teaches you the material well, though it's not particularly inspiring in the process. As for taking it with Barbara...I don't know, she's a really cool person, honestly wants everyone to learn well, and it good at explaining things. That said, she has a tendency to be pretty overbearing during class, which can make it hard to speak up without feeling like a deer in the headlight. She also lets her mood influence how she conducts the class, so if she's getting frustrated (usually because someone didn't do the prep work) it really shows and makes for a not-fun hour. It's definitely still manageable, but be ready for some stressful days."
