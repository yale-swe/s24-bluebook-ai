    "Absolute waste of time. Only take it for language requirement.",
    "I would summarize it as a review of the grammar you knew and a great course overall. I would totally recommend it as a precursor to L4 because it reviews all of the grammar and doesn't really teach you anything new.",
    "Mariana Melo-Vega is a very good instructor, she made class fairly enjoyable (and this from someone who didn't really want to be there). She also explains things clearly and my spanish certainly improved. There is daily homework, and occasional larger things (like reading short stories). Never an overwhelming amount, but daily work drives me crazy, which made it fairly unpleasant.",
    "This is an average language class and would recommend to anyone who wants to learn Spanish. I fell that my grammar improved significantly along with my fluency in the language.",
    "For the vast majority of students, you are taking Spanish 130 because you took some Spanish in high school and need to fulfill the language distributional requirement. This class will probably not be very fun or enlightening, but will provide instruction in reading, writing, listening, and speaking. Exams are graded very rigorously in terms of grammar.",
    "Spanish 130 is a very basic, repetitive class, but it does solidify grammar skills. I don't think I improved with any other aspects of my spanish though. The class work is very tedious at times, and the tests and quizzes are meticulously graded. This class is fine if you need to fulfill your distributional requirement, its not necessarily hard just tedious."
