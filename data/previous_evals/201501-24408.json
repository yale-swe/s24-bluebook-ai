   "comments": [
    "Take this class if you're looking to take an L5 Spanish and you can't get into Medical\/Legal Spanish or if you're coming from AP Spanish and want to solidify your grammar before taking more advanced classes. I definitely learned a lot, but I wish I had gotten to practice speaking more.",
    "Very grammar intensive and effective course with a lot of work required, it's gonna take your Spanish to a whole new level, especially with Profesora Valle! 3",
    "As someone who has spoken Spanish for 14 years (including taking Spanish in high school, i.e. already knowing some grammar), this class usually took at most 6 hours per week to complete the homework. It was quite boring at times, but we covered a lot in depth. Our professor even gave us the most time to practice speaking in class as possible, which was great. This is a good course, but you may learn, as I did, that you might get a lot more out of a more reading\/speaking intensive course.",
    "This was an amazing class. It was pretty small, which was good for conversation and getting to know the other students and professor. Profesora Valle is amazing, and I definitely recommend that you take the class with her! She's so kind and compassionate and also a great teacher. The material in the class is really interesting, and it introduced me to a lot of nuances in the Spanish language that I found to be fascinating.",
    "This course largely consists of a lot of busy work. If you wait until the day before, it takes most of the day to get done. But if you want to brush up on your grammar, there is no better class. I learned a lot of finer points that I never got from all my years taking Spanish. I've regained a lot of confidence in my command of the language. One of my greatest concerns in choosing a Spanish course was regaining my speaking skills, and I didn't expect a grammar course to help me with that. But we do a LOT of group work in class, and that forced me to speak a lot more than I expected, which is really the only way to get better."
