    "YES. take it.Stop kidding yourself. It's a requirement for you Theater Scholars. AND it's the best class at Yale.",
    "There is a reason that 210 is essential for majors. But the class is very different based upon teacher. I would wholeheartedly recommend Deb Margolin as teacher, if you can possibly get her. She inspired all of us, and taught us how to be secure in ourselves as creative beings, giving us the tools to access our own wellspring of self-expression. This class changed my life. I went from someone who loves theater and all that it can do, but who was less than positive about my own ability to possibly ever write or convey anything new or vital on my own, to a person who has complete confidence my physicality, my presence, and my ability to record life around me and turn it into art--into something that has meaning to other people. That is an incredible gift to discover and develop. Deb is crazy, vivid, and absolutely full of wisdom about life and humanity. If you have her, she will lead you on whatever process you need as an individual to become a creatively generative and amazingly beautifully expressive person--I have seen it in every one of my classmates, as different and similar as we all are.",
    "It is not just an acting class. It really teaches you to think in all kinds of ways to approach theater. It is an unbelievable course and I highly recommend taking it with Deb.",
    "This is a great introduction to PERFORMANCE CONCEPTS. WARNING: DO NOT take this if you think you will be taking an ACTING CLASS. This is an exploration of performance. What does it mean to perform? How can the actor engage most deeply and truthfully with the text? There is a lot of (optional) writing involved in this course (WHICH YOU SHOULD DO). The whole point is that we, as actors, should also be able writers so that we are never at loss for material. Our own material empowers us to STEAL THE STAGE. Also, by writing everyday, we become most in touch with our deepest passions, and these passions\/desires inform our performance. Deb is an angel. This class is great for anyone who wishes to EXPLORE.",
    "You will learn things about yourself and about your classmates that will take your development as an artist to new heights of understanding.",
    "YES. TAKE THIS CLASS. DON'T BE SKEPTICAL.Actors, if you think this class won't improve your acting because you've heard Deb is wacky you're absolutely wrong. In order to be a great actor, you need to see why people are interesting to watch and Deb's philosophy about the importance of writing to an actor is spot on. In addition, these 4 hours will be the best 4 hours of your classtime, guaranteed. Deb is a genius. take it, take it, take it.",
    "YES. Take it. The methods of learning are unconventional, but ultimately you will feel so much more capable approaching any role.",
    "This is the hardest class to describe ever. If you've taken any other acting classes, you'll know why and understand. If you haven't, hopefully it helps when I say this class is a combination of sitting in a circle and talking, writing, and moving around the room in exploration of oneself and the world around, with an eye to encouraging presentness in the moment. By all means, this is a fantastic course that has helped me change not just as an intellectual but as an artist, which is to say as a person altogether.",
    "Yes, yes, yes. Take it. Don't expect an acting class, because that's not what this is. This is a life class, a writing class, a therapy session, a revolution in how to be an artist. Should be required for all ThSt majors, just to get to know Deb. Changes how you look at yourself as a performer, or really how you look at performance in general.",
    "Absolutely. Take it take it. Dab's fantastic",
    "210 with Deb is a gift of a class - a chance to explore your capabilities not only as a performer, but as a writer and composer of theatre. More than anything, I found Deb's assignments and the work of my classmates pushing me to start considering my personal aesthetic as an artist - what practically works and what doesn't.I looked forward to this class all week not only as group therapy, but as a forum where I genuinely found myself acting and writing with far more honesty and specificity than usual. Granted, the success of the experience definitely depends not only on Deb, but on the focus and creative honesty of the other people in the class. Wonderfully laid back with much less physical work than most other classes, but definitely also a place where performance was expected to be tightly prepared and thoughtful.One of my favorites at Yale so far."
