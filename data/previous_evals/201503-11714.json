    "If you did HBA the summer beforehand, this class will be very easy for you. You'll have learned every single character on the placement test, although chances are you didn't review and don't quite remember, but you know them I promise! That being said, it's nice to ride the post-summer-in-China wave and use that to get by the class with less work. Teachers don't expect you to know much other than L1\/L2 vocabulary. You review a ton of words you already know, so while you have to \"learn\" ~40 words a day, you already know about 1\/2 or more so it's not as intense as you might be led to think. That being said, if you did not spend a summer in China before this class be prepared to put in a lot of work. Students in my class who did not go to China visibly struggled a lot more than those who did. It's also important to mention that you have 3 quizzes, one each on MTW. Thursdays and Fridays are chill. Keep this in mind when choosing your schedule. Li laoshi is great. She is enthusiastic about getting students to learn the material and really cares about the class. Mu laoshi could improve. Weeks we were taught by him dragged on. He doesn't really lead discussions too well. Oftentimes, he would simplify sentences we used with more advanced grammar. At the very beginning of the course he took our sentences we used with grammar learned over the summer and fed them back to us with 1st year grammar and made us repeat. Talk about horrible teaching. His preferred teaching method is reading sentences off slides, making us repeat, then turning off the projector and trying to get us to say the sentences from memory. To be honest, he often had to look at his own paper to see what the sentences were, how were we expected to remember? It was a huge waste of time and I got very little out of weeks with him. In fact, I'd say that my Chinese got worse when he was \"teaching.\" There's also the fact that he selectively corrects people's pronunciation. The most talkative people in the class could use wrong tones but would go by uncorrected while other students would get corrected because of far minor mistakes. Also, he seems to prefer correcting female students over male students. I'm a male, and I noticed it. Male students who used wrong tones\/grammar were often not corrected, whereas female students who made minor mistakes were asked to repeat themselves or repeat a \"corrected\" sentence.",
    "Be prepared to put in some work every night, especially at the front end. If you can do that, you should do well.",
    "An intense and immersive class of Chinese and exploration into Chinese culture through the language. I would recommend all Chinese students strive to reach this level--you learn a lot about the relationship between culture and language, as well as culture and language individually.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student who wants to continue Chinese language so as not to forget. Coming out of Harvard Beijing Academy, I felt like my fluency decreased throughout the semester, but without the class, I probably would have forgotten most of my Chinese.",
    "This class is challenging but extremely rewarding. We learn so much and we practice a lot in class, too.",
    "After taking L1\/L2 freshman year at Yale, L3\/L4 over summer in China, I have to honestly say that L5 was somewhere in between a disappointment and an utter failure. It pains me to say this but taking L5 Chinese discouraged me from continuing studying Chinese at Yale. I could not bear the thought of enduring one more semester of L5, even if it does get better later on with CHNS 168 and other higher level courses. In complimenting the course I will go as far as saying that the topics in the textbooks were fairly interesting, but other than that the course does a poor job in fostering and improving students' Chinese skills. In class we never practice the spoken grammar in the beginning of each chapter or the written grammar at the end of each chapter. Instead we just re-read the texts in the class or review the plots in last night's tingli homework. Sure this type of teaching might be conducive to improving a sense of how Chinese sentences are structured in the short term (and by short term I mean a few hours and then you forget everything you learned that day), but in the long run this teaching method is terrible. We did not focus on grammar or vocabulary at all during class. Then on the tests grammar from the textbook showed up. It was frustrating. As for the two oral exams in the semester, it is insane. Each oral exam counts for 6% of your final grade. Each oral exam asks only 3 questions. This means that a single question determines 2% of your final grade. The grading policy of no course should be like this. The essays in this course are somewhat of a problem too. The teachers do not recognize or reward you for the amount of effort you put into your essays. If you spend hours on your essay and writing well beyond the word-minimum, all of your efforts will have been wasted. You will just be marked off for arbitrary mispronunciations and apparent grammar mistakes. Essays work like this: you turn in a draft one week to one teacher, you get it back with comments and edits at the end of the week, and then you submit a revised copy the next week to the other teacher. Regarding grammar edits in the essays, sometimes Mu Laoshi would make changes to an essay one week and then the next week Li Laoshi would mark points off for having made those edits. The TA sessions in Chinese L5 were a waste of time. A lot of the times my TA didn't show up. True this problem could be unique to my TA, but regardless the TA sessions were not worthwhile at all. TA sessions, 30 minutes, were devoted to reviewing the stories from the textbooks in order to prepare for the next oral exam. This was a waste of time since we could just do this on our own time. The online L5 website already provides us with the questions that might be asked on the oral exam anyway. The grading was too arbitrary in this course and I would have preferred that we use class time to review grammar structures and how to properly use new words\/phrases instead of just wasting our time reviewing the stories from each textbook chapter.",
    "Easy continuation of the Chinese program coming out of a Light summer program, though a bit of a letdown. Class has ten or twelve students and the teachers alternate every week. Lots of repeated vocabulary and grammar structures from the summer. If you did PiB or maybe HBA, you might want to consider going into the heritage class, which uses \"A New China,\" the PiB second year textbook. That class would probably be more challenging and more interesting.",
    "It's what you'd expect as the continuation of past Chinese courses at Yale. The number of characters to memorize is very high and being prepared each time is a serious time commitment. However, if you keep up with the pace, you will be rewarded by an enriched vocabulary and very interesting discussion topics. Mu and Li Laoshi each add their own personal notes to the lessons and make the time in class worthwhile and entertaining. Sometimes I wish we got to speak more instead of learning characters, but I believe there's only so much you can do without actually being in China.",
    "Yes, only if you are ready for a rigorous Chinese course."
