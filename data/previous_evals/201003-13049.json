    "Absolutely recommended.",
    "Epic poetry is a good combination of survey and engagement with poems like the Iliad, Aeneid, and Beowulf -- along with less immediately obvious choices, like Song of Myself and Prelude. The caliber of discussion, as with all seminars, is really dependent on the people in the class at the time, and how interested they are in any given work. Epic is sometimes considered to be Directed Studies lite, which is a double-edged sword. On one hand, the discussion tends to be more relaxed and more text-based (i.e., no one's imposing their own, rather alien beliefs on the text). However, the professor also seems to expect less of her students, which lets a lot of things slide.",
    "Classical to Romantic Epic is a class on Epic Poetry. We began with The Iliad and worked our way through Rome (The Aeneid), the middle ages (Beowulf and Song of Roland), then Milton's Paradise Lost, Pope's Rape of the Lock, Wordsworth's Prelude, and finally Whitman's Leave of Grass. The greatest part of this course, like any great humanities course, is that you learn history and modes of thought without having to study history in itself. Each text provides new ways of thinking about our world and our role -- I would recommend this course to every student at Yale.",
    "Overall Verdict: Take this class, it's awesomeA few extra details:This class is great for people who want to read a lot very quickly. If you're looking for in depth (and I mean very deep) analysis of a few poems you might want to do something more specific.However, I really enjoyed this class thoroughly and Jane Levin is absolutely amazing. She is extremely active on email, so if you ever need help writing your essay or have a few questions about the poems you're reading, she will be there to support you.",
    "yes. absolutely. I think that epics are a very important part of human history and this course covers from Homer to Whitman",
    "Humanities 226 is a course similar to the ones offered in DS, but it is offered to students of all ages. If you enjoy reading epic poetry, this course is for you.",
    "I would definitely recommend Epics. Professor Levin is great, and the poems we covered are things that any person should read at some point.",
    "If the material sounds at all interesting to you, then take it. Professor Levin is incredibly warm and friendly, and she clearly loves teaching this class. The reading load is a bit above average, but it's never really unmanageable. The grade is derived from two papers, a presentation, and a final exam, none of which are terribly difficult if you've done most of the reading.",
    "A very worthwhile class that anyone with even a passing interest in the humanities will get something out of.",
    "YES. Take the class. The discussion of the texts was not only profound at times but also very entertaining. It's a lot of reading, but the reading is fun material. JLev analyzes the text extremely well. I was excited to come to class every day.",
    "There is a lot of reading, but there are only two papers and a final exam which is not difficult, and the class discussions are great. I would definitely recommend this class if you don't mind a lot of reading. Since the class goes through a lot of books in a short period of time, it doesn't delve too deeply into any of them, but you feel very knowledgeable about great literature by the end of the semester.",
    "I would recommend this class to a student who is truly interested in the literature and is willing to do the work and read. It is easy to fall behind on the readings, and in a small seminar like this class, everyone suffers when that is the case. That aside, Professor Levin is amazing, engaging, fun and passionate. It is totally worth it to take a class with her, and these classic books are good pieces for any student interested in literature to have under his or her belt"
