    "This class is what you make of it. I would absolutely take it again. It definitely applies to those outside the theater studies department -- the material is really important for anyone who has a body!",
    "I would certainly recommend it. Body training is important, especially for theater artists, and thinking about what the body is and how it exists day-to-day is a valuable train of thought.",
    "I can't speak for theater studies majors, but this was my most unconventional class this semester, and a bright spot in my Tuesday afternoons between two seminars in Econ and Global Affairs. Intellectually, I wasn't very stretched though.",
    "Take it!!",
