    "The schedule was kind of weird but it did allow plenty of time to write the report... mostly. The presentations at the end were all a bit haphazard because we received the news about who was doing what on short notice.",
    "Overall a good course, but the workload was doubled this semester as students worked independently to write a formal lab report instead of in pairs. It felt a bit unfair to place this extra workload on students compared to previous semesters simply because there were less students taking the class.",
    "I feel like this course could have been combined with MENG 286 class to create a 1.5 credit class, because back then when I was taking 286, the concepts did not really make sense because we did not see any demonstrations. In this class, we re-learn the concepts anyway so it's better to learn them just once and see how they actually work by combining the two classes."

    "Overall yes, it is a fine course, not too large of a workload and you get to see the material science concepts you learn in MENG 285 applied to the laboratory setting. If you liked 285, I would definitely recommend this class."
