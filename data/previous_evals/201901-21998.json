    "I'm familiar with a whole body of modern poetry now.",
    "Every single time I went into class I felt like my knowledge about the world of poetry increased substantially. I realize I was only gaining a fraction of a fraction of the knowledge that exists, but with Professor Bloom's knowledge made available, I stood to gain so, so much. I was constantly learning about deeper meanings, methods of analysis, critical literary, religious and historical references, voices in the critical sphere. The list goes on, but in short, it was an amazing, wholly beneficial experience.",
    "The enjoyment of reading and discussing some of the greatest poetry of the English language.",
    "How to read poetry, how to ask questions about a poem--questions that I'm not used to asking. Simply reciting a poem out loud with Bloom can help you see things you haven't seen before.",
    "I gained more practice in analyzing poetry, especially very difficult poetry. I learned how much historical context matters in interpreting poetry as well."

    "The syllabus is fantastic. There was not a lot of discussion among students this semester, and the video conference set-up makes it difficult to engage.",
    "No weaknesses, only strengths, I hope many more students are able to enjoy this incredible class.",
    "Was excellent!",
    "It is wonderful.",
    "Is there any way we could hold classes at Professor Bloom's home? The conference call works to a certain extent, but the barrier of long-distance communication does not facilitate conversation.",
    "The strength of this course is in the professor. Professor Bloom is a fantastic teacher who is so knowledgeable, and it is a privilege to learn from him. The discussion-based nature of the class is also a strength. I loved my classmates, and I felt like I learned a lot through discussion with them. In terms of weaknesses, I would have loved a deeper focus on less poems, rather than a broad survey of many poems."

   "comments": [
    "It's worth taking a class with Harold Bloom for the one-on-one meetings with him. The quality of the class depends a lot on the quality of the students in it in a given term.",
    "I cannot recommend this course more. I took the first half of the poetic influence sequence with Professor Bloom in the fall after majoring in biology for the last for years and barely dabbling in the humanities at all outside of completing my humanities requirement my first year. The glowing reviews from other students and the magnitude of his impact motivated me to take his class, and I hope my review will provide you with the same impetus. Please, if you have time and any interest, even if you don't feel you have the background, consider taking this class.",
    "Yes",
    "Absolutely. Even if a student thinks that they do not like poetry, they will discover some text in this class that will mean a lot to them.",
    "Yes: take this course if you're interested at all in English poetry. Bloom will expand your horizons and force you to read poetry from a different angle. Beware, though, that you'll have to deal with conference calls and all kinds of technology mishaps.",
    "Yes! Professor Bloom is a wonderful teacher, and I love the classroom discussion environment."
