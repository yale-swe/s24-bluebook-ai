Armed with a just budding knowledge, I have already been able to make connections with themes, materials and questions covered in this course to those of my other courses as well as to my larger research interests.",
    "I think that the mode of analysis I've begun to utilize in this course can only deepen the visual analyses I conduct in my work. And, the research I conducted for my final paper will likely form the basis for a larger project."
