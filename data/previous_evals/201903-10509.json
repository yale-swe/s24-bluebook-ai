   "comments": [
    "i hate orgo",
    "Learned some Orgo, but the class is pretty slow (especially for middle topics), and pace could probably have been sped up in the middle. Lectures focus too much on examples of problems, so much of my learning was from the (very useful) textbook. Dr. Martinez is very nice but not the best lecturer (repeats herself a lot).",
    "Strengths - clear expectations for exams, helpful but not overburdensome problem sets, great class overall",
    "Fantastic lectures and fair exams. Herzon is extremely knowledgeable and does an amazing and thorough job of answering questions, despite it being a large lecture class. Herzon was out for several lectures which was a weakness in terms of quality of the lectures when he was gone, but I assume this will not be a regular weakness. It is a difficult class, but the lectures were great.",
    "The major weakness of this course was that the teaching was inconsistent. When Prof Herzon was unavailable (which was quite frequent in the middle of the semester), the lecturer that took over was not up to his level and made the content more confusing than it needed to be",
    "The strengths of this course are the lectures that help us review what we read about in the textbook in a way that is very understandable and digestible. Also, the teaching team worked really hard to respond to student feedback to help make the course the best it could be.",
    "Strengths: -Great professor- Herzon is nice, a great lecturer, very knowledgeable, and has a passion for organic chemistry -Low workload -Taught at a manageable pace Weaknesses: -the last unit is a bit sporadic and connections aren't really made in lecture between course material -Dr. Martinez is nice but could improve her lecturing style a bit",
    "Strengths: The professor (Herzon) was really a great lecturer. One of the best lecturers I've ever had in a STEM course. Clear explanations, knew his stuff down pat. Answered questions clearly. Like actually answered questions (some profs just circumvent the question if they don't know the answer, but he would take time to really give a good explanation). Weaknesses: This is orgo, it can be dry. What can I say? Also, Prof Jenny Martinez had to teach lectures when Seth Herzon was out, and Jenny just wasn't as good of a teacher as Seth. Probably due to her lack of teaching experience, but I wish we had Seth more.",
    "It's not very engaging and is a very learn-it-own-your-own type course.",
    "This course could be improved by having a more consistent grading practice.",
    "Well organized. Could be improved with an improved review of gen chem thins in the beginning like MO diagrams. Also better feedback on graded exams would be helpful",
    "Class was taught very well, material was explained thoroughly in class in a way that complemented the textbook without regurgitating the previous nights reading verbatim. Homeworks and tests were straightforward, prof was approachable. The only weakness of the course was that we fell behind in material in he last week because we spent to much time reviewing SN2\/E2 and the last week as a result was a whirlwind of new material.",
    "This class covers a lot of material. Often, it felt like I did not learn the material in class and would have to teach myself based on the practice exams or topic lists that the professor sent out before the exams.",
    "strengths- well taught, fair weaknesses- hard",
    "Herzon is sooooo good! I don't know how he got so bad reviews 7 years ago. He's like reallly good at chemistry and even better at explaining it.",
    "I thought that this class was well-taught. Lectures were kind of boring sometimes though.",
    "strengths: homework is light so you actually get to focus on the material without stress of other work, concepts aren't to crazy weaknesses: definitely a learning curve, you don't know how well you're doing in the class because nothing is posted on canvas",
    "This course excelled in the sense that the TFs and Professors were very much available if help was needed. However, its timing at 9:25am made it difficult to ensure that I was engaged and understanding the material as best as possible. This is one of those courses where it becomes very difficult to catch up and excel if you fall behind.",
    "I thought Professor Herzon was a wonderful instructor. He was clear and concise and was available to answer questions throughout the semester. Unfortunately, however, he was absent for much of the semester, and the substitute professor moved through material more slowly, and less clearly. As a result, the class fell far behind, and in the last week of class, Professor Herzon tried to compensate by moving through a vast amount of material far too quickly. Additionally, a weakness of the course was the lack of communication between the instructor, the preceptor, and the TFs. They often had different information, different opinions about the answers to a question, and frequently gave students information that conflicted. It was clear to students that this group of people did not always get along personally, and it showed in their teaching. The course could be improved via better communication among the teaching team.",
    "This course was pretty poorly organized and was not necessarily taught in the best way. The subject matter is really interesting, but it is hard to be engaged with the frequent changes.",
    "Strengths - Great professor, well-organized course Weakness- Classes were a bit too fast paced",
    "Our main professor would be absent many times, which hurt my understanding because I've been so used to his style. When Prof Herzon taught, he was good.",
    "Professor Herzon is amazing! If you have the chance to take it with him do it!!",
    "Herzon is an incredible and engaging Professor, and having him was the highlight of the course. The two major weaknesses are first that the end of the class felt extremely rushed, since in the last week we essentially covered more material that was on our third midterm. I know we went slow at points, but I feel like that was an ineffective way of compensating. Additionally, the lectures taught by the preceptor were exceptionally frustrating to attend, as she was often unclear, did not answer students questions, and did not teach concepts, she just wrote out reactions to memorize essentially.",
    "Strengths: Interesting content, well delivered lectures Weaknesses: Lectures are huge and at times boring, not enough homework given to ensure student learning",
    "Strengths: Nothing Weaknesses: It is very hard to convince people to show up for a lecture at 9:25 AM 3 days a week at one of the furthest points on campus when it is very easy to get by studying on your own from the textbook, which is what I did most of the time. I'm not very sure how this can be improved.",
    "not enough support was given at times, thought in gen chem there was more useful help (more practice problems, concept explanations)",
    "I did very well on first two midterms, but on the final my anxiety got the best of me. I need to learn how to better manage exam stress.",
    "Strengths: Seth Herzon is a really wonderful lecturer. He is engaging, realistic about memorization techniques, and answers questions in great depth. Being about to drop the lowest midterm is great. Sapling problem sets are useful. Weaknesses: this class is memorization heavy, and requires a high level of constant organization so that you can remember and apply all of the reactions as needed. 3x a week is a lot of class, and though it is typical for Sc classes, I think we could have been better served by 2x per week in a longer chunk because we often had to stop class halfway through a reaction or concept.",
    "Strength is the course went at a good pace.",
    "Professor Herzon is the strength of the course. Makes class fun and engaging and very good teacher",
    "large lecture, sections were very helpful",
    "This course was great except I wish that Seth had taught the whole course. The time period during the middle of the semester when Jenny taught saw a large reduction in number of people coming to class, mainly because the way that she teaches is very procedural and not as engaging as Seth's.",
    "i really liked seth herzon's lecturing style but i wish he lectured more consistently he often went on leave and dr martinez would sub in for him then we would have to relearn some of the material she covered for him and we ended up very behind by the end, leaving us to learn most of the final materials in the last week",
    "The strength of this course is that it is very streamlined and follows the textbook closely. The weakness of this course is that it does not cause you to think more deeply about the topics taught in class (a lot of rote memorization).",
    "I wish that the instructor had been more present for the course. He missed many days and we fell behind in lecture, so the last week crammed so much material in - it was very poorly organized. I also wish there was better access to more practice problems and what we did in discussion. It would have helped a lot in preparing for the exams.",
    "Strengths: Well taught, fair tests, engaging homework assignments Weaknesses: Not really standardized grading (TAs take off wildly different amounts of points for similar errors), the class doesn't have an official re-grading policy for exams",
    "Half the semester our actual professor was gone which was inconvenient. Though Dr. Martinez took Professor Herzon's place, I felt cheated of an education because Professor Herzon was simply a better teacher. I appreciated Dr. martinez posting her notes, something Professor Herzon did not do, but overall, I had to independently learn everything for the 3rd and 2nd midterm.",
    "Professor was amazing.",
    "slow down teaching maybe, taught too much at once so its hard to retain and understand",
    "I think that the discussion sections could be more helpful. I also think that it was very disorganized to have 2 teachers because Seth was never here. They had very different teaching styles. I think that the pace could improved as well as sometimes we went really slowly and other times it felt like he was just trying to cram information in.",
    "There were so many resources available to help us learn- all of the TFs were very helpful and the class itself was meticulously taught. It was a good pace and everything was explained well. Also, both Pro. Herzon and Prof. Martinez were diligent in responding to any concerns we had.",
    "Seth Herzon teaches very clearly and well. For most of the course everything was great. However, it seems like we fell behind so the last week of class, after Thanksgiving break, a whole bunch of knowledge was thrown at us. We were expected to know things never talked about in class on the final, like ring expansion. (It was on the homework) Because of that week, the final was a lot harder than the 3 midterms. Hopefully the course can be paced better, but be prepared.",
    "Jenny Martinez was definitely a weakness. We fell significantly behind, her teaching style was not engaging, and her explanations were confusing. A substitute for a couple classes is one thing but for what seemed like the majority of the second half of the semester, I and everyone else in the class were fairly disappointed. To be clear Seth Herzon is a great Professor in my opinion I just wish it had been him teaching more",
    "Lecture, not much can be done.",
    "The combination of lecture and discussions section is generally helpful, and I most appreciated when lectures enabled us to both learn about concepts and see examples relating to the concepts. I think that the end of the course felt slightly rushed, so ensuring that class time accurately reflects the difficulty of material would be good.",
    "Seth Herzon is a great teacher.",
    "Strengths: great explanations, interesting content Weaknesses: material covered really quickly",
    "The lectures concisely presented the material and the exam format was consistent so it was easier to focus on studying the content.",
    "The material is great, but it was not taught very well. Herzon was great, but Jenny was not as engaging a lecturer as most students would have liked. We were also pretty behind, so the class was very much back loaded.",
    "This course is overall very well organized and well taught. One of the biggest weaknesses I saw in this course was that sometimes it seemed as if the support from the professor was somewhat absent. Professor Herzon was absent for a good amount of lectures throughout the semester, and even though that did not pose any huge issues it still introduced some lack of continuity in the material and the way in which it was taught. Furthermore, it would be nice if the professor himself could be more present when it comes to review sessions, as a review session from the professor would give a much more comprehensive outlook into the course material. Having said that, I think that the work of Dr. Martinez in organizing and managing this entire course was amazing, and I think she deserves props for stepping in every time Professor Herzon was absent.",
    "Had multiple professors at times because Prof Herzon was not there a lot of the time. Not a bad thing because both were great lecturers, but slightly hard to follow",
    "Herzon was excellent lecturer but left for a good bit of the semester. Martinez did okay, but there was definitely a gap in learning during those lectures. We also seemed to cover a huge portion of material the last three weeks.",
    "Strength: being able to drop one out of the three midterms, completion-based Sapling problem sets. Professor Herzon was a very good lecturer, but Dr. Martinez not so much.",
    "It is lectured well and there are no curveballs when it comes to the exams.",
    "strengths: TFs are very helpful weaknesses: the grading for midterm 2 was unfair over the meso problem - I don't think it can be dismissed simply because there was a question about meso compounds on the final; also the topics for the final exam was unclear since the practice final exam included things such as Grignard reagents, but it was barely covered in lecture, so lecture topics overall should be organized in a clearer way",
    "The lectures were very engaging, and the psets were good to facilitate learning. The practice tests were also very helpful, and TAs were very helpful.",
    "I wish I had known that Dr. Herzon would be away for so much of the course. It wouldve impacted when I decided to take it. Herzon was a fantastic teacher, but the preceptor who took his place for what felt like half the semester was not equipped to properly teach this class.",
    "The teaching seemed rushed but overall good course.",
    "Interesting material and the professor was very engaging",
    "Strengths: nice TFs, great professor, great explanations, clear organization of material Weaknesses: maybe more HW? I felt that the Sapling and HW was really lax which in some aspects is good but on the other hand, I feel that if the HW policy was stricter, I'd be more inclined to understand the reactions instead of memorizing them for the exams. Also, I'm not sure I exactly 100% like the structure of the class. I feel that instead of learning the reactions and then the including stereochem, we should have learned the reactions along with the stereochem.",
    "Strengths: Great professor, not a lot of homework, not too easy Weaknesses: The preceptor's (Jenny Martinez) teaching was mediocre at best but honestly not helpful at all. In addition, she was tentative to help students from my experience.",
    "The lectures were very good. They were not good at preparing for tests. The practice exams always had mistakes and different TAs often gave contradictory information.",
    "Very clear lectures by Prof. Herzon & great transparency through emails. Fast grading was good.",
    "The strength of this course was how the material was presented in an organized way. I was able to see different reactions and learn step by step how to solve these reactions. There were also a lot of resources that provided any help I needed. I think this course could be improved if we could have moved faster at the end since I think we spent a bit too much time on SN2, so then we could not cover the remaining chapter.",
    "I think that this course was overall very strong. A weakness of the class was I think that the grading was very harsh. I understand the importance of consistency but small errors were often penalized very harshly.",
    "The course was very well taught with lots of peer tutors. Prof Herzon kept lectures engaging and as interesting as organic chem lectures can be!",
    "The course is well structured.",
    "I think the lectures by Dr. Herzon were very good, although I feel like the Sapling homeworks were not sufficient to prepare students for the exams.",
    "The course provides a good overview of basic organic chemistry concepts and nicely follows the textbook. However, I think that the pacing of the course could be improved. Some topics (stereochemistry, review of general chem concepts, solvents) were given far too much attention during lecture. Stereochemistry and alcohol chemistry were given the same time in class, though the latter is far more difficult to understand. Making lecture time proportionate to the complexity of the concept, rather than the number of pages it gets in the textbook, would improve student understanding. Also, there was zero transparency about grading in this class. No grade quotas or grade cutoffs were officially announced, so none of the students knew where they stood at any point during the course. This is an unnecessary stressor that can be easily alleviated by explaining how grading will work at the start of the course.",
    "Strengths of this course were the professor, the TAs, and the content, which was taught is a very clear and applicable way. Weakness of this course is that often the professor was out of town and the other instructor would fill in, and their teaching styles was very different. Also, towards the end, the material was taught in a very rushed way.",
    "Strengths: The material we learned seemed relatively useful and the worksheets that were given during section to work on the material from class were super helpful! Weaknesses: The teaching when Prof. Herzon was absent made the class very difficult to keep up with. While I am sure that Dr. Martinez is a great person outside of class, she was not a good lecturer. She created a hostile environment that did not welcome questions, seemed agitated when students did not understand the way she taught something, and was often times negative towards genuine attempts to reach out for help. For example, the lessons she taught were the ones that students had the weakest foundations on because she just talked looking at her iPad and ignored questions of people that had their hands raised for almost 10 minutes. The material was already difficult without having a lecturer that was not approachable or taught well. Advice: The practice test keys that we received for exams only had the answers. It would be very helpful if they also contained the work so we were able to understand where that answer came from.",
    "Written psets instead of sapling would be helpful, or more sapling assignments that splits the content up more",
    "Strengths: Seth Herzon is a phenomenal Orgo teacher; he made sure to very explicitly draw out reaction mechanisms and explain step by step, and always took the time to answer questions during lecture. He was also very accommodating and accessible during office hours. Additionally, the lecture material lined up very well with the textbook, and the exams were generally very similar to the practice exams. Weaknesses: Discussion sections were often not helpful at all. Jenny Martinez, the preceptor, is also unfortunately a negative of the course. Seth was absent for a significant number of lectures, which was difficult because as stated, he is a phenomenal lecturer - in his place, Jenny substituted, and was extremely unhelpful. Instead of drawing out mechanisms, she would pull up a pre-written set of slides. For a course like Orgo, which relies so heavily on understanding each step of multiple processes, this was very detrimental; we would be hit with a vast amount of information at once and have to try to work things out mentally while taking notes on the slides, and meanwhile Jenny would keep talking in the background, without once looking up from her iPad to answer questions. Not conducive to learning whatsoever. Additionally, while the tests were similar to the practice, there would inevitably be one or two major questions that were completely different from course material.",
    "Order of the course made sense and the way things built on each other made sense. Pace was good but then a few times we fell behind and catching up especially at the end was a bit rushed. Having the two teachers switch out at times was tough since their styles were different.",
    "I felt that the course was okay, I wish that I would have spent more time engaging with the material. I feel that Dr. Martinez is a little harsh, but that wasn't really a weakness of the course itself.",
    "Strengths- Herzon was an extremely clear and concise lecturer and I loved that he would use the chalk board. His lectures were interesting and engaging Weaknesses- The course website was not updated frequently",
    "I like how this course had lots of opportunity to perform well, and it allowed me to better develop my organic chemistry skills. I think the Sapling could be assigned weekly so that we would get weekly practice, as I would often do the Sapling in one sitting and would forget the earlier Sapling topics.",
    "A major strength of the course was that it was well-organized. I never felt surprised at the material covered in class because it always mirrored the textbook -- on that note, I would suggest to students to definitely read the textbook pages before every lecture to prime yourself. In addition, the practice tests that we were given mirrored the actual test itself, which was very nice of Prof. Herzon and TAs. Another major strength is Seth. Professor Herzon is an incredible teacher. He makes the material very clear and straightforward. It's just a shame that during my semester he was away for half of the lectures. One weakness of the class is simply that it is a lot of material. I don't think that this is necessarily something that can be fixed, but it is definitely a great deal of information all thrown at you over the course of a semester. At times, I felt like the class was a little fast paced -- we seldom had any review of previous reactions.",
    "Clear lectures from both Professor Herzon and Prof. Martinez. Well organized and easy to follow. I wish the course moved at a faster pace so we could have gotten through more content. I feel like in comparison to first year orgo we covered far less, and I really like this subject so in some ways I wish the class was a bit more challenging. Although it seems nice to have the homework as \"optional\" I actually realized that this can just make one slack off and not learn the material as well at a steady pace, and in instead cram a lot right before the exam.",
    "I wish the lecture notes had been posted on canvas.",
    "Strengths: well written practice exams and exams, great TFs Weaknesses: it was difficult to navigate which mechanisms we were responsible for knowing",
    "This class was very interesting and I enjoyed it very much. The only glaring weakness was sometime Seth was not there. The intermolecular forces review was kind of unnecessary I felt.",
    "This is an excellent course in all aspects. It is challenging and informative.",
    "I think that the notes should always be put on Canvas. I also think Professor Herzon should be there for more time. I prefered his teaching greatly. I also think that partial credit should be given.",
    "The lectures were very engaging and the problem sets helped reinforce concepts taught in lecture.",
    "i liked prof. Herzon's lectures for the most part since he explained the reasons behind mechanisms pretty well but for other concepts it was a little unclear and left up to the TFs to clarify. The course was a little fast-paced and even then some parts of the syllabus were cut out because we didnt have enough time to read these topics. Information wise i feel it was distributed pretty well between exam, meaning each exam wasn't a ridiculous amount of content being tested. I also liked how before each exam a list of topics to know was distributed to help guide studying. The course could be improved by providing more exam-style questions outside of the previous year's tests\/practice exams and sapling to really help cement the concepts taught in the lecture.",
    "Strengths: the course gives a solid foundation for chemistry, the topics are interesting and understandable Weaknesses: the material moves very quickly",
    "This class was great to get the basics of organic chemistry and it was really well taught with in depth and engaging lectures.",
    "This course has interesting lectures, I would like to see more practical applications to the chemistry we learn like we did in gen chem (a bit of materials science or some background on industrial synthesis or something).",
    "I think the best thing about the class is that you can drop a midterm.",
    "I think the course involved a lot of clear explanations of material, though it was moved through quickly and missing one day of class could be very disorienting.",
    "Strengths - lectures by the professor were easy to follow and understand, tests were fair Weaknesses - sometimes material felt disorganized, it felt too fast in some places, we never went through a practice problem in class or anything like that",
    "I appreciate how practice tests were similar to actual exam. Helped me prepare much better",
    "A strength of this class is the flow of the course. Everything felt well connected and I never was confused about where a concept came from. The TAs and the professor seemed to be very in sync so that section was not just a repetition of lecture but also a productive space. A weakness of this class was the occasional absences of the professor, which is probably not under his control. However, the change in teaching style was very jarring and made it difficult to process and learn during those two weeks. It also caused for a lack of coherency so that once the professor returned he had to reteach the material in order to continue because many people were lost. I also think that fed into the fact that the last third of the class was slightly more chaotic (or at least less smooth than the first 2\/3) because we were a little behind so we didn't spend as much time on the newest reactions and I was not fully comfortable with them going into the final.",
    "I thought a major strength was Seth Herzon's teaching. It was much easier to follow than I expected, given the subject, and he handled it well. Jenny Martinez's iPad teaching was a major drawback for me. It was not engaging, and much harder to follow than Herzon's chalkboard teaching. The pacing of lecture with the iPad was faster in a different way, in that the pre-drawn structures and things like that made it difficult to keep up.",
    "I think the material was covered very well in this course, but the pacing was off. It started very slowly, with basic concepts, but by the third midterm and especially the last week we were learning two or three new topics every short lecture. At that point, I had to teach myself the material from the book and other sources rather than understanding it through lectures. I think it would be better if this course were a little more front-heavy. I also am not a fan of the online problem set system (Sapling). I feel that because often no explanation is provided in the solutions, it does not really facilitate learning and instead becomes a robotic process of checking off points. The assigned optional problems from the study guide were much more helpful, but because they were not graded, we have to prioritize the Sapling problems with our time, which is frustrating and unhelpful.",
    "Professor Herzon is a wonderful lecturer. He is very approachable and explains things in a manner that is easy to understand. If the class is struggling, he is willing to go back over material lectures after it was first presented. Online PSets are also great at presenting the material that we need to know. One weakness of the course is that because there is no weekly homework, students can easily fall behind.",
    "I wished that Prof Herzon taught the entirety of the course. I felt that learning from seeing the mechanisms drawn out and explained on the board was really helpful vs. the iPad teaching was not as helpful. I hope that in the future, they continue going through the mechanisms in detail because that was very helpful.",
    "It was definitely a fair class, the material was hard but not ridiculously hard.",
    "The professor wasn't there for half the course so that was not ideal, next time hopefully they pick an instructor that teaches. Otherwise, it was fine.",
    "The professor is a strength and his teaching style. The weakness is that the grade is mostly dependent on exams.",
    "Super engaging, really nice teachers. The only weakness is that they dont post the material online.",
    "The Sapling assignments helped solidify my grasp of the concepts. The information provided is usually presented well and accompanied by supporting evidence\/calculations.",
    "herzon was a good teacher, however he was gone for a lot of the semester, material was pretty dry and was basically all memorization",
    "This course really pushed you because it presents you with a ton of information and makes you apply it to many different scenarios. It is difficult information and I don't think enough examples of test-like questions are presented in class.",
    "Herzon's lectures very good. If he was here more it would have been better. Exams were fair; they rewarded the people who studied the practice exams.",
    "Strengths: Very well organized. There was a practice test provided for each midterm and final which was pretty representative of the test that would be given (questions were always almost exactly the same). The only homework were Sapling assignments. Prof. Herzon is a really great lecturer. There are peer tutors and TAs to help, and they almost always have hours.",
    "There was some switching of the lecturers in the middle of the course which made following a bit hard. The review sessions held during the semester were also a bit last minute.",
    "Strengths: - lectures were good - optional discussion section Weaknesses: - only one practice exam for midterms\/the final while previous classes had three (we didn't have nearly enough practice problems throughout the semester to feel prepared) - no designated notetaker for the class, so getting good notes was a struggle if you had to miss lecture - Dr. Martinez was not great with answering student questions and (I believe) was confused on the time limit and shortened our final exam time from what it should have been",
    "Strengths included the amount of practice material (practice exams and textbook questions) to prepare for midterms and the organized breakdown of content taught in lecture",
    "Strengths: quality of instructor, availability of help Weaknesses: would have liked more practice problems",
    "Strengths: Great professor, clearly taught, practice material gave good representation of assessments Weaknesses: Substitute professor halfway through semester made some information unclear. Also, the sapling website that we were given psets from contained material that was either too easy or not representative of what we were later tested on. Improve: Having a consistent professor, and better\/more challenging psets.",
    "Good lecturer",
    "A strength of this course is how the professor writes all of the topics on the blackboard, which gives us all a good time to copy what he is saying and follow along. In addition, it gives space for all of us to ask questions during class when we are confused, which is a huge improvement from General Chemistry. In addition, the amount of review sessions and problem solving sessions from all of the TFs were very helpful. A weakness of this course is the pace, specifically how we were forced to rush at the end of the course. It left us with only a passing understanding of some very important topics that we needed to know in detail. In addition, I think this was a problem for only this semester, but switching professors on and off for different topics also was a bit of a weakness because I think the varying speeds caused us to get behind. In addition, sometimes they would be teaching at different levels and want us to know different things, so it caused inconsistencies. In addition, I wish their answer keys would have had more explanation to the origins of their answers, because it forced them to always have to rerelease a second answer key to practice questions that was clearer, and just caused more confusion. Lastly, the fact that our review session was the day before the final was terrible, especially for those of us who had had an exam right before.",
    "Strengths: professor Weaknesses: fast pace of the course, changing professor",
    "The class was well taught, good practice problems were provided for exams and exams were graded quickly. The course could be improved by offering more peer tutoring hours, or study halls and additional help for the PSETs. Additionally, class announcements could be organized a bit better and the spacing and timing of PSET due dates could also be improved."

   "comments": [
    "i hate orgo",
    "Yes, this course was very easy to do well in and was taught fairly well (not amazingly taught, but not bad). Exams are straight forward despite relatively low numerical averages (70s or low 80s for all 3 midterms).",
    "Absolutely..much better than general chemistry. Learning the reactions is fun",
    "Yes, I think it is a fine course. I don't know if it is a particularly fun course, but it certainly isn't the most painful way to fill pre-req or pre-med requirements.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student--especially with this professor. You learn about orgo in a way that is palatable and you get a lot of support and practice in learning the subject.",
    "I would recommend it just because it's a class that teaches you the chemistry behind a lot of chemicals you hear in everyday life. I know I had heard a lot of the chemical names like \"acetone\" in just my everyday life but never really understood it in a chemical sense until this class. Also it's cool that I now know under what conditions and using what chemicals to use to get a few products.",
    "Orgo is a requirement. Don't take it for fun. You will suffer.",
    "Only if you are interested in orgo or it's a pre-req.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who needed to take the course and does not have a heavy course load. I was not able to give this course the time it needed for studying.",
    "Yes. Tough but you can definitely get something out of it if you want.",
    "Highly recommend if with Dr. Herzon. Organic chemistry is cool if thats your thing but Dr. Herzon is an amazing professor.",
    "This is a challenging course. You probably don't want to take this unless you need to or are passionate about chemistry.",
    "Yes, if it's required",
    "Yes. Learned a lot. Herzon is really good. The practice tests look exact like the actual exams so make sure you study from them.",
    "yes!",
    "I personally enjoyed the class a lot -- I thought it was like on big puzzle -- but don't take it if you don't have to! It is obviously a STEM heavy course so if you are not interested in chemistry or science, I would say don't take it.",
    "yes, but this is probably a class that you're taking as a requirement anyways",
    "I would recommend this course to students if they are willing to work hard to learn the language of organic chemistry.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone who is interested in organic chemistry. It's not too painful and really gives students a sense of the discipline and what further study in this field would be like.",
    "I think organic chemistry is a very interesting subject, and though this wasn't a particularly well taught class, it was still pretty interesting.",
    "Yes. The course is engaging and if you go into it with the mindset that you will succeed then you well.",
    "It was cool to learn this and realize that it is not as bad as some make it out to be. But you probably have to take this if you're reading this.",
    "Yes! I think Orgo has very interesting content, even if you're not premed (which many of the students are).",
    "Honestly, yes if youre interested in chemistry. For most people its a requirement, but I actually really enjoyed orgo.",
    "Yes, it is a very important course to understanding advanced chemistry, and is a very interesting course irrespective of major.",
    "Sure. Organic chemistry is interesting material and what better way to learn it than to take it as a class. However, don't expect much from the class experience.",
    "Yes, if they are interested in going into some sort of science field.",
    "Yes.",
    "Yes! It is totally different from general chemistry, so don't worry if you didn't like gen chem. This class is similar to solving a puzzle, and it is intellectually challenging in a way that is unique from most other classes.",
    "Yes, this course taught me that organic chemistry is not as bad as most people make it to be!",
    "Most likely, you're taking it because you have to. But try to take it with Professor Herzon. He's very helpful in teaching the information, but course is a lot of memorization regardless",
    "only if required",
    "No, I would not recommend this course to another student unless they have to take it to satisfy a requirement. There are other far more interesting science courses you could be taking to fulfill a science requirement that is not bogged down with so many small details.",
    "yes, herzon's a great lecturer and this class is straightforward",
    "I wouldn't necessarily recommend the course, but I know that it is required for pre-meds and chemistry majors.",
    "Yes. You learn some interesting concepts and it challenges you to think in a new way. I just wish it had been taught more consistently over the course of the semester. I felt like it was unfair to all the students to have such inconsistency.",
    "Yes. It is a good way to learn a lot about organic chemistry",
    "Only if required, not worth the headache.",
    "Only if it is necessary for a pre req or if youre VERY interested in organic chemistry. It is a lot of work and will take up majority of your time.",
    "Yes, because its required for pre-Med and also was in general a good course.",
    "Literally only if pre-med or you absolutely need it",
    "I would recommend only if you need it for major or Med school",
    "Probably not if you don't need to take it, but honestly it was satisfying to take and learn all the material.",
    "Yes, I honestly enjoyed the class a lot. Solving mechanisms is a lot like solving puzzles. It was cool to learn about reactions and also to perform them in lab. Teaching is pretty good and section is usually pretty helpful depending on the TA.",
    "Yes",
    "Organic chemistry is generally taken because it's required, but I would recommend it to another student. I was pleasantly surprised by how interesting the class was, and by the amount I was able to learn and understand.",
    "Yes, I learned a lot and it is a very interesting course.",
    "If you need this class for a prereq",
    "Absolutely, it's always valuable to have some organic chemistry behind you if you're in stem.",
    "Definitely, especially if Prof Herzon is teaching it. One of the best classes I've taken so far. You'll learn so much",
    "I would recommend this course for anyone that is interested in gaining a comprehensive introduction to organic chemistry. For most of the people this course is a prerequisite, however.",
    "Yes! I think its a doable amount of work & studying & very engaging\/interesting although challenging",
    "Orgo really isn't too bad. You can drop one of the three midterms, and the problem sets are all on Sapling and you get as many tries as you want. With that said, if you don't consistently go to lecture\/section it is very easy to fall behind due to the low workload and become complacent. Don't do this! It is hard to learn the reactions all at once in time for a midterm if you haven't been studying them all along. However, you can pretty much teach yourself from the textbook\/online resources because it's a rather standard curriculum, so if you do fall behind\/miss some lectures catching up isn't too hard if you're putting in the work.",
    "If they need it for pre-med",
    "only if you have to; I only took this course because it was a prerequisite for biochemistry",
    "Yes! This is definitely a great introduction to Organic Chemistry and Professor Herzon is a great professor!",
    "No it is a prerequisite",
    "Yes.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student especially if they are STEM kids. Even if they aren't interested in chemistry, I feel that the class really taught me to think in a different way with regards to how reactions take place.",
    "Yes! This was a great course and very interesting.",
    "Yes, only if you have to take it.",
    "Yes, very interesting subject.",
    "I would recommend this course. I learned so much this semester and was able to get to understand many chemical reactions on a fundamental level. I learned about many compounds and their properties. I also liked how we learned about why specific properties of reactions are important in real life experimentation. Overall, the skills and knowledge I learned will be applicable.",
    "I think that this was a good chemistry course and an improvement over the general chemistry courses. That being said, if chemistry does not interest you or you do not need to take this as a pre-req for pre med I would caution a student against this.",
    "Yes, especially if you are interested in chemistry. The course is very challenging but overall pretty enjoyable",
    "I would recommend this course; it was enjoyable and informative.",
    "Yes, but only if you really need to take it.",
    "Yes. If you have any interest in biological or chemical sciences, this course is a must. The understanding of mechanisms of organic reactions and the ability to think about organic molecules is an indisputable prerequisite for understanding biological processes (and obviously chemical processes as well). The material may seem dry and boring now, but when you move to more advanced courses (I am taking biochemistry and neurobiology concurrently) you quickly realize that understanding concepts like chirality and nucleophilicity is necessary in order to grasp the more macro-scale topics discussed in these courses.",
    "Yes, it was interesting and wasn't as hard as other chemistry lectures.",
    "It was okay if you have to take it. Wouldn't recommend it just for fun though.",
    "I do think this class is a great introduction to organic chemistry, and I personally found it a lot more interesting than general chemistry, but thats personal preference. It is much less conceptually abstract than general chemistry and instead focuses more on problem solving abilities, which I like. I would, however, not encourage someone to take it if it is not a required course.",
    "Yes. Solid course and if youre considering taking it, its probably because you have to.",
    "I would only recommend this course if it is required for pre-med or for a major. Other than that, there is no reason one should take this course.",
    "I would recommend this to people who are interested in organic chemistry. I found this far more conceptually interesting and well taught than general chemistry",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. While organic chemistry has a bad rep, I think that the course is engaging enough for anyone to want to pursue it.",
    "Yes, it is key to understanding orgo.",
    "I would, if you have Professor Herzon. He is a great professor who really cares about his students. I think he's a real gem in the pool of introductory class professors, especially if you are premed and you're taking organic chemistry because you have to. If there is one thing to say, though, no matter which professor you have, Organic Chemistry is a completely different ballpark from General Chemistry. When I first started taking this class, I was confused by the notation and the problems that relied more on spatial manipulation and formal charge than calculations and actual charge. But I slowly grew to enjoy doing organic chemistry. You just need to have the mindset that this is not the chemistry that you are familiar with. It is a completely different class. Embrace it.",
    "I would highly recommend any student interested in chemistry or is just passionate about science in general should take first year organic over this course. I made the huge mistake of thinking first year organic chemistry would be too difficult for me in my first year and opted to wait a year until I took orgo. Although sophmore orgo is certainly still good, I think first year orgo would have been a more intellectually stimulating experience.",
    "Yes, but only to pre-med or chemistry majors.",
    "Yes, Seth is awesome and so is the material.",
    "Yes, it gives a good foundation in organic chemistry for students in the sciences. And I think some of the problem solving necessary is good for anybody in field.",
    "Only if you need to take it.",
    "I would recommend this course even if someone did not have to take it to satisfy a requirement.",
    "Outside of taking it as a requirement, I don't really recommend it unless you need it. If you do need it however, don't be scared or anything it really wasn't bad - you get out what you put in and the TA i had at least was very good at explaining confusing concepts.",
    "I would recommend it to other premed students, but they have to take the class",
    "Yes, its a good class to take whether you are a premed or just a stem major who wants to know more about organic molecules!",
    "yes, if that student is interested in chemistry or synthesis.",
    "Only if they need it.",
    "If you need to take Orgo,, do so. I am neutral to the course. I thought it was a decent course with a fair demand of effort.",
    "If you need to take it for premed or chemistry, yes it's a good intro orgo course.",
    "Yes",
    "I would! I didn't think the first half of the class was too difficult and there are lots of opportunities for help if you get confused.",
    "I would recommend this course because I think the material is very interesting and crucial for certain tracks and majors. However, I would not say that . it should be taken for \"fun.\"",
    "If needed",
    "Yes but you must seek resources for yourself",
    "Yes, great course taught by a great professor. Herzon really cares about his students and when he taught, he always paused to answer questions. He went pretty slowly through the first unit, which everybody really appreciated.",
    "I think it should not be the reason you are not premed. Obviously don't take it as a science gut.",
    "Take it if you are interested in organic chemistry, it teaches you the basics and isn't too much work.",
    "Yes. The professor was great and I really learned a lot.",
    "Yes! Its so much nicer than Gen Chem. I think it is genuinely a good time, and the teachers are willing to work with you if you have health issues.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. It is difficult, but that is to be expected with organic chemistry.",
    "only if they have to take it for requirements",
    "I would recommend because if you like chemistry you will appreciate this course, but it is very hard.",
    "This course gave me a completely new perspective on chemistry. I did not see how anyone would like gen chem but could see how one would enjoy orgo, and often I enjoyed it as well. This class is not needed for my major but I am glad I took it.",
    "Yes! The entire semester was pretty predictable, and this course is interesting but not that difficult (at least, relative to other schools, I felt that Orgo I was a lot less stressful at Yale). The teaching is great. There's a nice curve too. I wouldn't take a semester of orgo just for fun (I'm not sure it anyone is actually considering this) because it doesn't really seem to have applications to real life, but that's just the nature of the material.",
    "If a student does not need to take orgo, I will never tell them it's a good idea to take this class.",
    "It demands a lot of effort and attention, but if you're willing (especially for pre-meds) and like the content I would say give it a shot",
    "Yes, but only to students who need to take it. It is not a course to take if you're not serious about the material.",
    "Yes, it's the fun kind of chemistry, and the chem department at Yale is generally great.",
    "You learn a lot of interesting things and Herzon is a good lecturer",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student if they are interested in organic chemistry or need it for their major. Even though the exams can be a bit difficult, the workload, especially compared to that of the General Chemistry lecture. In addition, it does make organic chemistry really interesting, and if you keep engaged in the course you can learn a lot.",
    "Yes, the class covered many essential topics in organic chemistry and allowed for the development of a in depth understanding of topics, as well as the ability to apply knowledge to problems."
