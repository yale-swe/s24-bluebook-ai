    "You probably need a bio lab, so here are the pros and cons to taking this one. Pros: very little work aside from the exams, no lab reports, cool procedures (you get to make a chimeric mouse embryo and fertilize frog eggs in vitro!). Cons: your grade depends entirely on two exams, the midterm was really hard, you need to be comfortable doing many many mouse dissections. Overall, a cool lab, but think carefully about whether you really want to take a lab where each exam is HALF your grade. The midterm practical was stressful. Study everything in the handouts really hard, even if you don't think it will show up! The final was much more manageable, but you will be a happier camper if you can go in with a good grade on the midterm.",
    "This lab is definitely among the top lab courses I've had at Yale! The lab focuses on reproduction in model organisms, whereas the lecture focuses on human reproduction. It is helpful, but not necessary, to take the two at the same time. Dr. Klein has done an excellent job building a curriculum that allows you to learn real, practical techniques used in reproductive biology, including IVF and embryo transfer, and she's a great teacher. I love the emphasis on practical techniques, too, since there are no lab reports, NO LAB REPORTS, in the class. Most of the work is in class, with lots of great dissections! Highly recommended for MCDB majors and very accessible to non-MCDB majors. Email Dr. Klein early to get a spot, as there is high demand for the course. Grading is based on a practical midterm and a traditional final. The midterm covers the first five labs and consists of quickly identifying structures on slides and in dissected specimens, as well as short answer questions (e.g. When looking at primary\/secondary spermatids, which of these are haploid or diploid cells? What stage of meiosis or mitosis are these cells in?) . Definitely study the diagrams in the handouts really well, as all the cells and tissue slides start to look the same after a while. Most students also haven't had this kind of practical exam before, so I would say the midterm is difficult but manageable if you stay disciplined and review material each week after lab. (I did not do this, and I did okay on the midterm but did NOT enjoy trying to cram everything in the week before the exam.) It's well worth it for the trade-off of not having any lab reports. The final was a traditional written exam, focusing on the procedures of the last five labs and the background information contained in those handouts (e.g. What is the difference between chimeric and mosaic organisms?), with maybe 10% of the questions asking about the first five labs. Pre-lab lectures were informative and helpful. Dr. Klein explains everything thoroughly and clearly, and I learned a lot from this class. Take good notes during lab, and study early. Overall, I would definitely recommend this to any student at Yale!",
    "An okay lab experience. It is a very different mcdb lab course in that it does not require you to pay attention to any of the labs or, really, even do them since the only grades are two exams. I would not take it if you want a guaranteed A. There is no experimentation in the course, just proof of concept exercises for established techniques in the study reproductive biology and genetics. I think it could be improved if there were more grades, honestly. I liked only doing work two days out of the semester for half a credit but half the grade is entirely dependent on whether or not you are naturally gifted at visual memorization and spatial interpretation. There was also no incentive to try during labs especially given that they are, towards the end, unbelievably frustrating.",
    "Yes, this class is a great hands-on biology course. You perform many types of dissections and learn certain surgical techniques very well",
    "Beware of the two 50% exams. It's just a ton of memorization of diagrams and slides. Not really fulfilling and can hurt your grade if you're not good at studying that way.",
    "It seems nice during the semester since there are no labs but the practical and final written exam are death. Do not take it if Klein still is the teacher.",
    "It is a great course if you like hands-on experience. It can get tedious at times, but you'll do things that are really cool.",
    "don't take it",
    "Amazing course material; you will learn fascinating techniques. The weekly work is nothing, other than reading the lab ahead of time. The midterm is hard. Like really really hard. But you will be okay, and it is curved. The final is better. Dr. Klein is such an incredible lab teacher.",
    "It was interesting but a bit difficult",
    "An unbelievable lab, you get to do procedures that no other undergrad lab lets you do. Be aware though, that the grading is 50% practical midterm and 50% written final. The practical midterm was extremely difficult and unlike anything I had ever done before.",
    "One of the cooler bio labs, though dissecting so many animals became kind of disturbing after a while. Both the midterm and final are doable if you really pore over the lab handouts.",
    "Definitely take. No lab reports, but that means the two exams are super difficult.",
    "Definitely take this lab! This is the best bio lab at Yale! Because there are no lab reports, I was able to focus on practicing my technique and not be too stressed if something did not work out. I felt that I learned so much in this lab that I will use in my future bio research career. The midterm and final are definitely hard. For the midterm, study all the diagrams in the handout and go online to see what the slides actually look like and be able to identify all the structures. Professor Klein provides you with links for some of them but you can find most of them online. For the final memorize the procedures as well as the scientific background for some of the labs.",
    "Reproductive Biology Lab is a fascinating course that allows students to get hands-on experience with dissections and assisted reproductive techniques. Professor Klein and the other TFs are very approachable and eager to help. Although it may be uncomfortable working with frogs and mice, the experience and amount of information you learn is worth it! Although there are no lab reports, the course is difficult in the sense that there are only 2 exams (midterm lab practical and final). You will have to seriously study for both exams. Despite all this, if you are looking for a bio lab, this course is great!",
    "Pretty cool lab--offers a reprieve from tedious weekly reports and allows you to explore at your own pace.",
    "Very good lab. You get to do some really interesting hands-on experiments and techniques, with plenty of help from Professor Klein and the TFs. The midterm practical is very difficult, mostly because you can't really study for it away from the lab. Its all identifications with the model organisms you work with in the lab. You have pictures to use when studying, but they honestly aren't that helpful when it comes to identifying the real thing. As such, someone who is used to consistently doing well on hard bio midterms might still struggle quite a bit with this midterm. And the midterm is worth 50% of the grade, which makes getting the grade you want in this class deceptively difficult. Overall though, the labs are very cool and you definitely take the course.",
    "I definitely recommend this lab to anyone! Nowhere else will you get this type of undergraduate experience. And premeds, if you need another bio lab, take this lecture and lab. Definitely worth it! Best lab I've taken.",
    "Very good course in providing introductory biology lab technique skills in a low pressure environment. Students are expected to learn a lot of material, but remain personally accountable since there are no lab reports or periodic homework. Study hard for the midterm and final!"
