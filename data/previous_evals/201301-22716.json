    "It's an interesting class that presents interesting material, but don't take it unless you have to. It's just not worth it the work or uncertainty of the exams.",
    "Much better than Orgo I. More interesting topics. Depends on the professor. Spiegel is very interesting!",
    "Do not take it unless you need to. The course is very much like biochemistry rather than organic chemistry. It simply involves memorizing a bunch of mechanisms. Spiegel gives pop quizzes to ensure attendance and is not a very organized lecturer. The exams are hard (averages are around 50%), but with the curve it's alright.",
    "Spiegal is a horrible professor, not sure how he measures up to the alternatives but be ready to be utterly disincentivized to show up to class despite the occasional 5-minute pop quizzes at the beginning of class. Material is pretty much the same as first semester though, except with a focus on the mechanisms of specific biological processes",
    "Pretty much biochemistry and less of a continuation of orgo when Spiegel teaches it. Take it if you must.",
    "I was really disappointed in this class. The lectures were completely disorganized: we completed 3 chapters of work in two lectures, but there was no material in the lectures, so basically, I had to teach myself an absurd amount of material in very little time. I put in a lot of work, and did not see results due to Spiegel's absurd grading policy. This needs a lot of work to fix and make meaningful. Lectures were not even worth going to because all he talked about was biology. It was a struggle the whole way through, not because the material was difficult, but because it was impossible to follow the lectures\/ syllabus due to numerous changes.",
    "A solid class. A bit dry at times but worth taking. The curve is decent and I would recommend taking it. Be ready to do quite a bit of studying on your own and in groups.",
    "It's orgo. It lives up to its reputation. It sucks. Don't take it unless you have to, or unless you REALLY REALLY REALLY loved orgo I.",
    "I'm assuming you have to take this class, so good luck",
    "This course was more biochemistry than organic chemistry, which is disappointing considering that if you're premed, you missed out on one of the few ways you will ever learn organic chemistry, especially for the MCAT, and you're probably going to take biochemistry later anyways. It requires a lot of memorization of biology-related pathways and its focus is more on biology with applied chemistry. I took this over the second semester of freshman orgo, but I'm not entirely sure if I would have done so if I had to make the choice again. Spiegel's not extremely helpful and a few times class was canceled or taught by a professor who had to substitute for him. The grading in the class is generous though, as in while it's extremely difficult to get an A, it's not too stressful if you're aiming for an A- or B+ or B.",
    "Material is amazing. Don't take with Spiegel.",
    "This was probably the most disappointing class I've taken at Yale. It's not just that the class was very difficult--the first semester of organic chemistry was difficult, too--it's that this class managed to make me not really care about learning the material, not even for the sake of getting a good grade. That's significant because I thought that the class would be interesting--it's the chemistry of biologicalpathways, all about carbohydrates and proteins and other interesting things.From the start, there was little incentive to really try hard. It's pretty easy to get a B, next to impossible to get an A. (2 out of 150 people will get an A.)Next, the class was 90% memorization. That may not have been the intent, but that's what happened, and I simply was not willing to put in the time to cram dozens of complex molecules and mechanisms into my head. (Up until last year, before Professor Spiegel taught the course, exams were open-book, which I think would do a lot to promote a deeper comprehension of the material rather than just memorization.) I'd work to get a solid conceptual understanding of the major pathways, but that's about it--partly because we didn't exactly know what we were supposed to be learning. Not even my TA knew what we were supposed to do before the first exam. So for section we mostly raced rapid-fire through a bunch of mechanisms at a pace where I couldn't even write them down, let alone follow along. Luckily, section was optional, and I started doing better in the class (i.e. a bit above average) because I stopped stressing about it. One problem with this was that it made it more difficult for me to ask my TA any questions. The TAs all sat at the top of the lecture hall, and unless we had to turn in a problem set, they were gone as soon Professor Spiegel finished. I've never seen someone leave a room so fast.Even the main textbook (I'm talking about McMurry, not Loudon) is pretty bad. There are several mistakes throughout the book (come on, they got the structures of glutamate and aspartate wrong?), and the authors like to skip steps in mechanisms or draw molecules in non-intuitive ways, making some sections difficult to follow.Finally, Professor Spiegel. He assumes a lot of prior knowledge (and a lot of enthusiasm for the class...), which leads him to gloss over a lot of major mechanisms and ideas in favor of minutiae. He goes off on long tangents all the time. A lot of them arequite interesting; others are meant to allow him to talk about his accomplishments (I did stay in section long enough to hear my TA discuss how many times Professor Spiegel would bring up his going to medical school). Also, we had several pop quizzes, which would be fine except for that a lot of them were saved for the worst possible days--the first class after an exam, the last day of class, days when it was pouring rain and the buses were all full so you walked up Science Hill, drenched, only to find that you missed a pop quiz... so he's also kind of a subtle dick.It's a shame. At the beginning of the semester, I thought the class would be pretty interesting. I don't really care now.",
    "Absolutely my worst experience at Yale so far, and I usually don't care if classes aren't good. If Spiegel is teaching it, do not take the course. Seriously. You literally just listen to him babble about whatever he feels like talking about for 50 minutes, three times a week, then occasionally a random pset will be thrown at you, which you complete in about 10 minutes while you watch TV and think about dogs or whatever. You basically have no idea what you should be doing until the tests arrive, at which point you realize you suddenly have to learn something. But what is it you're supposed to learn..? You don't know, the TAs don't know, and Spiegel probably doesn't know because he writes the test in 10 minutes while he watches TV and thinks about dogs or whatever. I had no idea what I was doing in this class, the tests were truly impossible to study for if you didn't want to spend a week memorizing the entire textbook, and I left the class with no greater appreciation for the subject. I loved Orgo 1 with Herzon, but this class was ridiculous.",
    "AVOID TAKING THIS CLASS WITH SPIEGEL AT ALL COSTS. He was a terrible lecturer, not because he's incapable of teaching, but because he put no effort into this class. Lectures were random, disjointed, and generally on material either not covered in the textbook or totally irrelevant; we finished the course months off of the syllabus. Tests were hard, and unfair as Spiegel didn't tell us what to study for them. That being said, we've all experienced these same frustrations with other Yale Chemistry classes; and yet again, I left this class feeling jaded and frustrated with science more broadly. I guess my frustration is particularly acute with this one because it's the first Yale science class I was genuinely excited for: the material is SO fascinating! and, unlike other BS premed classes, relevant! In all, a terrible, frustrating experience - but Spiegel curves to a B+, so at least there's that.",
    "Personally, I found this class to be a lot more interesting than first semester orgo. The medical applications are fascinating, and Professor Spiegel's explanations were really interesting. The tests were really difficult, but the curve is generous. Professor Spiegel wants to ensure that everyone is able to pass the class, so most people get a B\/B+. You probably have to take this class to fulfill major\/pre-med requirements.",
    "You learn the mechanisms behind glycolysis, tca cycle, fatty acid biosynthesis, and amino acid catabolism. Spiegel was awful, so don't take it if you don't have to.",
    "The lectures are interesting, as Professor Spiegel focuses mostly on the medical applications of the chemistry. However, don't expect to be taught any organic chemistry in this class. You'll be learning all of it on your own, or maybe from your TA if you're lucky. When it comes to exams, the TAs didn't even know what we should study, so we were all guessing at what would be on the test (wrongly most of the time). It's not worth studying at all for his exams, as the odds of something you studied appearing on the test are close to none. He made us memorize glycolysis (the whole thing), and I think it appeared once in a very minor question on a midterm. On the upside, this class is not a lot of work, as the problem sets generally take 15 minutes and we only had 5 spread throughout the semester.",
    "Not if you don't have to",
    "Overall, challenging but quite interesting course. Take it only if you need to.",
    "This is a TERRIBLE course. The lecture was unclear, and almost completely unrelated to the problem sets and what we were tested on. If Spiegel is teaching this course next year I will seriously second guess Yale's ability to develop in the STEM fields.However, the material coveredreally could be interesting if it wasn't presented so terribly.",
    "This could be an interesting course, but it all depends on you Professor.",
    "Basically a mix of biochem and organic chemistry. The subject was more interesting than orgo I and much easier. The grading was very nice.",
    "Pretty much a biochemistry class with a little more focus on electron-pushing.If you've taken MB&B 300 before, you don't even have to go to lecture.",
    "This course could be passable as an organic chemistry course if there was any form of communication between the first semester and second semester professors and if those professors knew the objectives of the course. On the first issue, Professor Spiegel believed we knew a lot more organic chemistry than we actually did, so he tended to gloss over the actual chemistry that was tested on exams and would go on long tangents about the biological pathways in a way that was 1) above what one should be expected to learn in an undergraduate organic chemistry course and 2) not testable. This resulted in our tests' averages being ridiculously low because we were not prepared to perform the chemistry (arrow-pushing, reactivity) that was expected of us. While I understand that this course is about biological pathways, I can say that I learned no more organic chemistry than I did in first semester. I think everyone in the course scrambled to learn the complex biological pathways (citric acid cycle, glycolysis, gluconeogenesis) for the tests, but would forget it immediately after when we had to go through learning more complex biological pathways. I feel that if the professor would have focused more on the carbonyl chemistry, we would have gotten out a somewhat passable organic chemistry education. Something that is absolutely appalling is that we did not learn NMR or IR spectroscopy in either first or second semester organic chemistry. The continuity between this course is something that I think is absolutely imperative that the chemistry department addresses and I hope that the department takes this evaluation seriously as constructive criticism.",
    "This class sucked. The tests were really hard. Lectures didn't correspond to what was being tested on the exams so I had to learn a lot on my own. Spiegel got on huge tangents all the time. Spiegel also got pissed that a lot people showed up late all the time so he started having pop quizzes in the beginning of class which sucked.",
    "I highly advise against taking this class with Spiegel! Spiegel does not teach you chemistry, but you will learn a lot of biology and medical facts that are not at all tested on the exams. All the exams tested reaction mechanisms that were not adequately covered in class, and they were extremely hard! The average on the third midterm was a 28, so that explains how the class really suffered and how the professor expected so much out of us. Professor Spiegel can also be very rude, especially during his office hours, and he is also not flexible in arranging an individual meeting with anyone. He also gave pop quizzes because he wanted us to be in class on time (but there were several days he was late to class.) He even gave a pop quiz on the last day of class! He explained to us the way he curves the class, and to get an A, you have to get greater than 1.5 standard deviations above the average (which is like 7% of the class). But if you do take this class, you will be very prepared for biochemistry because you will learn in detail several biochemical pathways.",
    "dont take it unless you have to.",
    "You probably have to take this class, and I would recommend it. However, you should do the supplemental readings and actually try to understand all the chemistry rather than the rote memorization technique employed by many students in the class.",
    "This class is very similar to biochem. This was Spiegles first time teaching the class and I think he struggled a little bit with how to structure, format and organize the class. Many times he just rambled about useless things that were not on the exam, so it was difficult to know what to study for each exam. All in all, I feel as though I'll be prepared for biochem next semester.",
    "Spiegel is absolutely horrible.ABSOLUTE WORST class I've ever taken at Yale...ever. Here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a comprehensive list on why.1. So the midterms are ridiculous. The questions are remarkably more difficult than anything we learn in class, in the textbook, or on the problem sets.When the average for the exam is a 28 and the entire class of approximately 175 students comprises of the most brilliant scientists, chemists, biologists, engineers, and premeds from all across the world, then you know there's a problem. This shows that the exam does not accurately reflect the students' knowledge\/intelligence on what is taught.Not only that, but on the last midterm, a mechanism that involved the reactant Malonyl Coenzyme A did not have the structure of Malonyl Coenzyme A written in. How is anyone supposed to know how to draw an entire mechanism when one of the biomolecular reactants required for the mechanism is missing?! Let me answer that for you--you're not.2. Spiegel puts the highest grade, lowest grade, class mean, and standard deviation on the board. I don't see the point of putting the highest grade on the board other than to inflate that individual's arrogant ego. I also don't see the point of putting the lowest grade on the board for the whole class to see other than to make that individual feel like total crap that they're the dumbest person in the entire class.3. Let me add to this by saying that after the 3rd midterm was handed back, Spiegel asked the students why the highest scoring student did better than everyone else and suggested that that individual was smarter, studying properly while everyone else wasn't, putting inmore efficient effort than everyone else, etc. As if there weren't enough intellectual friction and feelings of inadequacy and incompetence amongst Yale's student body already! To establish a dichotomous, intellectual fissure amongst the entire Orgo class and suggest that 1 person was doing something more right than everyone else was just wrong. I could not believe he had the nerve to do that.4. He had the audacity to continuously punish Yalies for coming late to his 9:25 AM class up Science Hill.Everyone takes a shuttle in the morning--to avoid the long trek up science hill when he\/she is already running late from wanting to sleep some more or wanting to grab breakfast first.And it just so happens that the shuttle, an entity that is completely separated from Yale's institution likes to come at a time that would cause students to be 2-3 minutes late to class everyday. That is just how it is.And so, Spiegel took it upon himself to give out quizzes during the first 5 minutes of class so that those who take the shuttle (who he claimed to be highly distracting and disturbing to the students and to him in class) won't be able to take it and would get a 0 on it. He stated that this was to punish and prevent continuous, dilatory behavior.5. Spiegel has everything on powerpoints. When you're taking a class like Organic Chemistry where everything is mechanistic, the most effective way to transmit this information to students is by using traditional chalk and blackboard--NOT a powerpoint in which you just read off entire obstruse mechanisms. This made it nearly impossible to learn anything from going to class.6. Spiegel never tells you what's going to be on his exams. He essentially implies that everything will be on the exam and gives false clues about the exams' contents. For example, on the first midterm, we had learn all of the 50 or so mechanistic steps of glycolysis--none of that was on the exam.On the third exam, we learned amino acid metabolism (especially the urea cycle) and lipid metabolism and was told to memorize the structures of all 20 amino acids. On the exam, there was in fact not a single question regarding the structure of ANY amino acid or the urea cycle.Take Andy Phillip\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Orgo class.3 He is AMAZING!!!",
    "A course you take because you have to. Obviously. You're stuck with the professor you've been dealt that semester, and unfortunately that can radically change your experience. Spiegel is an organizational disaster, and everything changes all the time. You really have to work at it like first semester. But you know what you're getting yourself into. Be prepared for biochem with arrow-pushing. That's Chem 230 in a nutshell.",
    "A requirement and a culling ritual, nothing more. Spiegel has a very lenient grading policy but often rambles and his lectures make it difficult to figure out which information is important.",
    "I was very disappointed in this class, specifically Dr. Spiegel. The class was very disorganized at time, and exams almost impossible to study for. Things will be emphasized in class to a point that you feel you will fail without knowing them, and then never be questioned on an exam.",
    "This class is painful. There's no way to sugar coat it. I actually liked Orgo I by the end but found myself hating Orgo II more and more as the semester went on. Spiegel seems like a nice guy and is sometimes entertaining, but he just cannot lecture in any structured way. He goes off on tangents and returns with like 10 minutes left in class to go over an entire metabolic pathway. Not good. Also his random quizzes are just that-- I don't understand the rationale behind them at all. Kate is a good TA if she is doing it again, and also Shuming I hear is really good. They understand your suffering and try to help out as much as they can.",
    "Avoid this class if it's taught by the same professor (David Spiegel). It is, in one word, hectic. The professor doesn't teach all the relevant information. The exams almost never cover the information mentioned in lecture. The syllabus is susceptible to change. You will leave knowing a lot, but that goes for any organic chemistry course. I recommend, if possible, taking the non-bio oriented organic chemistry course.",
    "If you're taking it you have to. I wouldn't recommend taking for fun unless you love memorization and chemistry.",
    "This class will not help you in understanding chemistry unless you are guided by some resource that can provide insight into how to form an intuition of chemical reactivity.",
    "Chances are, if you are thinking about taking Orgo, you are pre-med or have to fulfill some sort of requirement. This is a class that you have to take and it's impossible to avoid it. Just make sure you stay on top of the course material and do a lot of practice problems. Spiegel sometimes gives pop quizzes at the beginning of the class, so try to arrive on time.",
    "Take it if you have to. I took it for fun and spent a lot of time worrying about my grade. If you really like chemistry and you want to take this class, you might find yourself in for a surprise, since there's a considerable amount of biology. (We were tested mainly on chemistry, but class material was very biology-based.)",
    "Decent class. Could be improved for sure.",
    "If you're pre-med, you have to take it. Stay on top of your work and study hard. It is a tough class, there's no way around that. Take it with a professor other than Prof. Spiegel if you can.",
    "Usually you are taking it if you have to but there it's like a chem-heavy biochem class",
    "absolutely the worst course i've ever taken here so far. and i can say with confidence that it will most likely be the worst course i will take here ever. made me wish i went to harvard",
    "More of a hybrid between orgo 2 and biochem. Focuses heavily on biological pathways.",
    "This course was overall a terrible experience. Lectures were filled with theories and medical or research applications and had NOTHING to do with the mechanistic principles that were tested on the exams. Professor Spiegel is rude, and going to lecture is pointless except for his pop quizzes that stem from his anger management issues.",
    "NO. Avoid this class. The professor cannot teach and the powerpoints and his lecture are useless to study for the tests, which means you will basically never know what to study for the tests. Sometimes, he will cover stuff not taught yet. He also is very rude during office hours and is impatient. Professor Spiegel should never be teaching this class again, and you will learn more by taking the other organic chemistry class. There are pop quizzes too. If you are one minute late, he will not take them. The low averages on our midterms should tell you what a wonderful teacher he is.",
    "I would wait for a different instructor. The curve makes it very hard to get an A (1.5stdev above the average), and the class is not particularly well taught. Lecture was not very clear\/focused on important material, and problem sets\/exams don't always seem to reflect what was learned. If you're a freshman and Miller is still teaching 125, I would take that instead - I regret not doing so.",
    "Chem 230 in my opinion was more interesting than the first semester of Orgo because you apply all the chemistry to biology. It's still not a great class, but ultimately one you have to take if you're premed.",
    "I would recommend this course to pre-meds who must take it. Otherwise you will not learn very much organic chemistry. This class ends up being mostly memorization because of the nature of the material.",
    "Take it for the information, but expect to self-teach yourself a majority of the info if Spiegel is involved, and if you want a good grade. By no means an easy course.",
    "The class was very very frustrating. The lecture was so different from section\/the exams. Make sure you go to section and keep up on material from the textbook. The exams are very difficult and the influx of freshmen does not help the curve at all. Seek help from the TAs for exams, and don't expect anything talked about in lecture to show up on the tests. In addition, the textbook is awful and has very few practice problems. In many instances, the first time I would see a practice problem after studying would be on the exam-not good. I often felt like the class was mostly memorization. I was unprepared for exams, not knowing how to study. When studying for the final, it all made more sense, but by that time, was too late.",
    "The only reason most people take this class is for pre-med. Therefore, you probably have to take it regardless of this review. That said, Prof. Spiegel's version was alright. Nothing to brag about but nothing to complain about either. It is mostly self-taught, so be prepared for that. Most of the things you learn will be straight memorization. Problem sets were fine and nothing too crazy, so don't worry about those. Tests were hard (as evidenced by averages in the mid 50's and one in the high 20's).",
    "A note about this class (I took it with David Spiegel, so this information might only apply to his class): don't take it unless you have to for pre-med requirements. If you're a freshman, stay in freshman orgo--you'll learn more and it'll be more relevant for the MCATs. The class I took was basically a biochemistry class, and, believe it or not, I actually expected to learn some organic chemistry. So anyway, sophomore pre-meds, I'm sorry, but you're kinda stuck and you should just hope that you don't have Professor Spiegel. If not, at least it'll make biochem easier for you. For everyone else, I recommend that you take a different course.",
    "Necessary for premed. But if you're a chem major just take freshman if you can",
    "Spiegel has a tough grade distribution and you'll have to teach yourself all the material from the textbook.",
    "This was a terribly taught course. Professor Spiegel just stood at the front and rambled for most lectures. He was clearly more interested in his own research than teaching us. It's unfortunately the chemistry department doesn't place more emphasis on teaching quality because the material itself was fascinating. Try to take this course with a different professor!",
    "Chem 230 is unlike the first semester of Orgo, it is heavily based on biological processes bordering on what you would expect in biochem. We spent 2 long weeks on glycolysis and the most applicable information you gain is how to do carbonyl chemistry very very well.",
    "This course taught interesting, useful material if you are interested in chemistry and biology. It can be a little stressful, so I don't really recommend it unless you have to take it.",
    "I enjoyed this class, though it was far from perfect. The biological aspect of it made it way more interesting than first semester. I was very happy that Itook the ssophomore version (I took Freshman Orgo first semester). This class was frustratingly disorganized, but it was very little work and the content was genuinely interesting.",
    "This course can be very frustrating if one does not know how to study for it. For the midterms there was too much emphasis on memorization and overall there was less focus on knowing the actual chemistry and the basic reactions. The last three weeks of the class were very non chemistry related",
    "Wait to take it with someone other than Spiegel.",
    "rambling, irrelevant lectures, little real organic chemistry being taught, and a professor who habitually undermines the ability of his TAs to properly communicate the material to their students. Avoid if possible, other professors will make the topic much more enjoyable and worthwhile.",
    "TAKE WITH A DIFFERENT PROFESSOR!!!!! Spiegel is rude, a terrible instructor, and refuses to offer As. Even if you are a good student, in fact especially if you are a good student, you will have a TERRIBLE time",
    "Interesting and great for anyone interested in studying the chemical processes in the body",
    "Most of you have to take it. And some of the information is useful. However, most of the learning you will do on your own. If it is with Professor Spiegel do not take it. He is terrible and doesnot teach at all. You will just end up confused and forced to memorize a lot of information without having the tools to actually understand what any of it means.",
    "This class basically covers a few topics: glycolysis, citric acid cycle, fatty acid synthesis, fatty acid degradation, triglycerol synthesis and degradation, amino acid transamination\/ deamination, the Urea cycle, some key mechanisms that have to do with carbonyl chemistry such as immine formation, aldol\/ retroaldol reaction, conjugate addition\/ michael reaction, acyl substitution, claisen condensation, and etc. Under this professor, you basically need to learn everything yourself and really understand how molecules work in order to get a good grade. Through this professor's grading system only ten people in the class will get A's while a lot of people will get B+'s and A-'s so it's really hard to get an A in this class according to his grading system. I would recommend this class only to students who are really good at organic chemistry.",
    "This chemistry course was what I expected in terms of topics. It was about biological pathways. It was about organic chemistry. However, I felt that it was poorly taught. I felt that I did not learn much more from the lectures than from what I could get from the required textbook. In fact, I was more prepared for the exams from what the TAs had to say from section than from what Professor Spiegel said in class.I would say if you can take it with Professor Phillips. My friends who took CHEM230 with him had a much more enjoyable time than I did, struggling through this class with Professor Spiegel.",
    "Decent Chem Course...",
    "Dont take this class unless you absolutely have to. I thought there was no way a class could be worse than first semester Orgo...I was sadly very wrong.",
    "Terrible. This was probably the worst class I've taken at Yale so far. I probably could have learned more by NOT going to lecture. Of everything that was presented in lecture, about 85% of it was irrelevant. I feel like most of the time, Professor Spiegel was just trying to prove his MD-PhD status to us. On the first day of class, Professor Spiegel seemed like a great professor. He explained the molecular orbital theory well, and I thought it was going to be a great semester compared to last semester with Professor Herzon. Boy was I wrong. At least Professor Herzon taught us organic chemistry; Professor Spiegel taught us--I don't even know.Professor Spiegel liked to use the word \"intuit\" a lot. Many many times he would say, \"You don't have to memorize this. I don't want you to memorize it. You should be able to intuit it.\" ...We also didn't cover everything on the syllabus because a) (read the above), b) Professor Spiegel had 3-4 guest lecturers who pretty much just went over what we already \"learned\" (but were much better at teaching the material by the way), c) Professor Spiegel completely canceled a class because he had to be somewhere else and couldn't find a sub, d) he taught organic chemistry off of PowerPoint slides--organic chemistry shouldn't be taught off of PPT. period.On the brighter side of this dim, dark mess, the TAs were great. I feel like I learned more from going to discussion section than going to lecture.",
    "I thought the material in the course was very interesting, and I enjoyed it. What we learned was much more applicable than first semester orgo. However, I thought the class itself was disorganized. We spent weeks on glycolysis after we had already had a test on it, and some of the lectures were focused on biology, not chemistry. As a result, it was sometimes very difficult to figure out what to take away from lecture and what we were supposed to be learning.",
    "If you put the time into studying what you have to, you'll get a lot out of it.",
    "It was a tough course. There is a lot of material and I would only take this course if it was needed for a requirement.",
    "The subject material is interesting, and the professor is interested in the material, but I think the course would benefit from some more organization",
    "I enjoyed the class, but I just did so horribly on the tests (as did everybody), that it confuses me as to whether to recommend it to others.",
    "Honestly, if you can take it with a different professor, consider doing so. This was one of the most miserable experiences of my Yale career. You don't really learn anything, largely because everything is disorganized and you're never really sure what you covered and what you didn't.",
    "DO NOT TAKE IT WITH SPIEGEL. Worst professor I've ever had. You don't learn anything in lecture, and then he actually expects you to understand chemistry on the exam. I actually like organic chemistry (or I did the first semester), and I really would have rather taken the pure organic chemistry course for freshmen, but as a sophomore, alas, I could not. Hopefully there is a different teacher when you consider taking the course.",
    "Intelligent, fantastic researcher, I am sure, but not a good teacher. He used the blackboard as a tool to help him organize his own thoughts rather than a means of conveying the information to students. No practice tests, practice exam questions, or anything resembling what we could expect for the exam. Taking the course with Spiegel was like wading through quicksand in foggy weather.That being said, very interesting material. It really builds on what you learned in orgo I, and I would recommend the course for people who don't have to take this for their major. The things you learn are extremely applicable - how to go from lipids to sugars to amino acids to urea.. even if you have no interest in the medical profession, it's fascinating stuff.",
    "Do not take this class unless you need it for your major. If you need it for your major, may the curve be with you.",
    "This is not an easy course but take it with a positive mindset. Make sure you do a lot of practice problems as the problem sets are very short.",
    "Chem 230, taught by Dr. Spiegel, is not an orgo class; it is a biochem class with mechanisms. Although I came away from the class with a deeper understanding of glycolysis, the krebs cycle, and some lipid biosynthesis, a lot of the course material was rushed, especially protein synthesis and degradation. I would not recommend this course, but if you need to take orgo II, I doubt you have another choice.",
    "A horrible course, I do not recommend it."
