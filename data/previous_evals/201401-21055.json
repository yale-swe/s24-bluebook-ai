    "This was a cool class! I recommend it. Note that it's A LOT of reading. It takes FOR. EVER. to get through Moby-Dick, especially if you want to read it well rather than just glean basic information about the plot. (But Moby-Dick is AMAZING and you have to read it before you graduate.) For students who haven't encountered him before, Deming is pretty intimidating in seminar. He will really push students to make points that are clear rather than vague, and it feels awkward and uncomfortable when he presses you on something you said and you can't come up with answers, but if he's doing that it's a good sign -- it means you're onto something and need to develop it more. He's also awesome in office hours and everyone should absolutely go at one time or another. This isn't a downside for everybody but it definitely was for me -- Deming really likes the flag-waving American Studies FOOT crowd that laughs at his jokes, so expect his seminars (other than the intro ones that people preregister for) to be super populated by those types. It gets tiresome, in my opinion. In terms of papers, Deming is a pretty harsh grader. I'd say it isn't too tough to get a B+ or A-, but As are rare. I can't confirm this because my sample size is just too small, but I gather that he prefers the intellectually ambitious paper that isn't perfect to the polished paper that makes small, uninteresting claims, however well argued.",
    "A very intense but a very fruitful pseudo philosophy class.",
    "This class was so great. Readings were interesting, and Deming really knows how to lead a seminar, provoking and pushing on big thoughts and theories from the students. One of the best classes I've taken.",
    "A wonderful, wonderful course. Terrific reading with a terrific professor. If it's offered again, take it.",
    "Yes! These books are so important to understanding parts of American culture, and reading and discussing them was a joy. It was also a fun challenge to write a 15 page paper at the end of the semester to synthesize what we learned.",
    "Absolutely. This is an amazing class. The material is amazing. Professor Deming is amazing. One of my favorite classes at Yale. If these authors interest you, take it. I only say that the workload is great because the work makes you want to work really hard on your papers. Because the questions they raise are questions that are hard to answer and you'll want to throw yourself into answering them.",
    "Classic seminar set up.",
    "Great texts and a wonderful teacher to lead the way.",
    "Amazing. Deming is one of the most hardworking and talented seminar leaders I have ever seen. He draws an incredible amount from the texts and from the students, and I would absolutely recommend taking this class with him.",
    "The hype is high and COMPLETELY MERITED. The material is engaging and I think speaks the hearts and minds of students at this phase of life. Prof. Deming is hilarious and brilliant, and with the people who show up with a vested interest in these authors, you know it's going to be a good time. TAKE IT! I've never wanted to work harder on papers in my life. Highest ratio of mind blown to seminar meetings I've had yet. I clearly rated this course as \"excellent.\" I think there's often rating inflation to match grade inflation at this school. But if we lived in a course evaluation system where you had one \"Super Excellent\" (like your Master Ball--you only have one and your journey isn't over yet but you are pretty sure this is an ultra rare one) I'd use it now.",
    "Take it! Deming is so, so brilliant and such a wonderful professor, the readings are really wonderful, and Deming weaves them together very well.",
    "A great, detailed study of some great American writers.",
    "These three authors - and their texts - are life changing. I say that without hyperbole. You will be reading at a breakneck pace, all semester long, and still, probably, fall behind, and you will work yourself in knots over your various papers (2; a 7-page midterm and a 15-page final). But you will emerge on the other end a much stronger thinker, both out-loud and on the page, with all sorts of new ways to see the world. Take this class if you have any inkling of desire to read Emerson's essays or Moby-Dick or explore the dark recesses of Hawthorne's mind. You won't regret it.",
    "This is a life-changing course, and without a doubt the best I have taken at Yale. If you have the good fortune to be accepted, sign up and commit every possible effort to the work assigned; everything you dedicate to this class will come back to you tenfold. Professor Deming has a fantastic talent for creating intellectual community and camaraderie, and you'll find yourself learning just as much from the discussions in class as from the readings (which are absolutely wonderful). Pursue this course as aggressively as you dare, and let it become a major part of your life -- you absolutely will not regret it.",
    "This was an absolutely fantastic class in which Deming's clear passion for this (admittedly wonderful) material rubbed off on everyone in the seminar. I think that class discussion was so strong in part because of the mix of people in this particular seminar, but my sense is that Deming picks people that he already knows will be enthusiastic and attentive. My only quibble with the class format was that Deming would call on people in a predetermined order (so, hands would go up to make comments, and then Deming would assign an order for the next five people to comment, then call on them in turn) which meant that discussion sometimes didn't flow well, because the fourth person to be called on might be responding to the first, when discussion had already taken a different turn by then. In spite of this, though, I can't recommend this class enough - it was the most joyful English class I've taken so far."
