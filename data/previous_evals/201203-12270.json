   "comments": [
    "I have no idea why this is intro Greek, because it was the most INTENSE introduction to a language I've ever experienced, but it was a fun class and you leave knowing some Greek some how. I say this as someone who is not at all fond of the book.",
    "If you have a good reason for learning ancient Greek (and there are many good reasons to do so: reading Greek philosophy, the New Testament, drama, history, and more generally being an all-around better and smarter human being who can speak intelligently about the classical tradition and why it is so exciting and important), then you'll be pleased to know that this class is well-conducted, fast-paced (although still very reasonable), and an overall good experience. I enjoyed having a class that gave me an excuse to take a break from reading and writing in order to memorize verb forms or make flash cards. A few caveats: ancient Greek is a lot easier when you already know Latin, and I suspect that the students in the class who didn't know Latin may have been at a slight disadvantage. The identity of your Greek instructor matters! Jelle was absolutely fantastic and often explained things in a more concise way than the book (\"The most massive text currently available for the teaching of elementary ancient Greek in this country\" --review on the back). Jelle was also very understanding about missing class every once in a while or walking in five minutes late, which really makes all the difference in the world. I'm not sure I would have liked this class at all if the instructor had been more strict about small things like this. Also, make flash cards for the vocabulary. It will make your life a lot easier come finals. Overall, this is a great class! It's fun and you actually learn a vast majority of the grammar you need to know to start reading Plato next spring. Do it!",
    "Greek 110 is a really good class. The class doesn't move too quickly, but you really feel like you've learned a substantial amount of Ancient Greek by the end of the semester.",
    "A difficult but worthwhile introduction to Attic Greek. If you're up to the challenge, dive in!",
    "Be prepared for a lot of time commitment outside of the classroom, but be also prepared to be amazed at the progress you will make in the language if your dedication is sincere.",
    "I think this is a great class if you're interested in learning Ancient Greek. The class doesn't cover so much material that it's impossible but you also learn new things every day and really have to keep up. Jelle is a great teacher, and will also meet with you after class if you need to go over stuff. Also, I don't think there's any point taking this class if you don't also take GREK 120, so be prepared for that.",
    "It's definitely a lot of new grammar at a fast rate, as I imagine any L1 class would be. Lots of straight memorization. I imagine if you're interested in taking this class, you know what you're getting into, though. It can be fun and rewarding if you like languages and the classics, but I wouldn't recommend taking it unless this interest is sincere."
