    "Definitely take this class, and I would highly recommend Francoise Schneider! Although it has a reputation for being difficult, the workload is manageable for those with a strong background in French. It's the only course about modern French society and culture among the upper-level courses, which tend to focus exclusively on literature.",
    "Absolutely! This course gives you practical knowledge of French culture and invaluable information if you ever plan on studying abroad in France.",
    "A very good class. Excellent balance of work and learning, seriousness and levity. Good exposure to French current events and a little but of pop culture. The compositions were a good exercise in maintaining writing abilities without being too much work. This is the way a French class should be - mostly focused on conversation.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to any francophile.",
    "There is more writing than you think there will be. The workload is comparable to every other French class. It's definitely a great step in your French career."
