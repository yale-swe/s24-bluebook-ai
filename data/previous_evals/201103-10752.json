   "comments": [
    "PATH 690 is a valuable course providing a survey of several diseases and their underlying pathology.I would recommend this course to anyone interested in the etiology of disease and the underlying molecular mechanisms that can be leveraged for therapy.",
    "yes I would recommend this course",
    "Yes",
    "I particularly liked the material, delivery method and class discussions. I liked the variety of topics and different lecturers. I would highly recommend it to anyone seeking to learn more about the major disease processes.",
    "Good overview class. You don't learn much in depth (due to the nature of the course) but very interesting overall.",
    "Yes, I would! It's great to broaden your eyesight.",
    "it is an excellent course to take whether it is a requirement or not, because it gives you a great insight into the underlying molecular causes and mechanisms of various diseases; just as its description implies.",
    "I like to think of it as \"1000 ways to die.\" In all seriousness, I would stress that it is an overview of the molecular biology of many common and some not-so-common diseases. I would recommend it to any student who is interested in learning more about medical\/translational research.",
    "Summary: great course that provides very interesting information about various aspects of pathologyYes I would recommend it",
    "yes i would recommend the class. it was pretty chill and not that painful. learned a lot. especially about inflammation which i didn't know that much about before.",
    "I will definitely recommend this course to another student because this course is so interesting and helpful with students in BBS program. This course introduces different diseases and helps us to develop a good ability of analyzing problems and generating new ideas.",
    "This course is essentially an introduction to medicine for scientists. I would recommend this course to a fellow graduate student but not to a medical student.",
    "I would highly recommend it.",
    "I will recommend this course to others.Although there are a lot of work to be done during this course, each of them is reasonable and useful to profound our knowledge on disease.",
    "Path 690 is an excellent course to take if you want to arm yourself with some fundamental and up-to-date knowledge about the pathogenesis, drug discovery and development of therapeutics for some of the most important diseases ranging from infectious diseases (viral, bacterial, parasitic), cardivascular diseases, psychiatric disorders, inflammatory bowel diseases, e.t.c"

   "comments": [
    "taught good clinical applications of some research areas",
    "Very helpful!",
    "This course provided important information for future research. Although it wasn't required for my major, I thought the information would be good for me to know. I believe that it will be helpful in my profession.",
    "It helps me to know more about all kinds of disease and its molecular mechanism, which might help me choosing my rotation labs.",
    "it was very helpful in thinking and learning about different types of diseases besides the one that interests me the most.",
    "I haven't started my thesis work yet, so that is difficult to say. Most of the lectures weren't directly relevant to my discipline, but I have other course requirements that provide that knowledge, so I didn't really take this course intending to learn about that. However, given that Dr. Robeck is a virologist, I thought he did a good job of presenting research in that area.",
    "Relevant, a lot of overlap with my discipline. Very helpful",
    "like the mix between clinical perspective and pathology.",
    "Since I am in immunology track and focus on certain kinds of diseases, and this pathology course introduces diseases in a different view from immunology, which helps me gain a better understanding of what I am working on. Very good course and greatly helpful.",
    "Some of the lectures demonstrated research that I was not familiar with in medical areas in which I was (e.g. new immunologic targets for hypertension). The best lecture in this course directly related to my research, cancer stem cells, however, did not really add any information that I had not read already over the past year.",
    "Yes.",
    "I learned many new insights on major diseases, which I most appreciate for.One thing that I unsatisfied with was the lecture on Alzheimer's disease.The lecturer didn't offer us as much knowledge as I expected; he should have taught us in more depth about AD rather than just talked about the overall nature of AD and the current hypotheses for it as if he was talking to the general public."
