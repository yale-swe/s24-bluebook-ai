    "Really interesting look into the history of the Ballet Russes and some of its most important performances. I learned a ton about the Ballet Russes and the artistic movements that shaped their works and just overall feel like a more cultured person. Professor Paul is awesome too!",
    "A great 5th course that was really enjoyable and I came out with a very wideranging knowledge of the Modernist artistic movement in dance and other art forms.",
    "If you have any interest in modernity, literature, dance, scenic design, fine art, French studies, Russian studies, fashion, music, ballet, or European studies, this is your course.The readings are well-chosen, interesting, and not too long; the instructor is engaging, well-spoken, and enjoyable; the workload is not ridiculously extensive; and the interdisciplinary elements make this a course worth exploring.",
    "would definitely recommend. surprisingly ended up being one of my favorite classes here because of the topic, interesting readings and people from different disciplines and such a nice professor",
    "It's quite strange to be taking a class which is just about the Ballets Russes, seeing that it's quite a niche subject, but it has been fascinating. If you're a dancer, like me and many others in the class, this course does have less of a dance focus than you might expect (it focusses more on the history and music), but it's great nonetheless and gets you into so many different interesting areas. Professor Paul is wonderful, so helpful and enthusiastic, and she really makes the class what it is.",
    "Definitely really fun and random.",
    "YES! TAKE IT!",
    "Prof. Paul is a great teacher, and she really cares about her students. The readings can be really hard though, especially if you're not particularly interested or knowledgeable about the subject. If you're interested in the topic she's teaching and really dedicated to learning the background info, take her class! If you're not super fascinated by the topic though, the class can seem difficult or boring."
