   "comments": [
    "Short! Get out between 2:30 PM and 3:30 PM in almost every lab.Stuff you have to do - experimental plans (EPs) before labs, lab notes (LNs) after lab, and post-lab assignments (PLs) are a real pain. Not too much work, but just a total waste of time. Lab notes are more of a small lab writeup than real lab notes... you have to do them out of class.One lab report that's totally not bad. Grading is absolutely arbitrary. People have gotten points off for not stapling, for labeling a graph above the graph rather than below the graph, etc.The final is reasonable.",
    "I would recommend this course to fellow students. I would mention, however, that there is a ton of work and you must stay ahead in order to complete it well.",
    "If you have to take orgo and you have to take lab, you don't really have a choice. The labs are more fun and less stressful than gen chem lab.",
    "Well you probably have to take this course and it's not nearly as bad as CHEM 118 lab. Final exam no quizzes...",
    "As far as chem labs go, 222 was a good course. Dr. DiMeglio is great and the experiments are straight forward. Expect to do a fair amount of work for lab write ups, but it's nothing you can't get through with some effort.",
    "Take it if you have to, but be aware of the grading. Make sure everything in postlab reports is PERFECT, or else you will lose points.",
    "CHEM 220 was at times fun, at times less bearable, and on the whole, pretty average for a lab class. The labs could be fun (if done correctly, but if you mess up, it can be very stressful), and by the end of the course I felt like I had a good grasp on the basic techniques used in an orgo lab. That being said, the grading system brought unnecessary stress to the course -- I felt like the way the final grade was determined in the classwas not based on how well we knew the subject, but by how well we could guess what was desired on the lab write ups.Dr. Dimeglio is great. She's super nice and helpful, and always there with a smile. However, I feel like I would have liked to get to know her better -- her role as overseer left her kind of distant from the students who primarily interacted with the TAs.",
    "Not a good class, only because it's taken too seriously. Not difficult, but the grading is seriously unfair for the amount of work you have to put in. The thing is, this is completely perpetuated by the pre- meds in the class (esp. freshman) that are willing to kill themselves to get every detail perfect on each and every assignment in order to earn .5 credits worth of an A and show up exactly 30 minutes early every week. If everyone chilled out it would be a fine\/even fun class.",
    "This is a pretty standard lab. It's not overly painful and not too time consuming, but not exactly 'fun'. Take it ifyou need the orgo credit, you'll be fine. Otherwise, find something a little more exciting.",
    "I would say that it is a brilliant introduction to a more professional lab atmosphere. It eases the student in, giving them the confidence to perform relatively complex lab procedures, and also the space to perform in a relatively independent fashion. I would definitely recommend this lab to another student, as it helped my own confidence and comprehension in the lab.",
    "Certainly recommended. Much less painful than Chem119L. You will learn interesting techniques (like being able to positively identify a sample with IR-spectroscopy), and you start to perform syntheses towards the end of the semester.",
    "it's fineyou have to take it and it's better than gen chem lab",
    "This is a fun lab - much more fun than than orgo class itself! The labs are interesting and fairly straightforward. This is one of the best lab courses I took at Yale.",
    "Not a bad course. Far less work and generally less stressful than general chemistry lab. Accuracy in lab results is generally not graded, which makes time in lab less stressful. The work is fairly boring and essentially an exercise in carefully following directions. That said, I feel like the class gave me a good familiarity with basic organic lab techniques, which is somewhat helpful in organic chemistry lecture (it's nice to know what the techniques the textbook refers to actually are).",
    "It's probably a requirement and you have to take it, but it's definitely a good lab to learn the basic techniques and do some syntheses at the end, and the expectations are reasonable and clear.",
    "Chem 222L is a good introduction to organic chemistry lab work. I liked it infinitely more than 119L last semester. The atmosphere in lab is much more laid back. Rather than weekly lab quizzes, there is a cumulative multiple choice final at the end of the semester, which I preferred. Having weekly quizzes last semester made me dread going to lab, but having just the final at the end of the semester was much better. There is still a hefty amount of weekly work to do, but it is manageable. You don't have to type up a lab report every week, which is nice, but you do alwayshave to hand in lab notes. When you do have lab reports to write up, you also have questions to answer about them which makes it seem less like busy work and more like something productive.",
    "Great lab! It can be a lot of work, but the labs are really fun and interesting. It also complements the lecture course (CHEM220) pretty well.",
    "It's a lot of work (at least on a work per credit ratio) but also a lot of fun. Take it under the full expectation that it will be nowhere near as boring as Gen. Chem lab.",
    "CHEM 222L is a fairly average lab course, that sucessfully maintains a 0.5 credit workload. Since there is probably no reason to take the course outside of major or med school requirements, I suppose most of those taking the course have no other option.",
    "I definitely recommend it! Work load is fairly reasonable and each post lab assignment builds on the last..so as long as you stay on top of it and devote a certain amount of time each week in preparing EP's, you'll be fine.",
    "Take it with Chem 220 if you need it to fulfill requirements. Make sure you read the Course Packet so you don't get docked off points on lab reports for small errors.",
    "I would recommend that they take lab over a summer or something and not during the school year. It was a lot of work for half a credit, especially when taken in conjunction with organic chemistry itself.",
    "Don't take it unless you have to.",
    "Chem 222 is really good exposure to the methodology of organic chem labs and the techniques used. It's much more independent work (though they assign all the labs, you're mostly working on your own) than CHEM119, and it's pretty interesting and relevant to what you learn in class.",
    "This class is a good introduction to techniques of organic chemistry. I would recommend it if you want greater familiarity with the physical reality of organic chemistry.",
    "Definitely take CHEM 222L. It puts CHEM 119L and the rest of the general chemistry labs to shame. The atmosphere in CHEM 222L is far more relaxed, yet you learn an incredible amount of information over the course of one semester. Nothing you do in CHEM 222L is a repeat of something you've already done in high school or general chemistry lab; every technique, from TLC and distillation to organic synthesis and IR spectroscopy, is new for most students, and the atmosphere allows you to concentrate on learning and practicing the techniques. The lab course is well-structured and the material is introduced in a stepwise fashion. When new techniques are introduced, an entire lab is dedicated to the technique; then, in future labs, the technique is used again, but as a smaller component in alarger scheme -- allowing you to start out slow and then gradually incorporate what you've learned and reinforce it through practice and experience. Synthesis labs are great because you actually feel that you're doing something and making something, which is great. Also, instead of writing long and useless lab reports every week, you prepare short experimental plans for the upcoming experiment and turn in lab notes \/ answers to post-lab questions for each experiment; there is just one long journal-style report later in the semester, which you are well prepared for and which introduces you to the more useful style and skill of journal writing.",
    "A really great lab course, although with tough grading.",
    "It is a strictly disciplined course, but by the end of it, you feel like you've learned a lot about how to talk and write formally as a science student.",
    "Chem. 222L is what you'd expect for a science lab: four hours a week of mostly tedious work. It is definitely more enjoyable than Chem 119L, but most of the labs are performed individually. The grading is relatively strict and picky, but overall it's a decent lab course. And like all lab courses at Yale, it's definitely more than 0.5 credits worth of work.",
    "One of the most reasonable labs in terms of workload, and the experiments are pretty straightforward too.",
    "If you have to."
