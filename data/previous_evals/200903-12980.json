    "This course gives a VERY general overview of the product development process. There is no hands on instruction on how to build your product. So in the end the products are very simple and could have been done by middle schoolers. so if you wanna work in teams to build say a cardboard laundry folder go ahead and take this. if you wanna learn how to really design and fabricate products, look somewhere else.",
    "Great course! Organization is sometimes confusing, but overall, I would definitely recommend it.",
    "take this class!",
    "Easy and laid back, fun too! A great 5th or even 6th class.",
    "Yes",
    "yes. no work, very easy",
    "Very, very manageable course that actually teaches actual transferable skills.",
    "Good class, very easy",
    "It was a good 5th class to take. Being in a group and having a group project definitely makes the workload more manageable, but try to get everything done when it's due otherwise it can really build up at the end.",
    "Definitely take this class. you learn how to create a new product and actually make the product in this class.",
    "Take it if you want a fairly easy credit. Be warned, however, that if you actually enjoy academic pursuits and are not at Yale just to be \"along for the ride\", you will feel very empty by the end of the course because you won't get much out of it. But you very likely will emerge with a GPA-boosting grade. Be sure to email the instructor before the semester starts if you want a spot in the class."
