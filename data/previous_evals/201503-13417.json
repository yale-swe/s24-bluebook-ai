   "comments": [
    "I think the design of the course is excellent. It taught me how the basics of evidence-based medicine and build on that by formulating the final project. The lectures and readings are taught\/provided in the right manner. One of my favorite courses in Fall.",
    "This course provides very detailed contents on how to perform systematic review, especially meta-analysis. It covers most aspects including the strengths and weaknesses of systematic reviews. The weekly discussion also provides students a great opportunities to discuss their research interest with professor and classmates, which helps students to get a deeper understanding of systematic reviews.",
    "I learned an incredible amount from this course on how to properly conduct systematic reviews and meta analyses in the evaluation of medical treatment efficacy. I had previously taken courses where I was required to write review papers, but there were a lot of aspects of thoroughly and properly evaluating evidence that I would not have learned without taking this course. My only suggestion would be to improve the structure of the discussion sections, so that those whose topics were most relevant to that week's topic would present and that there was more time allocated to discussing everyone's progress with their papers.",
    "Very useful course.",
    "It would be very helpful to actually do analysis as homework assignments.",
    "I think this course could be improved by having a more graduated set of deadlines. Rather than just having the protocol due during midterms and the review due during finals, I think it would be much more instructive to have the following kind of deadlines: First 1-2 weeks: introduction and have us pick our topic, SHOW that there are no other recent systematic reviews on the topic, and that there are sufficient RCTs to perform a review on the topic. Then, in the following weeks, align the topics with an assigned part of the protocol or paper. For example, if you are talking about bias for 1 or 2 lectures, have the \"Bias\" section of the protocol be due at the end of that week. I think this would help the students better understand what is being asked of them and\/or help bring up issues\/questions for the review (and using RevMan) and a more balanced\/manageable pace. It would have been a nice way to keep everyone on track. Otherwise, the course content and lectures were fantastic."

Excellent teaching skills, supportive and available when needed, always asks for feedback to improve, and enhances that student-teacher experience. Allows for students to contribute to the class from their personal experiences, which i think is a great tool of learning.",
    "Instructor: Shiyi Wang \u00a0Dr. Wang is very responsible and responsive. I always got reply from him in 10 minutes after I sent an e-mail to him. Dr. Wang is also very knowledgable and humorous. During his weekly lectures, he can always convey the knowledge to us with sense of humor. Moreover, during weekly discussions, he always organize the discussions well and help every student a lot in our midterm and final project.",

   "comments": [
    "It's a really good course. Small size, and the teacher listens to everyone. There should be more courses in YSPH like this form not few. The prof is simply great. There is heavy work load at the end but definitely worth the effort.",
    "It's a course that teaches you how to formulate a Meta-analysis from scratch, and allows you to understand the evidence-based material in the literature. I strongly recommend it for anyone who's in the medical field or anyone considering going into Academics in general as it will provide you with tools to succeed in both areas. If you really work hard on your project of your interest, you can publish it by the end of the course. The course workload is spread throughout the semester which makes it manageable.",
    "I would highly recommend you to take this course if you are interested in how to perform a meta-analysis.",
    "I would recommend this course. The systematic review assignment can take up sometime so be sure to get started on it early and work on it during thanksgiving break. Overall, you learn very applicable concepts.",
    "This was a very informative and engaging class. I learned a lot of skills that I believe will be useful in the future.",
    "Excellent",
    "Highly recommend for students with PhD and research interests",
    "This course made me a better critical reader of the medical literature and taught me how to perform a systematic review and meta analysis. I would recommend this course to someone who either plans on doing a lot of systematic reviews and meta analyses, or someone who has a specific review in mind that they would like to do. If you have something in mind, do a literature search, make sure there are enough RCTs for a review and that another review has not already been done recently. If all of these things check out, then take the course. Otherwise, you spend half the course just trying to figure out what to write your review on and you may end up doing something you don't really believe in or might not be able to publish."
