   "comments": [
    "If you're taking lessons for credit or if you're intending to major in music, you'll have to take this class anyways. Don't worry, because this is a class you'll be glad you took. Andrew Schartmann is very reasonable and is a pretty fun teacher to have. Yes, the course was very challenging at times, but this made it even more musically rewarding. You'll learn to experience music at a deeper level and actually understand what's going on when you hear a piece of music. This will definitely be more work than you would expect for a 0.5 credit class, but ultimately, it's worth it.",
    "This course is challenging, and it will require a whole credit's worth of work, but it is worth it if you indeed want to improve your musical skills. Be prepared for class twice a week plus a keyboard lab that requires practice. This is excellent preparation if you wish to continue with music or if you wish to be able to \"hear\" music at a deeper level (chord progressions, instrumentation, qualities, etc), and the classes are small enough that you'll grow closer with your classmates.",
    "Take it if you're a proficient musician.",
    "I found this class very useful and most of the time satisfying. Although within one semester you can't really expect to improve your ear training that well, the skills of identifying chord progressions and reading figured bass etc. are definitely useful. This class is definitely more like a full credit class than a half credit class but it is very fun especially if you get close to your classmates :) If you come in as somebody with perfect pitch, don't expect that it will help you - it can actually bring you down! Doing movable do was very challenging.",
    "MUSI 219 is a great class if you really want to improve your listening ability. Even if you think you have good ears, this class will challenge you to listen carefully while also listening to the overall function of a passage.",
    "I would highly recommend this class to any musician or anyone who enjoys music! As the name suggests, this class really improves your overall musicianship. However, a little word of warning: Andrew is a very enthusiastic teacher. He is bursting to teach us new concepts constantly. Towards the beginning of the semester, I felt like we were getting more work than suitable for a half-credit class. Personally, I appreciate this as it helped solidify my musicianship skills. Bottom line is if you put the work in, you will get a lot out of this class."
