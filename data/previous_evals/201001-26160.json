   "comments": [
    "I would recommend MCDB 595 for a fellow student because of the in depth research experience it offers. MCDB 595 is a year long, 20 hour per week research commitment. This research experience will give insights into science that no classroom experience would give.",
    "I would highly recommend this course if you are interested in pursuing research in-depth. I have found that at Yale this is the best way to fit a large amount of research in your schedule so that you have time to be in lab 20+ hrs\/week in order to get significant results.",
    "Definitely recommended. At this point, if you're still on the track, just keep working hard! Stay focused and know that the end of the semester will be very busy, leaving you very little time to be doing actual wet benchwork."
