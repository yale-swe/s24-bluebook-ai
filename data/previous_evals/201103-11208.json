   "comments": [
    "Yes, take it now!",
    "Yes definitely! Very chilled out class and you will learn a lot. A great way to wrap up a week on a Friday afternoon. The readings are really interesting too.",
    "There should be more classes on contemporary popular music. If you have any interest in popular music, definitely take this course. More people should study contemporary culture.",
    "This is an incredibly refreshing course, unlike any other I've taken at Yale. Easier the more background knowledge you have, but accessible never the less.",
    "Take this course if you can get in. It is fantastic and Professor Conway is the nicest professor ever.",
    "Very interesting class that discusses the four pillars of hip hop. If you want to learn about hip hop or even if you already know quite a lot, I guarantee you will learn a considerable amount from this course. Very relaxed professor and class atmosphere, which makes the class always enjoyable to attend (even if it is on a Friday afternoon).",
    "A great course! Take this with Conway if you have the chance.",
    "Jump on the chance to take this class.",
    "Some hip hop history but also a survey class of different aspects of the genre, culture and music industry. A very open discussion, students can lead it as much as they want. The Prof was very open to talking about whatever the class wanted to talk about.",
    "Even though the class was great fun, I felt like it was a bit rusty because the class hasn't been taught here in years. The readings are great and so are the class discussions (even though they're basically always off-topic). Professor Conway is really amazing and I hope they bring him back to teach the course next Fall. He's a very chillperson in all aspects with great enthusiasm for the subject. He truly made up for the fact that the course was on a Friday at 3 PM.",
    "For anyone who is interested in hip hop it is definitely the course to take. Even for someone who isn't, I would still highly recommend this course. It's not too much work, you'll learn a lot, and it's a fun class.",
    "If you're excited by hip-hop and want an opportunity to really explore that, this is a fantastic course. If you're looking for a more academicly rigorous treatment it's probably not the right place for you."
