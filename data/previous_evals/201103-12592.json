   "comments": [
    "Although it seems like a typical history class, this is the most challenging DS course in its lack of direction. If it were possible to take DS without this class, I would be highly considering it for second semester based on my faulty professor and disgruntled discussions from first semester. Hopefully when you are looking into this course, the DUS will have provided more guidance of the material and structure of this class in what is otherwise a fantastic course.",
    "I would recommend this course because I myself have learned so much from this experience.",
    "I absolutely recommend DS H&P - it is a whirlwind tour of the basics of Western history and politics that everyone should be familiar with.",
    "At times H&P can be interesting, and at other times, it can be exceedingly boring (see: Tacitus). Overall, class discussions in H&P were much more interesting, heated, and intense than the other two DS classes, but this is mostly because students just espouse their politically-induced interpretation of the text, which is natural since the authors themselves have very radical views at times. Also, while H&P is less about understanding what the authors are saying and more so about interpreting\/arguing about it, Philosophy is more about getting the facts of the argument right, and Literature is more about talking about interpretations upon which everyone ultimately agrees. Petranovich is as good a section leader as any, and probably not the toughest grader (but not the easiest), but good luck deciphering what I suppose is his handwriting (hieroglyphics?). The secret for him is to have a clear thesis.",
    "On the whole, I would recommend this course to another student. I felt like it was a good introduction to exactly what its course title suggests: historical and political thought. As with the rest of the courses in DS, I wish we could have moved more slowly and spent more time with each individual text, but as this is impossible given the situation, this class comes second-best to that. The discussions were great and made me notice things in the reading which I would have never realized on my own (despite my careful reading), and I was generally always happy to be in class. The reading load may be heavy and dense, but through this section, it became more manageable and understandable. Whether we were discussing political theories or battle tactics or gender roles, this section (and especially the discussions which it engendered) were very interesting.",
    "Directed Studies H&P is a tough class, but it's very beneficial. You will feel very educated and your analytic writing skills will improve if you put a decent amount of effort into the class. I would recommend it to anyone interested in classic historical and political thought for the quality of education.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone. The connections between the Greek and Roman world are extremely interesting.",
    "Directed Studies is exactly what you'd think it would be. Lots of reading. Lots of writing. It becomes manageable after a month as you become accustomed to the workload. Many people find the History and Politics readings very dull. But I always enjoyed it. Probably cause I'm a history buff. However, as you move closer to Christianity it can get a little hard to get through.... But definitely take this course. You won't regret it!",
    "Good. Yes. Though the least compelling of the three directed studies courses, this one is necessary for its relationships to the others",
    "Absolutely. Especially for a major going into a government field. There is no better way to quickly verse yourself in the history that shaped our ideas about regimes (republic, monarchy, democracy, etc.)",
    "In this fast paced course, you will study a mix of ancient historians and philosophers. This course is not a history course in the traditional sense, but rather a course that will teach you to think and write critically about history and politics as described in the texts you read. You can enjoy this course even if you do not consider yourself someone interested in politics. I never though of myself a a particularly political person, but enjoyed this course because it looked at politics through history and philosophy which is a very interesting perspective to take. This class is driven by class discussion and will give you the opportunity to really engage with the ideas of ancient historians and philosophers. Professor Petranovich is a good professor who will ask questions to help your discussion, but mostly lets the students run the discussion.",
    "Overall, DS H&P is a great class. The synthesis of historical writing and political philosophy makes it markedly different from the other DS subjects in the program. I will say that the reading for this class took me longer than the others. This is perhaps because I found it less interesting than the material for Lit or Philosophy, but it seemed drier nonetheless. There was certainly a measure of value to all of the works we studied, even those that did not spark my interest. If you get Petranovich as section leader stick with him; you're in for a good semester."
