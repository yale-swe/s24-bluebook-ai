    "It's a comprehensive introduction to the field of cryptography, both theoretical and applied, and would be useful to anyone the least bit interested in data security (which, if you're planning on a career in computer science, you should be). You'll learn some number theory along the way and get to talk about things like Quadratic Residuosity, Euler's Totient Function, and the Jacobi Symbol, which will impress your friends. Though there's a lot of material covered in class, the workload isn't bad, and the exams are easier than the problem sets (which themselves aren't terribly difficult, just somewhat time-consuming). Take it!"

    "Cryptography is hugely important in CS. I feel that I understand crypto concepts well enough now to at least discuss them intelligently, and my breadth of understanding of the field is such that if I need to add crypto to an existing system, I'll have a pretty good idea of where to start and what pitfalls I should look out for along the way."
