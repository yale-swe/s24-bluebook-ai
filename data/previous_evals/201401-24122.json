   "comments": [
    "Practical skills were learned.",
    "This was such an important class to take. Stats and programming to not come easily to me and I was not able to do analyses on my own after biostats 1 and 2, but after this course I'm confident in my ability to program in sad and produce the kinds of analyses I would need, even confident enough to put it on my resume. Everyone who will do stats in their thesis should take this as a first year. My life would have been so much different if I had. Mayur teaches you what you need to know in an accessible way. There is no busywork, only skill-building work. One of the most useful classes I've taken at ysph.",
    "would not take it again if it was not required. Even though it does not pertain to my track or career, somehow it was a requirement.",
    "Very useful and hands-on",
    "Great course, I feel like I've finally learned SAS and how to effectively write a results paragraph. I think the labs assignments could be shortened, or lab sessions could be lengthened. I also think the TA's lab sessions vary too greatly in terms of content and SAS code\/help given. More standardization would be appreciated. Additionally, if graded lab assignments could be returned a day earlier, it would give students to actually apply the feedback for the next lab assignment rather than make the same mistake twice..",
    "Very helpful - Labs were especially important!",
    "Strengths are that I truly learned how to use SAS well, weaknesses are that lab grades were prone to TA variability and expectations for lab write ups were not clear. Lab times were too rushed and the material that we were expected to cover in one 50 minute session was unrealistic.",
    "This class is excellent. It teaches you how to analyze data and present tables write out results sections as if you were doing an actual scientific paper. However, besides teaching you the code and making sure you can interpret data correctly, this class doesn't really explain the epi behind the various models or why you would use them. Mayur does a great job of explaining the code and teaching you when to use the various models. However, without being supplemented by Epi II i fell like you don't get as much out of it.",
    "This was an incredibly useful class. It did accomplish its goal in teaching us SAS, but it also reinforced concepts from biostatistics and epidemiology. It's well worth your time! One suggestion, which admittedly may be difficult to implement, would be to extend labs to at least 90 minute blocks. The pace of labs was often too fast despite reading the labs ahead of time.I also strongly suggest using clickers in class. It's a large lecture hall and intimidating to answer questions! Clickers would help us practice and assess our own understanding of certain concepts (i.e., reading frequency tables). They also help keep us engaged when the post-lunch sleepiness sets in...",
    "This was a fantastic course. It taught me a variety of practical skills that I am confident will serve me well during my summer internship and beyond. Having barely used SAS prior to CDE 534, I now feel very comfortable with SAS.",
    "Strength: very useful for assessing data",
    "It's an excellent class. As an overly committed physician trying to learn SAS and logistic regression, I thought it was very doable until the 2 week spring break and my vacation not coinciding with the SOPH's calendar. So I missed a week of class and got behind with competing duties and responsibilities. Additional structure that I would have found helpful:1. Videos of lectures, in case I wasn't able to make a class.2. More lab time. For me, the hands-on learning and analysis was critical. I would have benefitted from less lecture and more time in lab.3. Putting homework answers online after the due date, or one week after the due date to be able to correct my mistakes. Would also be very helpful to have as I move forward with SAS. Would be helpful to have SAS code as a reference when I'm trying to remember how to do something in 3-6 months time from now and I didn't do it correctly in the homework.It's possible Dr. Desai has already considered some of the above and has valid reasons for not doing it. And I know I'm in the minority of students in the class as most are full-time SOPH students. Just some thoughts.",
    "I really enjoyed this course. The lectures were helpful with good examples. The only weakness is that sometimes the lecture slides could have included more detail to explain some of the examples.",
    "Strengths - very organized, clear expectations, useful lab assignmentsWeaknesses - pace in the first half of the class was a little slow, could have spent more time focusing on the more interesting material taught after the midterm",
    "Great!The course is very useful!",
    "Strengths: labs are very helpful, slides are clear and organized, very practical course",
    "AAMIE was probably one of the most useful courses I've taken at YSPH.I wish we had a lecture on how to write a good summary, rather than just having to read published journal articles.There also seemed to be a lot of variability in terms of TAs--some had slides in their lab sessions, other gave out the code, etc.",
    "SAS is the useful tool throughout Public Health researches.And therefore it was really nice that we had the specific course on advanced SAS applications, especially when we can interpret the analysis results into actual epidemiology language.",
    "The course is well-designed and very helpful. It gives an introduction on SAS programming to do some data cleaning and basic statistical analyses in epidemiological studies.",
    "Very useful course, and well taught too.",
    "This class taught me how to actually do data analysis using SAS. It got into the nitty gritty of how to re-code variables and run the necessary analyses, and then how to interpret those results in the context of the research questions. This course is essential to anyone who wants the skills to do their own research.",
    "We learned a lot, but the structure was sub-optimal. The lectures were long and challenging to pay attention to. Flipping through slide after slide of ASCII SAS output is not a good way to teach. There's a lot of overlap with the biostats course. Please try to integrate that somewhat. It will help with the pacing and avoid redundancy.About 30-40% of our final grade (as part of the labs and exams) was based on our interpretation of the results that we got from SAS. Did we spent anywhere close to 30-40% of our time talking about how to interpret our result? How to phrase things? What to focus on? Nope. Look back at the lecture slides: page after page of SAS output, with very little final interpretation. When asked for examples we were instructed to just look on pubmed. That's a little insulting. I didn't pay thousands of dollars to YSPH in order to be told to simply google examples. To make things worse, each of the TAs had their own idea of what a data summary should include, so students received lots of conflicting advice.I have two suggestions. First, after each lab is complete, have Mayur write up his summaryof the results and give that to the class. Use the same data and show us what right looks like. Second, if you want to refer us to published papers, choose a handful of good examples and put them on classesV2. Don't make us guess. Again, show us what right looks like.",
    "This course helped me tremendously in becoming comfortable with SAS, but I didn't always feel that the lectures were very helpful. The labs were much more helpful and I felt that sometimes the TA did a better job of explaining things in simpler terms.",
    "The course provided tips and tools in better understanding how to properly use SAS. Not only did I learn things useful for the course, but for other courses I've taken.",
    "GREAT CLASS. I loved it. There was a lot of overlap with Epi 2 and Biostats 2 so more communication between the professors could be helpful however in many ways they complemented each other and it was helpful to see the topics from different perspectives. Would be good to make the methods more uniform in each class though. This class should be required for all students though.",
    "Great course which teaches students how to actually use SAS for their thesis or for research.",
    "I thought this was a very useful course. I left feeling more comfortable with SAS, and had a much better understanding of it.",
    "This course was very helpful in regards to practical application of the things we have learned in epi and biostats.",
    "Overall I really enjoyed this course. The labs and lectures tie in well together, and you come out learning a skill. It can be a lot of work, but it's well worth it.",
    "I'm not sure I really have any suggestions for improvement. I had to miss Lesley's class due to circumstances beyond my control which was about special tricks. This is the only thing I would have really liked and it was me who missed it. The weekly layout and approach to the class with constant building and review was great.",
    "The course was very helpful for future research. It was difficult to learn SAS in the lecture setting-less time in lecture and more time in lab would make more sense.",
    "Good at improving SAS skills.",
    "Good course. TA was great",
    "Students learn how to apply important SAS programming required for Epi studies. The use of real world examples (i.e. publicly available data) make the course relevant and interesting.",
    "No recommendations",
    "One of the most useful and best courses at YSPH. SAS used to be intimidating and now it's actually fun, once you get the hang of it! And the material and labs really allowed this to happen. My only recommendation would be to teach it in a way so that students could actually follow along on SAS and be able to perform what we learn in class in real-time. Not sure how this would be possible unless the course were to be conducted in a computer lab",
    "After completing this class, I feel really comfortable using SAS. This class pulled together and applied different concepts from Epidemiology and Biostatistics. The lab assignments were straight forward and my TA was instrumental in helping me get through them. The labs and exams were perfectly aligned. This was one of the most worthwhile classes that I've taken.",
    "Great course! Learned a lot--better than Biostats II.",
    "interesting, practicable",
    "painful to go through, but helpful and impressive to see how much is learned at the end of the semester, best professor around",
    "Covers useful topics that definitely will be applicable to summer internships or other work experiences. Weekly labs are of good length. However, the midterm and final take a very long time to complete. I would recommend that students install SAS on their personal computers.",
    "Course takes beginners in SAS and makes them intermediate in SAS. Some topics covered very briefly or not at all and were still on the exam.",
    "This course is excellent. If you want to learn how to use SAS, take it. The material is covered efficiently.",
    "Lecture is sometimes hard to follow because it is lecturing about SAS code and language, but having slides beforehand to make notes makes this easier.",
    "This is a very well designed and well taught basic course in SAS. All lecture material and labs were very carefully prepared, clear and useful.The course really teaches SAS in the first place, and to a lesser extent approaches to data analysis in epidemiology, but this is probably what it was meant to be.",
    "This is one of the BEST and MOST USEFUL courses I have taken at YSPH. This course ACTUALLY TEACHES YOU SAS. I never thought I would learn SAS, but this course actually does a great job at this. I will use the notes and lessons learned in this class throughout my internship and life. Mayur's notes are amazing.Only improvement: There should be no lab assignment due the week the midterm is due. The final take home exam was way toooo long. We should not be re-tested so much on things we were tested on during the midterm.",
    "Great class. Very helpful skills to use for internship and thesis",
    "Course Materials (PPT slides etc) and lectures are really good for understanding.",
    "Great professor and TAsReally helped me learn SASThe only issue I had was with the grading for exams - usually on exams, if you make a mistake, points are taken off, but then points aren't taken off for wrong answers later on if you did the steps right but are off because of the original mistake. This was not the case for my midterm, and I felt my grade did not represent how my steps were correct except for a small mistake.",
    "I liked it a lot. I really appreciated the midterm and final as a way to put together everything we learned throughout the course. I think this was the class in which I learned the most.",
    "I can say I understand SAS now which means this course was a success. Definitely an awesome in-depth course.",
    "a very practical and useful course, student can learn a lot about SAS",
    "the strength is that this course provided essential skills and knowledge needed for analyzing data. I don't think there is weakness in this course; however, I do have a suggestion to this course. Hopefully, this course could have contents of how to develop a code book in thefuture, as coding is very critical in data collection and data analysis. knowing how to effectively code the variables is the first step of conducting research.",
    "Great introduction to SAS - it will definitely be useful for my thesis. I really liked that we used actual data. Would have liked more guidance on interpreting\/writing of lab assignments - it's difficult to know what published articles to use as references when the authors themselves are not interpreting correctly or using the correct syntax.",
    "I think at the beginning of the course we should have set guidelines for how the write ups should be structured. Guidelines varied by TA.",
    "The course is great for establishing a practical knowledge of SAS. I went into the course as a relative novice, and feel much more confident in my abilities to program now. The only drawback was the long lecture times, which were hard to sit through. This isn't Mayur's fault, as he is a pretty captivating lecturer and uses enough anecdotes to keep things interesting. However, it is difficult to remain attentive without a break for the entire 2 hour period.",
    "Strengths: forces you to think about what you are codingWeaknesses: lectures are not particularly helpful in terms of finishing the lab."

    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Mayur does a good job explaining the material, but the slides were difficult to interpret at times. Some of his comments were insensitive and did not create a safe space (e.g. calling students out for common mistakes in a demeaning way)",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Mayur was great. He taught something that was intimidating to me in a very accessible way. I only went to him a couple times for individual help, but he was so helpful when I did--he really made the visit about learning and not just solving the problem I thought I had, and he took the time to get to know me a bit beforehand. Even in that big lecture class, he learned my name, and that meant a lot to me. Overall,one of the best lecturers I've had at ysph.",

    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Desai was engaging and clear. His notes were well thought out and easy to follow. He took student feedback well and adjusted our course material as necessary.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0One of my favorite instructors at Yale. He does take a little while to get used to (as all of the first years had him for Epi I jumping right into the semester was totally fine, but last fall it took a week or so to get used to his teaching style). He will go off on tangents or use students (anonymously) as teaching tools (i.e. someone writing their thesis didn't understand why the model didn't account for all of the observations). However, they provide entertainment. He really cares that his students understand not only the coding behind analyzing data but how to interpret it. He's also available to talk, or even advise for outside classes, and will have chats with his students about life in general and embraces student's habits (i.e. saying totes). You can tell he cares a lot about his students and really wants them to not only understand the material, what they're looking at, and why they're doing what they're doing. All in all, you can tell he wants all of us to excel in whatever path we take.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0I was nervous about taking a second epi class from Mayur because my first epi class was a little rough, but this class was great! He really met us at our level and was did a great job in lecture. Also, if any administrators are reading this, please ask Mayur about the utensil in his pocket incident. :)One side note that I think is important to share: about halfway through the class, I realized that my understanding of dummy variables needed some clarification. I was going to email Mayur after class to set up an appointment, but then he made a comment in class about a student asking a basic question too late in the semester. This was pretty discouraging, and I fretted over whether or not to make an appointment for a few days. I wound up not setting up an appointment because I didn't want to become a \"story\" down the road. I wanted to share this because I think Mayur is a really nice, dedicated professor and I don't think he realizes how discouraging some of his comments can be.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Mayur is a phenomenal teacher. He clearly emphasizes important points during lecture, and his assignments rarely contain ambiguous instructions.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0I think if someone would like to learn SAS and analytical methods of epidemiology, this is the course to take. I had some previous SAS courses where mostly students had to use or modify and existing SAS code provided to them for completing an assignment. This course was structured in a way that I had to actually seat and program myself, so I found it an amazing experience. It was not an easy course at the beginning, but there were plenty of help available along the way. The course was structured in a way that literally everyday of week you can go to a SAS laboratory and find an answer if you have a question. The course starts with very basics of SAS and progresses slowly to more advanced topics so even for students with no previous SAS experience it is possible to take the course and make great progress during the semester.I struggled in the beginning of the course but thanks to the lectures and all the support available, I was able to take SAS examination and become SAS certified in last week of the semester. I am really grateful of Dr. Desai\u00e2\u0080\u0099s time and leadership for this course, he is truly outstanding. I love the way Dr. Desai masterfully delivers the lectures, with plenty of fun examples and publications from students who took the class before. Among many other things, I was specially amazed by Dr. Desai\u00e2\u0080\u0099s uncanny memory and his sincerely dedication to students learning experience, I think it is rare and precious. As a friend who also took the course told me once, Dr. Desai is teaching the course \u00e2\u0080\u009clike a rock start.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Thank you very much for your time and the amazing learning opportunity.",

    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Mayur has clearly had a lot of experience in data analysis like this, and we really benefit from learning this topic from him. His slides were extremely clear and useful - I'm definitely saving them as a resource for the future. While he did occasionally get sidetracked on a random topic or story in lecture, they made the class interesting.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Mayur is an great guy. He's entertaining, engaging, and genuinely interested in his students. Towards the middle of the semester he became noticeably more frustrated and less friendly. We feel for you, Mayur, but please don't take it out on your students. Some of his comments during this period were a little insulting and mean. But it's ok. We love the guy and were able to laugh them off.Grow the mustache again.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Sometimes I felt a little discouraged by Mayur. I understood his \"no questions by email\" policy and his \"bring logs, not code to office hours\" policy but he repeatedly brought those up in class and it seemed a little disparaging and condescending towards students. Also, there were a lot of tangents during lecture, which meant that towards the end of class, there was always a rush to finish the slides.",

    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Does a great job keeping the class interested. Sometimes it was hard to follow his slides when looking back. His slides could be updated\/beefed up. He should try to get a better grip on student questions. There were 2 students that monopolized class time with questions. While student questions are important, one student should not be allowed to ask 15 questions in the span of an hour and a half (yes, this is a real figure). Missed the 'stache.",

    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0One of the best teachers I've had the pleasure to learn from. Very approachable. Always incorporates humor with teaching which helps some info stick better. Extremely knowledge about epidemiology and data techniques. Only thing I'd change is the amount of material covered to be slightly less in class and more manageable.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Professor moves through the material at a good pace and the labs are helpful in reinforcing key concepts.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Dr. Desai is a great instructor!",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Mayur is a fantastic instructor and this course is paired so wonderfully with his teaching style. He made the material digestable and very easy to understand.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Mayur is AMAZING! He is great at teaching SAS. Also, Mayur's class is the only class I actually laugh in. His jokes make such a dry topic, like SAS, come to life. Thanks Mayur for always giving us a good laugh. Also, the lectures are amazing and you actually will learn a lot. The stuff you learn in this class is so useful, that you will start using it ASAP. I have already used the concepts from this class in two other classes I was taking this semester.Improvement: Interpretations of epi findings is a big chunk of this class. Could Mayur include written out interpretations in his slides? It would be something nice to have. We could all benefit from sample interpretations for different epidemiological data.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Ranted a lot about other matters but overall was a good instructor",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Course Materials (PPT slides etc) and lectures are really good for understanding.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Great professor! Invested in students, funny, good lecturer.Sometimes it was hard to sit through a long class of going through SAS output, but it was helpful.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0He is the greatest! He is great at explaining all of the SAS stuff. Very patient and approachable.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0It would be helpful if his slides were more detailed and had more than just SAS output and code. Overall, funny, brilliant, and awesome guy.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0a very great instructor who can make the class active and interesting",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Dr. Desai is an experienced and knowledgeable scholar. He could lead us step by step to go through essential knowledge and skills neededfor data analysis and management. He could use the easiest way to explain complex concepts and incorporated his experiences of analyzingdata into the handouts for the class. I learned a lot from this course and really enjoyed this course. I don't think there is anything he needs to improve.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Very enthusiastic and invested in our learning.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0The lectures were rushed at times and sometimes I couldn't get all my notes down. They are useful lectures but I wish there was more explanatory texts with them,",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Mayur is one of my favorite professors at Yale. He cares about the material, makes lectures interesting, is a fair grader, and he teaches some valuable skills based classes.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Mayur is quite helpful and certainly well-versed in this subject given that he has taught this for many years."

    "Instructor: Javier Cepeda \u00a0Very good-explained things clearly, but still made us work to figure things out on our own. He was very patient and flexible with his time.",
    "Instructor: Javier Cepeda \u00a0Marked really hard, even though other TA's were way more flexible than him when it came to marking.",
    "Instructor: Javier Cepeda \u00a0Usually very helpful if you asked specific questions; sometimes he seemed to get frustrated or think the question is stupid, but maybe because it was elementary stuff that we were mistaking. Also- grading of labs was a little ridiculous. Each time he would take of for something different, then you would fix it for the next one and he would take off for something else!",
    "Instructor: Javier Cepeda \u00a0Javier was well intentioned in his delivery of the material but I did not find him to be helpful or receptive to student questions. He was not constructive in his feedback during lab times nor was his homework grading helpful. My lab grades seemed like they were subject to whatever mood he was in when he graded it and I was unclear of what he wanted orwhat he would be taking and giving points for. He seemed annoyed any time a question was asked in lab and was flustered in answering it. We had a lot of material to get through in such a short amount of lab time and this seemed to frustrate him to a point where he was bothered by the presence of his students.",
    "Instructor: Javier Cepeda \u00a0Javier was helpful if you had logistical questions. However, for students in our lab who really struggled with programming he seemed to get annoyed very easily.",
    "Instructor: Javier Cepeda \u00a0I like the lab and the TA is very nice. But personally speaking, the grading of homework and midterm exam is too strict.",
    "Instructor: Javier Cepeda \u00a0Very approachable. Interested in students getting the material. Labs may have benefited from more structured guidance through the lab instead of working on your own and answering questions if you have them.",
    "Instructor: Javier Cepeda \u00a0Great! He is very responsible and always encourages us to think. He is also very patient. I like him!",
    "Instructor: Javier Cepeda \u00a0Strengths: clear explanations, thorough with labs",
    "Instructor: Javier Cepeda \u00a0Too strict grading in homework. I think the TA should explain well the grading rules to students in advance, and spend time making some slides to emphasize some important technical details.",
    "Instructor: Javier Cepeda \u00a0Unresponsive to student questions. While I did not have major issues in lab, it was sad to hear how he responded to students that did have problems. Many times questions and concerns were met with judgmental answers.",
    "Instructor: Javier Cepeda \u00a0Javier was helpful and nice but occasionally very arbitrary on grading. One time he told us he was tired and in a bad mood and that our grades for a particular lab were affected by this mood.",
    "Instructor: Javier Cepeda \u00a0Eager to help, approachable. I would just recommend that perhaps he explain a little more clearly why he is taking certain points off on homework assignments and even consider providing an example of what is missing in write-ups. That way students who cannot make it to office hours can have information they can use to improve their next write up.",
    "Instructor: Javier Cepeda \u00a0Javier was very knowledgable and helpful. He gave good feedback on assignments, which made it easier to do well on the midterm and final.",
    "Instructor: Javier Cepeda \u00a0friendly, responsible",
    "Instructor: Javier Cepeda \u00a0Javier is a great TA! Very supportive.",
    "Instructor: Javier Cepeda \u00a0Javier made asking questions very difficult since he had an impatient and condescending attitude in lab. At times he could be very nice and helpful but you could tell he thought out questions were stupid.",
    "Instructor: Javier Cepeda \u00a0Javier was a decent TA. I did not ever ask him for help so I can't comment on his availability. He was usually pleasant in lab but sometimes could appear frustrated at having to answer too many questions.",
    "Instructor: Josefa Lynn Martinez \u00a0Sefa was an awesome TA! I appreciated that she was willing to stick around after section for those who still had questions.",
    "Instructor: Josefa Lynn Martinez \u00a0She was very helpful. I enjoyed her lab sessions.",
    "Instructor: Josefa Lynn Martinez \u00a0Sefa was fantastic and probably one of the best TAs I've had. Very good at breaking down the labs and explaining the steps in simple, easy to understand ways. Provided very good constructive feedback.",
    "Instructor: Josefa Lynn Martinez \u00a0Sefa is incredible.",
    "Instructor: Josefa Lynn Martinez \u00a0She did a very good job of leading the labs, and her feedback on assignments was helpful",
    "Instructor: Josefa Lynn Martinez \u00a0Josefa explains everything very well in section, and is very helpful in answering your questions. I just wish we had gotten concrete directions on how to do the summary writeups for the labs at the beginning. It's a little confusing to have Mayur saying it should be \"brief\" but then the TA's all expecting a sentence on every single variable in the table, which ends up being not very brief.",
    "Instructor: Josefa Lynn Martinez \u00a0I really liked Sefa. Occasionally when the labs were long she would rush trough the labs. I understand the rationale, but I would have preferred to take adequate time with what she was able to cover and leave parts of the lab unfinished than to have rushed and felt as if I hadn't learned very well at all. However, she is clearly excellent at SAS and was always very helpful and able to answer all of my questions.",
    "Instructor: Josefa Lynn Martinez \u00a0Sefa gave great feedback on all of the lab assignments, which improved my understanding overall and helped me do well on the midterm and final. She gave a great final review and was always direct with answering questions.",
    "Instructor: Josefa Lynn Martinez \u00a0Strengths: Sefa is great! Very direct, knows what we need to know and very helpfulWeaknesses: A bit of a harsh grader..doesn't tell us what she expects in terms of grading like Mayur.",
    "Instructor: Josefa Lynn Martinez \u00a0Sefa was a great TA! Really knowledgeable about SAS, fair grader, and really, really helpful.",
    "Instructor: Josefa Lynn Martinez \u00a0She helped me so much. I really appreciated her patience, skill at teaching, and nice smile.",
    "Instructor: Lesley S Park \u00a0Lesley was amazing. She ran a tight ship, and encouraged everyone to learn as much a possible.",
    "Instructor: Lesley S Park \u00a0Great",
    "Instructor: Lesley S Park \u00a0Lesley is a really knowledgeable TA and I applaud her for sticking to her guns about not giving us code. That really made us work harder and learn the material for ourselves.Her lab sections came off as really intense, which isn't necessarily a problem (although we didn't really need to have a special meeting to go over her \"rules\"). The only thing I would call an issue is that we were timed to do a certain task or section quickly (ex: 3 minutes) and then needed to move on. I totally understand that there is a limited amount of time in lab, but if I made a mistake early on, there was no time to correct it and I just floundered the rest of the lab period. It got to the point where coming to lab was unhelpful if I hadn't already completed at least the first half. I think this was unnecessarily stressful and could be relaxed a little bit.",
    "Instructor: Lesley S Park \u00a0This course was a great learning experience. I am thankful for the instructor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s and all TA\u00e2\u0080\u0099s time and availability during the semester. Thank you, (Aliyar).",
    "Instructor: Lesley S Park \u00a0She is a really great TA who clearly knows SAS very well.",
    "Instructor: Lesley S Park \u00a0Lesley was an amazing TF - she kept us engaged and really helped us learn the material (rather than just giving us parts of code)",
    "Instructor: Lesley S Park \u00a0I was really glad that I got into the time slot of Lesley's lab session. She was a talented SAS programmer and therefore she always gave us extra SAS tips during the lab session. She was always kind and helpful with our questions, and she carefully commented in our assignments for us to better improve the epidemiology result interpretations.",
    "Instructor: Lesley S Park \u00a0I really appreciate that Lesley, more than any other TA I've had at YSPH, forced us to do the coding ourselves. She was a great resource and would help us if we got stuck, but she neverput code up on the screen, as I know some other TA's did. It forced me to figure out what I did and didn't understand, and I am WAY better at SAS because I had her as a TA. Her tips and tricks at the end of each session were super helpful!",
    "Instructor: Lesley S Park \u00a0She was clearly knowledgeable about the material and had a good plan to walk us through the labs. Unfortunately it was nearly impossible to get any work done during the lab period. I appreciate what she was trying to do - but getting interrupted every 5 minutes to have her talk about something is extremely distracting and makes it hard to concentrate on writing code. She paced the class so that it ended with about 5 minutes to spare, which was good, except that most of the labs cannot be done correctly by a student in 45 minutes. That meant that she was constantly racing through the entire lab, interrupting our trains of thought every few minutes as we were desperately attempting to focus on our code.And although I like her there were several times when she came off as patronizing. A number of us felt as though we were being talked down to. This, unfortunately, just led to greater apathy towards the class and greater frustration with the labs.But I'm focusing on the negatives here. I did enjoy the lab, and I did learn a lot from her. She's dedicated and inspired. Thank you.",
    "Instructor: Lesley S Park \u00a0Knows material very well.",
    "Instructor: Lesley S Park \u00a0Lesley is very knowledgeable about all things SAS. She requires students to think and code for themselves, which is a great active way to learn. Her bonus code is always helpful.",
    "Instructor: Lesley S Park \u00a0Although her teaching style was a bit strict, she was incredible and I am so grateful to have had her as a TA this semester. Not only did she explain SAS language so well, she made learning SAS fun (especially with her candy) and less intimidating. The fact that she rarely gave away any code during lab really helped us to learn how to perform tasks on our own and understand how\/why we were doing what we were doing.",
    "Instructor: Lesley S Park \u00a0Lesley was a fantastic TF. She really pushed us to learn the material well and in the end, I think I learned more SAS than I would ever have expected to. I loved the extra coding she taught us and she was such an approachable TF when we had questions or concerns.",
    "Instructor: Lesley S Park \u00a0She is very knowledgeable, but she goes way too fast for people who are not comfortable with learning SAS. Lesley would be a great T.A. for an honors SAS section.I also wish she would post slides after class. I understand that she doesn't use slides in class in order to avoid distraction, but it would be great to have some raw materials to review after class (besides Mayur's slides)",
    "Instructor: Lesley S Park \u00a0I want to become Lesley one day.",
    "Instructor: Lesley S Park \u00a0great TA with abundant knowledge about sas",
    "Instructor: Lesley S Park \u00a0Lesley was great - really enjoyed her teaching style.",
    "Instructor: Lesley S Park \u00a0Lesley moved the labs along way too fast and it was really hard to keep up with her at times. The way she graded homework was also not clear, and she didn't help very much in explaining how to fix our mistakes.",
    "Instructor: Lesley S Park \u00a0Lesley was a great TA. She makes you think about your problem and does not always spoon feed you the answer. Certainly helped that she had candy in lab, too.",
    "Instructor: William Kenji Murk \u00a0Super good!",
    "Instructor: William Kenji Murk \u00a0excellent- great slides, great feedback, helpful in lab, very comprehensive teaching",
    "Instructor: William Kenji Murk \u00a0HE IS SO GOOD! best TA ever!!",

    "Instructor: William Kenji Murk \u00a0Will was so helpful! He really cared about his students.",
    "Instructor: William Kenji Murk \u00a0the best! so helpful, patient, clearly explained material, seemed to put much more time and effort into grading and meeting with students than necessary, awesome.",
    "Instructor: William Kenji Murk \u00a0Will is the best! Will's lab was great. He is extremely knowledgable and always willing to help. He went above and beyond by sending supplementary slides and presentations to help with weekly labs and the midterm\/final. He was always available and happy to help in any way possible.",
    "Instructor: William Kenji Murk \u00a0Taught the lab sessions very well. There was never a question he didn't have the answer for. Lectures were very detailed and easy to understand. He was always willing to go the extra step for his students. No weaknesses.",
    "Instructor: William Kenji Murk \u00a0Will is awesome! Probably the most patient and helpful TA I've had at YSPH. Because section was so small he was able to give one-on-one help and was very accessible.",
    "Instructor: William Kenji Murk \u00a0helpful slides,answers our questions clearly",
    "Instructor: William Kenji Murk \u00a0Best TF everrrrrr. I wish I could have will as a TF for every class. He was very patient with his section and explained everthing very well. He took time to see us outside of class and responded to email very timely. I'm going to miss you Will!!",
    "Instructor: William Kenji Murk \u00a0His labs were perfect and kind. Good personality. Strongly recommended.",
    "Instructor: William Kenji Murk \u00a0Will always prepared handouts for lab sessions for us. The handouts contained useful knowledge and skills that can be used in the future doing data analysis or management. the knowledge and skills were also linked to what was taught in class. I will definitely recommend my colleagues to choose Will as their TA if they take this course."

    "Great class. You will learn a lot.",
    "This was one of the most useful classes I took at ysph. I'm intimidated by stats and programming and Mayur made it approachable and really taught me the things I needed to know. Take it your first year, because it will make biostats easier and is absolutely necessary to do a stats thesis.",
    "Probably not, especially if you do not plan on using SAS in the future.",
    "SAS entry course.",
    "Essential!",
    "Very helpful for everything and will definitely be utilized for thesis work.",
    "This course was a lot of work but worth the work in order to understand statistics concepts and the fundamentals of sas. This would be a great course if the grading was more consistent and if the feedback throughout the semester helped with improvement.",
    "One of my favorite classes and one of my favorite professors. I don't think this class should be used as an either\/or for Epi II (for certain departments) because the two classes complement each other in their material - Epi II is more descriptive\/understanding why something is done whereas AAMIE is the application. I would recommend this class to everyone. Even if programming is not your favorite thing or your not very good at it, this class teaches your the basics and isn't designed to fail you. There are many opportunities to get help or support.",
    "You will learn a lot of useful SAS! This is definitely a great choice, even if you are feeling a little nervous about SAS\/epi\/biostats! Make sure you carve out a few productive hours each week to really thinkabout your labs so you can keep up.",

    "If you want to have a better understanding of SAS than I would highly recommend this course.",
    "This course is a great way to learn how to apply epidemiology and biostatistics",
    "This course is where you really learn how to use SAS, and you can confidently put it on your resume as a skill. You'll come out the exams really proud of yourself, because you'll realize this is basically everything you need to do to analyze a dataset and write up a paper, and you did it by yourself. Highly recommend.",
    "I loved this course. I came in hating SAS and understanding nothing about how to use it and came out loving SAS and looking forward to using it for my summer project were I will be doing a lot of variable mapping. For anyone who wants to learn how to use SAS and learn about data management and analysis, this course if for you. Eminently applicable and a very approachable learning style.",
    "It was required for me so yes?",

    "Yes. It will greatly complement biostats courses.",
    "I would recommend this course for both SAS coding and an overview of Epi studies.",
    "Very useful and high yield. Definitely recommend.",
    "Highly highly recommend. One of the most useful and best courses so far. I explained the course to my potential internship preceptor and she was immediately impressed and offered me a position right away! I will definitely be using my notes this summer and for many years in the future.",
    "Best class to really learn how to use SAS.",
    "Excellent class. Great notes. Useful lectures. If you want to learn SAS, take this class.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class",
    "I would recommend this course to a fellow student. Because it is essential to data analysis.",
    "i wouldn't know a thing about SAS without this course, but get ready for a crap ton of difficult and stressful work along the way.",

    "useful class for knowing SAS for research and statistical analyses",
    "Definitely take the course if you want to learn SAS, especially if you are intimidated by SAS. You will learn it, and it's not intimidating at all.",
    "I loved this course. It is so incredibly useful and follows the biostatistics II format perfectly from week to week. I felt like what I was learning in biostats was being reinforced and applied in this course and the parallel was exciting. I really learned a lot from these two courses this semester and would recommend every MPH student to take these two classes together their first year.",
    "I would totally recommend this course. This course is one of the most useful ones at YSPH and as a MPH student.",
    "Helpful course",
    "Course Materials (PPT slides etc) and lectures are really good for understanding. Worth taking it.",
    "It's a good class, and really helps you learn SAS. The labs are doable and enjoyable. Lecture is once a week, and is sometimes a lot to sit through. Really great professor and TAs. I enjoyed the class and appreciate the skills I got out of it.",
    "Yes, one of the best most useful classes at YSPH",
    "TAKE IT BEFORE YOUR INTERNSHIP!",
    "highly recommend",
    "Yes, I will, as this course provided essential knowledge and skills needs in data analysis and management.",
    "Great course to take before your thesis. Assignments build on each other, so there is a lot of work needed to make sure errors are corrected each week, but manageable. Even if you don't like SAS or find it difficult, it is well taught, and you will learn a lot.",
    "The class is essential to public health and I definitely feel much more comfortable coding. However the atmosphere of the class is very tense and it's hard to ask questions",
    "I would definitely recommend this course, we learned a lot of good techniques and code that is useful when we analyze our own data. I would have preferred to take this course in the fall of my first year.",
    "Overall I would recommend this course to almost everyone. You'll most likely need SAS for your thesis, and this will help you with what you need to know.",
    "Yes, I would absolutely recommend it as I think the content is extremely useful regardless of area of public health one chooses to specialise in."
