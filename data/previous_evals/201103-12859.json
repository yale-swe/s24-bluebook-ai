   "comments": [
    "Yes it was a very good way to practice all four language skills and Professor Zhou is an excellent teacher!",
    "Relaxed, but a good way to work on one's oral skills and learn more about Chinese culture.",
    "It's perhaps not appropriate for anyone who is coming back from a semester in China or Taiwan, but it is still a very solid class. I would recommend this class.",
    "I decided to take Chinese through film for the sake of maintaining my colloquial Mandarin, after spending a significant amount of time abroad in China. Generally speaking I think the course helps one achieve that goal; for someone with high proficiency it is not a course in which, however, one learns a lot of new material (grammar structures, vocabulary, etc.). This can also be a good thing, if you're looking to take a class that won't take up too much of your time. This was the first year William Zhou taught the course, and though it was a little disorganized at points, I can only imagine that it will improve.",
    "Watch movies in Chinese, talk about them in class. Fun stuff.",
    "Yes, a great class to take if you want to improve you listening abilities",
    "Aside from the quizzes every day, this is a pretty chill course. You get to watch interesting films, and even though it's laid back, you still learn a lot. Zhou Laoshi is a wonderful professor- approachable, highly organized, and encouraging."
