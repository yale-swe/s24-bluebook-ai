    "Difficult philosophical concepts, but Sarab is good at making them easy to understand, and she's understanding of the different Arabic levels in the class (which would be less of an issue if the university provided more ARBC professors and therefore smaller class sizes).",
    "This is probably the best option at Yale for a student taking upper-level Arabic. The readings are challenging, but Sarab clarifies them in class. The class is all about substance and ideas, not grammar, which is refreshing. You'll read some of the big names in Arabic political thought, some of which will be familiar to you if you've ever taken Middle Eastern history (Sayyid Qutb, Gamal Abdel-Nasser, etc.), and some of which will be entirely new (Taha Hussein, etc.) So few Arabic students make it to this level that your class will feel like a small family.",
    "Yes, I would recommend the course. I can't say I learned as much Arabic as I would have liked, but I probably learned more than I would have in any other Arabic course.",
    "This is a great class! It's definitely a lot of work, espeically if you take time to look up words from the texts and make sure you understand all of them. The midterm (5 pages) and final (10 pages) papers are tough but definitely doable, and then there is usually around 300 words of reading response online for each class. But the work is worth it because we got to read really interesting political pieces (from Egyptian anticolonialism to Baathism to Nasser and even Saddam Hussein) and the discussions were really interesting. I didn't just improve my Arabic, but also really feel like I learned a lot about history\/politics.",
    "Arabic 162 is a thoughtful exploration of what it says on the tin: modern Arabic political thought. A broad range of thinkers and works are covered, which provide a rich, well-rounded sample of the diversity of political thinking that the Arab world has seen over the past century. Professor Sarab, for the most part, takes a neutral stance, deciphering the meaning of the assigned texts but leaving an actual evaluation of them to the students, who are allowed to form their own opinions of each reading. Views often differ among classmates, which opens the door to often fascinating discussions that the professor encourages. I would recommend the class only to readers who are proficient in Arabic and are prepared to read some fairly sophisticated texts. The Arabic works covered in this class are original, primary source documents intended for an audience fluent in Arabic; they are a far cry from simpler texts tailored to beginning speakers. More so, at least two full-length essays written in Arabic are required, so the workload could be challenging to students still uncomfortable with speaking and writing Arabic. However, for the student well-versed in Arabic with a thirst for a class that delves into the political thinking of the Arab world in Arabic, this class is a near-perfect choice.",
    "Difficult but very solid course. Probably the best Arabic course I've had at Yale, and certainly the only one I feel like I've really gotten much out of. The readings are difficult and pushed me, but Sarab does a good job of helping us understand the material while also working on helping us understand grammatical concepts we are still having trouble using or don't understand in the readings."
