    "Mixed reviews. When I took this, the syllabus always had too much material on it for any given week, and class discussions reflected the sheer breadth of things we were covering, which wasn't great. But if there's less reading for any given week, I could see this class being a lot of fun. Just check the syllabus before you commit.",
    "Yes. The course gave me a new perspective on the apocalypse and why the western society likes to dwell on this destructive yet hopeful event",
    "Depends - I liked some of the readings, but not the majority.",
    "I recommend this course on the assumption -- a valid one, I think -- that it will get better with practice. (The reading list this term was unrealistically long; I think that will change.) The concept is fascinating and lends itself to an eclectic reading list and interesting discussions. This term saw moments of productive dynamism equal to anything I've seen in a Yale class, and periods when everyone in the room floundered for any way to break the awkward silence. That said, the course was more genuinely interdisciplinary than many cross-listed courses I have taken, drawing on both close-reading and cultural studies approaches to readings which ranged from really enjoyable works of literature (especially science fiction) to texts only palatable as anthropological case studies. This interplay, for me, made the experience totally worthwhile despite dull moments and a somewhat disorganized structure. The opportunity to study the intersections of literature, religion, and culture with Berger is a very valuable one."
