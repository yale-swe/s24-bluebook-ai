    "The ability to transcribe Ugaritic tablets and provide a working translation and transliteration with dictionary assistance.",
    "I learned how to really pay attention to structure and organization of the Semitic language, and how those skills helps with translating in all languages. This taught me how to think about language, and that was super cool.",
    "One of the more important things we looked at was how the YBC stores and catalogues their materials. This was important and fascinating because their materials in their collection is incredibly important for an entire field of study and they have a responsibility to a lot of people internationally."

    "NA",
    "Perhaps, beginning the course with less focus on history and cuneiform script; stretch the grammar study of verbs over a few weeks, as opposed to one.",
    "Reading texts was very interesting. It could be improved by teaching more topics from comparative semitics so we had better understandings of the principles behind the language.",
    "Good balance between covering grammar in the first semester, and abundant practice opportunities in class during the second semester.",
    "I think the pedagogy could be a bit clearer, and that we spent more time in detail on some of the grammatical pieces. I loved that the grades were based on take home exams so that we could really engage our skills and use more time to truly understand the language than just learn it to test it. The chances we were given to interact with direct material and texts pushed me to not only learn the language but learn the skills that would help me re-learn it in the future for application if I forget pieces."

    "Yes, it is very useful for students who study the Bible to be able to work with comparative texts in their original languages (especially Ugaritic, given the high number of comparative texts in that language).",
    "Yes. Ugaritic is an awesome language and everyone should learn about the structure and stylistic pieces of cuneiform languages when studying hebrew bible.",
    "Yes because the language and the literature is important to my field and the class was taught in such a way that exposed me to as much of the material in a helpful way as I was expecting."
