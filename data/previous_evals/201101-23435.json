   "comments": [
    "This is a great introduction to mythology. You probably don't have to do most of the reading, but the texts that are assigned are so compelling that you'll want to.",
    "I really enjoyed this class! Lectures were sometimes a little unfocused, but overall Professor Bakker had great insight into the myths. I just wish we could've read more! The workload isn't bad and as long as you come to class and do some of the reading the exams aren't hard. There are three short written assignments that are like 2 pages each. Section wasn't too bad. If you're at all interested in mythology, take this course!",
    "This class is for you if you want to have a rapid introduction to ancient myth in a manner geared toward people with no academic background in the subject. However, this class is probably too introductory for anyone who has a firm grasp of the material already, particularly if you've taken Greek and\/or Roman Lit, or even both semesters of Eng 129, because it focuses less on comparative studies and more on general themes and the specific works.",
    "Sure, if you like mythology",
    "Yes, but only if you're very interested in the course material. I loved the readings, and lecture is informative, but can get a little dry.",
    "I would recommend this class. It's a great introduction to the early myths which underlie not only most of Western literature but also culture. I would also recommend that a serious student not bring a computer to class and take notes on paper. I wish I had done this, as it would have forced me to pay more attention and I would have gotten more out of the class.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. It is a great survey class to get acquainted with Greek culture and myth, the Professor and TA were great, and the lectures were very interesting.",
    "Yes, it's a fun class and the readings are so much fun! The workload is a bit much, you have two short writing assignments (5 pages each) and 2 exams (midterm, final). There is a lot of readings and you have passage id's on the exam, so beware. Other than that though, it's a great class if you are interested in mythology or classics (or both!).",
    "If you like myth, classics and humanities, this is the course for you.",
    "Yes, particularly if the student needs a humanities credit and has not already read epics like \"The Iliad\" and \"The Odyssey.\"",
    "It's an intro to mythology. Although the psycho-analysis was a bit weird (everything was a sign of castration), the material was interesting. I took this course because I watched Hercules as a kid. :P. TA graded pretty rough on essays. The highest grade on the first assignment was a B+, so if your concerned about grades, this may not be the course for you.",
    "I definitely recommend this class--it is not too hard but is interesting.",
    "The perfect course if you're at all interested in greek mythology.",
    "Nice class with a light work load. The assignments are easy and Bakker covers most of the material you need to know for the exams in class. Take it if you want an easy humanities and read some really great classics."
