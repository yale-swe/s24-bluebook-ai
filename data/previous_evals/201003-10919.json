   "comments": [
    "As the global economy becomes more complex and interconnected, the key players in the game shift from individuals to institutions. Behavioral and Institutional economics is a study of these players, and how they work in today's global economy. As we continue to grapple with the worst economic period since the great depression (a downturn largely caused the the breakdown of major economic institutions), this subject could not be more relevant or useful.",
    "Good course that covers incredibly interesting material, providing a fresh take on behavioral and institutional economics.",
    "Good look at behavioral economics. The readings are interesting and a lot of it is even applicable to day to day situations. Take it if you can make it to class at 8:30 am.",
    "It is an interesting class. You will enjoy reading the books and papers assigned, since they are really intriguing. Prof. Shiller has lots of special opinions regarding to behavioral economics, you will really enjoy sharing his thoughts.",
    "Very good. Highly recommended",
    "I would summarize it as an idea based course with minimal requirements that offers you what you put into it. I would recommend it to anyone with self-motivation.",
    "Yes",
    "Yes, the topic of behavioral economics change the way you think about conventional economics. When we combine both conventional economic ideas with behavioral economics, we can analyze economic problems more thoroughly.",
    "This is not your conventional economics course; I guess the course speaks more easily to psychology or business students.",
    "Yes. I think for an economics student or whoever wants to understand the economy, this course is excellent as it blends standard textbok economics with psychology and sociology.",
    "The material is very enlightening, but you must motivate yourself to keep up with the material. Otherwise, the class will feel disorganized and without a central theme.",
    "The course is a bit of a disappointment. Professor Shiller is a big name and the material is really interesting\/important, but it just didn't really come together. For one, I expected a well-thought-out, quantitative analysis of economics through a behavioral lens. I don't know whether the science is still young or whether Professor Shiller is just teaching to math-inept law students, but the course ended up being really wishy-washy and vague: no hard quant stuff. You end up talking about really ephemeral concepts like \"stories,\" and hardly probe deeply in to anything.Second, the lectures are pretty useless. Professor Shiller is adorable, but he goes on ridiculous tangents and his lectures seem to just be a highlighting of his favorite readings in every particular subject. Again, I didn't feel like I was getting a mastery of anything specific. You really don't have to go actually.The readings were hit or miss. Some were about really cool concepts (Prospect theory!), while others seemed like a complete waste of time. The reading length is pretty reasonable.The workload is pretty manageable. Again, there's not a ton of reading. There's only a midterm and a take-home final. The midterm you do have to study for (make sure you know the names of the authors of each study!), but the final is really easy and can all be done day-of.All in all, this is an easy course on a great subject with a great professor. It just didn't really come together for me, and all of my fellow students agreed.",
    "I liked it, but I sense that very few others did.",
    "This was a good intro course for topics in behavioral economics. The subjects covered were very relevant to the current financial crisis and I thought each subject was covered well.",
    "Overall a good class.",
    "I would not recommend the course to a student with minimal previous exposure to non-mainstream economics for I haven't learned anything new.",
    "I would say this course broadens and deepens student's perspective on seeing the economy and issues related to it.Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to another student.",
    "I would. Though I did have a difficult time understanding how the TA's graded the mid-term. It was not clear what they were looking for in the answers (but I did not make it to the review sessions)."

   "comments": [
    "I am a joint law\/MEM student with the forestry school. I approached this course with more of a law\/policy framework, and this course deepened my knowledge of economic institutions, and how human behavior can influence how these institutions work. I think this course provided me with valuable insights for the future.",
    "Expanded my knowledge of how behavioral factors influence economics, and how institutions can be aligned to better achieve policy outcomes.",
    "I'm an undergraduate, so it didn't have many applications to my future work. More just broad applications to my life from an organizational and personal behavioral context.",
    "The course makes me to understand a new area of economics, which is different from the standard economics theory.",
    "It's very practical",
    "Very helpful for development economics and economic policy development because developing policies also involve people and their reactions.",
    "It deepened my knowledge on economics. It has intrigued my interest for behavioral economics and has strengthened my decision to pursue further studies",
    "The material may provide me with another perspective from which to approach my senior paper, which I plan to write about society and the evolution of economies.",
    "Very helpful. We covered several cutting-edge concepts I wouldn't have been exposed to otherwise.",
    "This course picks up where traditional economics ends but the information is not vital to my research.",
    "in no way",
    "the elements of animal spirit described through the financial crisis or the way institutions are designed filled in gaps for me while I was taking other departmental requirement economic classes such as international economics and macroeconomics.",
    "I am just completing my first semester at the Divinity School and one of my interests is the relationship between economics and theology, and the field of behavioral economics is probably the most relevant to my intended work. I expect that this will be extremely helpful and plan to keep the syllabus and additional readings as an important resource going forward."
