    "I can't really imagine a non-Slavic PhD student taking the course; that said, it is among the most enjoyable classes that I have taken in the department. That it happens to also be a required course is merely a plus, in that it forces students to take a great class.",
    "Definitely rwccommend it. Very interesting and accessible.",
    "It's a required course, so maybe this question is not applicable? I think that I would recommend it to a student with a vested interest in 18th century literature, but it does require a rather sophisticated knowledge of Russian..."

   "comments": [
    "This course absolutely deepened my knowledge of the discipline, as well at the profession. Bella went out of her way on multiple occasions to widen the scope of discussion to include the state of our field today. We discussed presenting at conferences, contextualizing our own research interests within the field, even SEELANGs. Further, I knew next to nothing about the 18th century prior to the course, and now I know a little bit more than nothing. So that's certainly a deepening of my knowledge!",
    "I knew very little about this period before, now I feel I have a much better grasp of the history of Russian literature which I need for research.",
    "Many departments do not require their students to know anything about 18th century literature, but having taken this course, I can't imagine not knowing what I have now learned. It is essential for a more complete understanding of the history of Russian literature, and opens up a huge variety of work in terms of genre, literary language, etc. that is otherwise ignored in our coursework (and that, coming from undergrad, most students have had no contact with)."
