   "comments": [
    "Knowledge about genes and development",
    "An understanding of an organism's development and how it occurs, as well as topics relating to genetics, such as cancer, stem cells, and more generally how genetics works.",
    "I am interested in pursuing genetics research, so this module was especially interesting and useful to me. I think it is a good introductory genetics and development course, although at some parts I was unsure which details were necessary and which were just for my own information--the distinction was unclear, which left me disorientated as to what the specific learning objectives were (beyond the learning objectives posted for each lecture).",
    "Critical reading, developing scientific hypotheses, how to understand broader concepts rather than specific details",
    "In this course, I was able to develop further knowledge of genetics and developmental biology. Also, through the various problem sets, I was able to gain the skill of composing and presenting a research proposal of my own choosing.",
    "I feel as though I didn't really gain any knowledge through this course - maybe just some random facts that don't really pertain to anything else I've learned so far.",
    "I learned how valuable Piazza can be, especially because the lectures were very difficult to understand and Piazza was much clearer.",
    "I learned a good deal on how genetics and epigenetics informs development and developmental processes in humans and some animals.",
    "I learned bout genetics and development.",
    "I learned about genetics and development and I practiced writing in a scientific manner.",
    "I gained some knowledge of how to design science experiments to test simple hypotheses like whether things are necessary\/sufficient. Also learned a lot about genes and development, something I knew nothing about previously.",
    "Hardly and knowledge was gained from this class. It focused on random details of very specific diseases, leaving me wondering what the overall point of the course was.",
    "Concepts surrounding genes and development were emphasized in the course.",
    "BIOL 103 helped me be able to make sense of an observed phenotype and come up with a mechanism by which this was happening even if I knew very little about the subject matter. I also learned how to organize a research paper and find resources to help write one.",
    "how to write a scientific paper, design research experiments",
    "I learned a lot about development and genetics, and it was really interesting and informative",
    "I developed some knowledge of the key events of fundamental techniques in genetics - I feel like this course was overly focused on details that I will not remember a year from now, instead of developing techniques that will be applicable to any genetics class - which were covered but not in great detail (Punnett squares, crosses...).",
    "I learned quite a bit about the molecular mechanisms behind genetics and practiced the skills necessary to understand scientific papers and writing a research proposal.",
    "I learnt a lot about the developmental pathway and how to conduct experiments in order to identify the location and type of location.",
    "Very little.",
    "I learnt nothing from this course, besides, arguably, patience with the most horrendous slew of TAs and Professors I have ever had the misfortune to encounter.",
    "To be honest, I don't feel like I got much of anything out of this class, besides learning to go to Piazza for any sort of intelligible help for an otherwise unintelligible course.",
    "Designing experiments to find an answer",
    "I began to get a foundation in genetics and start to understand some of the experimental methods involved in genetics. The overall concept of early development is clearer to me now.",
    "I learned how to BS my way through quizzes and the exam and I learned how to read minds in that there was nothing of use on most of the lecture slides.",
    "I learned how to write a proper research proposal.",
    "This class definitely provided me with a greater knowledge of genetics and developmental biology. The material was somewhat more challenging that previous introductory biology modules and taught me to synthesize multiple lectures worth of material to gain a better understanding. I also appreciate the focus through the homework assignments on learning to write a research proposal, but this did not greatly benefit me as I had already written similar documents in the past.",
    "I learned factual information about developmental pathways as well as practical skills for solving genetics- and development-related problems, including genetic crosses, linkage mapping, and gene product relationships in pathways. I also learned how to design experiments to test hypotheses regarding interactions between genes."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Poor instructor, makes lecture nearly not worth attending, testing on super-specific details (on the final exam: is this particular disease dominant or recessive that was covered in one slide) while the professor claims its a class on \"general concepts\" some questions on weekly quizzes seem like they are purposefully inserted to be answered incorrectly by the students",
    "Strengths: Things were generally fleshed out pretty well Weaknesses: Details that we get quizzed\/tested on aren't explained that decently, and it can be hard to pick out what is or isn't important",
    "Strengths were that Dr. Zhong was excited to teach and explain concepts to students, although at times the explanations were not detailed enough or assumed we already knew information that we didn't. Improvements include providing more information as to what information is important for students to know as core concepts in genetics and development, as the information presented in class versus the caliber of exams was very different--sometimes tricky in a way that did not challenge students, but rather confused us (wording, unclear questions). In this way, although I felt prepared with the material, certain questions seemed to test my ability to decipher what the professor was asking, rather than testing my ability to interpret data or answer the actual questions.",
    "Strengths of this course is that the professor provides any necessary information for the exam and clearly describes what will\/will not be on the exam. Also, the problem sets are a strength because not only do they cover necessary content, but it builds practical skills that can be used in other research-based classes. Weaknesses of the course include that the lecture slides do not always provide enough detail, maybe include page references in the slides so that students can have further enrichment. Also, during questions, encourage student participation because questions are usually answered by the professor because students are not engaged.",
    "No real strengths that I could find. This course needs a new teacher who actually engages with students and clearly articulates his aims for the course.",
    "I don't really know what else to write here, because I feel that a lot of the students who have taken this course before me have written thoughtful responses and described improvements that they would like to see that would have made the course enjoyable and beneficial but that have not been addressed or taken into consideration.",
    "The curriculum is fascinating and well-designed. Unfortunately, the course is not particularly well taught and could use a professor who can explain more complex concepts with greater clarity. I personally had no trouble following the class but many of my peers were not as fortunate - and not by their own faults, but rather because I had been exposed to this material previously.",
    "Lectures for this course could be greatly improved. There is never enough time to cover all the content that needs to be covered, and this often means that there are lecture slides that are glossed over or poorly explained, but you are still accountable for this information. Also, there is never time to ask questions in lecture, and when questions are asked it feels as though Professor Weimin is annoyed that something needs to be re-explained or that a student doesn't get a concept. The class just ends up being you memorizing a ton of facts and hoping they are applicable to the exams and quizzes (which they usually aren't).",
    "Carter Takacs is the strength, and so is the presence of the TA's on Piazza.",
    "The class is on an interesting topic, and I enjoyed my section, but it was poorly taught and the lectures were hard to follow and remain engaged in. I actually liked the quizzes somewhat.",
    "This course covers a lot of information, which is good. The weakness is that the methods of assessment rely VERY heavily on details despite the professor's reassurance that they won't. And they're not common details they're obscure details related to very specific pathways etc. Overall I thought it was good but at times confusing. I also think the quizzes had us deal with difficult problems that we had no exposure to I would have preferred problem sets.",
    "While the content of the course is very interesting, the way it was presented in class was confusing and prevented students from making integral connections between related concepts. Several times during lecture, Professor Zhong insisted that students be able to understand general concepts of the course, rather than specific details. However, in order to do well in the course, students had to be able to regurgitate minute (and often insignificant details).",
    "The main problem with this course is the disconnect between what is discussed in lecture and what is tested on the quizzes\/exam. I understand that Prof. Zhong and the TAs want us to apply the concepts from the lectures in order to answer quiz\/exam questions, but often these questions tested us on topics that were never discussed in lecture. Many of us have very thoroughly combed through the lecture notes and not found any material related to certain questions, and I believe this was one of the biggest reasons as to why the quiz averages were so low. Also, this idea of only testing concepts is completely false. There were instances, even on the final, where the questions involved specific factoids that were only mentioned on a single slide in the lectures. And yes, although we are expected to apply concepts to novel problems, we never really had the opportunity to practice doing so. This is why I think the class can benefit greatly from two things: STUDY GUIDES that explicitly and succinctly summarize all the information we are expected to know for the assessments, and PRACTICE QUIZZES\/EXAMS for practicing applying concepts to problems we have never seen before. The class did provide a pset for genetics towards the end of the course, but a pset like that for every single topic in lecture would have benefited the class so much. My main qualm with the BIOL 103 sections themselves is that they should focus more on explaining the concepts in the course than reading papers that are tangentially related to the lecture topics. While I understand the reasoning behind learning the techniques in the papers, I feel that directly addressing many of the students' misunderstandings in the lecture topics themselves would be a much more productive use of time.",
    "This course didn't teach many big ideas, or at least didn't make them clear. This made studying and overall comprehension very difficult. The only strength I can think of is that it had good TAs.",
    "I did not like the organization of this class. Some lessons only made sense three lectures after they were tested. There needs to be a brief overview of general topics before going into specifics. The professor uses a lot of different organisms to show different stages of development, but could have been clearer which animals were being depicted in each image.",
    "The lectures were confusing, and the questions presented on the quizzes were convoluted. There was only 15 minutes allotted for each quiz.",
    "The strength of this course is the subject matter. A lot of the topics that were covered in class had great potential to be interesting. I like how the course is organized with weekly quizzes and a cumulative PSET. It helps in receiving continuous feedback throughout the module. One of the major weaknesses are the slides. They are incredibly unclear and hard to understand. There is very little explanation on any of them which was clearly reflected on Piazza when multiple slides from each lecture were asked to be clarified.",
    "this is a terribly taught course; the concepts are relatively simple however they are presented in a confusing light; enrichment was helpful but the lectures were awful",
    "The concepts are really interesting. The lecture slides are very helpful. The homework was fun and interesting. However, the quizzes were quite difficult and often tested us on things we hadn't learned. They also seemed designed to most-benefit people with prior knowledge. Also, overall the course didn't feel super friendly to people who didn't know as much to begin with",
    "The only strength of this course is the material, which I personally found interesting (the lecture on neurodevelopment and cancer were especially exciting). I also liked the homeworks and culmination into a presentation. Weaknesses - the material was skimmed over due to lack of time (no time for questions), the order of things was very incoherent (covering neurodevelopment before genetics), the lectures often felt like a collection of random examples with no big picture, the quizzes were often poorly worded. And last of all, we were told not to focus on the details for the final numerous times, so what kind of question is where is the ZPA located?? The final was straight up unfair and did not test any of the important concepts of the course - we were instead asked about topics which I knew from high school biology but were never covered in the course (ex: the 3 domains of life). I think the whole format\/teaching and testing of this course needs to be revised.",
    "Strengths: The content taught in this course is very good and is necessary for any bio major or pre-med, especially with how new medicinal breakthroughs are mostly focused on genetic alteration. Weaknesses: I feel like Prof. Zhong's lecturing style is not very well suited to such a large class. I noticed most of the people in the class weren't paying attention at all during lectures.",
    "The TA was very helpful at explaining the papers and homework which made the homework fascinating and manageable. The slides were sometimes in a confusing order in lecture which made them hard to follow and sometimes the explanation wasn't clear.",
    "The course lacks anything resembling structure, and is essentially just a series of lectures that may or may not have something to do with genes strung together. Professor Zhong's lectures themselves are also disorganized, and it was never clear what level of detail was or was not necessary for the exams. The sections involved papers that were never mentioned or tied into lecture material, and one section (not discussing a paper) had no discernible topic or purpose at all. BIOL 103 also doesn't fit into the rest of the sequence, and every time Professor Zhong said \"You should have seen this in bio 101\/102,\" I hadn't.",
    "Professor was horrible. This was an unbelievably stressful class and I do not think it properly prepared me for the MCAT or for my future bio studies. I didn't enjoy the class, the section, and would spend hours pouring over the notes. There was little coordination between the TAs and Zhong it seemed, and there was tension between him and the rest of class. Piazza attempted to fill in the blanks that he left, but is not sufficient for a properly taught class.",
    "This course had no strengths. The weakness of this course was that it existed to consume hours of my time without teaching me anything useful in the slightest.",
    "Strengths: the TF's answer questions on Piazza Weaknesses: very poorly organized course (we started with embryogenesis and gastrulation and ended with the birth of Mendelian genetics, which made identifying themes across the class and seeing how one concept lead to another a lot more difficult than it needed to be); taught by a professor who likes to assume that students know a lot of obscure topics beforehand and who therefore glossed over everything with obviously no interest in investing in students How to be improved: choose a different professor who actually is interested in teaching and spending time understanding students - teaching and learning is a two-way street, and it was very difficult to feel like Professor Zhong ever actually wanted to be there",
    "varying effectiveness of TAs. Carter was amazing but friends said other TAs seemed disinterested",
    "The pace of the material and the structure with respect to the research proposal as homework and the section assignments were strengths of the course. I found developing the research proposal particularly, while challenging, was relevant and applicable. The primary weakness of the course is the lectures. They are very difficult to follow and engage with, they don't prepare students for the quizzes or exam, and there is not much clear information to study afterward on the slides. The quizzes were not always answerable based on material in lecture and were often too long or comprehensive for the time allotted.",
    "There weren't many strengths that I can think of. It all felt disjointed. The lectures were all over the place and you could only hear him talk about half the time. The slides had no helpful information on them in many cases. The textbook readings were useless for the class.",
    "I really enjoyed the format of problem sets and the presentation about our proposed research on a gene. This really made me feel like a true scientist. Other than that, this course was not very good. There was always way too much information on the lecture slides. You could study all weekend long and still do poorly because of subjective wording of the questions.",
    "The material in this class was quite interesting, and Professor Zhong clearly takes the time to go into it in depth in lecture. I was also pleased by the overall fairness of the quizzes; I rarely encountered questions that I felt were not substantiated by the lecture material. That being said, the course was at times a bit difficult to follow, and almost appeared to be ordered in an unintuitive way. If I recall correctly, the review session led by the TAs started with lecture 6, as that was the true start of the introductory material, and eventually circled back to lectures 1-5, which could not really be fully understood without going through the background first. I understand why Professor Zhong tries to start in context with difficult material, but I dont think that it fully worked.",
    "I would've liked to learn more about development. Most high school biology classes don't teach it that well and I was hoping to get a sequential understanding of development in this class.",
    "In my opinion, a clear strength is the four-part project that centers on designing an experiment to test relationships between genes. I believe this project allowed us to apply the knowledge we learned in BIOL 103 to a real-world problem. I think there were some parts of the course, particularly the final exam, that were too fact-heavy, especially given Professor Zhong's stated intention to place conceptual understanding, and not fact memorization, as the central goal of this course."

   "comments": [
    "No, but if you have to take it, you have to take it",
    "Yes, if you are a bio or pre-med student. Otherwise, I wouldn't advise taking it unless you are interested in bio and want to go through the whole sequence just because.",
    "As the BIOL 101-104 course is directed for certain majors, I do believe it is a good introductory module for those interested in the material itself.",
    "It's part of the sequence. Most people take it because they have to.",
    "I would recommend this course to other students because it is a prerequisite for future biology classes. If someone didn't have to take this course, I would encourage them to take a science class that is slightly more engaging.",
    "Definitely not, don't take this course unless you're premed or have to for your major. If you are going to take Biol 103 take it off sequence to avoid Weimin.",
    "I can't recommend this course to another student. The intro bio sequence is necessary for a lot of students to complete their majors or go to medical school. I would definitely recommend taking the intro bio sequence off sequence, such that 101 and 102 are taken during the spring and 103 and 104 are taken in the fall of the following year as the professors seem to be better.",
    "I wouldn't, since there are better-taught genetics courses at Yale. Unfortunately, bio majors don't have much of a choice when it comes to the intro bio sequence.",
    "If you're in Bio103, you are probably only taking any of the bio sequence because you have to. If you don't have to, absolutely don't take this course. Lecture isn't well taught, homework assignments are poorly explained, and I didn't learn too much about development or genetics.",
    "Its an important part of Biology.",
    "Only as a prerequisite, probably not as a fun\/pleasant class.",
    "I would definitely recommend the course because I think biology is a fundamental science that everybody should know aboutthe nice thing about this course is that it's not really intro-level, the drawback being it's not really intro-level. It's tough and the quizzes can be tricky\/ require the knowledge of very obscure details from specific pathways etc. but I think overall it's very doable. Also, it assumes a decent about of knowledge about genetics.",
    "Even though the material was interesting, I would not recommend this poorly-taught course to other students.",
    "Unless you need to take it, stay far, far away from this course. There is a massive disconnect between what is discussed in lecture and what is tested on the quizzes\/exam. The lectures are very dry, and Prof. Zhong often has difficulty communicating his ideas effectively to the class. Outside of PIazza (which is disorganized and chaotic), there's not much you can do to help yourself study. Prof. Zhong insists on never making study guides and instead using the lecture slides themselves as study guides, but the slides are often confusing and make little sense on their own without someone explaining them to you. Often they are just figures juxtaposed with text that doesn't seem to say much. Th sections don't really help with learning the class material either. Take it in the fall with Irish if you can, at least she provides study guides and tests you on what's actually in the lectures.",
    "Don't take this course unless you have to. It is terribly organized, the professor is incoherent, and the quizzes\/exam is impossible unless you have a very strong background in biology, or if you have dumb luck.",
    "NO! Definitely don't take this course unless you absolutely have to. The course was really poorly organized and the professor was very unhelpful.",
    "This course was necessary for my major and pre-med.",
    "it unfortunately is necessary for the biology major; the material is interesting but is taught in a way that made me question whether i actually liked biology",
    "Yes, but with reservations. The material is interesting and you'll learn quite a bit. However, the way the course is structured can make you feel small and insignificant and like your professor doesn't care about you",
    "BIOL 103 is not worse than 102, simply because the material is more interesting (genetics of diseases, neurodevelopment...). However lectures are extremely hard to follow logically, what could be interesting material is skimmed over and I feel like I got little out of it in the long run. The final was terribly designed. Take it if you need to, it doesn't really prepare you for more advanced genetics classes\/ isn't very enjoyable.",
    "It is a good course in the way that the material is necessary and is comprehensive. Also, it's not like you can skip out on taking this course anyway if you are any kind of bio major or pre-med.",
    "Yes although only if it's a requirement.",
    "This class is terrible, but you have to take it. Consider the off sequence to get a better professor (Professor Zhong is incredibly disorganized and you learn nearly nothing that feels meaningful).",
    "Absolutely do not take this class if you can avoid it.",
    "It is a pre-requisite for many classes. Highly recommend you do not take it with Zhong. Nothing against him personally, Im sure he's an amazing researcher, but he is not a good introductory level teacher and I am extremely frustrated that the biology department would have him teach this course that is 150 students. He said he wished it was an 40 person class during lecture one day. That's impossible. This is a pre-req for the entire bio major, is needed as a pre-med, and is needed for psych with neuro.",
    "If you're taking this course because you have to, I pity you for being prey to the pointless foundational biology sequence that this school forces you to sit through. Be prepared to learn nothing, be tested on things that first, you were never taught and, second, have no use in a real world setting. The professor seems to understand very little of what he is teaching, and he is inarguably incapable of teaching the material. We were tested on things that were either pointless minutiae or things that we didn't know even remotely it's not like you have to apply your knowledge that you've learnt it's just totally random stuff, ranging from 7th grade biology to the paper that Weimin pulled out of his backside this week to drone on about cancer and eternal life maybe (I wouldn't really know, given he was so unclear). Honestly, if you have to take this class, brace yourself to be encouraged to obfuscate your writing like a \"true\" scientist, learn nothing useful, actually learn nothing at all, and get super frustrated. Also be ready to be sassed both in class and on Piazza without actually having your question answered. Take this class with a friend if you must; it's impossible without it.",
    "No - absolutely do not take the intro bio sequence at Yale unless you need to for your major or premed studies. This may not continue to apply, but I've heard that Kristin McJunkins has said that the class Physiological Systems can replace the bio 103-104 half. So consider that class, instead!",
    "Professor Zhong was a disorganized lecturer and made material more confusing than necessary at times. If Carter taught the course, I would recommend it.",
    "The bio modules in general provide a good foundation in both the theories and concepts needed for further study and the experimental methods used to discover the workings of those concepts. For this module in particular, I would say that you can get out of it what you put into it - I would recommend that you should take the course if you're willing to put in extra effort to decipher the lectures and go through the material diligently afterwards.",
    "Absolutely not, but no one is here because they just want to be. Lots of people have to take it.",
    "No, only take it if you have to.",
    "Im honestly not sure if I would recommend this course to another student. On one hand, the quizzes felt relatively fair, which is always important in an intro bio class. On the other hand, the lectures can be hard to follow, especially after the fact, and the difficult concepts are often the ones that get the least amount of explanation time. Definitely, if you are planning on taking this class, be aware that you absolutely must pay detailed attention in lecture and will more than likely also need to take further efforts to fully understand everything.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. I believe that the skills that BIOL 103 develops to study and understand genetics-related problems, particularly with regards to relationships between genes in pathways, are often crucial in biology-related research work."
