    "To say this course blew my mind would be putting it light. Wormholes. Nothing matters. Schrodinger's cat. What is meaning?",
    "A good introduction to some pretty fascinating stuff. Definitely a good way to take care of a science credit. Workload is very reasonable. The experience probably depends on who else is in the class--classroom time is generally at least half spent on discussion, which can go on pretty weird tangents. But all and all, it's a great way to learn interesting material that you wouldn't learn about otherwise without going through a ton of prereqs.",
    "I learned a lot about what physicists are doing right now and what they have been doing over the past century or so. But this is not a history of physics course, this is a physics course. You learn what the advances (both theoretical and experimental) were and how they led to such things as quantum physics, string theory, the discovery of a new fundamental particle in the last decade: the Higgs. The course is, though a tad unstructured, excellent. The material is accessible to everyone if you just put in the time to do the readings and the problem sets. Honestly, it doesn't take more than a few hours to complete the readings, and they are fascinating! I would recommend this course to anyone who isn't already a physics major (and would be bored) but is interested in becoming more well versed in scientific literature and wants to be up to date on some of the things going on in cutting edge physics. Learn about the many worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics, uncertainty, relativity, time dilation, relativity of time (time is not absolute for all observers!) and of space.",
    "Really good overview of quantum physicsprobably would never have learned this material in my life otherwise. It's nice as a casual SC credit; it's about 1-2 hours of homework a week, and one two-hour seminar. The lectures, however, are horrible. Often, I would be more confused about the material after class than before. They're disorganized and meander. The class does little to engage studentsit could easily be structured as a discussion-based class instead of a lecture-based one to make it more pedagogically effective.",
    "It's a fun science credit that will make you rethink your view of the universe."
