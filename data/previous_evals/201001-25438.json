   "comments": [
    "I would recommend global health as a good background class to issues in public health.",
    "I recommend this class for a simple and theoretical introduction to Global Health. Great professor and some very interesting case studies, but the books and classes focus a lot on theory and very broad topics that are not always interesting.",
    "Wonderful introduction, great class where you can take your liberties with what you want to focus on. Quite demanding though.",
    "I would recommend this class to those willing to put in the time.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course!!",
    "Some of the ideas are pretty basic and rudimentary, and the class can be a bit slow at times. However, through the process of writing the health briefs, you get a lot of practice researching and constructing a succinct paper.",
    "take it if you've never taken another class on public health. if you already have some exposure, it might be more useful to take a class on a more focused topic. the work is loaded on the end of the semester, but other than that it's a good class.",
    "Take it C\/D\/Fail unless it gets reorganized. The workload is heavier than expected (we had a lot of last minute assignments that weren't on the syllabus) and relies a lot on group assignments.",
    "Great class to take if you are at all interested in public or global health. Kaveh is definitely the friendliest professor I've had and very knowledgeable in the area of global health. He also has a ton of connections and got interesting speakers to come to do guest lectures, and also would take the class out to dinner afterward with the speakers. Definitely one of my favorite classes for the semester. Lecture could at times be a little quiet or dry if you have experience with learning about global health before, but the readings were interesting, the Prof and TA were also great, and the assignments were cool and actually fun to do.",
    "Definitely! Global Health is a pretty comprehensive look at global health, even though it's a hugely diverse field. Kaveh Khoshnood is an INCREDIBLE guy, absolutely THE person you need to meet if you are seriously interested in global health. The brief papers can be tough, because you need to fit so much info into such a small paper, but the guidelines are super clear and you are guided on them pretty well. The group project at the end is spread out well enough that you're not rushing over reading week, and the guest speakers are great!",
    "Definitely recommend it.",
    "Yes, I'd definitely recommend it. Very interesting class, and great professor. But I did think the Birn textbook was a bit dry. The case studies were usually much more interesting.",
    "Take it if you are interested in global health. The class is general so you do not really go in depth except in section with a few case studies. There are more specific courses for those interested, but for those who want a very broad understanding on all of the different agents that impact global health, then this is good course to take. I would definitely recommend it.",
    "I would recommend this class to a student who has not taken public health courses or would like to learn about global health. It was interesting and had a nice mix of class work."
