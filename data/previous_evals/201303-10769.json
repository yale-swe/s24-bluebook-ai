   "comments": [
    "I would absolutely recommend it.",
    "If you are willing to work for about 2 hours per day (even if you are good at languages) and are interested in Chinese language and culture, definitely!",
    "Chinese 110 is a fast paced, intense language class. You learn a lot in a short amount of time and the teachers are not kidding when they say you have have two and a half to three hours of homework and preparation a night. It's a lot of work, but it is well worth it. All the teachers are great and really encourage the students to learn. In class, everyone speaks and no one comments on anyone's level of knowing the language because everyone is struggling with it as well. The classes are small, so there is plenty of space for personal correction in class. I don't have to tell you it's a practical language in order to encourage people to take it. I think that knowing a language so different from your own has its own benefits and Chinese is very different from English (if that's your first language). The experience is one you won't forget and the knowledge is well worth the work.",
    "Chinese 110 is a serious time commitment, but if you like learning languages and want to learn Chinese, it's worth it. The homework load is consistent and substantial, but not overwhelming. The material isn't super easy, but it's in no way unreasonable. Basically, the course is a challenge, but one you can definitely handle if you want to.",
    "SO MUCH WORK. But you need a language credit so there's not much you can do to avoid it if you're starting off at L1 like me. But the teachers are great and you will learn a lot.",
    "A lot of work, but definitely worth it. The language is so fun, and this class is a great introduction to an amazing culture!",
    "Great introductory Chinese course. The pace is fast and there's little room (by which I mean no room) to fall behind, but all the teachers are great, the classes are super engaging, and you'll definitely learn a ton of Chinese.",
    "I'm amazed at how much I learned in one semester. It's a very effective class and not incredibly difficult, as long as you put in the effort. The combination of classroom focus on speaking and grammar and the outside focus on vocabulary provides a very comprehensive learning experience. I would definitely recommend this class; this semester has truly made me fall in love with the Chinese language and culture.",
    "I think that the Chinese language and culture combined is really different than the culture behind French or Spanish. I would recommend this language to someone who is up for a challenge, but also wants a completely different language experience. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think this language is for everyone because pronouncing the tones can be very tricky and some people might not be able to properly grasp the sounds.",
    "I moves quickly, but if you keep up with all the work assigned you will learn the material. I spent a lot of my time practicing Chinese, but has been worth it.",
    "CHNS 110 is an awesome class that i would recommend to anyone who is committed to learning Chinese. I would recommend this class to students who are willing to put in a lot of work and effort. I have learned a lot of Chinese - reading, writing, speaking that i never thought i could learn in such a short period of time. Great class!",
    "Chinese 110 is a great course, but it does require a lot of work. You learn a lot, far more than you would in another language course or in a high school course, but only if you are willing to put in the time. I would recommend Chinese 110 to another student.",
    "Yes, take this class if you are prepared to learn Chinese fast and love it!",
    "Yes",
    "I would say that you need to be willing to put the work into it but if you do you will see the results. It is a demanding work load but you learn a lot and learn to love the language as well. For these reasons I would recommend the course.",
    "As I stated in the first question, Chinese 110 is excellent as long as you are ready to put in the work. There are daily quizzes, two oral dialogues per week, 5 exams, and a ton of characters to learn. You get out of it what you put into it, though, and you have the opportunity to apply for the Light Fellowship which is an incredible opportunity. I would highly recommend the class.",
    "It is a ton of work, but you are going to get a lot out of it. Seriously, you will have to work up to 3 hours every night. All of the teachers are amazing, and a great dynamic is created within the class. I would definitely recommend it if you have any interest in China or Chinese.",
    "I would recommend this course to interested students. The only warning is that they must be willing to put in as much time as they can if they really wish to lean the language.",
    "Drills. You learn several contexts for conversation: Saying Hello., Family, Hobbies, Shopping, Transportation, School life, etc. Each lesson has vocabulary (about 30-40 new words every other day with pinyin and hanzi; 7+\/- grammar points). Memorized dialogue presentations every week in class (1) and in section (1). Tutorial 1hr every week. Teachers are great. You will cover a lot of ground and will definitely learn very much if you put in the hours of work. Like many other classes, you get what you put in.",
    "It's a really hard course with a lot of work but it's so worth it because you really learn Chinese. I'm amazed at how much I can say after just one semester.",
    "Chinese 110 is a rigorous course but it is definitely worth taking. The teachers are all very caring and accessible. On top of that, the course is well-taught and organized.",
    "Chinese 110 is a big commitment to take on. The class will probably demand more of your time than the majority of your other classes. However it is really satisfying to feel like I am learning something substantial every day, and Chinese is a very interesting course, so the large volume of course work is interesting."
