   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this class to another student. You get to spend a lot of time during the semester researching a topic on interest to you and applying a unique framework to it so that you can analyze it in a new way. But also be warned that part of this class is theory-heavy, and it's hard to devote enough time to understand it all because there are so many readings every week. Also the discussion of fisheries gets pretty technical, so be prepared for that.",
    "Democracy & Sustainability was a really interesting class, but it could be a little overwhelming at times.",
    "Great! Take it if you're interested in either democracy OR sustainability (or both, of course). The course offers a nice mixture of political theory and case studies of natural resource management. The project is fun and completely open, so you can study anything you want in depth. Professor Fotos is a great seminar leader. Readings are sometimes long and dense, especially in the first few weeks, but worth doing to get the most out of the course.",
    "This is a class that teaches you about the institutional analysis framework developed by Elinor Ostrom. This is the main focus of the class and the papers. Practical applications are presented through New England Ground-fisheries and Maine Lobster fisheries. You can choose any topic you'd like for you paper, though. I would caution prospective students to first be sure that you understand that this class is not first and foremost about democratic states and sustainability.",
    "The class is all about the IAD framework approach to sustainability. If that's what you're after, go for it",
    "Take this class if you are interested in environmental policy!! This class gives a much more engaging, complex and rewarding look at how policy (and environmental policy) is formulated than any other EVST class I have taken so far. The readings can seem like A LOT but you can sort of pick which ones you really need to know well based on the weekly memos the professor sends out. Professor Fotos gives a casual and friendly vibe to the seminar which can be very refreshing. Would recommend you have some interest in fisheries if you're going to take this course but not necessary.",
    "EP&E 390 is a class that aims at understanding ecological and environmental problems and looking for possible solutions. In this course, we learn how question what we think we know to be true about American politics and environmental management. We study a number of different cases where different management structures which either promote or degrade environmental health, and look for ways to answer complex and hierarchical problems. I would absolutely, 100% recommend this class to anyone looking to understand wildlife conservation and environmental management.",
    "Yes, I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone interested in the relationship between science and policymaking and the challenges that arise in bridging the two. Prof. Fotos sharp questions and humility make for great discussions of difficult problems."
