    "To the student of sociology and culture alike, this seminar offers an important perspective into the fundamental questions that abound the society that we live in today. Highly recommended to all students of the social sciences and the humanities.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student interested in cultural sociology or--more broadly--from relevant fields such as cultural anthropology or history. It provides a point of view on culture and society which is unique and different from most current literature in the field."

    "Where anysocial science or humanities subject is constantly faced with the question of meaning, this course offered insight into the internal structures that dominate such a thing. As a sociology graduate student with the intentions of exploring the deep structures that mobilize meaning, and thereby human interaction, this course was pivotal to my development into the second year of the program.",
    "The course provided much needed background in cultural sociology. While it is early to tell how and where this knowledge will contribute to my dissertation, I have no doubt that it will have a major impact on my future work."
