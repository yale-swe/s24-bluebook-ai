    "This class is brilliant. Doug and Julian are both excellent designers and teachers who give productive, specific feedback on the projects you work on during the semester. The history of graphic design lectures given by Doug during the first half of the semester were especially enlightening. Critiques were sometimes very long, but it was always interesting to see other students projects.",
    "Take it! It's fun, interesting, challenging...all the good things a class can be. The first half of the semester was history of design lectures which were very well put together (Doug is a beast) and a book design project for the undergrads which was super fun. The second half was with Julian and was only critique (no lectures) on a second book project we all did. Beautiful course. Tough but beautiful.",
    "first half is lectures on graphic design history while also making an accordion style book about 1 designer that you research and write about. second half was another book: had to re-design a book published before 1990.",
    "Advanced Design is a really great class! Each semester it's slightly different; the fall semester course focuses on poster design, while the spring semester has history of graphic design, and is more book-heavy. I plan on taking both, but if you aren't able to, the spring semester one is a great one to take, though I can't speak for the other. Both Doug and Julian are both fantastic professors, and the history aspect was both helpful and really interesting. Dont miss your chance to take a class with Doug, who usually teaches at RISD! The two major projects assigned were both interesting, and are some of the best work Ive done so far at Yale. Highly recommended!"
