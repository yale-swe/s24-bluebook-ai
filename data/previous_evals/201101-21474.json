   "comments": [
    "If you like China, yes. If you like History, yes. It gives you a good background on China and is a good class. Lecture isn't enthralling, but the readings are.",
    "boring lecture. great TA in Zhang Taisu, but he's not TA'ing anymore, so I wouldn't take it again.",
    "I would probably not recommend this course to another student. Look at the syllabus, get a couple of the books and read them. You will learn most of what I did and be able to take a more interesting class. The lectures did not add much in the way of identifying themes that you would otherwise not easily find.",
    "yes if you are interested in the history of china. i found it enjoyable. but if you are just doing it for the credit, it may be a little of a stretch.",
    "The workload is light, and the material is extremely interesting, even if the lectures are hard to stay awake through. If you are interested in China and are willing to spend time outside of class to really understand the material, you can learn a lot about basic Chinese history through this class.",
    "This course is a good way to get a rest of world credit. The material is fascinating and worthwhile, but the way it is presented can be confusing at times. Much of studying for the final exam turned into self learning, but besides that, coursework is relatively light.",
    "Very straightforward class: list of IDs for the exams and simple written asisgnments. Won't change your life but a stress-free option for learning about the subject.",
    "Perdue is not the most dynamic lecturer, but the material is interesting, and I enjoyed the class. Perdue does mix it up with songs and videos, which is nice.",
    "Don't take it yet. They still need to make the lectures more cohesive. The material is there, and it is interesting even while studying, but the lectures are terrible.",
    "I would not recommend this class, I did not get a lot out of it.",
    "Great class if you're willing to put in the effort to teach yourself a lot of the information in conjunction with the good readings since lectures were a bit dry and all over the place at times.",
    "Eh, I mean, if you are interested in China it's kind of a no option shindig.",
    "This class was a terrible waste of time. It is a travesty that Yale, which used to have a jam-packed Chinese history class when Spence taught, now has such weak offerings in Asian history.",
    "A lot happened in China in the past 450 years, so this course sort of breezes through those events in the.course of the semester. That said, Perdue does a great job of covering all the important things and of showing how they parallel other things on both Chinese and world history. You learn a lot really quickly and its all very interesting.",
    "History 316 covers the early modern and modern periods of Chinese history. The course provides insights on the Ming and Qing dynasties, as well as the Republic of China and the People's Republic of China. It is important to note that less time is spent on the modern ROC and PRC than one would think.The class utilizes a mix of scholarly interpretations, but mainly relies on primary sources. The readings are fascinating and the highlight of the course. The essay topics can be a bit eccentric, but they do force students to look at history in a different light.I would recommend the class to those looking to get an intro overview of China.",
    "If you're interested in China it's a must take, you can't get around not knowing this stuff. The readings will take you a long way and the ta's can take you the rest of the way.",
    "An overview of chinese history and modern china. you need this basic info if you wanna have anything to do with china in your future. you probably will, so take it.",
    "Wonderful course on Modern History of China with the perspectives of commoners. I would definitely recommend this course to those familiar or unfamiliar with China.",
    "I would recommend East Asian Studies 320 to anyone interested in Chinese history, especially if they enjoy lectures, because the class involves a lot of lecturing.",
    "If you like EAS or history, take it."
