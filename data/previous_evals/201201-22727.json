   "comments": [
    "Eh, if you're interested, like actually interested, in environmental problems. A lot of it is common sense.",
    "Yes, pretty interesting, useful material. Not too demanding either.",
    "Relatively easy environmental class, there are only two assignments all semester, two take home exams. Lecture is a bit boring, but readings and sections can be as intriguing as you make it. I recommend it to anyone who wants some background into environmental politics or for anyone looking for an easy class.",
    "Interesting for those passionate about environmental issues",
    "Yes take it, a good fifth class, a lot of readings but they are a really good read. Testing is fair, a lot of focus and attention on showing up for section, taking part in discussion but that's only fair since there are only take home midterms and finals.",
    "I've heard that people take this class because it's easy. I took it because I need it for my major, but it turned out to be fairly interesting. It's worth it to do the readings: they have the potential to contribute to some really cool discussion. Professor Wargo is a little pessimistic about the state of the world in general, I think, which can get frustrating, but handle that how you will. Midterm\/final weren't too difficult, and there's an optional paper to boost your grade.",
    "Very interesting class with little work to do. Definitely recommend it.",
    "Interesting class but not too engaging of a lecture. If you get a good TF, you'll have a great experience with it, and if you get a boring TF, the class will be a waste. Minimal assignments (take home midterm\/ take home final) and the midterm at least was graded very easily.",
    "Nah, you should take classes you're genuinely interested in. Some of you are thinking this is an easy A, and that largely depends on what TA grades your midterm and final, since they are not graded by the guy or gal who leads your section. Avoid this class, there are many easier\/more interesting ones in Yale College.",
    "I would take it. It's a must before you graduate.",
    "Good class for environmental awareness and the future of the field. Definitely made me think differently about daily life and where green tech is going. Very cool stuff.",
    "Easy going lecture about a very interesting and relevant set of issues - 2 take home exams + optional paper - totally manageable and worth your while",
    "PERFECT 5th course. The topic is actually really interesting and exposes you to everyday environmental concerns (food, tobacco industry, pesticides, nuclear weapons, etc.). I took this Credit\/D and it was the best way to do it (just one take-home midterm and one take-home final) -- but honestly, if you take this for credit, it isn't hard to do well in it. I had never taken an EVST course before this but it was a great introduction to these kinds of issues, and totally understandable\/manageable for non-EVST majors. Take this for a 5th course!!",
    "Take it if it is something that interests you. It's not a lot of work, but no a guaranteed A.",
    "Yes.",
    "If you're interested in the subject matter, EVST 255 is a great class. If you're not, I suppose at least it's an easy class. You don't really have to do any of the readings, and the midterm and final are take home and not difficult.",
    "great class",
    "YES, take this class!",
    "A good class to take credit\/d - just section, a midterm, and final. Also interesting material.",
    "A nice class to take as a 5th class or something. Very light workload, and Wargo is very lenient about a lot of things. Lectures are a bit dry, and section is awful, but the readings are interesting and the class makes you think.",
    "I would say the overal theme of this course is how oversights (inadvertent or otherwise) in government policy lead to loss of environment or public health. You basically learn about the concept in a bunch of different case studies. That said, you will learn a ton. I would recommend this class because it really opens you eyes to different problems in regulation and just with the food, air, and water we use. But, only take it if you already have some interest in the subject or are passionate about the environment...otherwise you will bored and should just read an article about these issues or something less time consuming.",
    "Great class. take it if you are interested in studying a science that applies more than any other science to your everyday life.",
    "I recommend it",
    "Take it if you're interested in environmental law... It focuses a lot on public health, nuclear weapons testings, pesticides, concepts like secrecy... Section can be dull, but it's not too hard. Theworkload isn't bad.",
    "Very interesting course material and wonderful TFs to help you work through it. Large lecture format prevented engaging more in class though.",
    "Yes, if you're interested in more of the human health side of things. Be aware - take home finals and midterms are much worse than regular exams. You spend a lot longer on them and you're restricted to an unrealistically short word limit. The content of the course is very interesting though, I especially enjoyed the first 5 lectures on nuclear issues and the government's deception. Also warning: your TA does not grade your midterm\/final\/paper so there is a lot of poorly distributed grading.",
    "Defintiely a good survey of current environmental issues.",
    "If you're looking for a class that doesn't have a lot of work, then this is the class for you.",
    "good easy class, interesting most of the time",
    "Midterm take home essay is worth 40%, final take home essay is worth 50%, and section participation is worth 10%. Thought the two essays don't allow you to fully demonstrate your knowledge learned from the class so make sure you can write a good paper to do well in the class. Reading is not really required but helps for section.",
    "I would recommend this to a student. It is a great course that gives you a wide variety of environmental issues and challenges you to think about the problems critically and suggest a solution.",
    "It's a good starting point for those interested in career in environmental law.",
    "Broad overview of complex issues concerning environmental politics and law. Touches on a variety of interesting topics. Definitely recommend as a chill and relaxed class.",
    "NOT A GUT",
    "This class is really relevant to every day life, everyone should be aware of the issues and concerns raised in this class. I really liked the knowledge I gained from professor Wargo. That being said, the tests are only two take home essays. I went to Most classes and took notes... And my friend who did not attend a single class or even own any of the books got a higher grade than me on the midterm. So it seeks that the redeeming part of this class, the interesting lecture information, is actually not relevant to the take home test. So whether or not you want to go to class you can probably still get a good grade.",
    "Environmental Politics and Law is considered a \"gut\". I took it because I'm very interested in the subject, but the low number of people who actually attend lecture is frustrating, as is the fact that the midterm and final do not test on lecture material. As with other \"guts\" it's not an easy A for everyone as the grading seemed completely dependent on what TA got your midterm, but if you want a course where you don't have to go to every lecture I'd recommend it. I enjoyed the lectures but they did have a focus on public health that I was not particularly interested in.",
    "Good survey course if you want to cover the major environmental topics - nuclear energy, sustainable fishing, pesticides, etc. - but you won't go into detail in anything. For that reason, section discussions can be tedious and unproductive, as you won't know enough information to scratch under the surface. Prof Wargo is clearly brilliant and a leader in his field - however, his lecture style seems a bit disjointed because the breadth of topics is so large, and more often than not, you'll come out feeling more overwhelmed by the obstacles in the way of reform\/environmental protection. Great readings however, you will come out being able to speak more intelligently about things.",
    "Take this class. Great lectures. Section is enjoyable. Not a lot of work. And the take home midterms and finals are not hard.",
    "This class is a very interesting and relaxing class that I would recommend to a fellow student looking for a non-strenuous fifth class. It gives you an interesting perspective on environmental issues and their political and legal implications. While this class is not a rigorous legal class, it is an interesting lecture.",
    "Great survey course! Definitely recommend it.",
    "Take it. A must. You will gain a new view about how to approach the world",
    "Unless MAJOR REFORM is done of this course, stay away. It is absolutely unsatisfying and disappointing. It leaves one with no interest in the environment (as admitted by a peer in section) and no real frameworks\/theories to actually analyze any issues.The \"frameworks\"\/\"models\" talked about in class which are apparently common through environmental history are absolutely common sense, and are so plentiful that they fail to really elucidate any issues.",
    "Great survey course in environmental history, not overwhelming in work. Applications in a lot of different majors.",
    "Absolutely don't take it. The lectures are miserable, the material, while interesting, is presented in a dull way, and the grading is all over the map. It is known for being a gut - but that completely depends on which TA happens to grade your exams (not your own!!) - and, frankly, there are far more engaging and entertaining guts.",
    "The course had a number of interesting lectures, and it's really not a lot of work. The take home tests were pretty easy, and the readings were very relevant. I'd recommend it.",
    "This is an amazing class. Professor Wargo is honestly the expert in the field. Sometimes his lectures are a little slow and the topics can be a little dry but most of it is pretty cool, especially if you are interested in the environment. This is a must take class at Yale!",
    "This was a great class. However, in the past it has been a gut but this year the TF's were grading a lot harder and the essay prompts were pretty hard. I went to every class and did 80% of the reading and I dont think this qualifies as a gut anymore but still its a good class that I think everyone would benefit from taking",
    "Yes! Great intro course.",
    "Very repetitive lectures. The unit on smart growth was completely and inexplicably skipped over! Also, only take if you're comfortable with the idea of a take-home midterm and final. Don't bother with this class.",
    "yes, but only if interested in environment or poli sci, as you need a passion for the subject to make lectures interesting",
    "Great overview class that introduces you to a wide range of environmental topics and histories. It will change the way you think about a lot of things, so be prepared. You get out of this class what you put into it.",
    "EVST 255 is easy, but also really really interesting--one of those classes that is the best of both worlds. If you go to class, you'll learn more than you will in any other class at Yale--the way Wargo presents the material simply has a way of sticking, whereas information from other classes simply doesnt. Take it for sure.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course. There is not much work required, you don't need to do all of the readings and the topics covered are interesting and relevant to everyday life",
    "I would recommend this class only if you're really interested in the public health side of environmental issues. Don't take it if you're looking to get a new perspective on law, as I was.",
    "Wargo is amazing, his book is amazing, and his lectures seem monotonous but are actually pretty wonderful. The format of the class was frustrating, as the only two grades were two take-home exams and couldn't effectively show having learned anything in the course - a lot of people got poor grades on the midterm and weren't sure why. That being said, maybe a solid little-work Cr\/D.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class because it is a really important topic that everyone should know about. It is also a great and straightforward class to take as a 4th or 5th class.",
    "This class is not much work but it is not very easy.",
    "Highly recommend taking this class. The workload is extremely manageable-- two take home essays. The class is extremely interesting if you are at all interested in the environment. Wargo is also a great lecturer.",
    "Very bad",
    "Good introductory course but you won't be very motivated by structure and content.",
    "It's very easy not to go, and I felt like I winded up not actually taking the course. Interesting subject matter though.",
    "I would recommend this class.",
    "Take it if you're interested in environmental law. It also covers food, pesticide, nuclear law as well. It's def an interesting class, but not a gut class.",
    "It's really what the title describes. It's considering the role of government in protecting the environment. If you're interest in political science or EVST, this is a very valuable class.",
    "An interesting course that affords a different perspective on the world. It mostly covers nuclear and pesticide regulation but other topics covered.Requires little work, only a 6.5-page midterm and final plus section attendance. Definitely a solid 5th class.",
    "I would recommend this to another student. It really helped me become aware of environmental issues.",
    "Yes, it's very interesting and a worthwhile class.",
    "I would recommend Environmental Studies 255 for a fellow student because it is a well run course and the material is relevant to everyone.",
    "Take this class if you have any interest in learning about what the human race has done to the environment, and how technology has brought us into an age in which what we do to our food may have adverse effects on our health.",
    "Easy class with very little work. Take it but do make sure to get the most out of the class - tough when there is not weekly homework.",
    "Yes I would recommend it. A lot of useful, pertinent information that is worth knowing. Most issues are still very relevant today.",
    "Definitely take this class if you are interested at all in the environment. John Wargo is a great professor, and you will learn a lot.",
    "I would definitely recommend the course for all, because the issues we discuss in class not only affect the environment but our health and daily lives. This course was crucial to understand the basic challenges to the environment and human health resulting from industrialization and modernization, which I think all Yale students should be aware of.",
    "The class is a great overview of the history of environmental law and how issues have been dealt with in the past (often in improper ways). Professor Wargo is a very knowledgeable lecturer and has researched much in the field. The lecture can be dry, but there are a lot of useful pieces of knowledge in it.",
    "PLSC 215 is a very interesting but also relaxed course. If you want to learn useful information about our government's intervention in public health, but don't have time to do a ton of reading and studying, take this class.",
    "Environmental Politics and the Law was a good way to learn about the practical impacts of our actions on the environment and in turn how we will further be effected. I would recommend this course because Professor Wargo is extremely knowledgable on the subject and you will get as much out of the course as you put into it.",
    "No, I would not recommend this course.",
    "This course focuses more on the discussion of environmental issues than it actually engages policy or law. The midterm and final offer an opportunity to craft legislation, but for the most part, this class surveys the history of environmental issues in the United States. The information presented in lecture is very useful (especially in section), so I would recommend attending as many classes as possible. The reading is extremely manageable, but it's up to the student to learn from them. I would definitely recommend this class to someone wishing to learn more about environmental issues in a low-pressure class."
