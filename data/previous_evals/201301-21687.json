    "I would definitely recommend 218 if you're interested in ear training and you have at least a bit of a musical background. I can see how it might be hard if you're not really used to listening to music past the typical radio jamming, but Sarita definitely brings everyone up to speed relatively quickly, and it ends up being extremely enjoyable! There is barely any work outside of class, so it's really chill and pleasant. If you don't have any theory experience, it would probably help to take 205 (or 210) before or concurrently with this.",
    "Definitely take 218 if you're interested in developing your ear and dictation and sight-singing skills. The class focuses mainly on melodic, harmonic, and two-part dictation -- it moves really fast and it's definitely a disadvantage if, like me, you don't have a naturally strong ear. That being said, Sarita is a fantastic teacher who, within three weeks, hadpushed me to a level of hearing I never thought I would reach. She's kind, cool, and awesome. The workload is very small -- I took it Credit\/D\/Fail which I would recommend for non-music majors who think they might find the material challenging. From Point A at the beginning of the semester to Point B now, I've probably never developed skills so thoroughly and so quickly.",
    "This is a great class. It will improve your ear and sight-singing immensely. As a non-pianist, I also found the piano lab very helpful. It was a good companion to Music 210, and helped me internalize harmony concepts.",
    "Music 210 is a great class for developing your ear, getting better at writing down dictated melodies, dictated harmonic progressions an more. It's also good for learning\/practicing figured bass. Very little work and fun if you're looking to improve your musicianship. You will have to be comfortable with singing in class. Doesn't have to be good, but it's just part of understanding chords and melodies.",
    "Music 218 can be a difficult course if you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have any sort of natural aptitude for dictation and sight singing. To do well in the class you have to commit to practicing nearly every day, but overall the course definitely helped my understanding of music and my practical musicianship skills."
