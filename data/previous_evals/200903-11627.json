   "comments": [
    "A great class - this is where Russian starts getting fun! And definitely take it with Constantine.",
    "Great class! I'd definitely recommend it.",
    "If you're reading this evaluation you're probably already going to take the course. It's an L5 language course, and a good one, with strong emphasis on reading texts (specifically, Karpovich's history of Russia in the 19th Century until the 1917 revolution and Chekhov's Dama s sobachkoy.) Just make sure to study for the tests by memorizing all the necessary phrases.",
    "This level of Russian will have much higher expectations than earlier levels. You will be required to write essays, do readings, learn grammar, and memorize a good deal of vocabulary. It is very difficult to do extremely well, but also hard to do really poorly. Plan on making a huge time commitment, as there is really more work than you can do some weeks. Constantine is great and a very interesting lecturer, and is terrific about working with you to make sure you get the help you need. I only have a few criticisms of the class. The first is that there is little chance to speak, so your conversational skills will need outside help if you want to speak more fluently. Also, a large - actually, huge - part of the course is memorizing phrases, which are sometimes only questionably useful. Occasionally, I felt like my performance in the class was closely related to how well I could use certain expressions rather than on fluency, pronunciation, or my comprehension of the material. Finally, it is sometimes unclear what is expected of you in the class, and it is not hard to get lost amid the tons of material that gets thrown at you sometimes. Be open about this with Constantine, and he is usually great about helping you out.",
    "If you are interested enough in taking 3rd year Russian to look at the evaluations, you need to take this class! Constantine is absolutely great, and you will not regret it!",
    "It is higher level mechanics of the russian language. And also putting to use what we learn to read history and literature in russian.",
    "Very good - very friendly and engaging. I feel like I learned a lot, was less intimidated than I thought I'd be and would recommend it."
