   "comments": [
    "This was a single author course focused on Rousseau. Requirements include weekly response papers, a presentation (which is longer, and expected to be more detailed than in most other courses) and a research paper. Discussion is typically good, though at times, differing levels of French cause participation to suffer.",
    "It is a good opportunity to read a lot of Rousseau in a short period of time, an exercise useful in understanding his complex and sometimes incoherent thought, and bridging the gap between his so-called literary and political works.",
    "French 751.01 is an introduction to Rousseau, covering almost all his major works, with the exception of his Julie\/Nouvelle Heloise and his Letter to d'Alembert. I would recommend it above all because there was an almost exclusive emphasis on Rousseau's work, which is priceless because Rousseau has had an incomprehensibly powerful influence on modernity."

   "comments": [
    "This course was helpful in clearing up a lot of misconceptions I had about Rousseau. I feel I have a good understanding now. Although I do not plan on working on Rousseau, his ideas were obviously very influential and having a strong understanding of his philosophy will serve me well in other areas.",
    "Rousseau has had, as was said before, an influence too big to be known on modernity, so knowing his work is invaluable to understanding Romance literature, philosophy, politics, and history since the mid-18th century."
