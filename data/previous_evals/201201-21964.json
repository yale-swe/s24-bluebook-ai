   "comments": [
    "I would recommend if you are interested in art history.",
    "I would highly recommend it to another student- although it is a required art history course, it doesn't feel like one. Very enjoyable with Professor Rizvi.",
    "I recommend it to all History of Art majors.Is joke, yes?",
    "As theoretical and often tedious as much of the material was, I do feel that I've gained a helpful set of lenses to evaluate not only art, but also literature, history, philosophy, sociology, anthropology, psychology, etc. You read some very important essays that have been written from many different modes of thinking - really helpful for other classes. I was glad to have a survey on many different methods to approach academic material. It's given me so many more ways to make a critical argument for most subjects I've studied at Yale.Another nice thing about this class is that there are no finals, just the 2-page paper for every class and quite a bit of reading, which was sometimes overwhelming. There is also a presentation to give, which just means you need to read a little more carefully. It's a well-structured class. It does feel very good to leave the last session knowing you'll deal with one less class during reading and finals week.I think Kishwar Rizvi is a very understanding, laid-back professor. I thought she did a good job of leading discussion, letting everyone speak (which does mean that she picks people randomly sometimes). Her comments on the reading responses are few, so it's not always easy to figure out what you need to improve on. Overall, helpful and kind.The most frustrating aspect of this classwere the discussions. I often felt that the ideas passed around never arrived at a definite conclusion, but were simply discussed for the sake of discussing them. The material is often abstract and doesn't have answers - this can lead to some really specious arguments presented by classmates, unfortunately. You may wonder at times why you're even studying what you are studying, you might think it's just so meaningless. I suppose that's simply the nature of what we study. Though the professor tried her best to steer us in the right directions, I think the people in the class definitely determine the quality of the discussions - absolutely check to see if you feel that your set of classmates will have a productive discussion before you take the class, because otherwise, you may be frustrated, as I often was.",
    "Take Crit Approaches with Prof. Rizvi!",
    "I would recommend Critical Approaches for someone who has to take it, but maybe not otherwise. The readings are just very time consuming, and sometimes they were so difficult I didn't feel I got much out of them. It starts out slowly with some tough readings and concepts, but as the course progresses it really gets interesting. The most important thing for this course is your section, so make sure your class is good. Also, we had weekely papers (reading responses) that were shorts, and after that, there was no final paper or anything.",
    "One paper (3 pages max) per week, no final. Interesting discussions but only really useful if you actually want to be an art historian.",
    "take it!"
