    "A strength of this class is that it does not only teach you different techniques of drawing but it so many different settings (in the peabody, outdoors.. etc). I think it would have been helpful however, to learn how to draw in a certain technique from visually watching someone do it before we actually start drawing ourselves. The instructor tried it once or twice and I think it was helpful."

    "I would absolutely recommend basic drawing to any student at Yale. I came into it never having taking a formal art class, but I was still able to succeed and my mid-class doodle quality increased exponentially. I will leave this class with a new skill\/interest and desire to continue drawing.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student with an interest in drawing",
    "Yes, absolutely. If you don't know how draw, this course can get you really far.",
    "This is a great course. I really enjoyed working on the assignments in and out of class. There is definitely work out of class, but the assignments were very interesting. I really enjoyed Christian's projects. The final was a full-size self-portrait, and we had projects like going to the Peabody Museum to draw one of the exhibits. Having the space to practice drawing was really useful, and Christian was very helpful in pushing me out of my habits and comfort zone.",
    "Yes! Really fun and interesting."
