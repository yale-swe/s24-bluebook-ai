   "comments": [
    "I was very disappointed with this course. Vida mentioned that students had, in the past, complained that the course dealt insufficiently with gender and health, defending herself by remarking that all of the topics studied (fertility, mortality, and migration) fundamentally contain elements of gender and health. This is a bit of a cop-out answer. This class really isn't about gender and health -- it's \"demography 101,\" reviewing major concepts with a slight focus on \"women's autonomy\" and \"women's issues.\" I would not recommend this course to people seeking it for gender content. I would, however, recommend it to any student looking for a background in demography and demographic research. It is definitely comprehensive and interesting in those areas.",
    "Only take this class if you are interested in demography. In the first week for homework, you will read a sampling of topics. If these articles are not interesting to you---find a new class!!--the style and tone of articles doesn't change throughout the semester, so IF you find this type of readings dry in the beginning, look elsewhere! That said, Professor Maralani is a great professor.",
    "Definitely take this if you have a serious interest in the social sciences. Demography is a large enough topic to be important yet small enough that you can understand more than superficially how the discipline developed and responded to evidence contradicting the theory. Learning how to write a lit review is also a really necessary skill and something the social sciences don't pay enough attention to. Professor Maralani was always friendly and responsive, and sharp (but sensitive) when leading discussions.",
    "Take it! It may not be offered next year but definitely take it if you can."
