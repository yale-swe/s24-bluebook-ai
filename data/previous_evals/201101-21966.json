   "comments": [
    "Exactly the same as Chinese 150 - if you did fine in the fall, you'll do fine in the spring. Topics are more formal - Chinese literature and cultural movements, famous people\/movies, news expressions.",
    "This course is more challenging that Chinese 150. Be prepared to work a lot, but you will also lear a lot. At the end of the semester you will begin to be able to read Chinese newspapers. This has been a long time goal of mine and with a little more study that goal will be realized. The wonderful professors and strong text are what make the class, but the work can sometime fell never-ending! All in all I am happy I took and survived this course, it's definitely worth the struggle.",
    "Chinese 151 is pretty much the same as Chinese 150. The amount of work is the same. The structure of class and homework is the same. The teachers and (most) of the classmates are the same. The big topics covered are business, economics, movies, and newspapers.",
    "Great class!Don't expect it to take less time than in the fall though",
    "A great follow-up to 150.",
    "I think that Chinese 151 is a good continuation of Chinese 150. It's a bit of a strugglebus in terms of course matter, since the the kewens cover things that are much less fun than stuff in 150, but at the same time, things are interesting and well organized.",
    "Standard Chinese course for the level you have to take.",
    "It's hard, but super rewarding. Definitely take it!",
    "This course follows the same path as other courses at Yale. For those interested in learning the language, there aren't really other options. The workload is heavy but the result is rewarding.",
    "Yes, if you are still in Chinese by this point then you already know the work takes time but the classes are good and help develop fluency.",
    "I recommend this class. Chinese 151 continues where Chinese 150 left off. If you liked 150, you will probably enjoy 151 even more. The course content is much more advanced (business, trade, news, drama, etc.) and the grading is a bit more challenging. There textbook subject matter allows for great class discussions in the later days of the week.",
    "Its the usual Chinese course with quizzes, tests, presentations, and all that jazz. Take it if you want to pursue Chinese - you learn a lot of worldly vocab about business, econ, history and such.",
    "good course, cover a lot of material.",
    "Yes take it. It is the continuation of Chinese and not miserable. I often enjoyed the class and the work is bearable. If you want to continue Chinese, take it.",
    "Chinese 151 is really more of the same. Sure, you learn more content and vocabulary and grammar, but it's just a continuation of all the Chinese you've already taken.",
    "Good course; nearly identical to CHNS 150 except that the content of the lessons is more serious and focused on economics, politics, etc. I would recommend it.",
    "Same drill as first semester, more or less. Notice that the font size in the second semester textbook has gotten smaller. But, on the bright side, the book has gotten thinner!",
    "Yes!",
    "You love Chinese. This will make you love it more. Its alot of work but you already knew that.",
    "The class is long and tiring. It feels like your Chinese is not improving much, because you do not have many opportunities to practice. However, I have realized that the vocab we learn, what I retain of it, does help me have more full conversation, help me express myself more fully.",
    "Chinese 151 is a lot of work, but I don't really feel like my Chinese got much better than it was when I got back from Light this past summer. But it's L5 Chinese, at this point you know what you're getting into if you're continuing Chinese.",
    "Chinese 151 should not be new ground for you if you're reading this, even if you're a freshman. (See evaluations for Chinese 150 if so). I wish that the course would sublimate some of its memorization-type activities and focus more on forcing students to 'use' and improve their Chinese; daily quizzes etc are fine for ensuring people know the material in one sense, but just structurally it is difficult to give students enough opportunity to really engage. A few days a week are more about conversation than new material, which is excellent, but some students got by without really contributing in these sessions and I think they suffered as a result. Anyway, this class is much much much better than l3\/l4, which were just a travesty (take a light fellowship if you can!!! anything to avoid those here at Yale). Lastly, being familiar with the L5 curriculum as handled at PKU, I can say that you cover a good mix of subjects here at Yale and will find your Chinese much improved. Just be sure you know what you're getting into and commit the necessary time!"
