    "I highly recommend it. My vocabulary increased a lot and I now know a lot more grammar.",
    "It is an easy class to start with, but then it gets somewhat difficult. If you have background in BSing your way to an A in previous Chinese classes, you're good. If not, expect to spend a lot of time memorizing sentence patterns.",
    "I came in with the idea that learning Chinese was going to fun. This attitude got me through through two of four tests. After the second test, learning Chinese wasn't fun anymore.STRENGTHS:- Xu laoshi is an experienced teacher. She also explains things extremely thoroughly.- Daily listening quizzes. They're a pain in the neck to study for, but they keep you on your toes and ready for class.WEAKNESSES:- Not much opportunity to practice Chinese during class. This is mostly due to the fact that Xu laoshi is so thorough with her explanations that there leaves little time for the students to practice using words and phrases.- The homework is rather difficult, first, as an extension of the first weakness: since we don't practice using the words and phrases in class, it's difficult to apply them to do the homework. Second, the translations often ask for advanced language that we haven't learned yet.- This isn't really a weakness, just a tough part of the class: the exams have a very tough grading system. Little mistakes add up, and as a result it's very hard to get above 93% on an exam. To top it all off, there is no curve to the class, so you have to get 94% or higher to get an A.Bottom line, this class will definitely help you improve your Chinese. You will learn a lot of characters and grammar structures, and it will help reinforce your previous knowledge of Chinese. Just keep in mind that this course is not easy, by all means.",
    "It's a fast paced course that sometimes gets tiring just because you have it every day, but it is definitely manageable. If you study and keep up in class, you will be fine. I found the grammar tricky and made lots of little mistakes, but after a while I got a beter gist of it. Xu Laoshi is adorable and approachable.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course! Chinese 152 moves along pretty fast; we had daily quizzes, weekly listening\/reading comprehension exercises, homework for every chapter, 4 unit tests, an oral exam and a final. The course emphasizes formal reading and writing more so than conversational Chinese. You really learn a lot by the end of the semester, and if you're willing to put in the work, you'll get a lot out of it. Xu Laoshi is actually amazing.",
    "I would recommend it -- it's a fair amount of work but not that overwhelming in the end. There was a learning curve for me in learning how to study for quizzes and tests, but once you figure out the rhythm of everything it's usually manageable.",
    "I would recommend Chinese 152, Xu Laoshi is a boss, you'll learn a lot of Chinese, and you'll get your foreign language requirement out of the way if it's still L5.The workload is pretty big, but it's constant and manageable, might be a little bit hard at first though. Expectations are clear, and tests are fair. Good class overall.",
    "If you are thinking about taking a language this is definitely a class to put towards the top of your considerations list. Although there is a quiz everyday, it is fairly easy to study for (usually a line straight out of the text) and forces you to learn new characters which I probably would not have done otherwise. Xu laoshi is really one of the finest language teachers I've had. Her expectations may be high, but she provides you with all the tools necessary to meet those expectations. The format of every test is given to you and often during tough busy weeks, she cuts way down on the homework load because she understands the crazy schedules everyone has. The oral test at the end of the year is actually a skit you preform with 3 or 4 other people. This is not only super fun, but also a lot less stressful. Also, take advantage of the tutoring if only to work on pinyin and reading the text for pronunciation.",
    "Good class. Lots of work, but if you stay on top of things and don't fall behind you should be fine. It may feel overwhelming within the first couple of weeks, but trust me you get used to it. Do get ready to memorize 15-20 words a day though. Find a study group to excel in this class.",
    "In the midst of a crazy, chaotic first semester of college, this course was like a steady heartbeat - constant, predictable, and reassuring. I knew exactly what to expect every day: take a quiz, go over vocab and sentence structures, and wait in anticipation for one of Xu LaoShi's inevitable, inadvertent jokes. Xu LaoShi is engaging and entertaining, and even though she may come off as intimidating at times, you know that she truly cares about your progress. The routine work does get tedious and it is difficult to drag yourself to class every single day, but I felt like the professor and the classmates I got to know throughout the semester really made the class what it is. And what it is is an excellent class. Highly recommended, with minimal reservations.",
    "If you are interested in taking Chinese, I would reccomend taking this course because it really helps develop your understanding of Chinese. Chinese 152 is a course that challenges students, but is not unreasonable with its workload. However, if you are not interested in Chinese and just trying to get rid of a distributional requirement, you may find trouble.",
    "Great class with an equally great professor. She really cares about helping you learn Chinese and oftentimes will go out of her way to keep you on track. There is a lot of work, but it's definitely manageable. I've noticed a marked improvement in my Chinese, especially in speaking and writing.",
    "I didn't find this class as useful as the previous year of Chinese. It's a lot more focused on formal grammar and writing than speaking, and the things we learned aren't that important in daily speech. If you're already orally proficient, this might be a good class to take to work on writing."
