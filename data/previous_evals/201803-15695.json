    "Totally recommend if you are a BME and wants to engage in more research. This class will build up your paper reading skill and grant\/ research proposal writing skills. The workload is very manageable during the semester, but can get quite heavy at the end. The class is at a nice intersection of engineering and biology, and you will learn about how the techniques are invented, and how they are used to further discovery. Prof. Mak is very accessible, smart and logical. His materials are always super organized and facilitate learning well."
