   "comments": [
    "I would recommend it if they need to take a math class for their major, or for distribution, not for an elective. It's not a bad class, but it certainly isn't a very fun one.",
    "I would recommend it, but only because 120 is a pre-req for other courses and majors. Otherwise, I wouldn't recommend it, unless said student REALLY loves math. I have heard many upperclassmen say that 120 took away their love for math, which is upsetting for me, especially that many of these upperclassmen are female students. I feel, in some way, that math 120 is discouraging women to go into math and physics, which is problematic.",
    "It's an extremely hard course. The problem sets are long and grueling, and the exams are extremely difficult, with little to no help from the graders. Frankly, I would not recommend it to another student unless they were somewhat familiar with multivariable calculus beforehand - I do not know of many people in the course who succeeded without significant prior knowledge about the course from high school. That being said, it is a good, very educational course, and there were people who last took BC Calculus in high school that did well. The instructors are good, and they will always do their best to assist struggling students.",
    "Take it!",
    "It is a pretty intense, calculations-heavy calculus course and does not draw a clear link between the mathematics and their application. I would not recommend math 120 to anyone except people very strong in math because it is taught in a way that can be frustrating and discouraging to people that aren't that strong in math.",
    "If you've never taken multi-variable calculus before, this is a difficult course. If you've taken multi-variable calculus before, this is probably still a difficult course. There are lots of students, many of whom are probably more familiar with the material than you are, but also a good amount who will feel the same way you do. It's certainly a challenge, but it's not impossible, and with hard work and perseverance, you'll make it through. Definitely take advantage of all the extra help resources you can (if you need them)--this course offers many.",
    "Your success in this course will depend on three things. 1.The amount of time you study 2.The degree to which you are comfortable with calculating intergals quickly(understanding of 112 material) 3. Your spacial intelligence.",
    "Very fast course. Maybe review lessons before class so that you can fully grasp the concepts in class.",
    "Interesting class that needs to be taken only when you need to take it. I did learn a lot from the math but it was a really difficult class.",
    "It's a pre requisite to many classes and you will have to take it at some point I'm sure. If you are engineers, you'll be better off taking ENAS151.",
    "I'd recommend it--it extends your brainpower. I'd say that if you're more Economics oriented you might just have to take the second half with a grain of salt because it's so Physics-esque.",
    "Since Math 120 is required for many, many don't have a choice in taking the course. It is helpful in many fields.",
    "I wouldn't recommend Math 120 to another student, primarily because more time was spent teaching us formulas than actually getting to the heart of the material. I appreciate the necessity of going at a rapid pace, but regardless, individual classes could have been structured better to allow more time for explanation and less time for practice. That method of teaching made everything much more difficult."
