   "comments": [
    "For someone who wants to learn more about crystallography or to practice it, this course summarizes the fundamentals. I would recommend it.",
    "It is a great course as a starting step to understand crystallography, and also a good choice to have a conceptual understanding the basic physics behind Fourier transformation even you won't work on crystallography in the future. I highly recommend this course.",
    "It gives a very good background in the laboratory methods used in crystallography. Some solid background was given on the mathematical and physical principles behind X-ray diffraction and the techniques used to actually solve a structure.",
    "Yes, I would recommend it for anyone interested in crystallography.",
    "MB&B 760 is a great course for learning about the process of crystallography to obtain structure. The course covers material from diffraction all the way through various methods used for obtaining phase information in a clear and logical manner. I would highly recommend this course for any fellow student interested in pursuing crystallography.",
    "Absolutely, if you want to know background of crystallography that will help you understand not only the basics of crystallizing, data processing but also the physics and math (for all levels) this is the perfect course.",
    "Well-taught and informative. I would definitely recommend it to any structural biologists.",
    "Yes. It's helpful if you want to some structural biology."

   "comments": [
    "Deepened my knowledge of crystallography.",
    "I will work on crystallography in the future, so this course definetely helpedme a lot to get prepared for more advanced self-studies.",
    "Although I still have a lot to learn aboutX-ray, this course will help me immensely when I actually begin to use the technique for my PhD work.",
    "I understand one method of structural biology much better than I did before. Should really help my research.",
    "Since I will be pursuing crystallography in my graduate research, this course is directly helps me. This course will be significantly helping me towards my research\/dissertation.",
    "This course was absolutely necessary for understanding the principles of crystallography as well as has prepared me greatly to asses my own data in lab as well as for my qualifying exam.",
    "Provided great insight into structural biology.",
    "I learned a lot about X-ray crystallography. This will be very helpful for my thesis work."
