    "Not much work. If you like game theory, take it, but be prepared to sit through some boring stuff. The final was also way too hard.",
    "I would recommend it for someone who has not taken Game Theory before. I spent a lot of time doing problems I already knew how to do.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student. Great class and not too difficult.",
    "The first part of the course focuses on a general introduction to game theory whereas the second half of the course focuses on voting, election, and government accountability models. I would recommend it to another student if they have taken a previous course on game theory because I think it would be a good way in which to build off of that previous knowledge."
