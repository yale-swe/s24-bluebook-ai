   "comments": [
    "DS is not easy, but if you made it through first semester, you should absolutely stick it out. The benefits of second semester and from the books you read far exceed the cost. I don't yet know if I would do DS over if I had the chance, as I think I need a little more distance to think about it, but I'm very glad I didn't drop at the semester.",
    "I would recommend it as an intense survey course of Western literature. Would not recommend for someone wanting to study these books in depth.",
    "DS Literature in the spring surveys major literary works (prose and poetry) from the Renaissance to the twentieth century, and references many works that were covered in the fall. Thematic connections between texts, close readings, and discussions of context are are included in the sections and lectures. I would definitely recommend this course to another student, even one who isn't particularly interested in literature coming in, as it really exposes you to a whole host of texts that make you so much more fluent in Western literature.",
    "I would recommend.",
    "A great chance to read some very powerful and important books. Literature felt like the smoothest of the three DS syllabi: for the most part, the books transitioned smoothly, and all were beautiful and interesting. Professor Semk is an intelligent, professional, and approachable instructor. Communicated his feedback clearly and concretely on each paper, and always provided guidelines for improving in the future. Ran discussions well, providing valuable historical and critical context while ensuring that other voices have a chance to speak as well."
