    "Fun, way chiller than the music major version, but still I feel like I learned a lot. Plus Prof Kreuzer is great and learns everyone's names! Which was really nice of her.",
    "An extremely well put-together, always fascinating course. The assignments are manageable and useful, the interactive lecture style is perfect for the material, and the end result is a very broad and reasonably deep knowledge of music since 1800. The music curriculum is also well-grounded in broader cultural and social trends. Professor Kreuzer is a great lecturer and a pleasant person. She also scales the difficulty of the material to whatever the class's prior exposure to music is. Although I am somewhere in the middle of the spectrum, I got the impression the class would be great for a complete novice as well as an experienced musician.",
    "A lot of sitting and listening to music. Too much time spent on modern junk, and not enough on the classics. I would sort of recommend it... Were I to take this semester again, it would not be on my shopping list.",
    "overall good course. prof kreuzer is great, helpful, genuine, approachable, but perhaps not as passionate or expressive as she could be.",
    "Take if you'd like to learn about a very interesting topic (the last 200+ years of Western music history) from one of the most uneven and demanding professors in the otherwise great music department at Yale. If the TA of the class ends up being Amy Dunagin, run for the hills - you're sure to get nothing but hell and misery out of the experience. There are simply too many superior and less painful ways to learn about music history than to have to suffer through the purgatory that is this class taught by this disastrous tag-team from the deepest depths of the fiery pit of the earth (Professor Gundula Kreuzer and Amy Dunagin).",
    "This is a very thorough, informative music history class on Western music from 1800-present. Professor Kreuzer covers a great deal of music\/information, so make sure to listen closely in class. I didn't think of taking notes as a chore - almost everything we talked about was totally fascinating. Some advice: do NOT be afraid to speak out in class when Prof. Kreuzer asks questions. You'll find that there will literally be two people in the class who will routinely volunteer opinions, but don't let it get that way! Always speak up if you have something to say...don't be afraid to look like an idiot, because everyone else has the same questions. Aside from reading (which really isn't that necessary...class is very thorough), the midterm, and the final, Prof. Kreuzer prescribes listening assignments, which aren't too bad. Just make sure to spend some time on them. Overall, very thorough, though perhaps a bit dense at times. As a violinist and a singer very familiar with the Western music tradition, I was pleasantly surprised to learn many an interesting fact about how such music has developed over the last two centuries.",
    "YES YE SYES! I loved taking this class so much. You go and sit and listen to someone who clearly LOVES music talk about music and for homework you listen to great music. And the assignments aren't hard. and the reading is so short. what's not to like?",
    "A survey of the most important century in classical music, the 19th, with a lot of 20th century music you know, and lots that you don't. It's all fabulous, my only regret is that we didn't have time to listen to more.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class for another student if they are interested in music in any way.",
    "Good class, take it!",
    "I would recommend if the student wanted to know the music history but had no background in music. If the student had some kind of music history, I would recommend not to take this class and study the history and listen by himself.",
    "Interesting class, a lot of good material. The listening exercises were a bit hard and if you're not used to writing about music, it might be a struggle in the beginning, but professor Kreuzer is very good about telling you exactly what she's looking for. This class was deceivingly hard, so make sure you keep up with the material. I loved it but kind of wish I had taken it Credit\/D so I wouldn't have had to worry about my grade so much.",
    "Take this class! No music background necessary. You've probably heard a lot of the music before without realizing it, and this class will put all of it into context. The 1800 to modern time period is probably the most interesting era to study in western music as it has evolved so much in these two hundred years. Kreuzer is really great and makes her classes feel more like seminars than lectures. This is one class I'd recommend all Yalies take before they graduate.",
    "This class is deceptively difficult. It appears to be easy (light reading, 4 homework assignments, 2 exams) but there's still a lot of information to know and they're looking for a lot of information on the exams, but I guess that's just like every class. The professor is pretty passionate about music history, but the thing is that she expects everyone else to be just as passionate and only a handful of people are that passionate about it. You listen to a lot of really good music, except for like 1950 to the present (which just suckkkkks). So, if you're interested in the subject and have looked over the syllabus, then you should definitely take it.",
    "Absolutely, especially if it's taught by Professor Kreuzer. She's an amazing musical resource, very friendly, and a really good lecturer. The class was engaging, fun, and very informative! If you are at ALL interested in music post-1800, then take this course!",
    "This course is advertised for anyone and requires no music background. If you take this course and have no music background, you will be miserable. It will be hard to follow and your exam will be graded down because you simply don't know as much as the kids with strong music backgrounds. If you cannot read music or understand it formally, do not take this course, unless you do it Credit\/D",
    "I really enjoyed this class and feel a much more cultured, fulfilled individual for gaining insight into such a crucial part of human artistic history",
    "MUSI131 is a good class. it focuses on the lives of the composers and how different genres and styles of music developed and changed (not music theory). You don't need to know how to read music to take the class, but it seemed like most people in the class had at least some music background. Professor Kreuzer is very knowledgeable and enthusiastic about the material. The workload is very reasonable; you have short reading and listening assignments for every class and four written assignments over the entire semester.",
    "It's a great class for non-music majors, but if you are interested in learning the evolution of Western music, definitely take it. The materials are very organized and readings are not too much.",
    "History of Western Music is a bit deceiving. While it may seem like an easy class to take, the papers and the exams are no piece of cake. Expect to take time to listen to pieces at home (which is enjoyable at times), and then have to identify them for the final exam. Take this Credit\/D.",
    "This class can be taken by someone who does not have much musical experience. It may seem like you will need to have a strong musical background, but the exams do not require one.",
    "Most of the class we discuss the history of music. However, though the course does not require the ability to read sheet music or prior musical background, it is highly recommended. In the listening assignments and portions of the final exam, I imagine those with some musical background have a great advantage over those who don't. You will learn tons of interesting stories behind composers, though there are also times in the class when parts of sheet music are analyzed--again, a huge plus if you can read them."
