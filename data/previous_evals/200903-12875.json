    "This course adds a few new grammatical concepts that give you greater ability to express your thoughts. The homework ends up feeling like busy work, however, that doesn't enrich the experience. Lourdes really makes you speak a lot in class and offers good pointers to improve pronunciation. She's also very sweet, understanding, and approachable.",
    "This class can seem like a burden sometimes, because it's daily and there's a considerable amount of work at time, but it's really worthwhile. My Spanish skills in general did improve, and Lourdes is a great professor, so it was an enjoyable experience."
