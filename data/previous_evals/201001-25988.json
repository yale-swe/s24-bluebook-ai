   "comments": [
    "Take this - it's the better intro to the Philosophy major, or it teaches you about philosophy you wouldn't otherwise learn.",
    "This is one of the better components of the DS package: it's interesting, well designed and well taught.",
    "I have mixed feelings about DS in general (although I am glad that I took it). Whether or not I would recommend it to another student depends entirely on how much they feel they can manage their own time and be happy with decisions they do make about it. I definitely went through stages of working really hard and efficiently to finish the readings, and others of totally giving up and resigning myself to not finishing when I thought it was over-ambitious \u0096 but I think the main thing for a student deciding to take DS is assessing whether or not they can be happy with a) having no life outside of DS; or b) not finishing all the reading or writing a brilliant paper every week. So much of it has less to do with time management than work ethic and comfort with one\u0092s own level of work and decisions about it.But, that said, DS did introduce me to writers who now mean so much to me, who I might not have encountered if I hadn\u0092t taken it, and also gave me the experience of having incredible professors who make themselves amazingly accessible, and really do dedicate so much of themselves to their students.",
    "This was quite a good class. The curriculum is fabulous, and Professor Grimstad is engaging and funny. His class is a lot of fun. We often went off on tangents that were somewhat related to what we were reading but went beyond the immediate text.",
    "I recommend it.",
    "This is a great introduction to modern philosophy. Professor Grimstad is an excellent teacher and brings extremely positive energy to section.",
    "DS is a good introduction to philosophy; the second semester has material that is often less interesting and more technical than that of the first semester. Grimstad is a pretty good section leader though he is rarely inspiring, or rarely challenges your own ideas. He rarely challenges his students to a more advanced reading of the text, but there's so little time in DS to do that anyway. Overall, he's a fairly good professor to introduce students to philosophy. The discussion dynamic was weird; we had very vocal students who tended to drag the discussion off topic, and Grimstad should have, but did not, pull them back in.",
    "Yes, I would recommend it to another student. The material is exciting and the discussions add a greater depth of understanding to these famous works.",
    "A superb building block. I don't particularly love Philosophy, but if you're on the fence about whether or not to take DS because of this class and you like the other two, do it. You get through it, the professors are great, and at the end you come out of it with a grasp of an important part of Western thought.",
    "DS Philosophy is a very good overview of Western philosophy. Second semester it focused on epistemology and morality - we charted those ideas over the course of philosophical thought. As with all the DS classes the weakness is that you can't spend as much time on the material as you might like. But the breadth is essential to the quality of the class, and after taking DS and hearing the lectures I feel like I have the tools to be able to go back and read any of the texts carefully. Philosophy tended to be my least favorite DS class, but second semester it wasn't always - I generally looked forward to going. The professor can make or break DS sections, however, and I had a good professor who was really suited to what I wanted to get out of the texts.",
    "I think DS Philosophy, while intimidating, is extremely valuable. Don't let concerns that it will be too obscure scare you from this course and thus from the spring semester of DS as a whole.",
    "Philo is probably the best DS class of the semester. The early conflict between rationalist and empiricist thought is well shown in the readings. Leibniz and Berkeley demonstrate super well exactly how metaphysics went off the rails and why Hume and Kant's (opposite ideas of) reform was necessary. Incredibly interesting, and Grimstad makes the section an adventure.",
    "Yes, the class was good, the feedback on papers was supportive and generous, I learned a good deal, the classroom was a pleasant and fun environment, etc.",
    "Professor Grimstad knows the material (and its historical context) very well, and is just as excited about exploring it as the students are. One of the best classes I've ever taken."
