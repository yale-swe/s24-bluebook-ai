    "In this course I learned to think more critically about how cultural productions can be used to understand history. It was also my first film class and first European history course at Yale, so I learned a lot of about both of those areas.",
    "A great survey of cold war movies, with themes ranging from espionage to nuclear war and colonialism.",
    "In this course, I learned about analyzing films and cultural ephemera as historical documents along with a general cultural history of the Cold War.",
    "This class was a great opportunity to look at history from a very different perspective. The fact that it was cross listed with history allowed me to begin to develop a new set of skills as a history major. In fact, that this class was cross listed in so much was wonderful. It really pushed me to think about things in a more abstract way than I am used to.",
    "Learned about the Cold War, especially in countries outside of the two major powers, and analyzed films pertaining to it."

   "question_id": "YC403",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I really enjoyed the list of films and novellas that we read, and thought it was a great overview. I appreciated that the historical readings were optional, but I think it would have been helpful to cover a bit more historical material in class to better contextualize the works we looked at. I also liked that we were each responsible for presenting on one work, but the structure of the presentations seemed inefficient to me because rather than have one person give a presentation at the start of class and then launch into a discussion, it felt more like one person was responsible for semi-teaching the class for the entirety of the 2-hour seminar. I think that separating the class into 1. presentation and 2. discussion would allow for deeper conversation and more participation.",
    "Great movies on the syllabus.",
    "I really enjoyed the course overall, I think that sometimes class discussions could be a bit more structured as they were largely based around student presentations. Perhaps limiting the time given to each student for presentations would help in this regard.",
    "Again, I enjoyed that this class was cross listed in so many departments. It led to people from different majors who provided different perspectives on material, which is of particular significance in a seminar."

    "Professor Syrimis is a very interesting thinker and this is a great course to take if you want to learn something while also being relaxed and comfortable.",
    "I would recommend this to another student, especially if he\/she is interested in Cold War culture and already has a working knowledge of the period and\/or of European film.",
    "Yes.",
    "I would recommend this course! It is fantastic if you are interested in Cold War history, or just like films in general.",
    "I would highly recommend this class. It was a lot of fun to take. I had the opportunity to watch wonderful films that I wouldn not have otherwise and consider the role of popular culture in the portrayal of and influence on history. It was different from what I had taken before, which made it a lot of fun.",
    "I would definitely recommend taking this course. Prof. Syrimis obviously cares a lot about his students--he even cooked dinner for us during a makeup class! However, if you're expecting to have the traditional, John Gaddis-style examination of the Cold War this class is definitely not for you. This class is more about Balkan history, which is one of my primary historical interests and probably the topic area of my senior thesis. If you're not interested in learning about Greece or Yugoslavia, you should probably steer clear."
