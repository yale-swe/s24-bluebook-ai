   "comments": [
    "Great course- fun, interesting, informative, and overall very enjoyable. I highly recommend this course to anyone interested in really understanding the production and conservation of artworks.",
    "Take this class if you are interested in conservation. Chem majors would probably have an easier time than most, but even if you are incapable of understanding basic science you can get through it. The first half is slow, but the second half is fun, and you get to walk away with valuable practical experience.",
    "Technical Examination is a really cool opportunity to get hands-on experience with actual works of art in the gallery. Unlike other classes in art history, this one puts you right up against the object...literally, I got to hold my object and do actual technical analysis (UV light, X-ray fluorescence, etc) on it, which to be honest made the whole class kind of worth it. The first half is a bit disorganized, and I think the instructors expect you to come in with prior knowledge that I just didn't have...the grading is pretty harsh, though I'm pretty sure they understand these differing levels of knowledge and adjust accordingly. The first half you'll pretty much have a rotating instructor, teaching about a different kind of art\/technique every week. Then, after the midterm, you'll get an object or painting assigned to you to research in a focused way, with the particular instructor who has expertise in that area. It is really an awesome experience, and they are all really knowledgable. Because they're not teachers by trade, sometimes the first half feels frustrating, but as resources, they are unbeatable. The experience of looking at art materially is incredibly important for art history majors, and I think it is both crucial and enjoyable--a great combo, and recommended!",
    "YES! It is a must for everyone. So interesting and informative, I'll never look at art the same way.",
    "Ian and the rest of the instructors were great, but you really have to be fascinated by the subject to enjoy it. If you are eager to identify which of many similar paintings an engraving was made after or the number of paint layers in a house's walls then you'll enjoy the course, but it was often too detailed for me--and I like detail. I'd suggest you take a look at a book on the subject to see if this type of analysis appeals to you. The final project was better, but as of this year, there was no choice in what object you examine.",
    "As a disclaimer, I have never written a completely negative review for a course...but there is a first time for everything.This course was very poorly organized and even more poorly executed. It might be a case of too many cooks in the kitchen (a huge rotating cast of professors, TAs, and affiliates) or simply that no one actually made teaching the class their priority for the semester. I always got the vague feeling that the class was interrupting the professors' and TAs' \"real jobs\" doing conservation work at the Gallery.If you are interested in art conservation, take the fall semester version of this course at the BAC with Teresa Fairbanks-Harris. She is a wonderful professor who is genuinely interested in her students. If you're interested in museums, take the History of the Museum class. Unless you a) want to write a substantial report every week without any explanation of grading expectations and\/or b) be pigeon-holed into an arbitrarily assigned individual research topic for the last 5 weeks of the course (studying a painting or object you have zero interest in, and that has already been EXTENSIVELY studied by an employee of the Art Gallery) DON'T take this course.PS. Don't be lured by the trip to the MOMA's conservation lab. They scheduled the trip for Finals Week (literally, a day in which people had to take other finals), and only 3 people ended up being able to go.",
    "Definitely take this class! It was a lot of fun and you get to go on a lot of field trips and learn about objects in the YUAG.",
    "This course is a great overview of the different types of techniques used by conservators to evaluate works of art. Basically, each class meeting looks at a different case study \u0097 a 17th century painting, a marble sculpture, a contemporary multimedia piece \u0097 and talks about the different approaches and challenges conservators and curators face. You also get to go to LSF and West Campus to see the labs there. Then, the last 1\/3 of the class, each student is given a work of art to study. You have the opportunity to test out some of the techniques discussed in class, andget to actually hold the works of art in some cases. Basically, you get exposed to a completely different way of looking at art. The class is a bit unorganized, because it's team taught by the entire conservation department. But at the same time, it's nice to have lots of different perspectives.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. The workload is manageable, the ability to work with real art objects is incredible, the instruction is great, and the final project is enjoyable. This class is very rewarding and has no drawbacks. You'll wish you could take it again!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. I learned a lot of material that I probably would not have leanred otherwise. Some of the technical aspects\/scientific terms were challenging, but once you understand them, the class allows you to build up on this knowledge.",
    "I would recommend the class. It's an interesting topic, and you get to look at a lot of art in a hands on way. The workload is not too difficult, and the final project is enjoyable to do."
