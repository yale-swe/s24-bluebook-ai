    "This class is perfect. It is so relevant to Political Science, and I think everyone who is interested in US Politics or ethnic studies should take it. All of the readings are super interesting, and Professor Weaver is great. The workload is manageable. I really like how we can write a final paper on anything we want.",
    "Really great class. Even as a non poli sci major, I learned so much and wasn't overwhelmed. The reading was a little heavy, but you should find time to do it or skim if you don't want class to get awkward.",
    "Definitely take this class. This is the best political science class I've taken at Yale. Prof. Weaver is awesome, and the readings are all really interesting. The workload (one open note midterm, two 6-8 page papers) is not bad at all.",
    "YES. DO IT. This is the best class I have ever taken. Professor Weaver is a gem and will blow your mind session after session. The class also did not have a bad workload and was really manageable. The papers were great because you could write according to your interest. Just great.",
    "Excellent class! The professor really knows her stuff. I felt like I learned a substantial amount every class. I would definitely recommend this class, it offers valuable lessons and discussions on issues that every American should be aware of.",
    "You learn so much in this course\u00e2\u0080\u0094 take it! Prof. Weaver is a fantastic seminar leader, the readings are all interesting (some are even mind-blowing), and the discussion is enlightening.__Overall, this was a great course. The readings, lecture, and structure of the course are all strengths. The readings were varied, contentious, up-to-date, and interesting. The lecture was sharp and concrete. And, the class was structured in a way that was very fulfilling for students. The only weakness might be that the discussion questions we posted each week weren't really used to facilitate discussion. This was fine, as most students were engaged in discussion, but it could be more fulfilling to find a way to bring these questions into the seminar, even if it takes enforcing a strict deadline for question submissions.Professor Weaverwas extremely knowledgeable, sharp, and understanding. She delivered a great lecture every week and could answer nearly all of our questions on the subject.",
    "Political Science 223 01 is a course for those interested in race relations in the United States. This class teaches students about the complex relations between law, politics, psychology, and sociology when it comes to race and immigration. I would recommend this class because many people, including myself are\/were ignorant on this issue. As much progress as we have made in this country, racism is not over. It is important to understand the intricate details at play within the issue that are relevant today and will be relevant tomorrow."
