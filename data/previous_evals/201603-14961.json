    "Professor Treiman was nice enough, but the class was essentially just reading off lecture slides, which is fine but not terribly engaging as a teaching technique. Technically a lecture class, but the enrollment size made it have aspects of a seminar. Definitely practical and useful as a class, but not the most exciting way to spend an afternoon."

    "If you're interested in quantitative social science and don't want to dive into courses offered by the statistics department, this is probably a good bet. Not the most engaging course I've ever taken, but practical, and the problem sets (especially the later ones) guide you through the techniques which you will eventually use for your final paper, and you're given a good deal of independence in your data set choice and research question."
