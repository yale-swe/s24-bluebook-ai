    "Topics of multivariable calculus ranging from vectors, double\/triple integral, Stokes and Greens theorem, and much more. Also picked up lots of self-directed learning skills.",
    "I learned how to apply multi variable calculus to more direct applications and complicated surfaces.",
    "multivariable calculus.",
    "I'd say it's less that I remember specific things like how to calculate the flux through an object or the way that vectors are added; rather, I feel as though my ability to work with complex problems and functions has increased and become more refined.",
    "I learned more about topics in multivariable calculus, which also translated to some physics topics as well.",
    "I learned how to do multivariable calculus.",
    "I learned a solid amount of multivariable calculus, and I now have a good understanding of how to solve various problems in the subject. The class was also a good review for me since I had taken the course previously. It was also a good opportunity to build good study habits.",
    "A thorough understanding of multi variable calculus and its applications",
    "I developed the ability to work through problem sets over a period of time and plan ahead.",
    "I learned about different concepts in multivariable calculus, like multiple integrals and partial differentiation.",
    "The multivariable calculus we covered in this class allowed me insight on extensions to single variable calculus that I have done in the past. This class, in conjunction with Physics 180, provided many real-life applications on how math is used in the field of engineering. I was also able to develop new study skills and learn how to approach learning a difficult concept I had never previously studied. I feel slightly more confident as to my aptitude for biomedical engineering",
    "I learned how to use calculus in situations with more than one variable.",
    "understand how to work with 3D surfaces",
    "It does what it says on the tin I developed an understanding for multivariable calc and its applications.",
    "I developed my skills and knowledge in vectors and 3D shapes. My integration and differentiation skills are greater than they were before and my problem solving has also been developed because this courses forces you to learn in a positive way.",
    "This course greatly improved my understanding of calculus and how ideas in calculus can be directly applied to engineering topics. I believe that I have been supplied with a comprehensive education of multivariable calculus and this has made me excited to pursue engineering.",
    "Learned how to deal with complex derivations and integrations. Learned how to solve partial derivatives.",
    "Decent intro to multi.",
    "I learned how to approach each problem with the point of view of an engineer or physicist. The course helped me see the connection between the math concepts I learned and the practical implications of the work.",

    "Multi-variable calculus (starting with vectors, moving into double and triple integrals, and ending with applications like curl and divergence).",
    "The topics outlined in the syllabus were the topics covered in the class.",
    "I gained skills in approaching complex problems in simpler ways and teaching myself difficult concepts.",
    "Obviously multivariable calc applied, but moreso an understanding of how to succeed in a lecture class by taking advantage of office hours and other materials.",
    "I learned to use vectors and do calculus operations with multiple variables, vectors, and vector fields."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The only strength are the TAs work hard to make up for the shortcomings of the course. However, their efforts are in vain because there are too many weaknesses in the way the course is taught and structured. Aside from the fact that this course teaches you how to deal with lots of stress, I see very little value in taking this class. There is too much work and very little support. For one, the textbook used is very hard to understand, but students are essentially required to go through it because the lectures are even harder to understand. Moreover, the instructor has his office hours doing a time where most students have class, making it hard to ask for help. Psets are also ridiculously difficult and vastly under-prepare you for the rigor of the midterm which is much harder than the psets. On top of the psets, a ~45 minute quiz is due an hour before each day the class meets, which adds unnecessary stress to an already awful class.",
    "Lectures are bit long. Difficult to maintain focus towards the end. 50 minute lectures might be better",
    "It goes fast, the material is difficult, and there's not a ton of extra help relative to the difficulty of the class. There should be one or two more TAs to offer help sessions besides the few office hours the professor was able to offer during the week",
    "Strengths - office hours were invaluable for strengthening comprehension of material and completing problem sets; exams were very reasonable. Weakness - teaching quality during lecture can sometimes get confusing and\/or boring.",
    "Vidvuds is an amazing professor, if you understand the material beforehand. When he says his pre-class quizzes are designed to suggest that you read the textbook, he is not kidding. If you are okay with teaching yourself straight from the textbook and then building upon that in class, this is the class for you.",
    "The office hours for this course were very helpful and spaced out well. A weakness is how the last section of the course was taught, it felt very fast paced and not as clear as the others.",
    "strength, very organized.",
    "A strength of this course was the pre-class assignments because they helped prepare me for the actual class, but I wish that there were more examples done in class so that we could take a proof or a theorem and apply them to actual problems.",
    "I like the somewhat applied nature of the class, though it's mainly just calculus -- no proofs. Teaching suffers from assuming the students know more than they do at times, and thus some of the class becomes lost in the middle of a problem. Lecture is of questionable value, confuses more than it clarifies at times.",
    "I found everything about this course outside of the lectures helpful--office hours, TA hours, and the practice sessions. My biggest problem with this course were the lectures themselves, which I did not think were very helpful, and were pretty hard to follow. I learned basically by reading the textbook. I think if the lectures were more like the practice sessions and had more of a class participation element, they would have been more conducive to learning.",
    "The course was not that difficult for me. I enjoyed Prof. Ozulins teaching method using the blackboard and not a slideshow. I also enjoyed that he emphasized solving problems over memorizing formulas.",
    "In order to really benefit from the course, the student has to practice consistently. The instructor makes this known, and lectures are usually very difficult to follow unless one has read the textbook in advance. However, the pre class quizzes are an additional incentive to read ahead.",
    "The strengths are in the geometric explanations of the concepts.",
    "I think the pre-lecture quizzes are good for keeping up with content but the lectures themselves are difficult to follow and don't assist in learning. Halfway through the semester when practice problems were introduced, I thought that was an added strength for the class and I could tell there was more effort in including practice throughout the semester.",
    "I believe one weakness of the course is the weighing of the exams, particularly the first midterm. While the first midterm was actually review of some concepts that I had previously encountered, I performed worst on this exam and improved much more dramatically for the second midterm and the final, which covered concepts I had never seen before. Because the first midterm was weighed so heavily, I don't believe my final grade in the class truly reflected my growth over the course of the semester. I also do not feel the pre-class quizzes are very effective (computing certain answers based on substitution into formulas was not conducive to be understanding what the topic is). I spent so much time working on the quizzes and they provided very minimal benefits in furthering my understanding. Additionally, I would have liked to work more example problems in class as opposed to working through all the proofs in the textbook. One strength of the class was the teaching fellow's office hours; I thought having them on Thursday was nice timing, as we have the week to complete the problem sets and have the opportunity to ask questions on Thursday.",
    "Course at the beginning had not enough practice problems, but after the first midterm got much better",
    "Strength: Plenty of opportunities to practice and review. If you want to master the material, you are given the resources to do so. Weakness: The first unit is pretty dense. The first exam seemed to catch most people off guard.",
    "This course was taught the best way it could be. This courses strengths are its problem sets and practice exams posted week before the exam and I dont know how this course could be improved.",
    "One weakness of the course was that the lectures often patchily covered the material that was covered in the book, and I only felt prepared for the class if I read the book carefully and worked through examples before each lecture. A strength of the course was the consistent mentioning of situations in which the class material could be applied in the engineering world.",
    "Lectures were not very engaging. Psets were a good reflection of material.",
    "The teaching is very good and I loved how accessible the professor was for help on both problem sets and concepts themselves. I also liked the system of pre-lecture quizzes, which helped me understand the concepts even more.",
    "Course was very straightforward and out of the textbook. Psets did a good job challenging us to think outside the box.",
    "Strengths: This course is structured so that as long as you put in effort, even if you do poorly, you'll still have a fair shot at getting a good grade. PSETs are worth 30% of your grade, with 12 of them throughout the semester. 3 of the lowest PSET grades will be dropped. You then have daily quizzes, at 10% of your grade, and a quarter of those will be dropped as well. Finally, while the tests are 60% of your grade in total, with one test at 15%, one at 20%, and one at 25%, Professor Ozolins weights them where your highest-scoring test is weighted the highest. The book can be found online. Weaknesses: PSETs don't accurately measure what's on the tests; I thought I knew the material from doing well on the PSETs, but they don't really translate to the exams. Lecture is startlingly unhelpful, as Professor Ozolins starts, goes too fast for the majority of people, goes into tangents for the people who do get it, and then leaves everyone else confused. The book is also opaque; Sal Khan single-handedly saved my grade.",
    "The course allows students to delve into the topics of multivariable calculus at a steady pace. There seems to be a gap between the knowledge acquired in Math 115 and the knowledge needed for the initial topics of Enas 151. More emphasis on the initial topics would be beneficial.",
    "The course's weakness lies in that the classes are taken up primarily by proofs and not by simpler and more challenging examples. I think there should be more time at the beginning of the course to introduce students to the basics that will constantly come up and that they might not be familiar with. I also think this class should have peer tutors so students can have access to more help.",
    "Very well taught and well organized. If there is a weakness, it is that the office hour space is too small.",
    "Office hours were super helpful and the professor was very willing to help out students finish their psets. Though I didn't enjoy doing pre-lecture quizzes because solving them was really without understanding the concepts behind each quiz. One suggestion is that a post-lecture quiz to review each lecture could be better."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "I would not recommend this course to another student. As explained above, the teaching is awful and the support system is even worse. The class, moreover, does not teach you to apply your knowledge of multivariable calculus which essentially defeats the purpose of taking ENAS 151 as opposed to MATH 120. Also the class is too computational and favors people who memorize strategies for the exam instead of creatively approaching problems.",
    "Yes but be aware that you have to teach yourself most of the conceptual ideas. Take this class if you have a bad math 120 instructor",
    "It depends. If youre between ENAS151 and MATH120, I would say go with this course if you have a background in multi, are generally a good self-directed learner, or wont need a very solid foundation in multi for your major. If you really want to learn multi at a deep level or arent as familiar with the concepts and need a greater level of teaching quality, go with 120. The professor is a cool guy, very nice and approachable, but not always the best at fully explaining things.",
    "To be completely honest, only take this course if you want to. The intellectual grind it presents is often not worth the work for \"dipping one's toes\".",
    "I would recommend this course for students who have taken higher level calculus before. Without prior knowledge it might be too overwhelming. It is a good class overall and has a good mix of challenge and application.",
    "yes it is much better than 120.",
    "Yes -- this course is basically Math 120, but Vidvuds is a fun (and thorough) professor, and the weights assigned to exams are more fair.",
    "I would recommend this to another student who wants to learn more about applied math than just learning theory. I will say that the structure of the class leaves you to learn a lot of the material by yourself or in office hours, so it is a lot of work and a sizable time commitment outside of regular class.",
    "You're probably choosing between MATH 120 and this beast, in which case I'd recommend the ENAS version if you have the option. Probably not too different at the end of the day though, but ENAS grading may be slightly more generous?",
    "If you choose to take this course you'll probably get through it. I wouldn't recommend it to someone who doesn't need it as a prerequisite. I would probably take this class over non-Sudesh Math 120, but for multivariable calculus at Yale in general there aren't a lot of great course options.",
    "Yes, I would recommend the course to another student. The content covered by the course was both valuable and interesting, and the teaching method and the professor made the course enjoyable.",
    "Probably the best course in calculus 3 offered at Yale. You are set up to succeed and there are plenty of resources.",
    "Yes its a well structured course for the topic and great for any visual learners.",
    "If you're looking for a multivariable class, based off of what I know from others, take this over math 120, because it is far more forgiving to mistakes and the process of learning.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone who is interested in pursuing math or a career that is math related. I learned so much in this class and have a much greater understanding of multivariable calculus and how it applies to the currently expanding world of engineering and science.",
    "Yes",
    "Yes! It is much better organised than Math 120 and fairly easy to manage. There are no teaching fellows though.",
    "Yes. This course is an enjoyable and fair way to learn multivariable calc. The workload keeps you learning but it isn't overwhelming. The amount of study material allows you to know where you are in the learning process.",
    "Yes, I would highly recommend this course to fellow students if they are in the engineering pathway because I feel it caters to the engineering side.",
    "Yes, this class has convinced me to pursue a higher level STEM education because of its thorough investigation of mathematical concepts.",
    "Yes. Professor Vidvuds Ozolins was the best professor Ive had at Yale. Excellent teacher and even better person",
    "Sure. Its required.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student, especially if they are into the practical implications of math rather than the theory.",
    "I would, Professor Vidvuds is great, and the course is a better alternative to Math 120.",
    "Yes, but no. If you need a multi-variable calculus credit for a major (e.g. S&DS), and you're unsure of how well you'll do in the class, your grade will be fine. However, I'm not really sure of how well anything I learned in the class is sticking, so if you actually want to learn, this class maybe isn't for you.",
    "I would recommend the class only if it is required for a major.",
    "I would not recommend this class to another student. I taught myself the course material and despite reaching out and searching for further help, saw that there was little availability and course resources. This course covers difficult concepts and while some students were further advanced in mathematics, many students were left to struggle through the material. At the end of the course I can genuinely say I do not have a proper understanding of the course content.",
    "Definitely. Great teaching staff and well organized.",
    "Yes, I would. It is a good introduction to Yale's math courses and a solid, well-planned class to learn multivariable calculus. The professor is super helpful in solving weekly problem sets and the overall workload is very manageable."
