    "If you have to take it for Literature major, take it. It is also a pretty good writing credit I have heard for those who are looking for one. If you are considering the Literature major, don't view this class as a guide to what other classes in the major are like-most classes in the major are much more engrossing!",
    "Yes, but it's not always exciting or interesting at times. But very doable.",
    "Not a great class, even speaking as a Lit major. The curriculum is all over the place and the works are hard to relate to each other. Lectures were supposed to give background on each work but they were often so boring it was difficult to pay attention (not that this mattered--the lecture material is almost never brought up in section). The professor you had for section really determined how you felt about the class--Beecroft is all right, but I've heard much better things about Gabriel and Trumpener. The upside is that since it's mostly poetry and plays, and you only cover one work a week, there really is very little work to do.",
    "It is a course that tries to cover very much in very little time. It is perhaps the most spread thin of courses I've taken, resulting in a course that is interesting, but perhaps not necessarily lasting in terms of conceptual value.",
    "I would recommend Lit122 to those who want to be introduced to major non-western literary traditions. Nothing is gone into in very much depth, however. Also, if you're a lit major this class is required.",
    "YES! YES! Great course! The alternating section\/lecture layout gave a thorough understanding of the material. The section really allowed for personal interests to be discussed. The professors (Beecroft was great!) really helped students to improve in writing by talking over the papers and the associated topics before they were due. There was a lot of choice in the topics, also, so that if one work was your particular favorite, you could choose to write on that one. Overall, it was great. As a science major, I feel that people of all majors could benefit from this course; writing improvements in skill and style will even help me on my science-geared writings!!!! : )"
