    "You choose a topic, which will inevitably grow and change as you continue working on the project, and you read primary and secondary sources, constructing a draft of a 30-40 page paper that is due at the end of the semester. Take it if you have a topic you love.",
    "I can't compare the experience of writing an independent senior essay to writing a senior essay in the context of a senior seminar. However, I am incredibly glad I chose to do the former, and I would definitely recommend the independent project to other students. Pursuing an independent research project is challenging, engaging, and exciting.",
    "If you have a topic about which you are passionate, I absolutely recommend it.",
    "If you have a topic you are passionate about, I would definitely would recommend the senior essay. Get started early---you won't want to have to do too much primary source reading while you are writing it, it's easier if you know your material fairly well before you start writing. You'll still learn a lot about it and figure things out while writing, but you won't be new to the material. Pick an adviser you trust to give you detailedfeedback, and pick a topic you know you can live with for several months. Even though I loved my topic, by the end I was pretty tired of thinking of it, so choose wisely.",
    "I would definitely recommend it if you're really passionate about your topic and are VERY motivated. You really have to keep up with your research all semester long, and it can become a VERY daunting task to try to catch up at the end if you haven't been working on it. If you don't want to do a lot of extra work, take a senior seminar instead.",
    "Only take it if you really want to explore a topic that you won't be able to cover in one of the senior seminars- the paper is more work than you might think, and it is helpful to have the guidance of a seminar. If you really want to do the senior essay, make sure to take full advantage of your advisor's guidance, and try to get things done ahead of time, if at all possible.",
    "It is difficult to assess the senior essay because so much of the experience depends on a number of variables. I happened to have a topic which I loved and fit together nicely into a paper. I also looked forward to meetings with my adviser. But if you are someone who does not work well independently and you end up with a difficult topic to write it could be a miserable experience. In the end, I definitely found it worthwhile and have no regrets about the experience."
