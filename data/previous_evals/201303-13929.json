   "comments": [
    "If you want to learn more about teaching foreign languages and find ways to teach even better, I definitely recommend this course!",
    "The course is definitely recommended to anyone teaching modern languages at the college or high school levels, or anyone who foresees teaching language in the future. It provides a thorough panorama of various pedagogical theories, methodologies, and practices of second language acquisition.",
    "I would recommend Linguistics 504 to a fellow student especially those students who wish to teach at some point in their life. This course gives an in depth knowledge of various teaching approaches and more specifically the CLT approach in language teaching. Students also have an opportunity to put theory into practice as they learn this course. The use of technology in the classroom is also a strength of this course.",
    "Absolutely yes! It's a course everybody who is going to teach or is interested in teaching or in learning languages should take! The information and practices provided are very very useful.",
    "This course is designed to give you a full toolbox of techniques for second language teaching. Research on a large amount of topics within SLA teaching are covered and there is the opportunity to conduct a research project in your own classroom.",
    "The class is excellent preparation for classroom language teaching in the university, and it also contributes to earning the certificate in second language acquisition offered through the Center for Language Study. Nelleke fosters a warm sense of collegiality amongst students in the class, and it is enriching to meet instructors from a variety of languages.",
    "Yes. Great course to bridge your perspective upon linguistics and teaching."

   "question_text": "How did this course deepen your knowledge of your discipline\/profession? To what extent did this course contribute to your dissertation\/research?",
   "comments": [
    "Not at all related to my dissertation or research, but a useful professional development seminar and a requirement for the SLA certificate offered by the CLS.",
    "My research does not concern SLA, but the course is a valuable asset as I prepare to go on the job market.",
    "This course introduced me to the Communicative Language teaching approach that focuses on the use of task based activities to teach. I have been able to improve as a language teacher, become more innovative and I am able to make my classes interactive, fun and student centered.",
    "This course does not contribute to my reasearch. However is fundamental for the profession I want to pursue in the academia.",
    "This was a great class in terms of actually preparing students for professional responsibilities. I learned many techniques that I feel I will be able to use in my own classroom.",
    "This course helped me solidify my understanding of second language pedagogy and gave me a reason to guest teach several classes even though I am not currently teaching language. I greatly benefitted from creating an online teaching portfolio that I will continue to use, and the class advanced my progress toward the CLS's SLA certificate.",
    "It provides a fundamental background necessary to deepen my understanding upon teaching a language."
