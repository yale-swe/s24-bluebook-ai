    "I would highly recommend this class. It is fun and informative, especially with Professor Safille.",
    "SPAN 130 consists of units of study that address real-world topics (e.g. traveling, health, environment) as well as a comprehensive review of Spanish grammar. It strengthened my confidence in my ability to speak coherently and expanded my vocabulary to include words that I can see coming in handy in real-life situations. It meets every day, which is a little annoying, but honestly that kind of consistency is the best way to learn a language. If you're just trying to fulfill a distribution requirement you can get away with doing the minimum amount of work (which is not that much), and if you're actually interested there is a lot that can be learned.",
    "A very good review of Spanish grammar.",
    "SPAN 130 with Safille is muy divertido! The homework can feel like busy work at times, but Barbara makes the class an enjoyable experience. If you have to take it, you won't go wrong doing it with her.",
    "Good overview of Spanish. Take it cause you have to, not cause you want to.",
    "Se\u00c3\u00b1ora Safille is one of the best teachers I've ever had. She cares deeply about her students and made the effort to get to know each and every one of us. She was very enthusiastic with her lessons, regularly provided further insight where the textbook explanations were inadequate, and went above and beyond to meet the individual needs of each student. Se\u00c3\u00b1ora Safille is a model Yale professor.Regarding the class itself, the textbook was easy to follow (even though its online component was useless) and the course structure was well-designed and allocated good amounts of time to each unit. Testing was well-spaced and each exam, paper, and homework assignment was given a fair weight. Overall, definitely recommend this course, especially with Barbara Safille.",
    "Boring readings. Lots of work. Do-able."
