    "Typical Spanish class - you learn by humiliation. I feel as if I did not learn any Spanish, as I was under too much pressure to produce than to to learn anything. The tests and exams are very unfair - they rely on \"fill-in-the-blank\" type questions that are ambiguous and could reasonably accept almost any answer. Spanish should be a course that's fun, where you learn to salsa dance and listen to music all day and everyone gets an A at the end of the day (and perhaps some language skills in the process, but that's just me). Instead, I am incapable of expressing myself in Spanish and will be avoiding foreign languages for the rest of my college career. Good luck; I wish I had taken something else.",
    "Take it if you want to learn spanish or need the credit.",
    "Take it if you have to in order to either move on in spanish if that excites you or to fulfill a requirement. Dont expect it to be a really amazing and engaging class and dont expect this to be your year of greatest spanish language growth. It is not the worst thing though so dont feel like you shouldnt take the class if it is something you have to do to either move on in spanish or finish your language credit.",
    "Recommended if you are interested in spanish or if you need to fulfill a language req.",
    "L4 Spanish is definitely better than L3 and L2. Chances are that if you are reading this review you are considering taking L4 Spanish to finish off the language requirement - my advice to you: go for it and get it done! Oscar is a good guy to finish off Spanish with. However, if for some reason you would have to take L2-L4 to finish the language requirement and are looking at this course I would strongly suggest you consider looking at a different language. Yale's Spanish is nothing special and you will get more out of taking a different language.",
    "I enjoyed this class on a whole. It is very hard to achieve fluency in a language without being submerged in the language in a certain culture. I found that this course was good at raising me to a level of comprehension without really experiencing it."
