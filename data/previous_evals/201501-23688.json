    "Nothing.",
    "The challenge of more advanced classes such as FES905 is to balance scope with depth of discussion. In some classes I did not put the same effort in all papers reviewed especially when I had to present. One suggestion I have seen in other advanced course is to have one paper per class and requires all students to submit as one-page summary of the paper. Maybe also restrict to only two presentations per class instead of three. I would also suggest looking for a seminar type classroom that facilitates discussions."

Ken does a really great job explaining the most recent research in the field and clarifying difficult methodological concepts."
