   "comments": [
    "Excellent coverage of the subject, reconciliation processes. The course also provided a robust historical understanding of South Africa, Rwanda, and Nigeria. Meredith also embraces interdisciplinary methods, a tremendous asset to the course.",
    "I learned a lot in terms of being able to understand what goes into reconciliation generally.",
    "We began by learning about non-African contexts of reconciliation (Hannah Arendt's reporting on the Eichmann trial, Death and the Maiden by Ariel Dorfman) before we focused in on post-apartheid South Africa, post-genocide Rwanda, and post-Biafran-Civil-War Nigeria (as an example of what happens without any kind of formal reconciliation framework like the Truth and Reconciliation Commission or Gacaca Courts).",
    "Skillwise, in this class, I refined my close-reading of novels, films, and memoirs\/nonfiction, improved my book review writing abilities, developed an interdisciplinary vocabulary for discussing pressing issues of justice, reconciliation, and reparations in literature\/law in a global context, and experience placing legal, theoretical, and literary texts in dialogue. Content-wise, this class provided a nuanced introduction to processes and discourse of reconciliation in theory and in practice in the three case studies (South Africa, Rwanda, and Nigeria).",
    "This course examined reconciliation attempts in after three national conflictsApartheid in South Africa, the genocide against the Tutsi in Rwanda, and the Biafran civil war in Nigeriaand used both historical perspectives of programs like the TRC and narratives (books and movies) to explore reconciliation."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: -well developed syllabus, excellent readings -great discussion facilitation -assignments well designed to allow exploration of individual students' interests Weaknesses: -we often didn't have time to cover the material in as much detail as I would like -I felt the student presentations took up more time from the course than they were worth",
    "The strength lies in the material\/texts we covered in the class. I do think that it was a lot to read entire books in one week, but its Yale, right?",
    "The Rwandan portion of the course was a bit more difficult because I was less familiar with analyzing filmic texts. I think a \"less formal\" reading was what Meredith wanted because that's how a general audience would perceive the filmic texts. Still, I would've appreciated a few pointers when analyzing a less familiar form for the first time.",
    "Incredible course, no weaknesses other than that it would have been helpful to establish a slightly more robust working definition\/(s) of reconciliation at the beginning of the course.",
    "Strengths of this class include an extremely knowledgeable and engaging professor, a great cohort of students from mixed majors and grad\/undergrad backgrounds, a positive, inquisitive classroom environment led by Meredith, well-selected fascinating (and typically reasonable in terms of workload!) readings\/syllabus. Weaknesses were rather few, and mostly just concerned not having enough time to delve into all readings every class or each case study in the same amount of depth -- Nigeria, specifically, at the end seemed rather brief. Generally, however, very few complaints -- this class went extremely smoothly, especially given that it was the first time it was taught!",
    "The nature of the topic meant that we covered a lot of ground and yet had trouble coming up with any real answers, but that was ultimately a strength, since a class that treated reconciliation as anything less than infinitely complicated would have felt like cheating, and some really interesting discussions came out of our collective uncertainty."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, I really can't name a significant downside to this class. Wonderful material, outstanding professor, manageable assignments.",
    "I would, but only if with the same professor. Her background knowledge and experience with the topics at hand were what made the class really invigorating.",
    "ABSOLUTELY. There are only so many courses in Yale's English Department that expose you to non-western texts, and I loved almost everything we read in this course. Meredith puts so much care into the syllabi she crafts, and you can tell. Not only are the central texts of her syllabus amazing, but her secondary readings are always helpful for framing our discussion using real-world theories on trauma, on state-instituted reconciliation, on human rights theory, etc. I also had an amazing group of people with in my seminar, and they all brought so much insight each class.",
    "This course is fantastic! Meredith is a gem, and is such a thoughtful instructor. This topic is so fruitful and important to think about reconciliation is slippery but so meaningful to study.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class if it is ever taught again! The class attracted a great mix of students from various majors and undergrad\/grad backgrounds (note: I don't think there were any first-years or sophomores in this class this go-around), who brought diverse perspectives and backgrounds that added a lot to class discussion. Discussion and analysis were extremely nuanced and interdisciplinary and were expertly led by Meredith who encouraged students to ask difficult questions and grapple with the lack of easy answers. Students and Meredith both seemed to REALLY care about the material and learning more, so much that members are planning to start an independent working group in the spring. This class is an incredibly strong introduction to the myriad angles of reconciliation studies (legal perspectives, literature, trauma theory, etc.) for a student looking for a one-semester intensive or, in my case and the case of many others in the class, considering further research in this field in the future!",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course, although it probably won't work well without Meredith. Discussion was consistently fascinating, as was everything we read or watched. The reading load and assignments were very manageable, and the student presentations were great."
