   "comments": [
    "Quite complimentary to the rest of my coursework",
    "Great perspectives from different minds. However the course has such a high number of HCM students who are not pursuing other degrees (i.e. MD or JD). Would have appreciated more successful individuals with just an MPH or MHA and not additional degrees. Could also switch up the food from week to week and do little appetizers.",
    "Strength: Good speakers Weakness: Conflicts with other activities at the same time slot.",
    "Best class at Yale. You get to network with c-level executives and ask any question that you see fit. Only weakness is that I wish it was longer and maybe on a different day of the week. I understand this may not be possible as the speakers also need to speak at the EMBA class on Friday.",
    "God time to learn and listen to people working in the industry currently.",
    "I loved this course! The speakers were great and I loved being able to go out to dinner and talk with them in smaller conversations.",
    "Howie brings in world-class speakers and creates an amazing year-long colloquium series. It is simply amazing.",
    "great class.",
    "Speakers talking about their perspectives on health care were more interesting than those talking about their careers.",
    "Great course. Very entertaining and useful.",
    "Love the diversity in speakers!",
    "Just amazing.",
    "An excellent selection of speakers this semester! Compared to last semester, the spring term brought more diverse speakers with different background and industry practice. Thanks Howie!",
    "Fantastic course. All of the speakers were truly inspiring, and approachable after their presentations. Dinner with the speakers was a great added bonus. I looked forward to this class every week.",
    "Strengths - It is nice to have the opportunity to hear from multiple speakers about a variety of topics. Weaknesses - - Seminars are too US-centric. It would be nice to have a more global outlook (i.e. maybe some speakers about European\/Canadian healthcare systems). This is feedback that applies to the whole HCM program in general. - Is it possible to have this seminar at any other time? Closing bell is one the best times HCM students can integrate and get to know SOM'ers outside of class so it's shame to have to miss most of them. - Sometimes I feel like the information provided is redundant with other course material and does not go into enough depth.",
    "Great course. The best seminar offered at YSPH. Highly encourage participating. Could use more speakers who are devoted to primary care, system transformation, rather than CEO's of medical device companies. Similarly could benefit from more speakers who are not MD's."

    "I would recommend this class without reservation.",
    "This colloquium series is easily the most-envied of all the YSPH department seminar series and a true joy to attend. Professor Forman is able to bring in world-class thought leaders and speakers, and students have the opportunity to ask them a range of questions and actually interface with these amazing people. It would be highly recommended to attend this colloquium whether or not you are a student in the HPM department since all public health students could learn something in leadership and changing the healthcare landscape from these discussions.",
    "If you want to hear from people in the industry, definitely take this class.",
    "I would definitively recommend the course.",
    "Wonderful.",
    "Be there! And don't feel shy to reach out to the speakers!",
    "If you want to learn more about US healthcare then this is a great seminar. If you want a more global outlook regarding health care management, you've got to look elsewhere.",
    "I would highly recommend taking this course."
