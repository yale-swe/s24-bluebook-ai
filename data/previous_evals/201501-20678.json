    "A seminar-style class that reads interesting cell bio papers every week and discusses them. Would recommend for those interested in cell biology or those wishing to learn more about cell bio in a low-pressure setting.",
    "In this class, students will read a different research article each week. One student will present some background information while the other students go around the room sequentially describing each figure in detail. I would recommend this class if you enjoy seminars instead of lectures.",
    "Very comparable to Methods and Logic for MBB. You read papers, write a summary, and discuss. I would recommend this class to anyone not comfortable in reading scientific articles, as it definitely improved my skill level.",
    "This is a very nice course to read papers every week and discuss. I've learned a lot this semester!",
    "I would highly recommend this course to an person interested in learning about cellular biology or entering the department"
