   "comments": [
    "If you're interested in Roman culture at all, take this class. The reading is manageable and the class itself is great.",
    "If you are a clcv or classics major you have to take this course. Although I don't think Professor Freudenburg will be teaching next year, it is a good course nonetheless. Oftentimes in Latin classes you don't get the chance to dig into the cultural context of a passage, line, or phrase. But this class gave me new insight on poems that I had translated in high school and never really understood. The classics department is passionate about teaching and getting everyone engaged with the material. I would recommend it.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class. This was one of if not my favorite class at Yale. Professor Freudenburg is an excellent lecturer and is very engaging.",
    "Really fantastic course with a focus on the fascinating social and cultural Rome that will probably be glossed over by the typical history class. A small lecture with a personal, energetic feel. Good for CLCV newbies (which I was) and probably everyone else. Prof Freudenberg is brilliantly knowledgeable and engaging and also a friendly guy. If you are at all interested in Roman culture it's a must-take.",
    "Take this class. Whether it is a requirement or not. It is so interesting and the professor and TA are fantastic. There is a lot of reading, but it is really interesting, so it doesn't seem like a lot.",
    "I feel that this course had difficulty finding direction. There were some overall themes (e.g. Rome as a culture of spectacle) but I didn't find the theme of each week to be articulated in a way that got into a lot of interesting or non-repetitive detail. It's a hard subject to teach because there's so much material to cover, but I think this course has so much more potential than was realized this semester. There should be some mechanism of engaging with the reading more in class, because a lot of what we were assigned was never addressed - also it would be wonderful if the parameters for the first paper weren't so strictly set on viewing a broad range of cultural phenomena through the lens of Roman friendship. Overall, I thought the class was a pretty superficial but interesting overview of some aspects of Roman culture.",
    "As someone who had to take it for the classics major, I liked this class a lot and found it useful. Professor Freudenburg won't be teaching it next year, and it's likely to be a little different, but he was a great, engaging lecturer. The material is pretty intrinsically interesting, thought it's a LOT easier and more comprehensible if you have a good grasp on Roman history already.",
    "Combining literature with historical and archaeological details. The professor has rich life experience instilled in the course."
