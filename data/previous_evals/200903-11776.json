    "Lovely for its reading list and the small class size which allowed for lots of individual attention.",
    "This is a terrific class that requires a lot of very close reading in French, with a curriculum that starts with short stories and poetry and progresses to plays and novels in the second half of the term, interspersed with essays in literary theory and criticism. I wouldn't necessarily recommend this course to students with no prior experience in French literature, as the discussions and writing assignments assume a certain degree of familiarity with the basics of the subject, but if you're fairly comfortable reading and writing in French (and patient enough to actually look up words in the dictionary), you should get a lot out of the course. Professor Zhuo is great - really helpful and interesting, and good at leading discussions - and we read a great selection of works from the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. When I took the class, there were only five students, which was really nice - the seminar style makes for some great conversations about the literature.",
    "I wouldn't recommend this course. The texts are interesting, but writing is tedious -the teacher is unclear about her expectations, she corrects your writing and allows you to hand in a corrected version, only to find innumerable new mistakes. She can openly tell you you write incorrectly or don't know how to express yourself and then give you a B+ or an A-. I wouldn't recommend this course, take one with Madame Pinzka instead.",
    "French 175 surveyed a number of different French writers and literary movements while aiming to teach students how to write the classic \"explication de texte.\" I enjoyed many of the texts we read, but was disappointed by how little I felt we were instructed in how to write. We received a sheet of paper at the beginning of the semester which outlined how to write the difficult close analysis we were expected to do for the first three papers, but after that, not much was done in-class to help students with their writing. Other than that, the discussions were as interesting as the texts, and Mme Zhuo is an incredibly bright and competent teacher. Stay for the discussions and works, but don't go in with the expectation that you will truly know how to write an explication de texte by the end. The workload was light (about a 60 page reading per week, three 3-page essays, and a final paper of about 5-6 pages) and manageable."
