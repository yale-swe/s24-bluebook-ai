   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course if you want a light intro to quantum. this course also is one of those rare few that shows practical applications of theoretical physics. Take it if you want a credit towards the major with a very doable workload.",
    "A welcome break after 410.",
    "yes",
    "I would recommend this course if you are willing to sit through many lectures filled with math in order to complete 5 problem sets and give two very simple presentations. If you can do these things then you can walk away with an A and knowledge a few cool applications of quantum mechanics.",
    "Basically a class in applied quantum mechanics, with the application being quantum information processing. I really enjoyed the class and thought it was great, but it's a pretty specific subject area and I could imagine its specificity frustrating some people. Professor Barrett was great though, I would definitely recommend it if he teaches it again.",
    "This is a great elective class for any physics or applied physics students who want to learn more about the interesting quantum mechanics that wasn't really covered in the core QM courses. If you have a decent math background or took QM before, the material will be no problem, and even if you haven't, there's enough of an introduction in the course to catch you up.",
    "I would recommend the class to people who are interested in quantum computing and have a pretty strong background in linear algebra. Be prepared for a lot of math! But it's enjoyable because its applied to such an awesome topic."
