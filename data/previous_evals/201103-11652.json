   "comments": [
    "Definitely take this class because if you want to take any other higher level German courses, it is required. It is definitely easy and a good time. You don't even have to do the work to do fine in the class, but doing the work makes it a much better experience.",
    "Absolutely! The material was fantastic, and my German improved quite a bit. But certainly take it if Ansgar is teaching!",
    "This class is great with Ansgar. It's fine with other professors. I would definitely take it if you're not sure you want to continue with German formally or informally after L4, because it introduces you to real material. I found it to be a bit of a struggle at first, but Ansgar's attitude was very motivating. He has a seriousness toward the material, which intrigued me, but also a lightheartedness toward the class in general - bringing (or having us bring) food, spending some classes working out puzzles, etc. In short, I'd recommend it, especially if you have the chance to take it with Ansgar.",
    "A mid-way course between the language classes and the literature classes. A little unsatisfying, if you were expecting either. On the whole, really fun and interesting. Ansgar is great.",
    "The course itself is very flexible and I think it really depends on how the instructor chooses to conduct the class. With Ansgar, most of the work was based on reading texts that were quite challenging and writing about them (1-2 page compositions). Both grammar and oral practice were covered tangentially and not evaluated in formal tests, which in my opinion relieved the unnecessary pressure that comes with more \"standard\" ways of teaching languages. Instead of having a final exam, we were supposed to write an \"Abschlussessay\" that should be 4-5 pages long. In general, it was a very manageable course and it turned out to be a good way to keep up with German without having to worry too much about the class."
