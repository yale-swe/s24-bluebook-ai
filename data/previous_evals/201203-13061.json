   "comments": [
    "Everyone should take this class! Whether you're a China expert or know nothing about China, this class goes into great detail and let us all ponder how it will develop moving forward. Prof. Roach is awesome and really is an expert on the material he's presenting.",
    "Could be interesting but material gets repetitive pretty easily. Roach is really well known in his field but he winds up covering the same stuff over and over. Beware the term paper.",
    "Pretty chill class. Major tests are open note and not difficult. The final paper is anything you want about the Next China, which, if you have interest in China at all, shouldn't be a problem",
    "This course has an incredible workload if you do all of the reading. If you don't... well, in that case, the workload is pretty light. My problem with this class is that Prof. Roach is too optimistic about China. I'm pretty optimistic about China too, but I don't feel as though this class promoted much intellectual discussion or debate, because we only ever heard good things about China.",
    "Great class, you learn a lot of facts, but the level of analysis is hardly challenging. Of course, there's a paper in this class so you can go as deep as you'd like, but there's not much support if you choose to do so. Take it as a fun fifth class.",
    "I have already! amazing class.",
    "Yes",
    "This course focuses on the past, present and future economic development of the nation of China with a focus on the challenges facing it over the next 1-2 decades. Its a fabulous course taught by a great professor.",
    "i would recommend for an interesting enough econ course. there arent many.",
    "So. so. so. repetitive.But the material (for the first couple weeks) was interesting and it's a minimal amount of work. Paper + final at the end though sucks.",
    "Not too much work, but you really do get an idea of whether or not you might be interested in studying China, or any other country, in a little more depth than at least I am used to from my other courses. China really is an important part of the 21st century, and this class has provided a foundation for understanding the changes that are happening. It is not comprehensive, but an economic perspective is a good place to start, and I look forward to taking more courses on China in my time at Yale.",
    "Professor Roach talking about the same things about China for a semester. Pretty easy \"econ\" class, no hard math, definitely closer to a gut than most other classes in the major. Final paper is interesting to write if you have any interest in China. Gets very repetitive.",
    "I would definitely recommend the Next China to another student, especially if they're even remotely interested in China. Since China is looking to gain a lot of prominence in the global economy, this course was very useful in painting a broad overall picture of what's happening. At the same time, since I am Chinese, some of the more specific aspects were somewhat repetitive, since they're common knowledge for anyone who's moderately well-read on the topic. The course is broad, but not very deep, so take it if you want to gain a sense of the big picture. Workload was pretty light, no weekly assignments and only a midterm, take home final, and paper. Readings are pretty heavy but his lecture notes are comprehensive and I got a perfect score on the midterm without doing any of the readings.",
    "The Next China is a great class even with no prior knowledge of Chinese history. Not much work involved, but the material gets incredibly redundant.",
    "Ya, go ahead. You'll learn things in lecture and, if you do all the readings, you'll have a pretty holistic understanding of where China has been, where it is, and where it may be going.",
    "Reasonably interesting class, but only if you genuinely like the material because the professor is very dry. Pretty easy workload. You don't come out of it feeling like you learned anything specific but are just generally more knowledgeable about China.",
    "Great class, extremely relevant material, but it becomes a little redundant. Still not sure where I sit on the China debate, but Roach is a very passionate and convincing guy. Also, the workload is quite manageable since you don't need to do the readings.",
    "Yes. Take it if interested in China!",
    "Take if you are interested in China at-large. Breadth not depth. Some of the material gets repetitive. Requirements are straight-forward. Get a good TA!",
    "It's a great course that covers the economics and politics of China, as well as key cultural issues. very relevant, very interesting, and an important class for all students to take.",
    "I thought this class was interesting, and not too much work. Professor Roach's lectures provide you with most of the info you need, so I rarely did the reading. Obviously, if you have time, it's nice to do the reading, but I feel like you get a lot out just by taking notes in lecture.",
    "This class is interesting, and afterwards you will be more knowledgeable about China. However, it is very repetitive. Stephen Roach has many catch phrases that he repeats throughout the class. This can be good, since it really drives the points home, but it can also be tiring.",
    "Solid class, that introduces economic concepts of China without going too nitty-gritty. A LOT of reading, but skimming is advised. Lectures themselves are informative, and actually mesh information on China together very well. You may learn more here than in an advanced seminar on China.",
    "Learn about the current state of china\/ where it's going. Really annoying write a final paper and do a take home final, but you learn a decent amount",
    "A very good class for anyone looking to learn more about the Chinese economy.",
    "This class was amazing. Finally a class that taught me a lot and had genuine application. Well-organized, engaging lectures that appropriately reinforced and explained major concepts and connections. Roach is a guy that implicitly makes you want to do well in his class, and he provides ample tools for you to do so. Easily one of the best classes I have taken at Yale. And to top it off, beyond manageable workload, especially if you find the subject even mildly interesting.",
    "it's a nice chill class. good to take if you're interested about China and it's future. not too much work either.",
    "I would recommend this course to someone who might be interested in China or Econ but wants to figure out if they are in the long run. If you get bored and think its too repetitive, then its probably not for you because the readings and lectures do have enough that you can dig into if you want to. It was a nice look at the recent history of China and the general features of its economy and politics. Very forward looking, with not too much work aside from the readings. Grading is easy and the paper is interesting. Get Michelle (Mengsu) Chang if you can.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course for economics majors. With a decent background from other economics course, there is a lot of value to taking this course.",
    "Take it - pretty easy and you actually learn a decent amount of econ.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class, especially to an econ major who isn't especially good at math. Professor Roach is fantastic, the subject is very interesting, and the work is manageable. Just don't put off the final paper until the very last minute.",
    "Please do take this class. You do get that feeling of being enriched after you've taken this class.",
    "I highly recommend this class. Not too much work and you learn a lot.",
    "Yes, but the course largely depends on the TA you get too for they will be doing the majority of your grading.",
    "If you're at all interested in China, definitely take this class! Roach is awesome, and although it can sometimes be a bit dry\/repetitive, you will come away with a tremendous wealth of understanding.",
    "This is a great survey class to China and the workload is very manageable. Lectures can get dry at times, but Prof. Roach does his best to keep the content recent and relevant.",
    "Great course! Take it if you want to learn everything about China and how it will change in the next 30 years.",
    "Great overview of very important issues that are not only pertinent to China, but the international community as well. The topics range from the financial to the environmental to the political. Yes, the material can get redundant towards the end, but that's due to the nature of the topics themselves, which are all very interconnected. If you have a strong background in China, I would suggest you take a more challenging course. In any case, you'll come out of the class knowing useful information that's really relevant to all sorts of contemporary issues.",
    "I would recommend it if you don't feel you know much about China. If you do, though, it might be a little elementary and repetitive.",
    "Very interesting. Easy. Repetitive. Take-home final sucks.",
    "Solid class that I took a lot away from. There is a lot of reading, but only doing a bit of it and showing up to Roach's lectures will teach you all you need to know. Not too much work, although it is annoying that there is a 10-15 pg. paper due in reading week and then a take home final due at the end of reading week.",
    "A perfect intro class on issues faced by China, and the implication of these issues both for the country itself and for the United States. A must take!",
    "Great Econ credit. You can get as much out of the material as you want to and the course is really not much work. One 10-15 page paper, an open-note midterm and a take home final.",
    "Take it!!",
    "I would definitely recommend the Next China to a fellow student, especially someone who already has an established interest in China. Without an established interest, someone should still probably take the class just to know what is going on in China (which is very interesting and relevant to current events).",
    "Take it if you're an economics major. China is a big part of the global economy and is going through interesting changes. The workload isn't that intense and you come away with a solid foundation on China.",
    "Overall I would recommend the course for its broad treatment of China's rise to economic superpower status. Good readings and experienced lecturer.",
    "This class is a very good survey of China's economy past, present, and future. Professor Roach really knows what he's talking about, classes are interesting, and the midterm, final, and paper are all reasonable. Highly recommend this class.",
    "The general consensus of the course is that it is extremely repetitive and taught by a famous economist. However, looking back, I think students will actually take away a lot at the end because of the repetition. There is less emphasis on brute force memorization that will actually cause knowledge to leak after the course is over. You will be given the key central dogmas that Roach believes about China's path, and take away the necessary statistics and facts that support his theory. I'm from China, and I learned a lot from the course. Given that most academicians, especially the ones that are supposed to be from China and are really \"exiled\" and haven't been back the country for decades, at Yale are usually China-bashers, ironically, this course will be quite mind-opening and fact-driven. Not to mention that it is not extremely demanding. It's been fun course.",
    "Take it.",
    "It's a great course that really changes the way you look at China.",
    "Good",
    "Economics 338 is a class about the historical struggles of China and the future challenges China will have to deal with in order to be successful",
    "Very interesting course highlighting the economic, political, and societal reasons for China's economic success in recent decades while using this frameowrk to look into how China must move forward as a nation. I knew relatively little about China's economy, let alone China at all, before taking the class and I came out feeling fairly well versed on Chinese issues. I also have never taken macro economics and I did finein the class. I would definitely recommend this class to other students!",
    "If you don't know much about China or the Chinese economy then this would definitely be an interesting class. If you know something about China already, the lectures can get a bit repetitive although the readings are pretty interesting.",
    "Take it. Little work, very relevant topic, good lecturer. What else do you want?",
    "Very little economic theory or model building so I was a bit disappointed as an econ major. Great for anyone interested in modern China, especially from a political perspective. The back half of the course becomes very repetitive though.",
    "Overall, it was a great course, whether you had a background in economics or not. I would definitely recommend to other students."
