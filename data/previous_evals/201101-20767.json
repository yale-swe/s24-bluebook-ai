   "comments": [
    "I would most certainly recommend the class to any student of the humanities, especially those who need to boost their knowledge of the history of theory.",
    "A good survey class to get one's feet wet in various lit. crit. disciplines. I would recommend this for people who have little to no theoretical background in Western literature, but not for people who want to expand on their knowledge of basic theory, or people seeking to learn non-Western theory.",
    "I would, but I would look at the new professor of the course before doing so. Otherwise, the general concept of the course is exceptional - a good overview of many major ideas and intellectuals. Perhaps best suited for undergraduates, but as a grad student I was still interested.",
    "The best introduction to literary theory course that I have come across or even heard of during my student life."

   "comments": [
    "The course was invaluable to my understanding of scholarship, both classic and recent. It changed the way I think about problems in texts and history. I will undoubtedly go back to this course as a reference in future research projects.",
    "As a student in of a non-Western literary field, I had not been exposed to much of European literary theory, so this class was very important in expanding my toolbox for evaluating and theorizing about literature. It allowed me to try new things and get a grounding in theories that I often see referred to, but had not had much opportunity to engage with in the past.",
    "Absolutely, this course is pertinent and relevant for any and all courses of study."
