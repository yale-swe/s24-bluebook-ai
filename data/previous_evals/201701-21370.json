    "Prof. Glaser taught me how to write an argumentative essay. I have done well in many English classes in the past and I think that is somewhat sad that I haven't had a professor who pushed me to dig deeper into the text for an argument before ENGL 126 with Prof. Glaser.",
    "I gained close reading skills and a better understanding of the five writers we studied, who hold central roles in the canon of English poetry.",
    "I have become a much more careful reader of poetry and have learned to focus less of understanding the \"main message\" of a poem and rather to focus on the specifics. I think I have also improved as a writer, in part because I have learned to make my essays more focused by constructing the scope of their arguments.",
    "I learned to better critically engage with poetry and hopefully to write better.",
    "you read a lot of poetry, you think about the canon, you write a bunch of essays. pretty much what you'd expect.",
    "I learned a lot about how to write a better paper and gained a much broader and deeper knowledge of poetry and how to read it."

   "comments": [
    "I liked the supplemental poems we read. I also liked the mandatory extracurricular event and poetry recitation. When I read the syllabus, I thought I would dislike both, but by the end of the semester I learned to trust in the ways of Prof. Glaser! I liked how Prof. Glaser encouraged me to go through multiple stages of ''complicating'' my thesis. Initially, I was frustrated by Prof. Glaser's endless \"why?\"s but I believe I became a much better thinker for it. I liked Prof. Glaser's attention to poetic form and meter. I think it's a great and interesting approach for mathematically inclined minds who are also interested in poetry. The discussions made up a majority of class, which I liked. In the beginning of the semester, you told us to come to each class with a question of comment or passage to share with the class. But by the end of the semester, I definitely forgot about this. I think discussions could be more focused if you offered little encouragements throughout the semester or occasionally called people out to set an example. It might also have been cool if you told us to look out for something in each reading.",
    "Strengths - allow for an in-depth understanding of five particular writers, encourage close-reading skills, and a particular strength of Prof. Glaser's section was that we read the typical syllabus works alongside contemporary poetry, which was exciting and really great. Weaknesses - I didn't find most of the texts on the syllabus extremely exciting or interesting, but that's just because my own passions lie elsewhere, I suppose. I also think a lot of other sections would benefit from reading contemporary poetry alongside the major works, like we did.",
    "The course was very well taught. I wish that we had had more opportunities to revise each others' work during the semester. The syllabus initially said that we would be required to do this on three essays, but Professor Glaser later dropped this as an explicit out-of-class requirement for the last two essays. I wish that he had not; I have always thought that meeting with other students outside of class to discuss essays is a really valuable experience.",
    "I honestly don't see the point in having Pope on the syllabus, especially the poems we read. Much of his work is satirical and roman-a-clef, entirely focused on the specifics of his contemporary society, and often difficult to decipher without knowledge of who these figures were. Which is to say, it's hard to read him as particularly relevant to the modern day (or at least, works like \"The Rape of the Lock\").",
    "one weakness of this course is pope. i really do not understand why he is on this syllabus. another weakness of the course is the privileging of certain (dead, white, British, male) voices above other voices. but it's cool that we read bishop. I think prof. glaser did a good job of making the readings interesting, keeping discussions organized and moving but letting them go where students wanted to take them, and pairing the old texts with newer ones.",
    "A majority of it was student-led, which can be irritating. I enroll in a class because I want to know what my PhD Professor can teach me, not what people my age conjecture. I really wish that Professor Glaser spent more time actually teaching and lecturing, rather than having the students lead the class.",
    "I think the curriculum is wonderful and I like Professor Glaser's pairing of the older works with more modern works as well. There was a lot of writing in this class, and I think that maybe three instead of four papers would be better, with more time for meeting with Professor Glaser or for workshopping in class. I really enjoyed the small meter exercises at the beginning of the semester."

    "I would recommend 126 with Glaser. You're probably taking it because you have to for the English major, but I also hope you are trying to become better at thinking about Poetry and writing about Poetry in addition for the credit. Glaser knows pretty much every rhetorical device under the sun and he is very knowledgeable on meter. If you like poetry but are dissatisfied because you have not talked about poetry is a very rigorous way and it can be too ~subjective~ at times, take 126 with Glaser! I'm not saying there is a \"right\" interpretation of a poem, but Glaser is good at showing you how some interpretations are more inconsistent i.e. less \"right.\" Initially, I didn't like Prof. Glaser because I thought he was annoyingly picky but I have really come to like him and he greatly influenced the way I think about poetry. Also you read some fun poems. Our fifth poet was Elizabeth Bishop (amazing) and we read quite a bit of poetry by female poets and african american poets to augment the lack of diversity from Milton to Eliot. If you are some one who ~hates the canon~ take 126 with Glaser because we talked a lot about what it means to be part of a canon and you might even walk away with a fuller appreciation for \"noncanonical\" poets.",
    "If you have to take this course (because you're an English major), Professor Glaser's section is a good course to take because you read the major works alongside contemporary poetry. I can't say the class was the most interesting or exciting one I took this semester (I just took it bc I had to), but Prof. Glaser created a productive class environment and I surprisingly enjoyed it in a lot of ways.",
    "I enjoyed English 126 very much. The reading list is good, though I personally thought it went downhill after Paradise Lost. I would gladly recommend it to a fellow student.",
    "Now that it's no longer required, I'm not quite sure how to recommend it. I certainly wouldn't have taken the 125\/126 sequence if I didn't think I had to, but ultimately I'm glad I did. I think it's worth it to have an understanding of the foundations of English literature.",
    "Probably not, I think that there are much better sections out there. I would recommend shopping around",
    "On the whole, I would highly recommend this course. The readings are wonderfuldo them, they are so good, don't skip any. Class discussion was really fun and Professor Glaser is very good at getting an interesting discussion going. I was intellectually engaged throughout this course and that, of course, made it very enjoyable. However, there was a lot of work (4 papers) and I didn't always know what Professor Glaser was looking for in these papers. Basically, I spent a lot of the first part of the course struggling to figure out what he wanted out of a paper. He didn't seem to like the paper-writing skills I'd developed in other classes, which was frustrating at first, but made me rethink what it means to write a good paper and made me try different styles than I'd tried before. Overall, I think this was a good experience for my writing. So yes, I would recommend this class definitely, but be prepared to put in a lot of time and intellectual commitment."
