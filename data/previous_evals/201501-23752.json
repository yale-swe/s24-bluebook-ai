    "Working on deliverables for a respected client and being able to add that experience to my CV.",
    "Working directly with clients is great, and working with teams offers a great chance to see issues from the perspectives of other disciplines.",
    "I thought the guest lectures went really well. It was great to have lectures about how environmental policy is made from professionals actually doing it out in the field. I also thought that having one class to compare and contrast project types and problems was useful, although given how different the project topics and scopes are, I don't know that we would need to have more than one.",
    "Josh and Dave were very helpful and went out of their way to answer any questions or concerns. This class was amazing!",

    "Excellent opportunity to work in a group and with a client. Allows students to apply useful skills and create a real work product.",

    "lecture topics sometimes not interesting or relevant. need a more diverse set of speakers. most came from nrdc. need a more diverse perspective on environmental issues.",
    "This may be beyond the control of the instructors, but, as with any class, some of the guest lecturers were hit or miss. It might also have been helpful to transfer the law overview part of the course into a short reading, so students would have more time to ask questions and take advantage of the expertise of the instructors during that section's class time.",

    "It was great to work with others, to share the work load, and improve upon one another's products.",
    "Advantages were that we could cover more ground on our research, disadvantages were that finding scheduled time that worked, and sticking with our timeline was difficult. Some people were more motivated than others to complete the deliverables.",

    "The same as all group work- nice to share ideas and work with a team, but often difficult to coordinate working schedules.",
    "I found it difficult to coordinate to meet.",
    "we were able to broaden our scope in our research because we had multiple people working on the same topic. hard to find a time to have weekly meetings with everyone's busy schedules.",
    "My group was actually just a two person team, and we worked very well together. The only disadvantage I would say was logistics (sometimes one person was traveling or had technical problems and the other had to account for that in his\/her work).",
    "Could be tough to coordinate schedules, and I wished we'd done a better job of taking advantage of each other's expertise. But working on a team was really valuable - apart from learning more about the topic we were working on, I learned a lot by simply watching different approaches to organizing work and interacting with our clients.",
    "Advantages - being able to split up the workload, having people with different backgrounds and experience helped to answer each others' questions. Disadvantages - so many hours spent emailing, waiting for other people to finish their part.",
    "I was very lucky to be in such an incredible group.",
    "It was great to collaborate with other students, given that they had other experiences and expertise.",
    "My group was all interested in the subject and everyone worked really hard on our project. I loved everyone in the group!",
    "Collaboration creates a more powerful work product. Organization and delegation are a challenge, but can be overcome with committed, diligent group members. I had a great experience with my group.",
    "Fortunately, my group was an excellent team. The discussions, difference of views, personal abilities and capabilities were a perfect mix. Great \"human quality\" of the team.",

You learn critical skills that are not necessarily offered in other courses, including client interaction, group collaboration, legal writing\/research, etc. The clinic also allows you to create a real work product at the end of the semester, which can greatly enhance your resume. Be sure to check in regularly with your client to get feedback pertaining to your deliverable, and be clear about team responsibilities early on.",
