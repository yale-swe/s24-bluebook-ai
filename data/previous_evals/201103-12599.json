    "Bah. If you're considering taking this class, it's because you're a math major, so you know what you're getting yourself into with Yale's math department. The professor walks in on the first day of class, announces the topic, then assigns you subtopics, which you lecture on. Stressful in the days leading up to your lectures, otherwise boring as all get out. Miserable experience, but you do get a degree at the end of it. *shrug*",
    "Each student in the class gives a series of presentations on a topic that they learn themselves. It is very interesting and you get a lot out of the process of teaching yourself a mathematical topic and then lecturing about it. It is a lot of work to prepare for the presentations but during the times when you are not preparing for your presentation, it is no work at all.",
    "If you're a math major, you pretty much have to take it. Professor Frenkel is really awesome, so take it with him.",
    "Math 480 is a great course. Each student gave a series of lectures on a topic of his or her choice, and all of the lectures were very interesting. I would definitely recommend the class to another student. You will cover a lot of very interesting Mathematics that isn't covered in the standard Math major courses."
