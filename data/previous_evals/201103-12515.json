   "comments": [
    "I would not recommend this class to anyone except those who need it as a pre-requisite. I come away learning very little. Please spend your time on the better classes at Yale!",
    "Don't take it unless you have to. Not even for QR.",
    "If you have to take statistics, or if you like statistics then by all means take this course. If you want to take a class just for kicks or for fun, this is the wrong choice!",
    "Terrific class. JRS is relatively straight-forward and he's very funny. Make use of his office hours. As for GPW, you will be blown away by how much you learn. Just be careful not to fall behind...also review the lectures afterwards because that helps.",
    "i would recommend taking the first part of the course STAT100 if you have never taken stat before. it can get really bad if you fall behind. i don't recommend MCDB215 for MCDB majors because most of the second half seems geared towards EEB applications. there is a lot of useful information, but only take it if you're prepared for very disorganized teaching.",
    "I think the biology section is probably the section that teaches its students the most. It was like going to the dentist. I didn't enjoy it, but it was good for me. I learned information that was relevant to my major.",
    "TAKE A DIFFERENT SECTION IF AT ALL POSSIBLE. The first half of this course were taught by JRS, he is an engaging professor and even though the lecture is really large he does a good job of covering general statistics (maybe a little to quickly), but I felt comfortable with the material. For the second half, with gunter wagner, the material was interesting but Gunter Wagner was extremely boring and dry and not helpful in explaining what would be covered on the test or providing practice examples. I liked the material but I basically ended up teaching the second half to myself and did not even need to go to lectures since they were completely not helpful at all.",
    "DO NOT TAKE IT UNLESS YOU HAVE TO. It's a badly taught class. And many students have already taken statistics in high school so you'd be at a disadvantage despite it being an intro course. Also the problem sets take forever to do. And not being able to download Minitab on your macbook is very inconvenient.",
    "Very useful introduction to statistics. If you plan on spending a lot of time reading (or writing) papers I would say that this class is a must.",
    "The first half is like all of the other classes: you learn some very basic stats skills. The second half is slightly more interesting to bio (but not premed) students. I personally did not enjoy this class because a) I did not take AP Stat and felt behind all the students who had and b) I often felt that formulas were being thrown at me without an explanation as to why they were important.",
    "I would not reccommend STAT 101 to anyone who does not either need it as a credit or truly enjoys statistics. It is very dry and challenging. The professor is hard to work with and does not give much helpful advice outside of lecture.",
    "If you should take it for your major, then this is a pretty painless way to do so.",
    "This is a good intro to statistics.",
    "Stats is a good core class to have to understand studies better, but this particular class could be a lot better. It's confusing to have two different professors as well with much different teaching styles."
