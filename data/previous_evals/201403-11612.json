   "comments": [
    "Excellent course; Melinda's expectations are very clear-cut. It's extremely organized and even though you may not learn THAT much content, you'll learn how to do a systematic literature review, which is a useful skill to have.",
    "This class was excellent! I found the content to be very interesting and class discussion was a low-pressure environment (no quizzes\/exams) so we were able to just learn for learning's sake. Writing a systematic review was difficult but Melinda was encouraging throughout the process and made it manageable.",
    "I loved it! I really liked being able to submit each part of the review for feedback (especially since this was the first of this type of assignment for me).",
    "Strengths are that it is discussion based, Melinda is flexible and engaging, and gives you the opportunity to apply classwork in discussion. No major weaknesses.",
    "Great overview of overweight\/obesity prevention and review of research methods. Perhaps be a bit more lenient with dates of turning in assignments.",
    "Strength - broad overview of different factors and treatments in obesity Weakness - preferred more in depth teaching regarding medications and surgical treatments",
    "This is a good course to learn about lifestyle interventions, the theory behind them, and epidemiologic challenges in conducting and interpreting studies. During the semester, deadlines for sections of our systematic review were pushed back, which made things at the semester more of a rush. I think sticking to the original schedule would have been more beneficial at the end of the semester.",
    "It was a great course. I learned alot about obesity and other issues.",
    "This course was great! I really liked that the course was structured around writing our own reviews of a topic of our choosing. I thought it was an efficient way to teach us this skill and to incorporate what we learned in class, helping to demonstrate the difficulties involved with conducting interventions for improving health.",
    "Awesome! Learned tons of useful information.",
    "It was a great course. I really liked doing a systematic review that was divided throughout the semester. By the end of the semester, we had written all the parts of our systematic reviews, with feedback given by the teacher, to put it all together with the corrections. The classes were very organized and clear. It was also great that we had external speakers which were wonderful!",
    "I would liked the course go more in depth about chronic illness related to obesity and to have done it in a more organized fashion. The lectures were interesting but I feel they were too broad and would have appreciated the incorporation of a more scientific approach to each of the diseases discussed. I agree that learning how to write a literature review is valuable but it seemed the class was almost entirely revolved around that rather than learning about obesity and chronic disease itself.",
    "I thought this was a very good course. I was able to focus on the areas that interested me most, and I really enjoyed the behavioral component. From that perspective, I think the course offers a different perspective than others at YSPH. Melinda was great and down to earth. I enjoyed learning about the systematic review process. I felt like my work was rewarded. The course readings were appropriate and a nice length, and i enjoyed working on the end product throughout the semester. I feel the final product was enhanced as a result, and it made finals less stressful.",
    "Excellent lectures by Professor Irwin, great guest lectures.",
    "What a huge area! But I felt the class did a good job of highlighting the most important things.",
    "The course provided a good introduction to the strengths and limitations of various obesity interventions. The systematic review assignment was difficult, but a good learning experience.",
    "The main strengths are that it covered a wide range of topics related to obesity and that it is designed in such a way that the students can learn to correctly interpret lifestyle interventions evidence. A weakness is that it includes a lot of readings and the content is overlapping in several of the readings. A better selection of the most relevant readings will improve the course."

    "Instructor: Melinda Liggett Irwin \u00a0Melinda is great! Wonderful personality and very invested in teaching and helping her students.",
    "Instructor: Melinda Liggett Irwin \u00a0Probably my favorite professor at YSPH. Engaging lecturer, very knowledgeable, extremely encouraging about assignments, and easy going (for example, lecture went over time one week so since she didn't get to fully explain an assignment she pushed it back another week).",
    "Instructor: Melinda Liggett Irwin \u00a0Melinda is great! Extremely knowledgable, fosters excellent conversations.",
    "Instructor: Melinda Liggett Irwin \u00a0Melinda is great! She gives each student the attention they need and makes class enjoyable.",
    "Instructor: Melinda Liggett Irwin \u00a0Expertise in the field; passionate about obesity prevention; good examples from her own interventions and the readings.",
    "Instructor: Melinda Liggett Irwin \u00a0Instructor was excellent, took time to explain issues while allowing students input. Needs no improvement",
    "Instructor: Melinda Liggett Irwin \u00a0Professor Irwin is very engaging and responsive to students. She promptly gives us feedback about our systematic reviews.",
    "Instructor: Melinda Liggett Irwin \u00a0Great professor. Makes the material relatable and breaks down complex concepts.",
    "Instructor: Melinda Liggett Irwin \u00a0Professor Irwin was very encouraging and effectively communicated the issues surrounding obesity interventions. She made herself available for help and guidance in writing our reviews, helping to make the assignment a rewarding and worthwhile experience.",
    "Instructor: Melinda Liggett Irwin \u00a0Best professor thus far. She is so attentive, smart, and understands us as students. Highly recommend.",
    "Instructor: Melinda Liggett Irwin \u00a0I really liked professor Irwin. She was always full of energy, very engaging with the students, and was always willing to answer all our questions. She was a great instructor!",
    "Instructor: Melinda Liggett Irwin \u00a0Great enthusiasm and anecdotes.",
    "Instructor: Melinda Liggett Irwin \u00a0Dr. Irwin is incredibly knowledgeable and I appreciated learning about her own research in the field. She can engage the students very well and is very accessible for guidance outside the classroom. I think her teaching could improve by including more guided lectures in specific NCDs each class and providing detailed information on each subject area. I appreciated that she allows for a wide range of topics for the final paper based on our individual interests and that she takes the time to get to know each student's topic for the lit review. However, I think she should include in-class lectures (or even optional classes at other times during the semester) to go how to effectively use PubMed and other publication libraries. I still don't feel very comfortable with it despite having written the review. It would also be helpful to go over Endnote in the class and to be required to use it for learning purposes in the final paper.",
    "Instructor: Melinda Liggett Irwin \u00a0Melinda is great. It is clear she is a pioneer in her field, and she made systematic reviews seem do-able and approachable. Her feedback was always pertinent and prompt, and her lectures were interesting. I thoroughly enjoyed the class. I can't think of many other classes I'd be willing to attend at 8 AM!",
    "Instructor: Melinda Liggett Irwin \u00a0Dr. Irwin is a great professor! She made me feel extremely comfortable in class and her enthusiasm for the subject is obvious.",
    "Instructor: Melinda Liggett Irwin \u00a0She was very energetic and she was always willing to answer questions and provide examples."

   "comments": [
    "Great course -- you may not learn a lot of content but you definitely get skills in doing a systematic literature review.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to another student. Not only is the subject matter interesting, but it is presented well with very relevant readings assigned. Going through the process of writing a systematic review was a good learning experience of how to critique studies and learn about effectiveness of prevention interventions.",
    "It's a great class to learn more about obesity from different perspectives and a great way to experience the process of writing a systematic review.",
    "It is a lecture and discussion based class with the opportunity for you to explore what interests you in obesity prevention.",
    "I would recommend taking this course during the first year of the MPH program. For second years, some of the methods learned in class can be a bit basic for others who are also taking the Evidence Based Health class.",
    "Great course. Earlier in the morning so it forces you to get up. Learn tangible skills with systematic review assignment. Definitely recommend it.",
    "This course provided a great look at how we currently conduct obesity and lifestyle interventions and the issues that surround these trials. The highlight of the course was writing our own reviews of a specific intervention, which was the the most engaging and fulfilling assignment I had all semester.",
    "If you are interested in learning about a major PH problem AND improve skills in writing, this is the course for you",
    "This course talks about obesity, the different causes, and the different existing interventions to tackle this epidemic. I would highly recommend this course to another student, because not only do you learn about one of the biggest and most important public health issues, but you also learn how to write a systematic review, which is fundamental to a public health professional.",
    "In this course, you mainly learn how to write a systematic review and gain a broad overview of obesity and weight-related diseases. However, I don't feel like I gained more in this class than I could have in the combination of a few other classes as YSPH such as the Nutrition & Chronic Disease course or the Maternal Child Public Health course. The workload in this class is very doable though which was really appreciated throughout the semester. There are just a couple of writing assignments throughout (on top of the weekly reading) and Dr. Irwin does a good job helping you to prepare for the final paper by having each section due at different times throughout the semester. I would recommend this course to someone who needs to take CDE elective and already has a heavy course load but not to someone who is looking to work hard and gain a lot in return.",
    "Great course for those interested in obesity \/ systematic reviews. Offers behavioral \/ exercise component to health that isn't a major component in other YSPH classes. Working on final project throughout the semester is nice, and your hard work will be rewarded.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student with an interest in this topic.",
    "This course covers a wide range of topics related to obesity and helps to understand how to interpret the evidence from lifestyle interventions."
