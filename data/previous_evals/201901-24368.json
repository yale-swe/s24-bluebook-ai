    "I learned how to use a political ecology lens to analyze environmental and social issues.",
    "Learned the vocabulary to describe environmental injustice.",
    "various critical skills for identifying the numerous key themes and lessons of political ecology in the everyday, in my career, and in analysis of other texts and research. knowledge about the development of the field of political ecology, its foundations, and possible future directions. substantive knowledge about tropical forest restoration and ecology. amazing diverse insights from how political ecology theory translates (or cannot translate) into practice from the field trip and from hearing the teaching staff\/other students' experiences.",
    "Many! including critical thinking and questioning the purpose of environmental, conservation, and development work . The class also made me reflect on my own work and approach to environmental-problem solving.",
    "This course helped acquired analytical skills, provided me with understanding the fundamentals of political ecology. It made me reflect on my past action taken in my career. It has provided me with skills that will be helpful in decision making and problem-solving.",
    "Sharpened my understanding of political ecology. I came in with some background, but this class really helped ground my understanding with definitions and clear examples. I also gained some important tools that I hope to use in my future career, such as communicating broadly with stakeholders; look for bias in conclusions from government, NGO, or community groups; knowing that it is dangerous and reductive to assume groups of people (governments, NGOs, or communities) are homogeneous in their goals; to arrest judgement; dig deep for context; and how to scrutinize documents for assumptions."

   "comments": [
    "Theories and lessons could have been explained better. Students did most of the teaching which means I didnt learn very much. Discussions where not moderated very well and many students shared their thoughts on theories that still remain a mystery to me. This class could have done a lot more to engage in political ecology case studies. I didnt learn as much as I wish I did.",
    "strengths: information covered, useful textbook and excellent selected readings, discussions tended to be interesting, attempt to apply to real world with focus on ELTI, amazing instructors, field trip (field trip feedback already covered in class discussion - overall, a really worthwhile and insightful experience) weaknesses: poorly organized overall and terribly structured class time, ELTI readings not impactful - never had enough time to apply theory into practice - feel like we heard the same stories over and over again and only had five minutes to give our opinion and think about ways forward Would have liked more lectures from the professor. student run discussions are valuable for those preparing, but not always that fruitful. Maybe have students prepare series of questions, but leave summarizing and lecturing to the professor. OR eliminate the summarizing and lecturing and assume that students have done the work and put in the time. Don't be so flexible with expectations - it takes away from the experience for those of us who are hoping for a rigorous experience. First 2\/3 of semester should be spent on political ecology and the assigned texts. last 1\/3 of semester should be spent applying framework and theory to case of ELTI. all final projects should be related to ELTI or summer research and be framed in a way that will have real impact for the organization. Like the Qs that we answered upon returning from Panama. Make it a grad school course - just require everyone to participate the whole time.",
    "The course is intense but worth it!",
    "Strength: the field trip was great. I thought the itinerary was very thoughtful and well-structured. Each day built on the previous day's learnings. Perhaps we could have added an extra day and spread out the activities a little more. Strength: the mixed grad and undergrad student makeup. I loved hearing what the undergrads thought--and was very impressed with what they had to say! Weakness: the structure of the class time. After the two hours of student presentations and discussions, we would take what was supposed to be a five minute break. Usually it was more like ten minutes, and the discussion after that break was usually kind of dull and limp. I think it'd be better to have two class meetings: the grad-undergrad class earlier in the week, and the grad-only class later in the week. This would give the grad students opportunity to discuss the practical case study (ELTI) more in depth, and more time to do the grad-only readings. Weakness: Student presentations were often too long, or too focused on the reading. Perhaps the instructors could make student presentations time-limited, and also make sure that each week has graduate and undergrad students leading class discussion. I noticed that weeks led by just undergrad students tended to focus more tightly on just the readings. Weakness: It'd be nice to have fewer written assignments, or at least different types of written assignments. Sometimes I just didn't have much to say about the week's reading--but those weeks were when I learned more from discussion and fellow students. An example of a different type of assignment could be a brief political ecology analysis of a project or case study selected by the instructors. Weakness: I sometimes detected a reticence to speak from students. Amity did try to address this by inviting students who hadn't spoken yet to speak up in the final minutes of class. But when discussing such weighty and sensitive topics like colonialism, indigeneity, or environmental justice, maybe this shyness is borne from fear of judgement. I know I experienced this from time to time: what if I used the wrong term, or said something that accidentally offended someone? Maybe establishing class norms at the beginning of the term could be a way around this. \"Assume good intentions,\" or \"Have patience and compassion when responding to other\" are examples that come to mind."

    "There needs to be better coordination in scheduling the grad part of the class and the undergrad part of the class. It was nice having different perspectives but distracting with two different sections where not everyone attended both.",
    "Be ready to do a lot of learning on your own. Very interesting subject, could be taught better",
    "be patient - it pays off in the end. take this course. be open to critique, and remember that nothing is personal - it is designed to get you thinking critically about your position, the impact you intend to make with your work, and the situation of your field within the broader scope of history and power. useful for anyone including scientists, foresters, social scientists, historians, and more.",
    "I highly recommend the class",
    "Be patient and kind with yourself, and your fellow students. Dedicate at least 4 hours a week to do the readings for this class."
