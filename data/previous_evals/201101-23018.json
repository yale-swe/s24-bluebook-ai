   "comments": [
    "It's not a lot of work. The assignments for each class don't take a lot of time, and it's easy to get by without doing the reading. I don't think it was worthwhile. I didn't really learn a lot, but it was definitely an easy credit.",
    "Great course, interesting and fun. There are writing assignments due each class, but they take about 30 mins at most to complete. Carreras is really a great professor. I would definitely recommend this class.",
    "This class appeals to a specific audience: those that are interested in the medical professions. However, I would still recommend this course to non-pre-meds just because the course is taught like an introductory anatomy course, and I would have gotten twice as much out of the course had I not already known much of the biology. It is a great class, and if you expect to use Spanish in a medical context, it is essential.",
    "good L5 if you r looking to chill.",
    "Yes, take this class. The material is definitely useful if you are a premed. Although, it will not improve your spanish, it is an easy A.",
    "Yes, definitely, even if you are only remotely interested in the material",
    "The class is interesting and not that difficult. I would recommend it as fulfilling the language requirement.",
    "I absolutely would! Although it is at 9 in the morning, it's so worth it. The class is a lot of fun and a non-stressful was to start the day.",
    "I would recommend it because the subject matter is very interesting and it is a good L5 class to take for pre-med students.",
    "It's an excellent class, you will gain a lot of confidence and feel better prepared for Spanish conversations about medicine related topics.",
    "Great class on the basics of medicine taught in Castellano. Although you do not have to enter the class being an expert, or being L5 in every aspect, be prepared to apply the effort, and you will most certainly succeed.",
    "Sure, if it's applicable or interesting for you. It was not my favorite class, but Professor Carreras is really sweet and classes often include videos and songs. It felt slightly disorganized at times, especially when Prof Carreras is writing on the blackboard.",
    "It's a great L5 that isn't stressful and is relatively interesting.",
    "I never understood what people meant by \"a good fifth class\" until I took this course. I took this course very seriously at the beginning but then saw that most people did not and started slacking a bit. I would recommend this class because it's interesting and a good way to keep up with your Spanish.",
    "I definitely loved this class. Profesora Carreras is a riot, and she loves to get to know us too. The class could be useful if I intended to practice medicine in an urban area--or anywhere at all. But even though I'm not, it was still generally interesting and a lot of fun.",
    "Carerras is great and so so friendly. It's painless and easy, but don't expect to learn anything or any get better at Spanish. You just might get worse."
