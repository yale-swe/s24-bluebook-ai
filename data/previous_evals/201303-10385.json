    "This course was an intense seminar on modern Russian works of literature. It was well-led, well-planned, and did not involve too much writing (5 short essays and a final paper). DO NOT fall behind on the readings, but if your'e committed to the work you will get so much out of it. We had a great group dynamic, so that helped of course.",
    "I would summarize it as basically a class in which you discuss Russian literature with one another and sharpen your literary analysis skills through essays. I would recommend it to students who are specifically avid readers; I wouldn't suggest it to someone who does not spend a lot of time reading or thinking about literature.",
    "Take this course if you want a strong introduction to literary analysis and really, really love Russian literature.",
    "The course is great if you are extremely interested in Russian fiction or have a background n it. If you are just interested in exploring the subject matter, it may not be for you.",
    "I loved this class; if you have any interest in Russian literature (or just great literature in general), take this class! Professor Alexandrov is brilliant and wonderful at helping you extract meaning from the novels. The books are engaging and, with the exception of Crime and Punishment, not the well-known Russian novels that everyone knows about, so you'll get to explore a quirky, lesser-known, but still incredible side of Russian fiction. The seminar style is perfect, and I just thoroughly enjoyed reading the books. I also improved my essay-writing, because Professor Alexandrov is big on concision and clarity.",
    "Absolutely recommend. Stellar works (where else would you read Bely?), incredible instructor, an open and accessible discussion setting.",
    "It has a very heavy workload with stiff grading but if you are interested in Russian Literature there is no better class to take.",
    "Read awesome pieces of Russian literature and analyze the relationship between humans and the divine. I would recommend the books we read but probably not the class",
    "This was my top choice freshman seminar and was so happy to take it. Read some incredible books, thought about them in atypical ways, made some amazing friends. Professor Alexandrov focuses on basing analysis in the text, which is refreshing compared to a lot of literature discussion classes that can spiral into BS. The divine and human theme is very relevant. This isn't just a survey of Russian literature, but a very intentional reading of it with those themes in mind. That helps make discussion very productive since we're all focused on the some very important ideas from the text.It is a lot of reading, but if you like literature (esp. Russin) and are interested in religious\/spiritual\/cosmic ideas it's well worth it.",
    "A great class on some of the best Russian literature. You will learn a lot about not only Russian ideology (which is just fascinating) but also how to read and write about literature in general. The professor is brilliant. His insights on Russian literature and literary theory are like no other. Although I didn't agree with all of his arguments at the beginning, I have to say that he always managed to convince me at the end and I really do appreciate the new perspectives he introduced us. I would definitely want to take more classes on Russian lit in the future.",
    "Definitely take this class. The novels we read are super interesting and span across several periods of Russian Literature, and Prof Alexandrov REALLY knows his stuff on this novels. You won't be disappointed... If you give them the time they deserve, the readings can be really challenging to the way you view the world - and you'll learn a lot about writing in the process."
