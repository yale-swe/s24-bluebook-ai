    "It is hard.",
    "Just take it. Its amazing",
    "This course is not an easy class. If you put the work in you'll learn a lot. If you don't put the work in your grade will suffer. The professors and department is phenomenal and is very supportive. It's a great class and the content is entertaining.",
    "I probably would not recommend it for students that have had previous experiences learning languages because it approaches it from a different perspective that can be hard for those that have already learned to learn languages in another manner. However, I would summarize it as a good introduction to the French language.",
    "This course is a moderately demanding introduction to french (1.5 credits of work). The \"Capretz\" immersion method helped me develop a more intuitive command of the language. I would recommend this course.",
    "take it, quality learning",
    "I would definitely recommend this course since it teaches you a lot of French in so little time, and that too in quite an entertaining manner."
