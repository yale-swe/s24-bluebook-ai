    "The skills I gained were quite clear because I started the semester as a complete beginner. Now I am able to speak a fair amount of french and write it even better.",

    "I learned more French than I could have ever hoped to learn in just a few months.",
    "This course gave me a solid foundation in basic French grammar and vocabulary.",
    "My professor was wonderful.",
    "I learned French",
    "At the end of the semester I was surprised as to how much French I learned. You learn basic and intermediate grammar and a wide range of vocabulary through the French in Action method.",
    "I learned not only the language but a lot about the French culture through the French in Action series. I learned probably more French in this semester than I did with Spanish in three years in high school.",
    "I learned a significant amount of French in one semester."

    "I think a weakness was that not everything built on one another so it was easy to forget some stuff you learned.",
    "French In Action can seem outdated and sexist at times, but it is nonetheless an effective method of learning French.",
    "That this course occurs daily means students are constantly able to practice and hone their language skills.",
    "I like the class. But the work is too much.",
    "It was very intensive, which was good, but someone's too intensive",
    "There is a very strong structure behind this course. I find the \"French in Action\" method to be very successful."

    "I would recommend this course if you REALLY want to learn French. It is A LOT of work. That said, you will learn more than you could imagine learning in just a few months.",
    "Absolutely recommend this course to anybody who wishes to learn French. The French department at Yale really is fantastic.",
    "Absolutely, but be prepared for lots of work.",
    "I would if someone was very interested in learning French, but not someone looking for a walk in the park",
    "Yes! Amazing teacher- Prof. Carole Delaitre",
    "If you are interested in learning French, I would highly recommend taking this course."
