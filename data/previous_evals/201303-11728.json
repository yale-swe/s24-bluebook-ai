    "This class is jewel! It mixes the practical of West African dance with the theory of African dance. It is physically demanding and intellectually exhilarating! However, it is physically demanding! Be prepared to sweat!",
    "An amazing class. Take it if you have the chance.",
    "Take this class.",
    "AbsolutelyYou burn calories, have fun, and earn credits at the same time :). Find me a better class...",
    "yes take this class",
    "What i appreciated most about this class was that it was unconventional. We did a lot of actual dancing, which I thought helped a lot with learning about West African dance without it seeming boring and abstract. We watched films and learnt a lot from the professor about dance through his own experience. Most classes at Yale challenge you only academically. This class was n opportunity to learn something different, still pretty challenging, and enjoy it. Also, the professor is really patient and despite it being my first time dancing, I eventually learnt the steps.",
    "Totally recommend the class. Very fun!!",
    "AMAZING CLASS. I had no previous dance experience before this class (except at parties). The professor is an incredible dancer and teacher - he helped me to tap into a side of myself I hadn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t seen before.",
    "I would totally recommend this class! It was a blast and I learned a lot.",
    "Great class for anyone who wants to switch up their normal schedule and learn about something new in a different way than any other class at Yale is taught. Also no homework on a day-to-day basis so even though you meet for almost 4 hours every week you don't feel like your time is being overused"
