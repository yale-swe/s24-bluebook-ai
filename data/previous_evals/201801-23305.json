   "comments": [
    "I learned about various microbiology laboratory protocols, such as cross-streaking, sterile technique, spot tests, streaking for bacterial isolation and soft agar overlay plating. More importantly, though, I learned how to create an independent project and follow it through from start to finish.",
    "This course taught me the techniques and research mentality necessary to pursue research on bacteriophage.",
    "I learned a lot of basic science skills. I also learned how to develop and carry out my own research project. Finally, I learned how to create and give a poster presentation.",
    "I gained a lot of experience with microbiological lab techniques, a lot of knowledge about how bacteriophage function, and a lot of insight into experimental design in the evolutionary context.",
    "This course taught me almost everything I know about research. I learned fundamental research approaches in microbiology (pipetting, cross-streaks, spot tests, soft agar overlays...) but also much about the thinking process behind the research. I learned to lead an independent research project by conducting experiments I designed, and learned to critically discuss research and give feedback to other students. I learned to think more critically in analyzing and interpreting results, and how these correlate within the much bigger picture of evolutionary biology.",
    "I learned lab skills, how to conduct my own project, etc. It was very useful to build skills if you have never worked in a lab before, or if you want to work on your own research project.",
    "Overview of bacteriophages, basic microbial lab techniques, and most importantly, valuable experience in running my own independent research project."

   "comments": [
    "This course was fantastic. It was well organized, and all the students got a ton of attention and feedback. The learning process was very personalized, so I felt like I chose exactly what I wanted to get out of the course.",
    "The course was well structured so that we could learn techniques and background knowledge in the first half and then be able to conduct independent research in the second half.",
    "This course is amazing.",
    "I thought this course was structured very well. The combination of individualized instruction, guided independent research, and whole class projects made for a great learning environment.",
    "This course was incredibly well organized and structured. The weekly assignments at the beginning of the semester introduced us to the fundamentals of phages and bacteria, and progressively delved us deeper into scientific research and publications. I also loved that the class was a combination of a traditional classroom and a research lab. We not only learned a lot of content, but also had lots of choice and attention in carrying out our independent research projects. Although it was a bit short to carry out a research project in 4 or 5 lab classes, Dr. Burmeister and Mike definitely made it possible, and provided time outside of the lab period to work on our projects if necessary. Overall, it was a remarkable learning experience.",
    "Maybe spend more time on the research project itself.",
    "Amazing - small class with two instructors, the layout of the first 1\/2 of the semester focused on developing skills and learning about phages, and the second half dedicated to research - everything about this class worked extremely well. Homework assignments were always manageable and valuable, never felt like busywork. The final project, culminating in poster presentations, was unbelievably rewarding. No weaknesses that I can think of."

   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. I looked forward to going to class every week, and I almost always wanted to stay late and go to extra office hours with Dr. Burmeister. All of my classmates got really invested in their projects, and I had an awesome time learning from them. This is an amazing introduction to evolutionary biology.",
    "This is an amazing course. The whole class was very engaged because no one was taking it out of necessity, only out of interest. Dr. Burmeister gives you everything you need to get your feet wet in research, regardless of your previous experience. And the subject matter is very interesting. Take it!",
    "I would 100% recommend this course. This has been my favorite lab course Ive taken at Yale, as well as just one of my favorite courses in general. Ive learned more about being a scientist and about myself in this once a week course than I have in a lot of my courses. Honestly, more courses like this need to be developed.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone interested in viruses, or interested in gaining valuable lab and research skills in a low-stress environment.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student interested in learning the fundamentals of research, or any student looking for a great laboratory class in which they can lead an independent research project.",
    "Yes, it was a great experience. I learned a lot about science and whether it was something I wanted to pursue.",
    "AMAZING CLASS, 10\/10 would recommend. Dr. Burmeister is one of the best teachers I have had at Yale - she is so passionate about her work and dedicated to every student's individual experience. I learned a fair amount about viruses, but more valuable were the lab skills I gained and the experience of conducting independent research. It is incredible that we managed to conduct projects of such depth in such a short amount of time, and I cannot emphasize enough how rewarding the end product is. Very manageable workload in the first half of the semester, then it becomes more of a time commitment as we get into research (often students would go in on Fridays as well for a few hours), but again so very worth it. It also offers research experience and mentorship at such a pivotal time in the Yale science education - take it first or second year if possible!"
