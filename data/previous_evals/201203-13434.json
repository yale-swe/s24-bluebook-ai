   "comments": [
    "A great second half of a must-take course! If you're remotely interested in social enterprise, the private sector's role in development, or poverty solutions, you should take this course!",
    "The second part of the yearlong course (meaning you either have to take this or cannot take this) is a good way to build off of the work from the summer and the themes introduced in the spring. Make sure to clarify everything along the way with Bo and your social enterprise and not leave things until the last minute. Also establish clearly as a team and with Bo, the responsibilities of each team member.",
    "A course about social enterprise in developing economies in which you get valuable and practical on-the-ground experience. Highly recommended. One of the best courses at Yale. The summer experience was the biggest value-add.",
    "No, I would not recommend this course. It is a big year-long commitment and the experience over the summer, for me, did not outweigh the costs of being in this class for a year. Professor Hopkins is very disorganized and there is not much of a class structure or a syllabus in the fall semester. There was not much guidance throughout the course and the expectations were always unclear. I learn from this course, but at the expense of much frustration and anxiety around the class. So, no I would say save yourself a year of frustration and feeling lost.",
    "Social Enterprises in Developing Countries is a course like few others at Yale and if you are a motivated independent learner it will definitely be one of the best classes you take at Yale. You will get the chance to learn the theory currently available in the field, spend a summer on the ground learning and seeing the challenges faced by a single social enterprise, and then writing a case study to help teach future students. The combination of theory, on-the-ground experience, and writing for others is a fantastic way to develop a strong understanding of the current challenges and opportunities when it comes to thinking about social enterprises.",
    "Although I was frustrated with some elements of the class, I would recommend it to anyone who wants to travel and have an amazing experience with a social enterprise. I also learned a lot about working independently in a team (i.e. without a professor's close supervision) and about working within a team on a new kind of project.",
    "take it. very worth it, but make sure you are fully committed to a year long class and that you choose your case study partners carefully.",
    "The perfect class for you if you are an adventurous, hands-on learner interested in social enterprises. The class will be a lot of work, but well worth the effort that you put in.",
    "Take this class. If you are interested in business, development, social change or both. It will break down any barriers you thought existed between these spheres and inspire you to embrace the \"other side\" of things.",
    "TAKE IT! there's nothing like it at Yale. It is an unmissable opportunity.",
    "This is the second semester of a two semester course. During the second semester you only meet as a class a few times and will mostly meet with the teacher with your group. The end product of the semester is the online case study. Also, it is a lot more work than it seems.",
    "Definitely! It's a hidden gem."
