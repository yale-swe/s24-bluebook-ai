    "A very broad look at a lot of nanomaterial applications but, given the student-led nature of the course, you could really personalize the topics\/direction of the course. The project was a really fun-- although challenging!-- way to integrate classroom academic knowledge into hands on skills development\/relation to current research. Would definitely recommend!",
