    "It can be a tough class but if you study it is fine. Very difficult to earn an A though, you really have to slay a couple exams, and they are designed to be tough to ace.",
    "This class is very good at describing and teaching Spanish. I would definitely recommend this class. It's informative and very well planned.",
    "I would recommend L2 Spanish as a continuation of L1... Most people are taking this class to fulfill their language requirement, but it's actually an enjoyable class and the workload isn't too bad. Professor Garcia is great if you can get into her section!",
    "Really good language course. Take this class!",
    "Nothing outstanding, but it's not monotonous (as it could be, meeting every day). I enjoyed it for the most part and liked how we switched up materials (short readings, long readings, songs, presentations, the movie at the end). You really get out what you put in.",
    "Spanish 120 is a lot of work. Professor Garcia is a good teacher, but very strict. Other teachers are easier and more relaxed, but you won't learn as much. If you don't want to work hard, or want to mess around, don't take spanish with Professor Garcia.",
    "Yes! its absolutely necessary if you want to learn the language."
