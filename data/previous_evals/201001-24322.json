   "comments": [
    "I wouldn't have them take it if they just wanted a fun freshman seminar. You don't really get to meet any of the other students and it doesn't foster a sense of unity in the class. Only take the class if you are really really interested in animation and somewhat OK with science and math.",
    "CPSC 079 should really be called \"Intro to Pixar.\" It really highlights all of the elements we have come to enjoy on the silver screen, and it's fascinating to learn how to put those elements together. Even though you only learn the basics and there are no higher-level courses to follow it, CPSC 079 is a fantastic course to explore one's own creativity with computers and technology.",
    "definitely recommend, but make sure youre interested in animation",
    "mathematics behind animation and you use Maya a lot. The very beginning and the end are fun\/cool.If you like computers and math take it.If you like math take calculus.If you like neither of the above, stop reading this, return to course catalog",
    "Interesting material, if a little too technical at times. Quizzes are manageable because she lets you use notes. The final project is really cool. Relatively light on math and a good way to fulfill a QR.",
    "I loved this course! If you want to learn how to design in 3D, how to animate characters, or just play around with creating realistic scenes on a computer, take the course. It is taught very well, tons of office hours, and just the right work load. I highly recommend it - I had very high expectations and it lived up to them, if not surpassed them!",
    "Yes, great class, especially if you wanted to learn something new.",
    "The final project was very fun to do. The psets and quizzes are very easy as long as you review the material and create a good \"cheat-sheet\" (which they allow). Many people seem to take this class to get an easy QR requirement.",
    "This class was very different from my other ones because of its subject matter and because of how actually make something that you like at the end. Every week there is a lecture and lab day, with lecture being more dry and lab being more fun. It's really rewarding to see what you can make in Maya, though the program takes some getting used to. Overall, I loved this class because I became really passionate about my final project and enjoyed playing with different things on Maya, even though I'd never used it before in my life. I would recommend this course to someone who is interested in how3D computer graphics works.",
    "I liked this class a lot. Sometimes the math concepts we learned were a bit sporadic and random, but using Maya is a lot of fun. It's a good way to get a QR in an artistic way. There are only two tests and a final project (an animated movie which is actually quite fun to make), and the problem sets are very manageable.",
    "This is a great course for someone interested in learning to use Maya and a little bit about the technical side of digital animation. It isn't too difficult, just be prepared to put in a couple of hours each week in the computer lab -- but the work is enjoyable and even artistically pleasing.",
    "yes. take it, very interesting, fun and informative, have a far greater understanding about the visuals and animations i see in movies and tv and video games.also very easy class if you have the extra time for the homeworks which are not *too* hard, but time consuming.if you are taking for QR (i wasn't), the math side is very light and one of the easiest you can find.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student who is looking for a fun freshman seminar. This course required going to thecomputer lab to complete the psets which was a little inconvenient and some psets were math intensive. However, having taken the course I feel that I have learned a lot about both how to create computer graphics and also how to analyze or evaluate computer generated images that I see.",
    "You make 3D graphics animations. It's amazing.",
    "The class was not a lot of work and was interesting.",
    "It is not a seminar inthe strictest sense, because 1\/3 of the course are lectures. It is not a graphic design course, because you don't learn how to produce professional, photorealistic 3D models and animations. It is not a computer science course, because the assignments are not quite as rigorous. That said, it is fun course packed with interesting material in computer graphics. It is a course where you learn-roughly-what goes on underneath those button-filled interfaces.If you're a graphic designer with previous experience, you will learn some math. If you're a programmer or computer scientist, you will see where and how math is applied in the 3D industry (though I'd advise you to nab Maya, buy the textbook, and fiddle around with it on your own time instead of taking the class). If you've never used Maya before, you will learn just how frustrating it is to use. But through the frustration, you'll find yourself learning and making some pretty darn cool stuff. If you are considering the Computing and the Arts major (Art track), this is probably the closest intro interdisciplinary course. You'll briefly skim over graphics, graphical storage, and GUIs. It won't be enough to convince you to pick the major (or go into graphics), but more likely than not it'll make you interested and a little curious. With such a broad (albiet shallow) survey of topics, you will have a rough idea where you might want to head."
