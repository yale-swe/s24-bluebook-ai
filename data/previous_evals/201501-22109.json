    "Near-weekly coverage of student scripts, write a 20-30 pager of your own. Film a scene from your script.",
    "Yes I would recommend it for film majors",
    "if you want to force yourself to write under academic deadlines, take the course, but don't expect to learn how to write beyond the format of a screenplay",
    "More self-directed than introplan ahead!",
    "You have to take this if you want to take advanced senior thesis. Don't take it if you don't plan on writing a feature, though. It's good practice, good to meet other film studies majors, and fun to listen to Marc every week, but there's not really too much to gain if you've taken intro already. Not too substantive, but also a ton of work. Filming and editing a scene feels like a massive waste of time and doesn't help your writing at all, and a 30 page screenplay is a lot of pages. Plus, writing coverage for everyone else takes up more time than you'd expect. A lot of work and not too much to gain, but fun if you know you want to be writing as many screenplays as you can here at Yale. Don't take if you just think a screenwriting class would be fun. Marc expects this to be your dream and you won't gain too much from the class if it's not.",
    "Intermediate screenwriting is a chill class that allows you to experiment creatively."
