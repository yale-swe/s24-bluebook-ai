    "I think it's a very specific subject and I think if you haven't taken a Sociology and\/or Middle Eastern course before, you might be really lost (even with the readings). It was great for me because I'm very interested in the topic and enjoyed the small class size for intimate discussion.",
    "A solid course. I definitely got a complete sense for the main theoretical axes about nationalism and got to learn some good stuff about each of the nations in the case studies. I now have solid personal opinions about \"what is a nation,\" which is always fun.The case studies might have been more interesting if the readings dealt with more contemporary issues-- the readings seem to focus so heavily on \"the interwar period.\" Which makes sense as that's when a lot of these nations came to be. But it also meant that sometimes class was a bit dry. It's not like I left seminar with my head spinning from some radical new revelation which changed my world view.In general I'm definitely glad I took the course and came away with some great new perspective. I would recommend it to someone who is interested in learning about the Middle East and has not already studied nationalism theory.",
    "I would recommend the class. There's a good mix of nationalism theory, themes and case studies. I took it because I'm a sociology major interested in nationalism, and I wanted to learn more about another region. Other people with a lot of experience in the region took it as an MMES class without a background in theory. Prof Wyrtzen is great, and I enjoyed it.",
    "Great course. The first two sections (nationalism and then arab nationalism) of the course provide an excellent backing for great discussion, particularly in the last third of the course. Smart, nice professor leads good discussions--I'd recommend it.",
    "I would definitely recommend the class. Not too hard, and you learn a lot. Professor Wyrtzen is great!",
    "Nationalism was a fine class. It's divded into three parts: the first you learn generally about nationalism theory, the second about regional issue relating to nationalism, and the final part you synthesize what you learned and apply it to country case studies. Generally the course syllabus was well designed if lagging at times. However, I found the papers really helpful. They really brought together what I learned about thought about nationalism. There are two 5 page papers and a final 15-page research paper and no reading responses. Wyrtzen is good but can be unfocused. I hope that in future semesters he will have general discussions about the week's topic, as opposed to only dealing with the papers we covered specifically. Students would be much more interested to do the readings well if the syllabus was more connected with current events. Why are we reading about nationalism in the 1930's in Iraq, when it is such a problem there today and so much has been written about it? Also, while I have not seen my final grade, Wyrtzen seems to be generally an easy grader if you do a compentent level of work.",
    "YES. Great compare-contrast class, excellent blend of theory and specific cases."
