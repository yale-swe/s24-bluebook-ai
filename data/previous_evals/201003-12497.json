    "Not as cool as the title sounds, becomes mundane very quickly and less enjoyable as time passes.",
    "If you're in a non-Math related major don't expect to come out of this class with an A (I know of 2 non-Math majors who dropped out halfway through). The difficulty level steadily but very surely increases throughout the entire semester, so even if the first few classes seem really easy don't be fooled. And the fact that the problem sets don't mirror the work in class doesn't help, nor does the fact that the second half of the material doesn't refer to a textbook.Other than that, the material is extremely interesting and formal proofs aren't required, which allows you to cover a lot of ground without feeling pressured by technicalities.",
    "Math 228 was a very interesting class. It investigates a bunch of geometric topics using transformations, starting with the Euclidean planes and then extending the concepts to other geometries. Problem sets were generally rather long, but with a few exceptions, they were very tolerable, and I feel they helped me improve my mathematical logic. You have to write a 5 page paper, and he gives almost no guidance, but I feel like he's also very flexible in what he expects. The tests are more than fair. Prof. Howe is an excellent teacher, and he is very thorough and clear. Be warned, though, he usually starts class a few minutes late and then ends 10-15 minutes late. One clAss, he went 24 minutes over. This class is definitely worth taking; note that it's only offered every other year, though.",
    "This course has great potential, but it got a bit jumbled and hasty after the first half \u0096 it became more of a survey of non-Euclidean geometries rather than an in-depth look. That is pretty much impossible, though, since it is simply too much stuff to teach in one semester. Howe sometimes went through the material at an insane pace. And what the evaluation from two years ago says is correct: Howe almost invariably goes over. Usually by ten minutes, sometimes longer. His record was 24 minutes, i.e. an extra 50% of class time on top. So, yeah do not take a course that is immediately after. Don\u0092t the wrong idea though \u0096 Howe is extremely nice, helpful, and funny. He loves the stuff he teaches and that definitely engaged the rest of the class. And the exams were absolutely fair.",
    "Euclid to Einstein reveals everything about geometry that your high school math teacher never told you. Well, okay, not everything---but there\u0092s a lot more to geometry than I ever realized, and it\u0092s fascinating. After going through Euclidean geometry from the perspective of its underlying symmetries, the course moves toward an exploration of non-Euclidean geometry and its application to Einstein\u0092s special theory of relativity. Along the way, you\u0092ll prove some really beautiful theorems. I would recommend this course to absolutely everyone: If you haven\u0092t done math proofs before, it\u0092ll be tough at first, but I think this course is just about the best way to learn how to do proofs."
