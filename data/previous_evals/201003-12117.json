    "yes. everyone should be required to experience Mazzotta.",
    "If you enjoy the study of:-poetry-literature-religion-love-psychology-italian-italian culturethen this course is for you.",
    "The epitome of a hit-or-miss class. Sometimes, Mazzotta \u0097 who always speaks without notes \u0097 lectures brilliantly; sometimes, you feel like banging your head against the wall. However, if you want to learn about Dante from one of the greatest Dante scholars in the world, there's nobody else that understands Dante like Mazzotta.",
    "I would recommend the class. I didn't have the life-altering experience that others touted the class to be, but it was still enjoyable. I especially liked discussing Inferno and Purgatorio. I found Paradiso to be a bit dry. But Mazzotta's lecturing style will keep you interested anyway.",
    "Take this class before you leave Yale! Dante is hard, but the Comedy is beautiful and Mazzotta's lectures are inspiring and brilliant. This class is an Open Yale Course - so look it up and check out a lecture or two if you want to get an idea of his style (it's also a bonus to be able to catch a video of an old lecture if you're sick\/writing another paper or whatever during the afternoon). If you're willing to commit to unpacking a difficult text, then I'd give this class my highest recommendation. Even if Dante doesn't immediately appeal to you right now, you'll love it by the end of the semester, I promise!",
    "From the perspective of a freshman who selected this course based on scanning Open Yale Courses and thinking \"this could be cool,\" this class was actually surprisingly fulfilling. There were definitely times where I felt like some things were going over my head such as allusions to other readings (Aeneid, Aristotle&Plato stuff, etc.), but that's expected for someone coming into this class with such little peripheral reading. The class is mostly comprised of upper level English\/Lit majors, past-DS students, and even grad students, but DON'T LET THAT SCARE YOU! As a freshman I could totally comprehend (most) of the readings and the lectures (and I'm actually not a big lit person; this was my only non-math\/sci class). But even the other people in my section had some problems with understanding them, so you are never alone! No one understands Dante perfectly. Also, the workload is definitely manageable -- the 3ish required cantos per week never seemed like too much. The paper may scare you, it was my first real \"college paper\" ever, but it's not that bad if you start relatively early and work through it. Overall a great class and Prof. Mazzotta was AWESOME!",
    "Only if they love literature, Italian, and have an extensive background in Latin, Biblical, and Classical literature.",
    "In my opinion, this course did not live up to its past two years' reviews. Don't get me wrong, when it's good, it's really good, but when it's bad ... anyway, there were lectures that truly captivated me. these tended to be ones rooted in textual analysis and applied to Dante's background and pre-existing works. However, as we got away from Inferno and Purgatorio, and into Paradiso, the lectures turned into broad philosophical forums that sometimes seemed to have absolutely no relation to the text. The Comedy is great, especially when accompanied by rigorous textual analysis, but unfortunately, that wasn't always the case in this class because that's the risk you run when you have a professor who lectures from memory. I also think this course would be bettersuited for 50 minutes rather than 75. Mazzotta is one of the most renowned Dante scholars out there, and it was a real privilege to have a class with him. I just wish sometimes he'd focus more on the actual text as opposed to general commentary.",
    "You can't graduate from Yale without taking this class. Your education would be incomplete.",
    "Definitely a class to take at Yale. Dante is such a classic, and there is no better way to read the Comedy than with Professor Mazzotta. I never thought I would appreciate Dante so much.",
    "Strongly recommend.",
    "It's a great in depth reading of the Divine Comedy, which is one of the world's most beautiful and intellectually challenging works. Mazzotta is also rightly considered one of the world's foremost Dante scholars. The lectures can get a little tedious towards the end, but you will still learn a lot even if you space out a bit. The workload is fairly straightforward. Keep up with reading the poem so you can understand the lecture and identify quotations on the exams. Obviously, if you are a student of Italian, this course is something you shouldn't miss.",
    "Take this course-- it will change your perspective on poetry, the middle ages, and literature.",
    "YES! Best course I took at Yale. The workloadis very manageable. You read a few cantos a night, you take a final and midterm, and there is a final paper. A lot of fun and one of the BEST lectures you will ever get to sit in on. I am more than pleased that I took this course and wish I could take it again.",
    "I would very much recommend this class to other students. Professor Mazzotta is very knowledgeable and engaging - and really, you should be learning Dante from an Italian. The work load is very light. Generally you only read three or four cantos for each class. There's a midterm and a final and if you actually read the books and study a bit you'll do fine. They consist of passage identifications and short essays. There's one 8-10 page paper that you get to pick the topic for, so it's not that big a deal (but the course is very back loaded when it comes to work).Really, quite an enjoyable class and not very much work.",
    "Professor Mazzotta's lectures were to me what Virgil was to Dante. If you do not understand what I mean, then you should probably take this class. If you do, then you should still take it. It is rare to find a class that covers so much good philosophy and theology. Professor Mazzotta understands the context by which Dante was informed and fills us in. His analyses of the cantos are always thorough and satisfying, and all about the content. This is the type of class that will give you arthritis, because you are taking notes all of the time. A rare and inspiring gem. I am glad we went relatively slowly. Reading 3 or 4 cantos per class gave us the opportunity to learn about each of them in detail.",
    "It's fun to get to read Dante, and there's definitely more in these books than you could ever get to in a lifetime. But the class itself wasn't as good as I expected. They are almost too ambitious, and didn't always make the reading accessible to people who didn't already know everything about all the classical, christian, medieval, etc. sources.",
    "A semester with Dante and the best Dante Scholar and genius, Prof. Mazzotta.",
    "I would highly recommend it. Dante is so amazingly complex, and Mazzotta brings so much clarity to the readings. I feel like if you read Dante without Mazzotta you are losing really valuable insight. He is one of Yale's best resources of knowledge.",
    "ABSOLUTELY. This course is extraordinary. The material is incredible, and Professor Mazzotta's lectures illuminate the text and--I can almost guarantee--will seduce you as much as Dante's Francesca--just not in the same way. TAKE THIS COURSE; it will most likely significantly change your life.",
    "Yes. I would definitely recommend it.",
    "Take it. Mazzotta is incredibly enlightening and enthusiastic. He's got decades of Dante under his belt and will always have an insightful response to any questions you may have. The workload is very light (reading 3-4 cantos in detail with maybe a few more skimmed each session) and as far as tangible work, there's next to nothing besides coming to section with questions and the final paper. This class is a great way to really gain an understanding of the Comedy without the headache of frequent essays. DO IT.",
    "Take this class! You will love Professor Mazzotta. The Divine Comedy is not only great on its own but it will also help you understand all the literature that came after it. I would definitely recommend this class!",
    "Good class about Dante. The work is so good that this class is bound to be good, but Mazzotta's insights really add to the experience. He's one of the leaders of the field and it's an honor to be able to study under him.",
    "How can one summarize Dante in Translation? Wisdom, poetry, art, wisdom, suspense, an incredible journey sum up both the lectures and the Comedy itself. Professor Mazzotta is absolutely brilliant - his lectures, which (without notes!) consist of commenting on chunks of text that he reads aloud in English or Italian (\"listen to the music of my voice if you don't understand\"), not only help you also understand the complexity of the poem but also will provide you with profound insights into life. The class is structured very well - the pace is perfect, just 3-4 cantos per class, a midterm and final (both very fair), and a term paper on a topic of your choice (enjoy it!) For my section we also had to contribute weekly responses\/questions (150 word max). And basically, you need to read Dante at some point in your life. Dante was my favorite author in the Directed Studies syllabus, so I was thrilled to spend a semester studying his works. The poem and the class will make you a better person."
