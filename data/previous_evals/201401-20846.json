   "comments": [
    "Absolutely take this class! It isn't too much harder than ITAL110. In many ways it's easier. There are less grammar sections and the focus is more on beginning to read and immerse yourself in Italian culture. If you can definitely get Anna as a professor. She's the nicest and best professor I've had in college thus far. Overall a really great experience.",
    "Yes, Italian is awesome.",
    "Italian 120 is a continuation of the grammar from Italian 110, but at a slower pace. It is a great way to continue studying and refining your knowledge of the Italian language.",
    "Anna is a really great professor to take Italian 120 with. I would definitely recommend her.",
    "I would highly recommend it. If you find yourself interested in the language after L1, don't skip a beat, go right to L2. It moves fast but won't let anyone behind. You come out pleasantly surprised at how much you've learned.",
    "If you like Italian then you should take it.",
    "L2 with Anna was wonderful! She's so understanding and helpful. Tests were extremely fair, and she always made sure we'd thoroughly reviewed concepts before she tested us on them. She also did a lot to vary the activities we did in class -- I looked forward to attending every day because we truly had fun. If you take L2 with Anna you'll learn a lot of Italian in a low-stress environment, which I think is the way to go. Also, if you're lucky, you'll get to meet her adorable son and eat her delicious Italian cooking."
