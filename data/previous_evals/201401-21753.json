    "Art 237 is a medium format, film based photography class. Most of the time is spent printing in the darkroom, but the class also covers color film and scanning and digitally printing negatives. You are expected to shoot 40 rolls of film based on a project or interest and to be printing in the darkroom every week. The work load is slightly more than a regular Yale course, but it is definitely worth taking.",
    "If you're wanting to continue film photography and get into larger format films, then this is great.",
    "A good way to learn new methods, new cameras, and to push yourself beyond taking \"nice\" pictures - the class teaches you to have a critical eye towards the work you make."
