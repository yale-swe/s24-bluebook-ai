    "Learned more about the various aspects of informatics and the foundations of the field",
    "The class provided a lot of insight mostly on clinicial informatics. I was introduced to many of the associated concepts and ongoing challenges in the field.",
    "The course was a good overview of the history of computational biology and bioinformatics, with more emphasis on the informatics aspect.",
    "This course provided me with a nice survey towards informatics in the biomedical fields. The course offered in depth assessment on the implementation of EHRs and the processes that have been required to reach the current state of adoption. The select lectures on translational informatics were terrific.",
    "Knowledge about what is clinical informatics, what are the topics and problems in the field, and what kind of things we bioinformaticians can do about them."

   "comments": [
    "Readings are old. While this provides a good foundation, the course was not always able to go above and beyond the origins and foundation of the field. This course felt more like a history course at times. Outside presentations helped a great deal.",
    "It was a very manageable course, but I would have wanted to material to be a bit more challenging.",
    "Strength - good overview of clinical informatics Weakness - some redundancy between lectures Strength- lectures were designed with both clinicians and bioinformaticians in mind Weakness - but lectures they were mostly designed BY clinicians, which tilted the balance of discourse towards the clinical side Because CBB 740 is a required course for CBB students, there is a high bar for making the course relevant for bioinformatics students. The course is relevant for bioinformatics students but could be made even more so with a more even mix of clinical and bioinformatic lecturers (although I suppose this past term's imbalance may have reflected the sabbatical of a key CBB instructor)",
    "It is a rare situation where lectures spread across a set of lecturers can be cohesive. With the exception of the lecture on Red Hat, that was true of this course.",
    "Most of the time the course is about telling us what there is in the field. The rich and comprehensive introduction is its strength but lack of interaction may be its weakness."

   "comments": [
    "For someone new to one of the various aspects of informatics, this would be helpful. If you've had any experience in one of the various areas of informatics, this will feel like a survey course where you cover a number of topics, but gain no real depth of understanding about any topic.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to another student.",
    "There were a number of lectures where I remember wishing certain of my friends were in attendance for their benefit. Frequently, lectures did drag on, but with some patience there's lot to learn."
