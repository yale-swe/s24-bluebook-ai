    "Although somewhat disorganized, this course is good transition from MATH 120 to upper-level mathematics.",
    "Unless you love proofs, don't take this class. It's not worth it; take 222 instead if you need a linear algebra credit. On the other hand, if you can handle the proofs it should be easy to do well, since the class grade is based only on the midterms and final.",
    "It was an okay class. I think learning the material was very interesting, but I mostly learned it from resources not provided from the class because I couldn't understand it very well from how the teacher taught it. Obviously I haven't seen my grades yet, but perhaps you should look into taking the course Credit\/D and switching later. I think it'd be better to have the option of just getting credit for it rather than dropping the class, as about half of the original class did. Though I wouldn't say it was a fabulous class, I am glad for my experience with it. Oh, also, there are discussion sections that you vote on for a time; there should be two a week, and you should go whenever you can, I would say.",
    "Yes, I would. Math 225 is not bad like some previous reviews will say. The thing is, linear algebra is an incredibly important, fundamental step in one's studies of math\/physics\/etc. You have it to take it. Frankly, Math 225 is much better than Math 222 (this semester, according to many friends I have in that course, Math 222 was either a complete joke in one of the sections, or a very frustrating but still unproductive experience in the other). Math 225 is harder (it is proof based), but it was also my first proof-based math course and I never experienced some sudden, impossible \"difficulty\" resulting from having to suddenly know how to do proofs. Neither did anyone else I know. The textbook shows you proofs. Professor Garland shows you them, too. If you still don't know how to solve a problem, GO TO HIS OFFICE HOURS. I went to Professor Garland's office hours several times this semester, whenever I didn't know how to solve any of the homework problems; each time, he was incredibly helpful, clear and kind and I came away understanding deeply how to solve the problem. The exams were also very fair considering the difficulty of some of the material (the hardest stuff, like Jordan Normal forms or finding minimal polynomials id not even come up on the final). The homework is not mandatory, so the course was minimal in stress (homework was there for practice: still do all of it so you do well on exams). Lastly, the textbook is incredibly helpful and clear (I ended up reading the whole thing, and it made the lectures, some of which could be hard tofollow, all make sense). So in the end, you need to take Linear Algebra. In and of itself, linear algebra is a really amazing and beautiful field (which is why I personally liked the course). Take 225 to have a rigorous and strong introduction to the field in a course that is not too stressful and with kind and helpful instruction.",
    "Linear algebra and matrix theory.Describing (definitions), understanding (proofs) and using (application) abstract objects.If course isn't revised regularly, it becomes very difficult. Other wise, it isn't too hard."
