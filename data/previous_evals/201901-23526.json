    "I learned about how specifically parts of the legal system are flawed to allow for wrongful convictions, including eyewitness misidentifications, prosecutorial misconduct, false testimony, etc. I learned about what reforms have been proposed to fix these parts of the legal system, and how they are actually being implemented. I learned about what it means to be wrongfully convicted and how that affects a person's life. And I learned about what social factors (e.g. racial\/gender bias, use of media, etc.) contribute to these issues.",
    "I learned so much about the criminal justice system and how to critically think about institutional issues that effect many human lives. Through in depth readings, thoughtful discussions and critical writing analysis, I walked away with a cohesive idea of wrongful convictions."

   "comments": [
    "An amazing course! Very well organized and professor is really helpful in understanding more complex themes. The professor does a very good job of admitting students of different backgrounds to make the course really insightful!",
    "Strengths: You learn a lot about a really important issue in our society that rarely gets talked about. You also learn about what is being done to fix it (such as the Innocence Project) and are forced to think about how you, personally, can make a difference. The units are all well thought out and every meeting is partially led by a student so you get experience leading the discussion, as well as get to do creative activities thought up by your peers. Weaknesses: It is a 9:25am class on Friday. Also sometimes I felt like I didn't know enough about the legal system \/ wrongful convictions in general to participate in the discussion, whereas all my peers did seem to. So just be cautious that if this topic is completely new to you, you might have to do extra work to understand what's going on.",
    "The readings were insightful, conversation was eye-opening, the guest speakers were engaging, and having to write a final paper outline early on helped organize my ideas\/schedule",
    "I loved presentations and discussion leaders and the personal project. I also loved the option to participate in CTIP",
    "I loved that this course allowed students to explore wrongful convictions in a methodical and very practical way. I loved that there was the opportunity to do real work with the innocence project. Class discussions were interesting and everyone seemed really committed to the topic, even if they were coming at it from different angles. The only weakness I saw was that breaking weeks up by very specific topics sometimes took away from the big picture conversations. I wish we could have had fuller discussions of race\/gender\/sexuality in the context of the criminal justice system and personally found these class sessions to be a bit surface level compared to others I have had about these topics. I think this was due to the fact that people in the class all came from very different vantage points in these discussions, which was both an advantage and a disadvantage at times. I also wish we could have discussed more the significance of innocence based work in the context of larger conversations about the criminal justice system.",
    "It would be helpful if Dean P, lectured for a few minutes at the beginning of each seminar, just to ensure students were all on the same page. Other than that, I thought the class was phenomenal and really opened my eyes to some of the practices that were leading to wrongful convictions.",
    "This course only has strengths. The readings were just enough to keep you engaged and the following discussion was also very interesting. There was also not an overwhelmingly high workload which made the whole experience very worthwhile.",
    "this is such a great course - i cant even think of a weakness, other than i wish we had more time to discuss all of the facets of wrongful convictions."

    "YES! One of the best courses at Yale! Strongly recommend if you're interested in the criminal justice system, law and\/or reform.",
    "Yes! I really took a lot away from this class in terms of what wrongful convictions are and how detrimental they are to so many people's lives. This course is a very systematic look at wrongful convictions, but also every class period is mainly discussion and it nice to have a time just to debate ideas and learn from your peers. Also the final paper has deadlines throughout the entire second half of the course, so you have a very good sense of what you're writing about come reading period. And Dean P. is really knowledgeable about this stuff and good at making us reflect on all the things we're learning. I would definitely recommend this course.",
    "yes",
    "This was a fantastic course. Absolutely worth taking. My only two criticisms are that the readings were repetitive and didn't always lend themselves to discussion, and the expectations could have been clearer for the CTIP project.",
    "Absolutely",
    "Definitely! Everyone should know about this topic and just about the criminal justice system in general. Dean P is an amazing instructor, very caring and nice but also focused on student learning.",
    "Yes, I would absolutely recommend this course!! There are no flaws and you will probably come out a changed person.",
    "YES"
