    "An experience not to be missed. The second half of Studies in Grand Strategy is the only chance you will have at Yale to build teamwork, administrative leadership, and critical thinking of present-day issues in politics and international relations that are mandatory for success in the highest positions of power in American government and elsewhere. Take advantage of the out-of-class dinners and really pour yourself into the summer experience to get the most out of the class and to get to know your amazing classmates.",
    "yes. It's fun. It should be two credits though, or 1.5. I wrote a 28 pg paper, did two 2hour in class presentations, and spent 7:30am-5pm two consecutive Saturdays on this course."
