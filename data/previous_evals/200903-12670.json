    "Yes. On the whole, it makes you much more able to understand how contemporary music came to be and folk music's foundation, which everyone should know something about. Lots of thought provoking discussion and good books that you would be unlikely to read on your own.",
    "The course can be difficult for undergrads (as it is also listed for grad students). There is a lot of work, but for anyone who is interested in how music is studied, this class is a must.",
    "The class is more a lesson in how to talk about music than about any type of music in particular. I learned that \"vernacular\" encompasses a much wider array of styles than I initially thought, but the exposure to new genres is great. I would definitely take this class if you have any interest in seriously studying non-classical musics.",
    "Great class. If you want to learn about and discuss music that's not in the western classical tradition, this is the class for you. it's kind of an ethnomusicology class (music + race\/ethnicity\/class + history + politics) but don't let that intimidate you - i came to the class with only an enthusiasm for the topic and i didn't feel like anything was over my head. shop it first though - it may not be what you expect from reading the syllabus"
