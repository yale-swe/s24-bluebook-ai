    "I've always loved Jane Eyre, but this course was wonderful in helping me break down why exactly I loved it so much when put in the context of Austen and other women's novels that it influenced. Professor Trumpener is so knowledgable, we could pretty much ask her any question about other pieces of literature from that time period, etc. and she would have a ready answer. On the rare case she didn't, she would always come to the next class with the information we had asked about, plus anything else interesting\/relevant.",
    "This class was so wonderful. I learned a lot about the lineage of women's novels (and the women writers of those novels) from this class.",
    "I developed a canonical understanding of the female novel as it was developed and influenced by Austen and Bronte, and how this tradition was carried on through the 20th century. Definitely in invaluable lens with which to consider literature."

   "comments": [
    "I don't think it's possible to have this class meet twice a week because of the amount of reading, but I wish it did I wanted more time in this class. I think that the course could be made stronger by explaining the grading up front, and explanation of what Professor Trumpener was looking for in a paper.",
    "This class has a heavy reading load but it will help you grow your interests in the classics and introduce you to many you might never otherwise pick up.",
    "This class was wonderful!!!!!",
    "I loved this course. It was absolutely the best seminar I took at Yale. All of the novels we read were fascinating and compelling individually, but they were were organized by Professor Trumpener to represent a continuous discussion of similar themes and issues, and ultimately formed a coherent whole, so at the end of the semester I felt like I had a working understanding of a body of work, rather than just some knowledge about separate books."

    "This has been one of my very favorite classes at Yale. The reading list is fantastic and never makes the longer reading list feel like work. Professor Trumpener is also amazing and is really good about balancing points she thinks are important with topics the students wish to discuss.",
    "YES. TAKE THIS COURSE. The reading is enjoyable and awesome, and you will have a much greater understanding of the novels, even if you've already read some of them in high school before. Professor Trumpener is hysterical and makes class fun.",
    "Take this course if you love reading the classics. You'll spend a lot of the time with the text but it makes for fascinating discussions. In this class you'll read old favorites and some new finds but it's totally worth it to do the reading. If you're nervous about the weight of that workload, take the class CR\/D. With only two papers, it is totally manageable.",
    "This course was so wonderful I would recommend it to anyone who likes to read!!!!",
    "Yes. Discussion was always really lively and compelling - I never realized that two hours were going by. The reading load is significant - about a novel a week - but if you like reading these kinds of books anyway, you'll enjoy doing it.",
    "This was a positively delightful course, and probably one of my favorite classes of my time at Yale. The syllabus is a great mix of the familiar (Jane Austen, Charlotte Bronte) and the off-the-beaten-track (FM Mayor, Elizabeth Taylor, Jean Rhys, and others) and the works beautifully echo one another as the semester progresses. I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone who's interested in the period or who wants the opportunity to discuss such enjoyable novels with other enthusiastic students.",
    "Yes, absolutely. Professor Trumpener is wonderful and the reading could not be better!"
