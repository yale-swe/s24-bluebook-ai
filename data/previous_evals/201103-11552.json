    "State Building is a course built for independent research. Prof. Darden doesn't really have any particular points he wants to teach you, but he'll help you do your research.Take it-- If you are super interested in a particular state building project and want a method to learn some political theory to further your research.Don't take it--If you want a more standard Yale course that is trying to teach very particular curricula.",
    "Good course. Darden is a great discussion leader and knows his stuff. But take it only if you are interested in state-building.",
    "State Building covers state building in the present day, but also provides historical background. The beginning of the course presents the groundwork of different state building theories from which we drew for the rest of the course. I would recommend this course to another student; Professor Darden was very engaging and the students were very engaged in the material as a result.",
    "State Building is a great course, and Darden leads excellent discussions. Take it.",
    "I would recommend it to a student who is interested in the specifics of how states work and how they develop. It helps to have a strong interest either in political theory or in a particular modern case study. Its not a general-interest class, but great if you are looking for something with a lot of analytical rigor.",
    "I learned an incredible amount from this class. The notion of states and state-building are thrown around pretty uncritically, but this class forced me to carefully articulate what it means to be a state or undertake state-building. The readings were at times long and tedious, but offer a lot of theoretical insight that shaped my thinking on the subject."
