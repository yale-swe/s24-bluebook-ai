   "comments": [
    "Yes, I absolutely recommend this course.",
    "This course has one midterm, an in-class debate, and a final paper. Each student is expected to present on the reading one week and is expected to post on a class blog as well. The only issue with the class is that it is intended to be more cursory and language-based, but many people in the course are from the region or are experts in it. As someone who knew very little about this topic beyond the basic details, I found it hard to speak up in class (although listening in was very interesting). Luckily, the professor is approachable, helpful, and engaging, and the TF Maria was as well. I would recommend any of Professor Greenberg's classes.",
    "The class is interesting and you'll learn a lot, and Greenberg is great, but if you have no background in the area prepare to feel in over your head at times. Background knowledge supposedly isn't necessary, and I survived without it, but it definitely would have helped.",
    "If you are interested in the topic and willing to sit through four or five weeks of linguistics in the middle ofthe course, then take it. There is a midterm and a paper, several non-optional extra meetings, and a class blog that everyone posts on. Professor Greenberg is incredible and the course is graded very reasonably, though it is not the most structured class you will find at Yale.",
    "Greenberg is amazing, but this course can be a little much (in terms of information rather than time commitment) if you're not already familiar with the Balkans.",
    "This class is really great-- you'll learn a lot you probably haven't been exposed to before. The only thing to bear in mind is that it is more of a linguistics class than a poli.sci. class, at least in the beginning of the semester. But take it-- Professor Greenberg is wonderful!",
    "his was, without a doubt, among the best courses I have taken. Even if you don't know much about the Balkans, I assure you that you will become deeply interested in this most fascinating region of the world and learn about Balkan languages, politics and history. Professor Greenberg is the most talented Professor at Yale, who always stimulated and engaged the class, planned a dynamic agenda for each session--including presentation of Balkan news items, analysis and discussion of the readings, a debate and just a little bit of lecture to contextualize the reading and set the stage for the discussion. The class blog also kept the discussions alive outside of the classroom and was a wonderful component of the course.The assignments--a debate, leading discussions, a midterm exam and an open-ended paper were very interesting and wholly worthwhile!",
    "Take this class! It's a really important topic that is often neglected. This class will teach you not just about the wars and identity but also about the culture and its rich traditions. It debunks the myths of \"ancient hatreds\" and allows you to see the politics behind the disintegration of Yugoslavia and the West's reaction to it.",
    "One of my favorite classes. Definitely take it if you have a chance and are interested.",
    "Yes, especially if they want to specialize in the are very passionate about the topic.",
    "YES, take it. It's not that much work:30 pages of readings a week, movies\/sections every other week, one midterm, one final paper. It's a lot of fun and Greenberg is a memorable prof."
