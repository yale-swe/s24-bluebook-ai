   "comments": [
    "films are great.",
    "Quality Class. You will learn a ton about the French New Wave.",
    "Not a good class. Only take it if you ADORE the New Wave. Don't take it if you're looking to take a good film class.",
    "If you're into the French New Wave, then there is no better use of your time than taking this class. It was informative, immersive, and very well-presented. There's just a lot of reading. A LOT. Time management is key here.",
    "Take it.",
    "take this class. seriously. the films of the french new wave are beautiful and inspiring.if you don't take, then crash the screenings -- mondays, 6:30!!",
    "Great film class, and great class. Very cohesive. Beautiful. Fin!",
    "It was a really great class, and I would highly recommend it. The work is sizable but only comes in small bursts.",
    "I would probably not recommend this course. The lectures are really boring. That being said, the films are fantastic, and are all on 35 mm, so I'd pick up a copy of the syllabus, decide which ones you want to see, and then stop by!",
    "This is a film class about the French New Wave movement of the late 50s\/early 60s that includes two film screenings a week (both at the same time and one usually shorter than the other), as well as two lectures a week and a discussion section. I highly recommend it - how you watch films will be enhanced and you will gain a new appreciation for this unique moment in cinema. The professor is passionate about what he does and is a very interesting lecturer, and section provides some of the most fruitful discussions available at Yale. The reading material is pretty light, but very insightful. TAKE THIS COURSE!",
    "Yeah!! Great great class!",
    "Great films, great reading, not too much work.",
    "I would recommend this class to any student with a legitimate interest in broadening his or her film repertoire. Some of the French new wave films get a bit esoteric and need to be read as though they were works of abstract art, and won't really appeal to someone without the interest in or patience with art cinema.",
    "The movies are great, but while Dudley Andrew is clearly an expert in his field, he is not the best at communicating information to students or at sorting out what is really essential and what is extraneous, and consequently you'll get tons and tons of lectures based entirely on background info (i.e. the Algerian War, political parties in France, etc.) but NO simple, straight-to-the-point lectures about whatthe New Wave is in a nutshell. Worth it for the movies though, since apart from that it's really not too much work.",
    "Yes. Definitely. If you want to learn about one of the most rich cultural and artistic movements in the past century while getting some priceless dinner table conversation fodder, this is the course for you.",
    "This is an awesome introduction to a great subject. A critical understanding of the French New Wave may be the most important thing you learn in college, especially if you plan to impress people at parties.",
    "I'd recommend it. The lectures are not terribly useful, but the screenings are awesome. And you finish the course with a fairly good idea of the scope and character of the French New Wave.",
    "Take this course! Professor Andrew is both an expert on the New Wave and (quietly but strongly) passionate about the subject, and you'll learn a lot about art\/literature\/France in addition to the films themselves - which are (mostly) great as well. The Monday screenings can be a bit long, and there's a lot of reading but not all necessary. Overall the workload is very manageable; a fairly short takehome midterm essay, and a substantial (but manageable if done in stages like my TA required) final paper. Definitely fun and worth your time."
