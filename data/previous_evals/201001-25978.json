    "TAKE IT! DS IS AMAZING!!!!!",
    "I would summarize the class as a general overview of classic Western literature between the Renaissance and the present day, covering most of the landmark works. I would absolutely recommend it to others.",
    "Absolutely recommended.",
    "Yes.",
    "This course is really phenomenal, I highly recommend it. The works we read are beautiful and the professors do well to choose a cohesive body of texts that form a clear narrative thread. You have the perfect combination of fascinating lectures and exploratory discussion. Do take this class if you have the opportunity.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this class to another student. It broadens one's horizons and gives one an important introduction to the classics of the Western canon.",
    "DS Lit is an overview of the greatest works of the Western literary cannon after the Middle Ages. I highly recommend this course as a foundation for future studies in literature.",
    "I would recommend (and have already recommended to every single prefrosh I met) the Directed Studies Experience! Directed Studies was incredibly rewarding and I cannot say enough good things about it. The intellectual community that was developed over the course of the full year, the opportunities to get to know professors, the in-class discussions, colloquiums, and Art Gallery Talks...all made Directed Studies an in-depth and rich experience! The reading assignments are lengthy and there are many papers, however, the works we read and the students' excitement and curiosity about the reading makes the experience challenging and rewarding.",
    "Yes, it taught me to conduct effective and fruitful close readings of any text and made me appreciate the significance of every word and punctuation mark and enjambment."
