    "This was a fantastic class. Everyone should take it before they graduate. I might take it again some year. Strengths: laid back but not to the point where we dont get stuff done, it is to the extent where you feel comfortable to express yourself, your intellectuality your creativity in so many different ways, not just sculpture, but observation, you yourself are the art sometimes. it teaches you to unwind and let yourself be the artist in anyway you want. I cant really think of any real weaknesses.basically, what you get from this class what you put in. you have to have faith in it becauseif not you wont enjoy it. It may seem silly to some at first but in reality you realize that you mind can do more than just math and need more than just textbook stimulation. you study your own ideas, not someone else's.",
    "Yes",
    "I would recommend it if you are looking for an interesting, but low-key class. Keep in mind there was very little actual sculpture going on, but enough for me to get very interested in the field. I found the freedom given with the projects and the lack of structure of the class to be, well, freeing.",
    "This class will be whatever you choose to make it. If you want an easy, fun art class with little work, you can make it that way. If you want a space in which to think differently and be able to go on crazy projects and devote lots of time to them, you can do that as well. Daphne is a fantastic individual and everyone who is remotely interested in creative expression in any sort of format or medium should get to know her. That being said, what you get from this class depends entirely on what you chose to put into. It's relatively easy to turn this class into something less than serious, which can a times be frustrating.",
    "I'd love to recommend this course to others. As a MFA student, I know attending this course is really good for students who want to access to Fine Art. It can tell students that Art as is friendly is easy to approach.",
    "This is the class where you get your artist badge, if you don't already have one. Be prepared to do weird, fun stuff!"
