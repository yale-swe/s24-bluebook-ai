    "Learned about the microfabrication process for microdevices. Material is interesting but just too difficult and the professor does a terrible job explaining it. Was literally lost throughout lectures.",
    "This class was a pretty solid overview of different micro-scale fabrication techniques and devices. By no means does the class explore any one topic in depth, but it exposes you to lots of different subjects and cutting-edge research projects that allow you to gain an appreciation for the field.",
    "In a very concrete way I learned how to write an SBIR grant and give a business proposal for a new idea. I also gained an insight into the world of medical microdevices.",
    "This course taught me a solid foundation in bioMEMS devices, from the theoretical aspects of microfluidics to the fabrication process. I also learned to create a business pitch presentation and work in a group to write a scientific paper on this topic. I took this class because I wanted a biomechanics elective and this definitely taught me an extension of biomechanics!"

   "comments": [
    "Learned about the microfabrication process for microdevices. Material is interesting but just too difficult and the professor does a terrible job explaining it. Was literally lost throughout lectures. A more engaging and clear professor would have been good.",
    "I liked the fact that I was exposed to many different topics because I feel I could read a number of scientific reports from the field and have a basic understanding of what the report is talking about. However, this was also a potential weakness of the class. The professor goes through so much material in a single lecture that we only really touch the surface of the topic and I find myself often wanting more information or a better understanding.",
    "The class presents a lot of information to the student without a clear way for the student to revisit the material at a later date.Perhaps more reading or source material could help improve this problem.",
    "The material was kind of dry, making the class not incredibly interesting. The final project, however, was a lot of fun. there is a lot to be said for being able to design something novel and do research on something you find interesting.",
    "Strengths are that it provides a breadth of knowledge in bioMEMS, enabling students to delve deeper if they wish. The class is very chill most of the time during lectures, and only gets to be more work with the business presentation and final paper towards the end. But even with these bigger assignments, I came away appreciating how much I learned through the group work. Weaknesses are that lecture slides can be confusing and sometimes it is hard for students to understand what the professor is trying to express. There was also little guidance on what would be on the midterm. This can be improved by giving students a midterm study guide, hosting a midterm review or Q&A session, and making lectures slides and lecturing style more clear."

   "comments": [
    "Learned about the microfabrication process for microdevices. Material is interesting but just too difficult and the professor does a terrible job explaining it. Was literally lost throughout lectures.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student who already has some background (theoretical or experimental) or vested interest in micro-fabrication and devices. You'll gain much more out of the class if you have already been exposed to the topic and don't mind brushing over many subjects quickly.",
    "BENG 411 is a relatively low workload class with a high payoff in learning about medical microdevices and their applications. The final project is fun and engaging. Definitely take this class.",
    "This course material is pretty dry, which is not helped by the fact that this course is taught almost entirely through PowerPoint slide, so not easy to feel engaged in lecture. The Lab visits were the most interesting days. Being able to apply things that we had been learning and see how the concepts actually play out in a lab setting. The final project was very enjoyable for the similar reason of being a chance to apply our learning and even delve deeper into certain areas during our research.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class if you are looking for a chill but also intellectually interesting biomechanics elective. Professor Fan is very kind and really wants the best for his students. Note that this class can be end of semester loaded with the presentation and paper, but is definitely still very doable as a senior."
