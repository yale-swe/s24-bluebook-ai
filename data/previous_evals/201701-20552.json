    "Excellent introduction to the use of ArcGIS and geographic information systems in general. The term project allows to explore and combine learnings from different classes to enhance overall understanding of map usage as opposed to specific tools only.",
    "You learn a marketable, useful skill--ArcGIS. Great to put on your resume and very useful for anyone interested in geography, urban studies\/planning, architecture, or environmental studies.",
    "Learned how to use the ArcMap GIS program",
    "I learned how to use GIS technology and use spatial data find solutions to problems.",
    "Learning ArcGIS was a pretty cool & useful skill that I hope to be able to use in future years as an ecologist. However, since it's a course based on a software, if you know specifically what you want to do, you can learn it online - so I also learned how to be self-sufficient in my use of the software, and how to formulate a project.",
    "Ability to use ArcGIS. Pretty straightforward.",
    "I feel comfortable using ArcGis in a number of different applications.",
    "This was a phenomenal course in which I was able to learn a lot about GIS. Dana has been doing this course so long that he has teaching it down to a science, and knows what works and what doesn't, what's helpful and what isn't, what's useful to know and what's not. He teaches GIS in such an efficient and systematic way that you really will be well-founded in the software by the end of the semester, and ready to pursue GIS in further applications, whether it be more advanced classes or actual use of the software in a summer internship or a job.",

   "comments": [
    "This class is basically a 2-hour, once a week lecture. A lecture is a terrible way to learn any computer program, especially one as complicated and finicky as ArcGIS. You really do all the learning outside of class on your own, following the handouts Professor Tomlin have made (which are incredibly detailed and useful). The class would really be much more effective if it were interactive. Also, if you don't have an idea in mind for a final project that will show off the features of GIS that the professor wants to see, don't take the class.",
    "Class could sometimes be a little of a drag, especially when we werent able to follow along, but otherwise a very well organized course(and supported by all of the excellent handouts)",
    "Difficult course. My computer was too old to install the necessary software, so I could only work at bass or csssi, which made completing assignments very difficult and stressful. Deceptively high workload",
    "The seminar format makes the course easy to follow. I wish that when we got our homework evaluations, we were told more about why we given that evaluation.",
    "A strength is that the term project is completely up to students - it's really great to be able to apply a software to something that really interests students. The classes themselves are just okay. Dana teaches ArcGIS well, and he definitely knows what he's doing & is great in general, but I definitely felt like I was just being lectured to during class, and most of the learning of GIS came at home.",
    "Strengths: definitely gets you familiar with ArcGIS. Professor Tomlin and Jill were both very open to questions and they knew their stuff. Ability to see other students' work allowed me to put my own work into context and get a few ideas for my final project. Weaknesses: Lectures were a little boring, and I found the suggestion not to take notes was actually counterproductive for me personally (I started taking notes and it helped immensely). Putting all of the grade on the final project is an interesting concept that I personally wasn't a fan of, given the amount of time I put in throughout the semester on stuff that didn't end up in my project. Despite seeing other people's work it was unclear to me how I was doing- would have been good to get specific feedback on each pset about what I did well and what could have been improved, instead of the occasional class ranking.",
    "This is a great course. You get to learn the skills based on a project you choose, which is super awesome. I wish there were more graded aspects than simply the final project.",
    "Class time can be slow if you don't enjoy GIS enough to be interested by simply watching Dana work in it and demonstrate operations on the projector. But if you think the stuff he is doing is cool, you'll be interested and class will go by faster. This is just a teaching style that's not very engaged and may not work for some people, unless you come to class with a question in which case he'll work it out right in front of you which is extremely helpful. I also think the class would be better if there was a lab time dedicated to doing the homework, like a required section for the course. Jill's office hours are certainly long enough to be comparable to a lab, but if it was a required section, I think that would help people (me) who have procrastination issues by making them attend a work session shortly after the class - this would help them get a head-start on their program and would be helpful for being so soon after class while the topics and any questions on them are still in students' minds. It's also a little irksome that Dana was only on campus on Tuesdays; no one's going to start the homework and have questions that need answering the day of class. However, he was very accommodating (one of my best professors in that) when you asked to meet with him, plus Jill had plenty of office hours to go to, and she was super helpful as well. It would just be better if the main professor who's doing the grading was more available. The biggest strengths of this course was Dana and Jill! They are both phenomenal teachers, and as I said in \"knowledge, skills, and insight\" question (#1), Dana has gotten teaching this course down to a science and is very effective at it. I was also about to say a strength of this course was keeping it small, but now that I think about it there was nothing inherently helpful about that. I never felt pressed to get a word in since few people would ask questions in class. I think they could let more people in since if they wanted and if there was interest (which I think there was.)",
    "It clearly shows you how to use ArcGIS but is very boring if you are not interested in learning that and only that. It is basically has the format of an online course that is taught live."

    "This is a good class to take Credit\/D. GIS is a very complicated program, so there is an infinite amount you could learn, and you definitely wont become a professional in a semester. That being said, it is a good chance to get a better grasp of the skill and play around with the different features. Take it Credit\/D so you will learn the application but don't have to worry about the final project which is very unclear on how it is graded and what specific expectations are. Dr. Tomlin is good at answering questions and being available to help.",
    "If you want to get an introduction to ArcGIS or geographic information systems in general, this is your class.",
    "I would not recommend it unless you have a clear idea for a term project to show off GIS, and are willing to be very active in teaching yourself and getting help. I wish I had waited to take Professor Tomlin's graduate level courses on GIS, which are less final-project oriented.",
    "Absolutely",
    "Difficult course. My computer was too old to install the necessary software, so I could only work at bass or csssi, which made completing assignments very difficult and stressful. Deceptively high workload. Only take if you really want to learn gis",
    "Yes. GIS is a great skill to have, and this class is a good way to learn the software in a way that is interesting to each individual person",
    "Take it Cr\/D\/F. It's a course where the grade is mostly based on a year-end term project, because homework assignments are \"not a part of your grade\" (something I still have no idea what it means...) so it's tough to know how you're doing unless (unlike me) you go to all the office hours. If you're super into your project, and love office hours, by all means take it as a letter grade, but if you don't go to office hours, I wouldn't recommend taking it as a letter grade. Other than that, I took the course because I wanted to learn how to use ArcGIS, and I did leave the class knowing how to use ArcGIS, so I suppose that worked.",

    "YES! This is a great skill to gain!",
    "This was a phenomenal course in which I was able to learn a lot about GIS. Dana has been doing this course so long that he has teaching it down to a science, and knows what works and what doesn't, what's helpful and what isn't, what's useful to know and what's not. He teaches GIS in such an efficient and systematic way that you really will be well-founded in the software by the end of the semester, and ready to pursue GIS in further applications, whether it be more advanced classes or actual use of the software in a summer internship or a job. He often explains in a worm's eye\/bird's eye view format and is very effective at getting you to understand exactly what is going on. Class time can be slow if you don't enjoy GIS enough to be interested by simply watching Dana work in it and demonstrate operations on the projector. But if you think the stuff he is doing is cool, you'll be interested and class will go by faster. This is just a teaching style that's not very engaged and may not work for some people, unless you come to class with a question in which case he'll work it out right in front of you which is extremely helpful. THINGS TO KNOW: **You'll go to class for 2 hrs once a week, which can be long but it's nice to not have to go a second time. Then you'll have allll week to do your homework - this is a tricky part of the course since you'll feel like you have all the time in the world, and I guarantee you'll put it off. Don't do this! The homeworks can become very involved very fast since it's easy to get pulled into tweaking formatting and similar things to get it just right and before you know it, hours would have passed by. **The final project will also take up a significant portion of your time. I put it off after a big exam I had, giving myself 3 full days with no other commitments to complete it, and that wasn't enough time; I ended up pulling an all-nighter on the last night to finish it. ** Dana is only on campus on Tuesdays (at least he was this semester), so plan accordingly. ** Jill, if you have her as a TF, is great! Go to her as often as you can to get suggestions on how to take your homeworks and final project up a level (same goes for Dana). **Your only grade is effectively just the final project; weakly homeworks get graded on a qualitative, not quantitative, scale ranging from very below average to below to average to above to very above. ** Dana is a phenomenal teacher and very effective at teaching you GIS.",
    "No, I did not find it to be very engaging. I t was interesting to learn how to use the program but I would use one of my limited classes I get to take at Yale to take this course."
