   "comments": [
    "It's a great class for anyone wanting to improve his or her French before moving on to higher level French courses. There's a fair amount of work, but it's manageable. I'd definitely recommend it.",
    "It depends on what French experience they have had. If they have the opportunity to do L5 I would go with that but otherwise I'd definitely recommend it",
    "Take it.",
    "Amazing class. Definitely take it.",
    "yes",
    "French 140 is good for students with a good familiarity with French, but who need a bit of brushing up on grammar.I would recommend it to a student looking to continue into higher levels of French.",
    "French 140 is a lot of work, but it is very rewarding because you not only come out of it with an improved spoke, listening, and writing comprehension, but also the context in which it is used. I would definitely recommend this course if you want to improve your French and even more so if you are considering working in the Francophone world.",
    "I absolutely would recommend it. I had a lot of fun, and the reading was interesting. Plus French is gorgeous.",
    "This class is a good, solid review of French grammar and vocab. It's not too hard and the workload is not too hard. The readings are interesting and Professor Burton is really nice and helpful."
