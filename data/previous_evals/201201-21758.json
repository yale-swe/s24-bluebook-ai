    "If you are interested in the subject matter, or just want to keep up your French reading, writing, and speaking skills, it is an excellent option.",
    "Professor Miller is a fabulous teacher and has crafted an incredibly interesting syllabus for this course. I would suggest that you take this course or any course that he teaches. Litt\u00e9rature Monde en Fran\u00e7ais is rich in new readings and art that you probably have not come across before.",
    "I really liked this course! Christopher Miller is very knowledgable in his field and has a great taste in literature. If you want to break away from the typical French lit canon I would recommend this course.",
    "FREN228 is most definitely a great course to take if you have absolutely any interest in French literature, andhow literature and sociology have come to interact throughout the centuries.The reading is not overhwelming at all, and the discussions are extremely fun. I always left the class happier than I came in, and even if I found particular reading assingments difficult, Prof. Miller's thoroughly researched and prepared classes always solved my difficulties.Prof. Miller is also a great guide in whatever research on French literature you may be undertaking, so it might be worth taking the class just to improve your essay writing and research skills in French.",
    "French 228, \u0093La litt\u00e9rature-monde en fran\u00e7ais\u0094 was an enjoyable class. If you\u0092re not a fan of leftist cultural discourse it can be a challenge, but Professor Miller was a great person to lead the class and a strong professor and discussion-leader. I would encourage you to take this course if (a) you can speak French well, since far too many students this semester couldn\u0092t, and (b) you are expressly interested in the subject of the course, which is exploring the role of \u0091francophone literature\u0092 (i.e. French-language literature not published in Paris) and the relationship between France and its colonies before and after their decolonization."
