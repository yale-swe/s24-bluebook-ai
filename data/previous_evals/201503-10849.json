    "If you have four hours each week that you want to spend doing something relaxing and constructive, then take this course. If not, think about why you don't have those four hours.",

As an undergrad, if you're at all interested and have the space in your schedule, absolutely go for it. You'll have a great time.",
    "Best course ever.",
    "Yes! Definitely recommend this course for people with an extra 4 hours a week to spend in a machine shop learning how to machine metal. This is a really low homework class so the only work you put in is during class time. Super fun.",
    "yes, because i learned a lot from this course."
