   "comments": [
    "Lot of new knowledge about the different genres explored by American writers in antebellum period; learned a lot about the contemporary publishing industry and political\/cultural responses to certain works.",
    "Antebellum American Literature was an engaging course that combined close readings of text with historical contexts.",
    "I learned more about early 19th-century American history by taking this course (this was already the time period of American history in which I am the most knowledgeable). I learned a lot about the genres of literature popular in this time period (which I did not know about previously), such as Gothic and sentimental literature. I also was able to brush up on my writing skills, but only by virtue of actually writing the papers that were assigned, not because we were actually taught anything about writing.",
    "This class reintroduced me to some texts I was already familiar with (Whitman, Scarlet Letter) while introducing me to some really influential works I might have never read otherwise (Sheppard Lee and some of the Native American writings). Coming up with my own essay topics was challenging since I'm used to pretty detailed prompts, but it helped me develop my critical thinking skills while also allowing me to write about something I found interesting. Professor Warner leads interesting and engaging discussions.",
    "Filled important gaps in my American literature lifetime reading list",
    "I gained an understanding the policy and technological changes that defined both antebellum America and its literature. I gained insights into the biographical lives of the authors we read, which enhanced my understanding of their works.",
    "Valuable knowledge about American history, especially with regard to social change, along with a highly increased ability to read, understand, and analyze poetry; also an understanding of transcendentalism, the development of American identity; sexuality in the 19th century; the process and ideology of abolition; printing, press, and magazines in the 19th century; increased ability to utilize social and historical context in essays about literature; improved essay-writing.",
    "Really interesting overview of early American literature, blended with Am Studies historical context"

   "comments": [
    "Discussions were very engaging and often at a high level. There was a lot of reading, and I think I would have been a more productive participant in seminar if we had been flagged ahead of time to what we would focus on in class.",
    "Antebellum American Literature overall was a very well-structured class that allowed for discussion among students and Professor Warner.",
    "Strengths of the course include the depth of knowledge of Professor Warner and the excellent reading list. However, sometimes his knowledge worked against him, as the course did not really feel like a seminar but rather an extended lecture, because Professor Warner was so eager to tell us all of the relevant history behind the book, author, subject matter, etc. Even when he did ask the class questions, it sometimes felt like he was fishing for answers. I also would have liked to read more works by writers of color that were not strictly related to slavery and\/or civil rights, even though I realize that those issues were obviously the main focus of black writers at that time. Nor did the class include any Native American writers instead we read white mens observations about them.",
    "The reading list is great, and Professor Warner is really passionate about all of it. There's a huge variety of readings, from Dickinson to Poe to Sheppard Lee, which I had never heard of before the course. Coming up with my own essay topics was challenging since I'm used to pretty detailed prompts, but it helped me develop my critical thinking skills while also allowing me to write about something I found interesting. I was sometimes intimidated to speak up in class because it often seemed like a few people dominated the conversation, but that's something I worked on over the semester. Professor Warner is great about giving lots of context and leading discussions. If you're interested in Whitman at all, you should absolutely take this class with him.",
    "Strong survey of American lit from Irving to Whitman, give or take. The works read are mostly great, and Professor Warner is terrific.",
    "This class was a typical English seminar. I appreciated that the syllabus offered a wide variety of works that fell under the category of antebellum American literature. Its main weakness is that I would have wanted more time to discuss the works we read. Often, the quantity of reading surpassed what we had time to cover in class.",
    "Strengths: - Professor Warner is a strong discussion leader who does a good job picking insight out of very difficult texts. - A body of pretty consistently interesting literature - Pre-1900 lit and American lit (you can only use it for one though) - Students are returned their first essays drafts with discussion, giving them a real chance to improve. Weaknesses: - Professor Warner provides no essay prompts which may be intimidating or paralytic to people who have never encountered this before. - As with many seminar classes its easy to feel intimidated by your peers. - Uncle Tom's Cabin is a looong book and a little unengaging (but that's just my opinion) - Not a pre-1800 lit class"

   "comments": [
    "Warner is a great professor. He is willing to talk about anything at his office hours. He is also very willing to go through your writing, line by line, which can be very useful. His is a less than stellar section leader, as he lectures more often, but his lectures are very illuminating. So its a trade-off. American Lit is also sick, so take it if you like Am lit! Warner is a great choice.",
    "Antebellum American Literature is a great, thorough survey of major American writings from a variety of genres!",
    "I would recommend this class to those who are interested in American literature particularly within the time period of 1810-1860. Professor Warner is very knowledgeable about the writing both in breadth and depth. However, speaking in class with this high-powered of a professor can be intimidating. Many of the students who enroll in this class, furthermore, seem to be pretty well-grounded in the material, so be prepared for some illuminating discussions.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student if they were okay with it basically being a lecture. Anyone who wants a true seminar experience probably shouldnt take this course. I might also warn students of color to steer clear of this course, since you might find that the discussions extremely frustrating. The professor tends to completely avoid the racist comments that the white authors make in passing, and calls the blatantly problematic episodes in the text merely interesting. I understand that this is not a course in race theory, but it disturbed me how we managed to discuss entire works about slavery only in terms of how they fit into a particular genre, and avoided almost entirely their roles in either creating or tearing down the American mythos of race. Are these issues not also important aspects of literature?",
    "Great seminar! The reading list includes some classics like Leaves of Grass and the Scarlet Letter, but you'll also encounter some texts you're probably not as familiar with, like Sheppard Lee, which is a really weird but interesting book. Professor Warner leads engaging sections, so definitely do the readings and participate. Talk over your essay ideas in his office hours, he's a really great person to get to know!",
    "It fills important gaps. Every English major who cares about American lit should take it.",
    "This is a solid pre-1900 class to take. The reading consists of many of the works I never got to read in high school, but probably should have read (such as Scarlet Letter and Edgar Allen Poe). The discussion was typically interesting.",
    "Amazing. You will read amazing works of literature and poetry, learn an endless amount of information about American history, including lesser-taught subjects such as sexuality, views on the American landscape, American romanticism, and the ideology and process of abolition. Discussions are lively. Readings are heavy. Professor Warner is brilliant and knows seemingly everything about American literature, history, sexuality, environmentalism, and transcendentalism. This class would be worth it simply for getting to read and understand Walden, Song of Myself, and Dickinson's poems, but it's much more than that.",
    "Good to learn more about the roots of American literature. To me Dickinson, Whitman, and Poe were especially interesting. Professor Warner is easy to talk to, supportive, and enthusiastic about the subject matter. About as good as I think you could expect from a pre-1900 class.",
    "Yes definitely - really engaging reading, and Professor Warner is incredibly knowledgeable about his subject material. It's a pleasure just to hear him talk."
