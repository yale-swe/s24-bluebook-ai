   "comments": [
    "YES! This was the best class I have EVER taken at Yale! There isn't much work at all (just one reading a week, 2 short papers and a very short final) and class is very fun and entertaining. Some TAs are hard graders, but I learned so much in this class and had fun doing it.",
    "Yes, I would recommend it! It's an interesting course, not too hard, and Casetti is an entertaining lecturer. This course is the epitome of a gut course at Yale and is a perfect 5th course if you're looking for one. You'll learn a few interesting things about the media that will actually shape the way you think about it.",
    "lots of readings! lots of guest lectures, and not that much structure. But super interesting overall.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student mostly because professor Casetti provides a window into understanding many complicated works in this field. The courseware isn't much, and the final was a take home but that begin said, the texts covered in this class are extremely abstract, and are certainly a challenge to write about clearly and confidently, as a genius english phd student will be grading them. If you are interested in reading texts that you might not find in any other course at Yale, then take this one, but I would recommend shopping it and checking the syllabus first.",
    "Very little work. If you do the readings they're fascinating. If you listen to Casetti he's absolutely hilarious.",
    "IF you are a film studies major, take it. If not, don't. It's interesting, but yeah.",
    "It's a fun course with a smart and interesting professor. Not too much work.",
    "A fun small lecture with not too much reading about media theory and lots of room for choice on papers. Every week, one of the lectures is devoted to a guest lecturer, and in the other, Professor Casetti goes over the main implications of the readings. Professor Casetti's animated style and current references really brings the material to life.",
    "It's a great course, whether or not you're a Film Studies major. The material is pretty easy to understand, and assignments don't take that long.",
    "Only if you are interested in film and philosophy. Not for those who hate to read like me.",
    "Don't do it, unless you genuinely love the stuff and have the background for it.",
    "I think that I had an overall good experience in this course. Professor Casetti is wonderful. Very kind and thoughtful, and always more than willing to meet with students. He really has the students' best interest in mind. I found someof the readings quite difficult, but Casetti managed to explain them quite well. In terms of the readings, although I often found them difficult, and didn't like them when I was reading them, I find myself constantly thinking about in my daily life as well as in my other classes. As a summary-- the readings are tough, but you can get something out of them by listening in lecture and section. The papers, if you discuss them with Casetti\/TA first, to make sure that you are applying the material correctly, are easy and relatively fun. It's not too much work, and it's interesting. Sometimes lectures area bit difficult to follow.",
    "First off, this is a fantastic course. Professor Casetti is hilarious, easy-going and very accessible. The class leads students through a set of different answers to the questions of media's definition, its social\/psychological implications, and what it means to be an audience (just to name a few). Prof. Casetti is concerned with more than basic comprehension of the theories (although this is necessary); he is committed to students' cultivating their own critical frames through the course. Concretely, this looks like an extremely light reading load. While this can be desirable in itself, to really get something out of the class there needs to be a personal investment in the ideas, a real engagement with the discussion. Otherwise, it's fun and light but won't be nearly as rewarding.",
    "The most important class you could take at Yale. The material is so relevant and the Casetti is not to be missed.",
    "A review of different media and technology theorists. Comparisons drawn to contemporary examples and old models compared and contrasted with newer ones. Well organized, constantly developing course",
    "Now if you are looking for an easy humanities class, continue looking. This is not it. The readings are incredibly dense and if sifting through philosophy-like writing is not your idea of an easy workload, get out before you immerse yourself in this supposedly gut class. Sure enough the material is interesting and it makes you think differently of media, but you have to consider the immense efforts you have to put in to get your humanities credit. The TAs also grade harshly and in the end you will end up bruised mentally because of the convoluted readings, and your GPA will be in tatters. I rest my case.",
    "Know what you're getting into. This is indeed a theory class, and not entirely a film one -- expect little practicality, little grounding in real-life examples, lots of hypotheticals. Know that Casetti is often difficult to understand (for reasons of accent), and that his self-described \"schizophrenic\" teaching method is exactly as such. The class has little apparent structure, and most of what I've gained from it has come of my discussion section. For those in love with theory, I suppose it's worth shopping, but I personally do not recommend it.",
    "This was a good course, with not a lot of assignments. It would be a good course to take if you are interested in film theory, but be warned of the sometimes dense, tedious readings.",
    "I would recommend this but only if you realize that this is a LOT of theoretical (abstract) stuff that is hard to understand. I probably should have realized that because it's called \"Theory of Media.\"",
    "Oh yeah.",
    "No, unless you have the opportunity to take it Credit\/D"
