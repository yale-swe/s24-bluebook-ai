   "comments": [
    "It is a course dealing with early film (and pre-film) theory through the perspective of cinephobia (fear of film). Several major fears connected to cinema are discussed and illustrated by the texts. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who is interested in core film theory as well as someone who just wants to get a better sense of it.",
    "This was not a seminar in the usual sense. The class consisted of open discussions and a strong sense of working together and critically develop a certain concept of cinephobia at the END (!) of the semester. I would highly recommend such a format classwork.",
    "The seminar was concerned with the question of \"cinephobia\"; i.e., the many ways in which people have reacted negatively or ambivalently to film as a medium, a technology, a system of representation, and so on, with each week centering on a different mode of cinephobia. I would recommend the course to another student, if nothing else because it enabled new and fresh readings of certain standard texts, as well as bringing to light several less familiar ones.",
    "This response mostly echoes the response to #1. I would absolutely recommend it.",
    "The course concerned the history of anxiety and fear that marks film history and historiography. Each week attended to a different anxiety endemic to film or film studies, with a series of remarkable texts (from Plato and St John of Damascus to Bazin and Epstein). I would absolutely recommend this course. Prof. Casetti is an invaluable resource to Yale's film and media program, and this course reveals him at his most passionate and most knowledgable. For anyone questioning film studies \"relevance\" in the 21st century, this course offers a persuasive rebuttal. Not to mention, the workload is not too taxing, despite the import of the material covered.",
    "I would most definitely recumbent the course. I think the range of the material reaches out beyond the scope of Film Studies and can be of interest to most students in the humanities with rigorous theoretical interests."

   "question_text": "How did this course deepen your knowledge of your discipline\/profession? To what extent did this course contribute to your dissertation\/research?",
   "comments": [
    "The course strengthened my knowledge of film theory which was what I really needed. It is hard to tell whether the course was beneficial for my future dissertation because I am still in my first year and don't have a clear idea about my final project.",
    "As a course outside of my immediate research interests, it helped me methodologically in seeing how one can re-read familiar theoretical texts, or search for new texts, guided by different theoretical questions.",
    "I believe it opened up certain new avenues of inquiry I had not previously considered, which may well prove crucial to my dissertation.",
    "By limiting the class to the theme of anxiety and\/in the cinema, Prof. Casetti offered us a unique lens with which to study the whole of film history. I know that many of the texts we read in this course (particularly those that may fall more appropriately under the rubric of \"media studies\"agamben, heidegger, derrida) will inform my future studies in film. Also, the opportunity to write a portfolio at the end of the semester gave me the seeds of multiple projects that I hope to pursue in the future with Prof. Casetti's guidance.",
    "The course's subject matter was not in my discipline per se, but the theoretical aspect was informative and enlightening. Indeed, it helped me rethink and hone aspects of my work for the ongoing departmental requirements."
