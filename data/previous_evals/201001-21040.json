    "As a philosophically minded student, I would recommend this course to those who have an interest in the applications (and limits) of possible world semantics, but also the philosophy of language in general. The course topics were well-balanced between current research and their historical antecedents, as well as both linguistically and philosophically focused material. As a result, this course should be of interest to students of philosophy as well as linguists.",
    "The class is an introduction to different semantic topics that seem to have a subjective flavor and how to deal with them given the normal set of semantics tools. I would recommend the class to people with interest in semantics."

   "comments": [
    "I have a deeper appreciation for the various applications of the possible worlds framework, which is especially relevant because of that framework's ubiquity in philosophy. Additionally, the opportunity to be exposed to another discipline (viz. linguistics) and to the people who do it (or will do it) professionally was invaluable."
