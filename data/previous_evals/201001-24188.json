    "This class is great if you're interested in art and like to draw and are willing to draw a lot. It's a lot of work and meets very early, so be prepared for that. However, you learn a ton about drawing and your drawing will improve immensely.",
    "YES, but perhaps you should shop the classes and see which professor you would prefer, because they are all very different.",
    "Yes, I would most certainly recommend this class, although this is a class that will probably appeal to a very certain type of student. Regardless of one's \"artistic\" background, the most important thing is that the student is willing to invest a lot of work and challenge themselves mentally. This class ultimately demands a high level of curiosity and exploration.",
    "In choosing which section of this class, you should know what you want. If you want to improve dramatically, and you have the time to invest, choose Robert Reed's section; it is a guarantee that he will help you improve if you want to. If, on the other hand, you just want to explore drawing in class, with no guarantee that at the end of the semester you'll have work that you're proud of, then choose a different section.",
    "\"Take it if you are extremely concerned about Prof. Reeds opinion but not if you want to learn how to draw.\"",
    "TAKE IT. Amazing class. This is the one Basic Drawing class where you will learn how to visually research something, not just draw pretty pictures. Because it begins with the bare bones skills of drawing--line weight, elliptical\/perspectival systems, etc.--you will be forced to learn from scratch. RR is intimidating only if you let him be. He is actually very considerate, wants to get to know you as a person, and deeply invested in seeing you reach a breakthrough in your work. I think his teaching style pushes us to be honest in our investigations -- is that drawing really evidence of investigating something\/looking closely? or is it just to please RR? I think he can tell the difference. RR was so encouraging with directions \/ possibilities, but also very honest with constructive criticism. Yes, some of the investigations sounded ridiculous because of the number, but really, we needed those numbers and vague-nesses sometimes to discover things on our own. In-class sessions were useful segways into after-class work. I never was afraid to ask for specific feedback during in-class sessions. It's awesome waking up to a class where you will actually learn something and feel productive.",
    "While I learned a lot and my drawing improved, I often felt miserable on my way to the 8:20 class. Wednesday after it ended was my most stress-free moments of the week."
