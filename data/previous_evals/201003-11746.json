    "This is a great seminar with fantastic readings, a reasonable work load and great discussions. I would absolutely recommend it.",
    "TAKE IT. Period. Great class w\/ great professor. Some kids were bitches, though, should only be for History majors.",
    "Highly recommended. The central questions of the course are defined well at the beginning and the material (lots!) works its way well through those topics. Professor Joseph is wonderful--deeply knowledgeable on the subject and always available for help.",
    "This is a great history seminar. It's a bit too heavy in its reading assignments, but the construction of the class is excellent, and Professor Joseph is a very cool and dedicated teacher. Even if you know a lot about Latin America, you'll learn something and enjoy the class.",
    "If you have an interest in getting a broad eduction of 20th century Latin America take this course.",
    "Yes! Take it. Professor Joseph is really great and the readings and seminar discussion are really interesting.",
    "Definitely a great class. If you can get in it (which isn't easy) you'll have an opportunity to learn about some of the most important and exciting events in Latin America over the last 50 years, with plenty of applications to present situations.The workload isn't overbearing but you won't be able to enjoy the class unless you can take the time to do at least the majority of the readings.",
    "If you are lucky enough to get a spot in the seminar \u0097 there's usually a pretty healthy demand \u0097 then you should definitely, ABSOLUTELY, unquestionably take this class. Great material, great professor, great speakers.... nothing bad to say about this class. Unequivocal yes, take this class.",
    "This is a fantastic foundational class if you are interested in 20th century Latin American history. There is a huge emphasis on the relationship between the united states and various Latin American revolutions. Professor Joseph is very open, knowledgeable, and helpful. Take this class!!",
    "A group of case studies of latin american revolutions.",
    "This is a great course! Take it if you can.",
    "Excellent. Take it.",
    "Yes, I would recommend HIST 372J because it is an extremely fascinating study of political\/economic\/social revolution, Latin American history, U.S.-Latin American relations, U.S. Cold War foreign policy, and the Cold War in Latin America. I felt I learned an incredible amount from Professor Joseph (who is extremely knowledgable, passionate, and generous), the overwhelming amount of readings, the awesome film screenings, the great guest lecturers, the mostly interesting class discussions, the one journal assignment, and the final essay. HIST 372 increased my interest in and passion for 20th-Century Latin America.However, as mentioned above, I warn prospective students about large amount of assigned reading. Obviously, any History junior seminar is going to have a lot of reading, but I often found finishing HIST 372's assigned reading impossible, especially during weeks when there was also a required film screening. Oftentimes, I just watched the film which allowed me to get by, but I was not able to participate in many parts of the class discussion. Also, Prof. Joseph's questions hold you responsible for being able to synthesize many readings which is challenging. The class discussion format can get repititive and the reasonable writing assignments took me longer than expected despite their seemingly easy appearance."
