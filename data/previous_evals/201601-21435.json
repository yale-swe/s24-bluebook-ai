    "I really enjoyed this class, especially with Prof. Gabriel teaching it. But I think the biggest factor for my enjoyment wasn't just the course material, but the way Prof. Gabriel taught it, because he made things understandable for everyone, even a science major like me, so I don't think it will be the same without him.",
    "Low pressure, and even though there isn't really anything enforcing the reading requirement, definitely still read everything because it's a great collection of books. I'd recommend it if you're looking for something thought-provoking that won't kill you with a heavy workload.",
    "I would definitely recommend the class-- it has a really nice, relaxed atmosphere, but the books we read were fairly demanding. The themes we focus on in class were also always interesting.",
    "LITR 465 is one of the best classes at Yale. All of the texts were interesting. Professor Gabriel was amazing. You will never be bored during any of the seminars. You will be truly interested in the texts that are being discussed. Definitely take this class if it is offered again.",
    "Highly recommended! I needed a humanities credit and I was dreading having to take one, but this was really nice. I am really happy I chose this class because I really enjoyed it."
