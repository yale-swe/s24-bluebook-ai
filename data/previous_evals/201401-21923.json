    "It's a great compliment to other courses within African American studies and it unique in that it provides an international perspective.",
    "A solid, interesting seminar. I don't think Adom will teach at Yale again, but this was an interesting syllabus and was well-taught. Not too much work, fairly engaging conversations, and interesting and unique readings.",
    "General overview of Race and imperialism regarding the 20Th century, not necessarily the closing of imperialism however.",
    "One of my favorite courses I've taken! Fascinating material, with a really well put together syllabus, and more importantly, a wonderful instructor. Adom is incredibly smart and engaging, an excellent seminar leader who is also extremely approachable and spends a lot of time giving feedback and guidance on students' work. Would highly recommend taking a class with her if you can!!!"
