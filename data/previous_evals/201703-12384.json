   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Great overview of international relations. Generally easy to follow. Guest lecturers were not very good, with the exception of Stephen Herzog and Charlotte Hulme, everyone else spoke too fast and was hard to follow. Overall a very reasonable and interesting class.",
    "Less readings would make the class more likely to engage with the lectures and sections. The class gives a good, broad overview of challenges internationally and provides interesting reading material.",
    "Strengths: very general knowledge course that covers a lot of different need-to-know subjects Weaknesses: the variability in TAs and the fact that they grade makes grades vary a lot.",
    "improvement: make readings\/lecture more mandatory I enjoyed the section discussions and readings. Wish lectures were more engaging",
    "Very interesting material but too many random readings and covers so many topics it's hard to grasp everything.",
    "This class does a great job at providing a broad introduction to current international affairs. However, at times, the structure of the course left me with a dissatisfaction with the depth with which we discussed certain subjects.",
    "I think one major strength was the TAs that this course draws. Mine in particular was really engaged in our section and even when I didn't find the material all that interesting, he made section overall interesting. I like that the course is structured as having a new challenge each lecture. That really keeps the pace of the class moving and keeps peoples' interest",
    "It is a general survey of a variety of problems with a good collection of readings. The only grades are the midterm, final, and a small participation grade, so the workload is small, but the weight of the exams is great.",
    "The format of the course was great: one lecture per topic with readings for each lecture. Sometimes I thought there were too many readings for each lecture, but other than that I thought it was great.",
    "The workload is low and you really get what you put into this class. Perhaps different methods of examination would be more engaging.",
    "Lectures were great and the discussion sections were my favorite i've ever had. Readings got long on occasion.",
    "One's experience in the class was largely based on which section a student was in.",
    "Definitely seemed like a good way for people who don't read the news to get up to date on the pressing questions of the day. If you're generally aware of things happening in the world (like me) this was a good structured way to talk about them with other students. A great fifth course, especially, since the only real commitment is the weekly discussion section.",
    "Lectures by Professor Howorth are disorganized and hard to follow. His slides are difficult to use to take notes in tandem with his lectures. Very poorly attended which is discouraging.",
    "I really loved this class. Professor Howorth covered a different topic every lecture which I thought was fantastic.",
    "I loved this class! Truly, the topics were interesting, and lectures were explained very clearly.",
    "Lots of good information, but maybe a bit too broad?",
    "Strengths: course material is pretty interesting. Prof. Holworth is engaging. Weaknesses: gut, so not many students take it seriously. Not sure if the total lack of coursework is a strength or a weakness?",
    "It was a well-run class, the only issue was the syllabus' exclusion of the Israel-Palistine conflict- one of the biggest challenges on the international scene today.",
    "Great readings.",
    "The course should have more opportunities that contribute to the grade.",
    "I liked how every lecture had a very different focus and allowed us all a glimpse into each challenge.",
    "The class is great for getting acquainted with many topics really quickly, but not for getting an in depth understanding of them.",
    "I thought the structure of this course was pretty well organized, so not much improvement needed there. The class didn't require too much effort, offered some great insights, and the material covered was something I think every Yalie should be aware of.",
    "It was a decent course, but I recommend it for STEM majors who don't follow the news and want to learn a bit about everything.",
    "The differences between the TAs was a weakness and the kinds of things each TA focused on and taught in section. They all varied greatly and grading was not consistent.",
    "Tremendous lectures. Opportunity to hear from Thomas Graham was a pleasure. A number of lectures were given by TAs, many of which were good, but I object to the number of lectures not taught by Prof. Holyworth. As knowledgeable as many TFs are, nobody is going to match Holyworth's charisma and erudition, and I wished he wasn't in the audience of some six or seven lectures.",
    "This class did a very good job at presenting the different issues in an unbiased way. In an international affairs class it is easy for the professor and material to be partial to one side, but I felt like I walked away understanding the arguments on both sides. Additionally, I think this class did a good job at covering a wide range of issues, from environmental to national challenges, which truly helped reinforce the notion that global challenges could come from anywhere.",
    "Strengths- very interesting weaknesses- too broad sometimes, doesn't go into depth on most topics so understanding of the topic is just vague",
    "Pros: class was a gut Con: TA was a tool",
    "The course gives a great overview but does not go into particular depth about any one challenge. The course could be strengthened by giving students the option (possibly in section) to specialize in one particular challenge area.",
    "I thought the structure of the final was well done and truly forced students to understand the course material and how it connected.",
    "Low courseload, interesting lectures and readings.",
    "most students dont engage because its only a midterm and final",
    "Strengths: interesting, exciting, relatable, current Weak: long readings",
    "Students gain a solid understanding of the challenges that affect our world today.",
    "Weaknesses: very American centric. The class could actually be international and teach about challenges that face the rest of the world other than US",
    "Strengths: light work throughout the semester and definitely do not have to do any of the readings (especially if you already have some sense of what is going on in the world and skim the headlines). Weaknesses: the strength could be a weakness, as the light and broad nature of the course attracts certain individuals who are not actually interested in the material but rather just an easy A",
    "The biggest strength of this course is the diversity of topics that are covered. Having taken it, I feel like I have a command of most current events ranging from climate change, to nuclear geopolitical politics, to basic knowledge of point of views of China, Japan, Russia, the Middle East, and the EU. Professor Howorth is an engaging lecturer, and does a pretty good job of mixing in-depth knowledge with the requirement of a survey course. Meanwhile, the biggest weakness of the course was a lack of standardization of what was happening across sections. Some sections focused a lot on map quizzes, other discussed the readings in depth, some did simulations, etc. Although the course is comprised of a lot of people, I feel like the experiences of my peers were really disparate from mine, making studying together sometimes challenging.",
    "Strengths: interesting material, good lectures, readings and notes all posted online Weaknesses: variance in work given by the TFs",
    "The lectures were informative. Sections were interesting, but often did not correspond to the lecture schedule. Grading seemed inconsistent from TA to TA.",
    "Professor Howorth did a decent job of getting topics covered in the 50 minute time constraint allotted for each class, a testament to his brilliance. However, there was a lot of knowledge that I felt we were expected to have even though this course is supposed to be an entry level one. There was a lot of knowledge that was meant to be gained from this course that I did not attain due to the impossible amount of material and the poor quality of communication in trying to relay certain wisdoms.",
    "Note taking in lectures and readings were my weaknesses.",
    "I liked the class overall, but would recommend standardizing grading and material across sections. It seemed as if some TAs gave more assignments and had different grading criteria than others.",
    "Content was great, lectures were great, section was great. I very much enjoyed this class",
    "A strength is definitely in its array of topics, because I believe the amount of topics covered was very well organized and well taught. One weakness might be the lack of written homework, which may have made it difficult to keep in track on readings and other assignments.",
    "I found the lectures for this course to be very engaging and interesting. I thought they were all very relevant to current affairs and I thought the readings really supplemented the material we were learning.",
    "Strengths: Broad range of topics covered Weakness: No one topic was really explored in depth. The professor should explore fewer topics in more depth.",
    "There are many strengths to this course, it covered a wide range of topics but at the same time delved into each one through the readings and discussion sections. The workload was very manageable and the readings were mostly interesting. I also liked that the readings consisted of articles, audios, documentaries and a ted talk, and not only having to read a hundred pages. I also enjoyed lecture very much, it was always interesting even when I did not care about the topic that much. And the lecture notes with all the pictures and charts facilitated the learning and helped me stay focused. I also liked having several 'guest lectures'. More so, the tests were well-structured and reasonable.",
    "Strengths are the lecturers -- they are experts in their fields. Weakness is that we simply covered too much and did not go in depth enough at times.",
    "Interesting and relevant topics. However, some of the content students are already familiar with.",
    "Strength is that it very well taught--Prof. Howorth is an expert and is a very engaging lecturer. It also covered a wide range of topics (1 topic per lecture), which was great because then we could learn about many different things. A downside to that is that really each lecture could be it's own class, so sometimes I felt I wanted to learn more about one subject but we were moving on to the next. Downside is the classic TA dilemma: if you have a not great TA, you're going to have a not great experience with the material.",
    "Lectures were a bit dry and sections were very dry. But Professor Howorth was a very interesting guy and some of the guest lectures were excellent. The courses content and scope was superb. Grading not so much.",
    "I appreciated the wide arrange of conflicts that were covered in class. However, I think some of the lecture materials were too broad in addressing the contemporary issues and the discussion sections lacked opportunities for in-depth conversations.",
    "There are many strengths. It was taught by a great professor with many TA's that are really smart and informed. The content was very up to date which was very helpful for outside knowledge throughout the class. It is extremely interesting to hear the viewpoints of the guest lectures."

   "comments": [
    "I would EXCEPT the final is on the last day and is an essay question but he refuses to offer another date. This is absolutely bananas! Flights are more expensive, people have to stay longer, and it's an essay!! We could do that from home! It could be timed or anything. If it isn't a real exam then why only one date?! This is so unreasonable. I know Professor Howorth is retiring so my review doesn't matter but I wanted to write anyway because his inflexibility on this point is so ridiculous. They is no reason you couldn't write a second essay question and give two date options. I might not have taken this class if I knew this would happen.",
    "yes",
    "I would greatly recommend this course to others. The subject is incredibly interesting since it is all about our present-day world and the crises that we must face, and being informed about these issues is very rewarding. It is also very possible to take since it only consists of readings and hardly any other work. This allows for it to fit in to busy schedules easily.",
    "It is an easy course to take and learn about international relations in the contemporary world.",
    "Highly recommend this course to another student, however, sadly Jolyon Howorth is not teaching it anymore and that was what made the class so interesting. He was a great lecturer and grasped your attention from the get-go. It was fun learning about current events and how they affect us, and not too much work.",
    "Yes, you learn things every student should know.",
    "really broadens your perspective on world issues",
    "Yes, especially if interested in politics.",
    "I would recommend this to a student who is looking to get a broad overview of current international challenges. While this class can be thought of as a gut, if you engage with the materials in the way that Professor Howorth and the TAs encourage you to do, it can be very rewarding and intellectually challenging.",
    "International Challenges is a great course and I'm sad to see Professor Howorth go. I am not generally very interested in political science and figured I'd never take another Humanities credit after I had fulfilled by distributional requirement. However, after shopping this course I decided to take it and was pleasantly surprised. The course overall was really low workload and I enjoyed the content. I'd definitely recommend it to another student.",
    "Yes, great, relevant class.",
    "I highly recommend this class to everyone at Yale. This is an absolute MUST TAKE. I am very glad I took this class and feel so much more informed on what is going on in the world. Definitely take it!",
    "Professor Howorth is a great lecturer and the course content is pretty interesting.",
    "Yesoverall and enjoyable class with a low workload.",
    "Yes. Easy class, light work load (depending on TA, but still in general pretty light), weekly section where you review material from lectures, readings are required by they aren't really required.",
    "Yes, but only if you are going to engage in the class. If you are taking it because it looks easy you are going to miss out on some incredible lectures that are pertinent to you now.",
    "Yes",
    "For the material, I'd recommend this to students who either don't have much experience in international relations or don't pay attention to the news. Otherwise, I'd recommend it to students who want a low-key fifth course or international relations course for the political science major, or just want to have more structured conversations about things that are happening in the world. Very low commitment if you look at the Times everyday, for example.",
    "Not really. It doesn't really delve much into current events except for consolidating an entire topic into 50 minutes, so things get really jumbled and rushed through.",
    "YES! Unfortunately this was the last time this course was being offered, but I would definitely recommend taking a similar course.",
    "Absolutely - if it's taught again. The information covered was just wide enough to get a clear understanding of most issues we're facing -- but also deep enough to get a clear understanding of exactly what the problems were.",
    "Yes.",
    "Soooo gutty. No psets\/essays, just a midterm, final, and required section (which is probably graded mostly on attendance). You could probably get a lot out of it if you did the readings, paid attention to lecture, etc - the topics are interesting. But if you've got a busy semester otherwise, it's a perfect 5th (6th?) class.",
    "I would recommend this to another student but I believe Professor Howorth said this would be the last time he teaches the class so I probably won't tell others to take it.",
    "Yes. This course is very interesting and it covers important stuff.",
    "Yes! I loved the content and section was super interesting.",
    "Yes I'd recommend it! Although I know it is the last time it is being taught.",
    "The class is relatively easy and pretty informative. It's practical more than intellectual, which can be a nice break from the rigor of many of the other Yale classes.",
    "Yes!",
    "Good overall poli sci course that surveys topics; don't go into much depth. As a STEM major, this was a good course to take for a change of pace. Be mindful of which TA you choose though; some assign extra assignments as part of their assessments.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to other students. I can honestly say I enjoyed going to lecture and learning about the challenges the world faces today and it was a pretty low workload so it's super easy to sit back and just enjoy the learning.",
    "It depends on the student. It is such a broad survey that you don't get too much out of the class. I would recommend it to a student who does not carefully follow the news and would like a background on a lot of current events. It is a good 5th class.",
    "I would recommend this course only if comfortable with the TA after rthe first section. They play a big role.",
    "Absolutely, at least if taught by Holyworth. He is a wonderful lecturer with broad knowlege of global affairs. While this is rightly regarded as a gut, it is still one of the most substantive classes I've taken, if you are willing to commit yourself to doing readings and attending lecture.",
    "Yes, I recommend it! Not just because it was a class you could float by in, but also because it did genuinely give me a good base for tackling contemporary political dilemmas.",
    "I would recommend this class to all Yale students interested in engaging with or simply understanding current events. It really gave me a strong understanding of current events, America's relationship with the rest of the world, and the basis of America's policy towards international challenges. This class provided me with a good overview of these events, and little background in political science was needed to understand these events.",
    "Yes but not offering it anymore lol",
    "Yes. I finally have a broad understanding of the worlds conflicts and how they relate to each other.",
    "Yes- very interesting, easy, light workload. Overall great.",
    "Bigly",
    "I would recommend this course because it gives a great overview of global challenges.",
    "Course will No longer be offered, but if it were, I would recommend. Interesting topics and not a high workload.",
    "yes because t is good to help you decide what youre interested in and gain a broad knowledge of the world",
    "Yes, definitely if one is looking for a class that is engaging and based on current problems that can be used in everyday conversation.",
    "Yes",
    "Yes and choose your TA wisely",
    "Great survey course to learn about current issues and acquire the analytical skills and frameworks to understand them",
    "Yes, big lecture without a lot of work. Readings can be a lot sometimes but you definitely do not have to do all of them, or any of them for that matter, if you already know about basic world events and global politics. Good introductory class in global affairs and political science for freshmen and sophomores, though my semester there was quite a sizable number of juniors and seniors taking it for an easy A.",
    "A super standard intro survey PLSC course. Take it because youll gain exposure to virtually all current events issues, take it because Professor Howorth is actually a pretty good lecturer, or take it because its not a lot of work at all and pretty easy. If you keep up to date with the news, and\/or go to lecture, you can probably get an A.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student if they are looking for an interesting and low-workload survey of the many international challenges that the world faces today.",
    "This course is very low workload, and is good to take if you know very little about the international world.",
    "If you are not very interested in international relations or find foreign relations confusing, do not take this course. Some of the lectures were absolutely awful and skipped over so much information, it always felt like we were going a mile a minute and if you got left behind, not much you could do about it.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to a peer.",
    "Yes definitely! This class is especially good if you're looking for a fifth class that teaches you about some of the most pressing issues over the next few decades.",
    "great class",
    "This course is a great course if you want an overview of international challenges. Coming from a STEM major, this is a great introduction as it touches on pretty much every important foreign policy challenges you might hear about in the news. It makes you feel more well-versed in current events.",
    "Yes, I loved this course and would definitely recommend it to other students.",
    "Yes - a gem of a class.",
    "Absolutely, without a doubt, this class was definitely one of the best classes I have taken at Yale. I have also learned a lot about the institutional, natural and security challenges that the world is facing these days as well as other future threats.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to any political science major, or any student looking for a fairly broad and manageable analysis of major current events.",
    "Unfortunately this class won't be taught again, but it was an amazing class that I'm very glad I took.",
    "I would recommend for anyone looking for a class with light workload and more recent and relevant topics.",
    "I would recommend this as a class to add on during a high-workload semester, because this class is very low workload. I hardly did any readings (although they were interesting and current! I just didn't put in the time). It's also just generally an interesting class, especially as someone who doesn't keep up with current events or read the newspaper as often as I should.",
    "Yes I would certainly recommend this course. Gave me an outlook on the world today and also allows me to engage in discussions on current world issues that I once knew nothing about.",
    "Great intro to political science theory and an excellent way of putting world news into context. Lectures were a bit dry and section\/grading is very TA dependent though. Good guest lectures, especially the Russia one. Would recommend as a pretty chill lecture with very interesting subject matter.",
    "Yes, because I found the curriculum to be very interesting.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student if they are well-informed and motivated to study the various global conflicts. The course moves very quickly because of its expansive topics.",
    "Yes strongly recommend. The work is not demanding since it is only a midterm\/final but at the same time you have to keep up with the material throughout class to have a voice in section. It is very interesting and fun so the more you learn the more you can relate the class back to the themes of the course."
