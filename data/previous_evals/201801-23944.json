    "cover a variety of topics",
    "amazing",
    "Good",
    "The strengths include that lecturers come from a bunch of fields which are related to toxicology, and we therefore can learn a lot of topics on this class.",
    "Only strenghts; great variety of material and extremely interactive discussion friday sessions.",
    "Great course. Very informative and well taught.",
    "This course was overall very good. I learned a lot from the guest speakers and appreciated how Dr. Vasiliou encouraged us to explore topics that we were interested in with the various assignments. The Friday discussions were nice when we had specific assignments or speakers attend but sometimes I was confused on what exactly was happening in them, so some extra clarity regarding those would be useful.",
    "Great course, amazing guest lecturers, and not too much work.",
    "Our professor Vasiliou has a very good design of this class and invited outstanding officers and professors to our class and gave us very good lectures.",
    "Good seminar series on topics in toxicology but did not teach more than superficial information about toxicology. I learned some things but do not think my overall knowledge of toxicology improved throughout this course. There were also no exams throughout this course, as all the exams were changed to papers. This was fine, but should have been reflected in the syllabus with specific due dates and instructions. The debates could have also been improved with better class interaction and participation.",
    "Great and interesting",
    "I think this course could use more organization. It would also be useful to have a toxicology class more relevant for HC management.",
    "The course was interesting and I learned a lot. It is a tough balance since toxicology can be a very science (chemistry, biochemistry) heavy topic, but there are no science prerequisites for the course- I think the class did a good job of trying to balance giving the science information that we needed vs. the class' ability level, however I do think we could have gone a bit more into depth on the chem\/biochem side of things. I appreciated the emphasis on debates, essays rather than eams"

    "Instructor: Vasilis Vasiliou \u00a0Professor Vasiliou had a very good design of the class. He encouraged us to actively participate in the class, through debate and topic writing. We learned a lot, from this class, about the knowledge of toxicology. We also had opportunities exchanging ideas with outstanding officers and professors in this field and got a sense of the trend in this field.",
    "Instructor: Vasilis Vasiliou \u00a0The instructor is friendly and seems to care about students. He purposefully teaches this course in a more superficial manner, not wanting to explain concepts that might be more difficult, such as metabolic steps and mechanisms of toxicity.",

    "Great course. Take it to learn more on Toxicology, product design and sustainable design for green chemistry.",
    "I would recommend this course. It was a great learning experience and the outside lecturers really enhanced the course.",
    "Definitely take this course. There is not too much work, the guest lectures are amazing, and the professor and TA are kind and helpful.",
    "I strongly recommend this class to other students. It is a good opportunity to study some of the hot topics in toxicology.",
    "I would recommend taking this course only if it is a requirement. If you are interested in toxicology, it would be a better use of your time to learn on your own rather than taking this semester-long course. This class is too simplified if you have prior knowledge about toxicology.",
    "Yes. This course is very interesting"
