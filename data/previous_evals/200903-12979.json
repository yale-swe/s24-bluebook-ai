   "comments": [
    "I enjoyed the material and found it relevant.",
    "The sequence of the material and the syllabus was very well thought out and seemed to flow nicely.",
    "The material presented was clear and well structured, and included a wide scope of writing techniques, communication styles, and polemic opinions. The sequence was a bit choppy, but that is only the nature of the wide range of writing styles covered. Each week was essentially a survey of a method for delivering written information for a specific effect or purpose.",
    "Carter has this course very well planned out from the sequence to the readings and assignments. I do not believe anything was missing, however everything was covered very fast which could only be remedied by being spread over two semesters.",
    "The body of information was presented well. The syllabus was excellent and very clear. The readings were well chosen and applicable to the in-class discussion. The assignments were very well thought out and spaced appropriately throughout the semester. Having the final paper due before Thanksgiving break is a great idea.",
    "One of my favorite parts of the syllabus was the reading. It was manageable, well-organized, and informative.Also, I like the format of a series of two-page prompts followed by one larger paper.",
    "Professor Wiseman presented the syllabus and course focus very clearly during the first class and stuck to both very closely. The course is fairly specified in focus, so we didn't wander too much from the original theme. Wiseman did a good job at mixing guest lecturers, slide presentations, class discussions, readings and writings.",
    "-Overall the body of material worked well. As each new week presented us with a different type of architectural writing, there was always a freshness to what readings\/assignments we had.-What about adding a component that deals with unconventional architectural writing, like new media, internet, graphical reviews etc.. This class could begin to look forward as to how architecture is presented in writing.",
    "everything was very well organized. I think the body of material was very much appropriate to the time and the subject treated by the course."

   "comments": [
    "Since Mr. Wiseman has such immense experience as a non-fiction writer, I thought the course would focus more specifically on what he learned from that experience. While he did teach us how to write a structured critique, I thought I learned the most about how good writing is, like good thinking, ultimately balanced. By teaching us to not \u0093carry water\u0094 for a designer, he gave our work more validity as we tried to understand a design from a less polemical point of view.",
    "To become a better writer and they were most definitely met.",
    "I was hoping that the class would help to refine my writing style and help me to express my ideas more clearly and concisely. I would say with no reservations that my expectations were met and exceeded.",
    "I came out of this course with the tools helpful for writing about my architectural ideas and with the knowledge necessary to communicate with clients when I become a professional.",
    "I hoped to refine my writing skills and understand the mechanics that go into writing good papers that deal specifically with architectural subjects. I think that this class fulfilled these expectations extremely well.",
    "I expected to understand more about the breadth of architectural writing and to improve my skills. I think both these things have happened.",
    "At times, the overall purpose of the class seemed unclear and vague. It was not a class on grammar or style; it was not a non-fiction writing class; it was not a fiction writing class; it was not an architectural theory class. I expected a more rigorous writing seminar with more instruction on technique.",
    "Wiseman met my expectations exactly. I took the course to become a better writer, specifically as it pertains to architecture and I believe I came out a much better, clearer writer. I appreciated how Wiseman allowed us to do a variety of writing from descriptive to opinion based to more formal research driven.",
    "-I had perhaps expected more workshop like modules.-More discussion; though not the fault of Carter, not every student was as active in the discussion as I'd like. So student body failed in that respect.",
    "The course fullfilled all my expectations."

   "question_text": "Comment on the value of this course to you.",
   "comments": [
    "The greatest value of the course comes from Mr. Wiseman\u0092s ability to link clear writing to clear thinking. He claims (and I agree) that if you can write about something clearly, you can think about it clearly. Since the course focuses on critiquing architecture, its greatest value is teaching students to consider design in a more nuanced way.",
    "This course is very valuable to any young architect as writing is one of the main tools we must use to obtain jobs.",
    "The course was extremely valuable as a tool for learning to self edit and to peer edit others' written work. The course will continue to benefit my writing in other courses, and will impact my professional writing into the future.",
    "I am not completely comfortable with communicating my ideas in writing. This course has been so valuable to my personal comfort level with writing at a professional level especially because Carter showed me how much of a difference writing can make in the architecture field.",
    "-This course was incredibly valuable. It helped me to become more comfortable with my writing and in my ability to critique written work.",
    "I plan to take the lessons and methodology I learned in the class and apply them to every writing assignment throughout my graduate studies (and beyond). The instructor's emphasis on clarity in communication is extremely applicable to both writing and architecture in general.",
    "I would not argue if writing was more incorporated into YSOA's syllabus.",
    "I think the course was very valuable. My only suggestion to the professor might be to encourage\/allow more \"big idea\" topics for the final paper. I had originally hoped to write about a broader topic paralleling my own architectural interests, but Wiseman encouraged each student to write about a more specified building or topic. In the end, I think Professor Wiseman was correct, but it may make sense to have a different course allowing students who are interested in grant writing or research-driven writing to fine-tune their skills while still taking advantage of the clear yet poignant writing skills that Wiseman professes.",
    "It was valuable. Having taken this class first semester it also helped in getting back into school mode (having been away for a few years) and into an essay writing mindset. Certainly helped when it came to write essays for other classes.If anything, I was hoping the class would be further rigorous or perhaps, more exploratory. Sometimes it felt too tame.",
    "The course helped my to become more aware of the writing process for a non-fictional subject. By learning a very simple technique, I understood the many perspectives available to describe the same subject. Furthermore, the course helped me to become more critical of authors and important works architectural history and critique within the american context."

   "question_text": "Comment on the effectiveness of the teaching by the courses's instructor",
   "comments": [
    "My only problem with Mr. Wiseman's teaching style was that he seemed cynical about our abilities to write. While that cynicism is undoubtedly rooted in years of reading bad writing from supposedly top-tier students, I still think that people rise more to the occasion when they\u0092re given the benefit of the doubt.",
    "The instructors feedback on papers, as well as the TA's was extremely helpful. Class discussions were always clear and never dull.",
    "Professor Wiseman is an intelligent instructor who conveys information with impeccable clarity and humility. Despite his expertise, he in no way preaches to his class, but rather encourages his students to direct the conversation of the class and to lead the peer review of each others' work. The structure was refreshing in a school where you are constantly faced with one sided critique of your work.",
    "Carter is amazing and knows exactly what he is doing. From what he has said, Hillary was helpful this semester to focus the material to the cohesive and manageable work load of this course.",
    "-Carter Wiseman is an excellent, approachable, knowledgeable, and understanding professor.",
    "The instructor was very knowledge on the subject matter and obviously has a lot of experience with writing. He was always very encouraging and helpful. More than any other instructor I had this semester, he seemed to take a personal and genuine interest in helping students succeed.",
    "Carter was very helpful and encouraging. I think that more constructive criticism would have been good.",
    "The TA, Hilary Bignear was always prompt in responses and fulfilled all of the needs of the class.I would also like to point out how much I enjoyed Alan Organschi and Fred Clarke coming in to serve as guest lecturers. They offered some valuable insight and allowed the class to gain a better understanding of how writing informs their respective firms.",
    "-Carter is definitely knowledgeable when is comes to writing.-The vast and different writing samples as course reading materials was also good; it covered many styles and matter.-Although the TA's job was limited, she was efficient in what she did.",
    "Professor Wiseman was very effective, available and helpful in leading the discussion in class and developing the project for the final assignement together with the students."

   "question_text": "Suggestions you may have for course improvements:",
   "comments": [
    "Really great course!",
    "A wider variety of RFP samples for that reading week is really all that I can think of.",
    "The only recommendation for improvement would be to engage in the student peerreview process earlier in the seminar, perhaps with one of the shorter assignments. This will help students refine their critical commentary and allow the writers to prepare for such commentary in advance of the final paper. The seminar was an enjoyable and educating experience, and I would recommend it to anyone wishing to refine their skills of communication.",
    "My favorite part of the course was reading my peers final papers and giving\/getting verbal criticism. I would have liked there to have been time to be able to critically respond to more of the short essays at the beginning of the semester.",
    "The readings on architectural criticism did seem to have a New York centric view, so maybe the selection for that unit could expand a bit to be more national (or even international). Also, I would have liked to have a second group critique earlier in the semester. Whilewe, as architecture students, are familiar with the criticism process as it relates to design work, it would also be helpful to practice the give\/receive aspect of critiquing written work.",
    "More writing prompts relating to the final paper, maybe?",
    "My suggestions for the course have been included with my other answers.",
    "-There could be more writing assignments. We had two plus the major paper. Perhaps adding one more assignment.-The class was most valuable as a writing workshop where the class sat down and individually looked at writing samples and each other's essays.We discussed what worked, what didn't and why. So more of this.-Less business\/in-office type of writing. Though it is something we will all face, that side of writing is more valuable in doing it rather than learning by example.-The final papers were most intriguing when they were not about singular buildings but conditions on architecture. For instance, memorial monuments and casinos because it forced us to look at architecture differently. I would suggest pushing the class to this end. Plain building reviews feel stagnant and run of the mill. The writer may get something out of it, but those reading it do not. It puts the class into a comfortable zone, whereas writing about something less conventional could lead to interesting pieces\/responses.",
    "During the course I became curious of the work done by students during the past years. I think that include some of the most interesting work done by Wiseman's student in the body of readings would be helpful to future students to envision a choice of styles, subjects and language applied to a succesful student's writing project."
