    "Really cool focus, liked the casual atmosphere a lot. The syllabus was great, but the longer denser works should have came earlier in the semester, I think.",
    "The course organization was great. My one suggestion would be carving out more time at the end of the course for full student presentations. Maybe eliminate the theory paper in the first part and instead get students launched on their projects sooner so they can present and have some more discussion of their own land-grab case studies. That really gets students to apply the theory and other readings to their own topic...pushing thinking in an applied context."
