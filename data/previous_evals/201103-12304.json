   "comments": [
    "Great class! Definitely try to get in if you have an interest in graphic design. All the work is done in collage format, cutting and pasting paper. You will not learn computer tools for graphic design, which I soon realized was a good thing - this class teaches you the basics and the important elements of graphic design that you need before you get on the computer. The assignments were challenging but enjoyable, and the critiques were extremely helpful. Take it!",
    "I loved it. Great intro design class. Be prepared to do a lot of paper cutting, you're not learning how to use photoshop or indesign or illustrator. But the skills you learn will definitely transfer to computer graphics. Projects can be pretty time consuming so plan ahead. You often do several drafts of a project so be flexible and let it evolve.",
    "A must take for anyone remotely interested in graphic design. Be aware, though, that no computers are used in the class, and that all the projects are done by hand. In other words, there's lots of time-consuming collage work. Take the class with Henk--he's amazing.",
    "This is an incredible class. Most classes are spent critiquing projects, which means that you have a different project due in every class. Expect a huge time commitment and a huge workload, but it's so different from other work for Yale classes that it was always really fun for me, even if it did cause many all nighters. Don't take this course as an extra credit or as something that you're just going to half-ass. Henk is an excellent teacher, and to present him with mediocre work is embarrassing because it feels like you're wasting his time. The other students in the class will also be working just as hard as you, and because the class size is so small it's good for bonding as well. Take this class, but only if you have the time to devote to it.",
    "I would definitely say that if you are interested in graphic design, take this class. However, bear in the mind that this class definitely does not involve any computer design or photoshopping at all. You will be basically cutting and pasting posters and assignments all semester long, so be willing to put in that kind of effort. Overall, a wonderful class with Henk.",
    "This is a great class; Henk is wonderful, and very supportive, which makes critiques helpful but painless. It's a good amount of work, and know that you're going to spend ~$70 on supplies over the semester out of pocket.",
    "Great course. Take it if you get the chance.",
    "This class introduces the basics of graphic design that would be relevant to any field in which visual appearance is important. It teaches how to approach and critique work effectively to get to a good product. I would absolutely recommend it to a fellow student, with the warning that making the work will always take longer than you think it will.",
    "I would definitely recommend Art 132 Intro Graphic Design to a fellow student. It requires a lot of time and patience, so don't take it in a semester that you know you'll be overloaded with other coursework\/extracurriculars.",
    "It's a good class dedicated to the hands-on basics of graphic design. Some may not consider it 'advanced' (since it doesn't use anything computer based for assignments), but it is exactly what it should be - a helpful, instructive, introductory course to design. It had a very reasonable workload, but wasn't too easy; there was a good amount of work in that there wasn't a lot, but there definitely wasn't a little.",
    "A great introductory course which teaches basics of design. Definitely recommend it to the hopeful graphic designer.Be prepared for hands-on (as opposed to digital) approach. The assignments built on each other well (from black and white lines, to collage, to text and then to color) and their progression help you feel that a) you're capable of learning how to design and b) that you are learning how to design."
