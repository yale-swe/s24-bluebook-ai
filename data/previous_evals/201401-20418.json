   "comments": [
    "This topic is super interesting in theory, but the style in which it is taught does not lead to strong analysis during discussion. It is still possible to get something out of it, but it's not worth it if you really want to go deep into the topic. Overall I felt Eh.",
    "I loved this course. The book-a-week reading can be tough, but it's generally enough to read half to two-thirds to be able to participate well. Marcia does a great job of explaining why masculinity studies is an overlooked and underdeveloped field, and why it is important to discuss men's issues. Additionally, this course is a great way to learn about anthropology and its challenges, from ethics and standards to methodology. I would definitely recommend this course.",
    "Fantastic class with a fantastic reading list!",
    "ANTH 455 is an exploration of masculinity and men's health through reading of 12 ethnographic studies. It meets once a week for 2.5 hours, during which students lead the discussions about the books. The workload is not bad. Weekly reading responses, 2 short papers, leading one discussion, and a final comparative book review (15-20 pages). The topics discussed are fascinating and Professor Inhorn is wonderful. I would definitely recommend this class to another student. It was a great experience in which I learned so much about a unique topic in a relaxed and awesome way!",
    "I would most certainly recommend this course to another student. It is best for students interested in anthropology, public health or men\u2019s issues. There is a book to read for every week and, in addition to the weekly reading responses and book reports, that makes the workload pretty heavy. However, the course themes are exciting and you will never think about masculinity in the same way again. Great class!",
    "A very excellent course. Difficult, intensive, highly critical, and extremely rewarding.",
    "A great literature based seminar, highly recommended for anyone interested in the health consequences of beliefs about gender and gender roles."
