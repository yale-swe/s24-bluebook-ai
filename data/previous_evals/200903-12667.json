   "comments": [
    "It is an interesting course with not too much work from which you nonetheless learn very much both about what it means to research archaeological sites and about what it means to be evaluating a sacred site and the culture which used it. I would definitely recommend the course, as Prof. Hale is great and class houses arelaxed, friendly environment. Even though it met in the afternoons at a time somewhat inconvenient for me, I always looked forward to going.",
    "It was an overview of important archaeological sites around the world. It was dictated based on students's own presentations.",
    "It was a joke. Dont waste your time, though take Hale's lecture class because he is the man.",
    "This course was incredibly low key. I wouldn't recommend it if you actually want to learn a lot about the subject matter, because it's basically a student-run (through presentations) overview of a bunch of sacred sites with almost no required reading, so discussion was pretty superficial. But it's a chill way to fulfill a social science, and isn't a bad introduction to archaeological questions.",
    "Archaeology of Sacred Sites is an interesting, easy seminar. There is very little reading each week, and you determine your own topic of presentation."
