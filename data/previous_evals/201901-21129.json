    "I gained a broader insight into the historiographical debates on colonialism in Africa and the varied methodologies scholars use to approach key questions.",
    "This course addresses many of the fundamental arguments and interpretations of the African colonial period. We learned about the various forms of, \"motives\" behind, and mechanisms by which colonialism was practiced throughout various parts of the continent and by different powers. This syllabus for this course includes works from various disciplines, from anthropologists to political scientists.",
    "perspective on certain key books\/authors in African colonial history",
    "Critical Thinking skills",
    "Readings for this course reflected virtually all the sub-continent of Africa and it exposed us to the different colonial experiences of the different ethnic groups on the continent.",
    "A general history of British and French colonialism in Africa. This included not only specific approaches, such as economic or political histories, but also an appreciation for the larger historiography of colonialism in Africa.",
    "This course provided some useful analytical frameworks with which to think about the question of colonialism in Africa. It was also useful"

   "comments": [
    "It might be helpful to re-arrange some of the texts so that we have broader overviews at the beginning, or to read bits and pieces of Cooper's text alongside other readings to get more context.",
    "This course brought together students from various disciplines and with various levels of experience with the subject matter into lively and productive discussion. The focus on writing and posing questions made for many exciting seminars.",
    "Several good foundational books were included; possibly more discussion on articles when a book and article are both assigned",
    "Dr. Harms is brilliant and to be taught by him was truly an honor.",
    "I really enjoyed the readings for this course. I thought Prof Harms did excellent with his monograph selections. The readings were well organized in the form of a build-up from one week to the other. At the end of the course, Prof Harms asked students to make recommendations to improve the course for subsequent years. This to me is very useful and shows how he is committed to designing courses that reflect the needs of students.",
    "The strength of the course was its breadth; reading the history of British and French colonialism from a variety of angles offered students a range of perspectives and accounts. One weakness, however, might be in the geographic distribution of readings; the majority focused on western and southern Africa.",
    "Its interdisciplinary readings was a valuable asset for thinking in diverse ways and with diverse frames."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course to any and all history students. The readings and conversations from this class have definitely altered how I approach history in many ways, and I think all students, especially those who may not be familiar with African History, could greatly benefit from it.",
    "Yes, if they are interested in African or colonial history more broadly",
    "Yes, if there is a discussion to be had about colonialism, Dr. Harm's expertise is warranted.",
    "Yes! Prof Harms created a friendly environment for students to engage in the discussions. In addition, students read some of the most authoritative and thought-provoking monographs on colonialism in Africa.,",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who is interested in learning more about European colonialism in Africa. The course is structured in a way that covers several major historical works within the field, as well as providing a broad overview of the discourse of colonialism.",
    "I will recommend this course given that the subject it engages, colonialism in Africa, is one that has had a profound effect on history."
