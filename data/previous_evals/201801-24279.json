    "This course enhanced my ability to program using python and tensor flow. I developed mathematical skills that I did not posses prior to course. Developed a much deeper understanding of why neural nets work, how they work, and how to program them for optimal performance.",
    "Building deep networks",
    "How deep learning algorithms worked and how to use tensorflow\/keras.",
    "TensorFlow, NumPy, Mathematical Foundations of DL",
    "A lot of deep learning techniques!",

    "A working knowledge of Tensorflow, understanding of types of neural nets.",
    "Learning and training deep neural networks, tuning networks and a general idea of optimization",
    "Deep Learning is an extremely topical class that forces you to read relevant textbooks. The Problem Sets were incredibly helpful for developing understanding. The main topics we covered in the Problem Sets were Backpropagation, Optimizers, Regularization, Convolutional Neural Networks, Autoencoders and gained a lot of familiarity with the tensorflow libraries. It was definitely not math heavy, but I think they did a great job of introducing enough math to help students understand the intuition behind the concepts. I did not attend many lectures, but the lectures were far beyond the concepts I listed above.",
    "I gained an understanding of the wide variety of deep learning techniques and learned some tensorflow through psets.",

   "comments": [
    "I think it's really good that there are more and more machine learning-type courses being offered at Yale. Although there's always room for improvement, I think this course is a step in the right direction. I get that this is supposed to be a survey course of sorts that just touches on the main topics in the deep learning, and it does a good job of that. However, I think it would be really good to maybe even split this course into two parts. The first part could be offered in the fall and it could cover the \"essentials\" like regular NNs, CNNs, and RNNs. Then the follow-up course could be offered in the spring and go into more detail on things like reinforcement learning and GANs. Overall, as a single-semester survey course, I think it does a good job of covering the basics and I'm sure it will only get better as it gets refined over the years :)",
    "I think the course structure is good. Lectures are fine, but the homework is long yet not very helpful.",

    "Emphasis on homeworks and projects rather than exams fit this class well",
    "There is little help when we have difficulties.",
    "Strengths: Kevin's lectures were pretty good and clear, and you will definitely come out with a good theoretical and practical understanding of neural networks. If you've already taken a course using neural networks, though, a lot of this will be review. Weaknesses: The homework. Some of the psets were absolutely ridiculous, and the TA's didn't know how to do them. Going to office hours was useless since they couldn't help you, and they basically just told us to put anything and they would grade leniently. So, most of us just BSed answers and got full credit, and it felt like we weren't actually learning. The homework absolutely needs to be looked at in future years.",
    "I would like more application or potentially have some guest speakers.",
    "good mix of theory and practice",
    "The worst part of the course was the lack of feedback on homework solutions. There were no solutions and never any comments on how to improve code. Most of the TAs did not know how to use Tensorflow which made office hours challenging. The lectures were also mostly following the Nielsen book and it would have been nice to have another source of information and not just a repetition in class.",
    "Strengths are many: explanations were often clear, lectures were quite organized, homeworks were helpful Weakness: some lectures were quite condensed what led to a rush explaining material",
    "Assignments are too simple.",
    "Having a real professor, not a guy that dissapears and leaves the TAs on charge",
    "The course was well structured and we covered interesting topics. However, the exercises were not very interesting and I did not learn a lot doing them. I would suggest that the exercises be made more challenging and interesting, but also at the same time resources should be available to students to be able to tackle the exercises as well as the final project. There was not a lot of help available in terms of learning tensorflow and the nuts and bolts of programming for deep learning.",
    "Really interesting subject matter. The co-instructor postgrad Kevin Moon and the team of ULA's were great.",
    "I wish it were less of a survey course and dived deeper into the mathematics behind some of the topics discussed. In addition, while the psets were well-designed, for a class being taught for the first time, the programming assignments could have involved some more coding exercises.",
    "Strength: the lecture covers much important knowledge I did not know. Weakness: no weakness",
    "good lecture assignments can be more useful",
    "Some lectures towards the beginning were well put together.. by the end it sometimes seemed random and unprepared Homeworks also seemed hastily put together",
    "Fairly rigorous problem sets which are a good blend of both the theory and application (read: writing code). However, most of the class materials can be found online, but I guess we are talking about a super hot field anyway.",
    "The material is quite interesting, and the research results presented in lecture were on the cutting edge in a way that I have not seen in my other classes. A weakness is that undergraduate employees of the course taught all (I believe) of the lectures after the midterm, except for the closing lecture.",
    "Psets would have very arduous problems mixed with extremely easy ones for the same point value. Lectures were very dry.",
    "Strengths- good assignments, good feedback mechanism, engaged professors and TAs Improvements- Classes can be more applied",
    "I think that the teaching could be improved. I think there is a motley of students who take this class, and participation based learning is incredibly important to keep students engaged in those type of lectures, which we mostly just missed.",
    "One way this course could be improved is by combining the theory and applications better-- the psets and lectures didn't overlap much.",
    "strength: good course structure weakness: assignment is too hard",
    "The course did force me to spend time with deep learning material and therefore learn how to build deep nets. However, the homework contained a lot of busywork. They were long, but uncomplicated for the most part. Would have liked to see less explain what this line of code does questions. Some questions were ill-defined, especially on the first homework. The lectures didnt contain much material that wasnt in the course books, so class meetings werent super useful. Graders were generous, but would take off a half-point or a point for something random most times. Received a point off for a missing question that was present, for example. Seemed like lazy grading.",
    "Strengths: nice class slides, great (and free) accompanying textbooks, a lot of freedom to do the final project.",
    "The subject is new and offered in very few universities. Most of the value addition for me happened in initial 6 classes. Kevin is a good instructor. TAs did a great job with class teaching. Weakness: I am not confident on developing a neural network from scratch in python. Programming is the weakest link in the course. Demonstration of code, sample codes could have improved my take away from the course.",
    "Good",
    "Lectures were far removed from practical work",
    "Important info covered. This is legitimately a useful course but it could have been done much better. The slides should have been more than just reading off slides that felt as if they were copied out of the book. The course should also be more developed so that hw's are not straight out of the book and so that the end of semester project is initiated earlier than April. Too much of the hw, especially the first one felt like busy work.",
    "good",
    "The course wisely draws very closely from strong textbooks, which allows students to read and clarify concepts on their own. The homework assignments are very clearly structured and feature several \"build up code file-by-file\" format questions, which I deeply appreciated and felt truly helped me understand the somewhat foreign TensorFlow process. However, the assignments were quite long, and as a result grading rarely entailed any feedback. If instructors are not able to spend sufficient time to deliver feedback on assignments, perhaps they should be shortened, or at least 1-2 questions per assignment should be chosen for strong grading, as clear feedback on assignments and project proposals\/update reports was lacking.",
    "Strength: the first half of classes were very detailed and had good slides to accompany the lectures. Weakness: the second half was mostly given by undergrad students talking about their own experiences; that was somewhat interesting, but the quality of the material presented and explanations were way below that of Prof Moon."

    "It is an OK course. It may or may not be helpful depending on what you need.",
    "Not sure, since the course covers a lot of content, but has little instruction about how to start ourselves.",
    "I'd recommend this to a student who doesn't know about neural networks and wants to learn. If they already have experience, this class would mostly just be good for getting practical experience using tensorflow. Anyone thinking of taking this should know that office hours are useless and you are on your own.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student who wants to develop a deep knowledge in the subject. I would not recommend to beginners or students without the appropriate math backgrounds to truly develop an understanding of the material.",
    "Yes. very useful skills can be learned",
    "If someone is self-motivated to actually read the textbooks and put time into the homeworks, then it is useful.",
    "Yes - highly",
    "Strongly recommended!",
    "No, this professor doesnt engage",
    "If you're interested in AI or ML related stuff then this class is a must take! Especially if Kevin Moon is still teaching.",
    "Take it if you are interested in deep learning and machine learning, but not already an expert. Anybody who has decent experience working with deep nets will likely find the class a little slow.",
    "Would totally recommend.",
    "Yes, very helpful",
    "yes",
    "I think it will be very different in the future under completely different professors, and also if it is planned to accommodate the level of interest that it received",
    "I would recommend this course to a student who is very interested in deep learning, as I learned a lot from the cutting edge research presented later in the semester. I would take it again if I could. However, students who strongly value professorial engagement perhaps should shy away from this course as many lectures are not taught by professors.",
    "Yes, if you want to be thrown into Tensorflow and get a survey level understanding of the different neural networks and their underlying mechanisms.",
    "Yes , must take if you are interested to learn deep learning",
    "I would recommend this course! I thought the problem sets helped facilitate learning and actually learned the concepts well. The psets were sometimes very very long, but they consisted of both concept based questions (with proofs sometimes or simply explanations) and coding (which walked through tensorflow and really helped you learn what the code was doing and how to create working autoencoders, conv neural networks etc.). Also, we later found out that the psets seem to be graded on completion. The main topics we covered in the Problem Sets were Backpropagation, Optimizers, Regularization, Convolutional Neural Networks, Autoencoders. It was definitely not math heavy, but I think they did a great job of introducing enough math to help students understand the intuition behind the concepts. I did not attend many lectures, but the lectures were far beyond the concepts I listed above. To truly appreciate everything this course has to offer, I think you should make sure to set aside more time for this class. That being said, I initially went to every lecture and did not find the lecture style that conducive to my personal learning. Also for the final project, make sure to continue working on during the school year and attempt to go into the TA and relevant resources for help to truly get the most out of the course.",
    "Yes, deeplearning is an important topic in today's world",
    "Yes; super interesting and practical while not being too much work.",
    "Instructor is most important for this course. Kevin did a good job. If programming sessions (in class) and sample code is discussed during the course every week, this course is worth the time and effort. A reasonable challenging project and a good team will help a lot.",
    "Good",
    "Yes, it is a good into to deep learning",
    "Not as it was. Again the info taught was very useful but it was straight from the book.",
    "partly",
    "I think this is an excellent survey of topics in deep learning, and would recommend it to anyone interested in learning more about the subject. You will definitely get out of it what you put in: there is a high degree of autonomy, and--when I took it--not much instructor feedback on work, so a personal commitment to reading the textbook and understanding assignment questions will be the key factor in how much you feel you learned.",
    "Yes, you can definitely improve your knowledge on deep networks with this course."
