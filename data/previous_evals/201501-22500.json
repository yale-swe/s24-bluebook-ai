    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. Primarily, I think because of the teacher. Ustadha Sarab is incredibly kind and compassionate but also able to accomplish a lot in a class. The class is a fair amount of work and you have to be dedicated, but if you put the time into it and learn the material rather than just trying to get the homework done, it's totally worth it. Class projects are fun and assignments are sometimes creative and lead to fun class discussions. I was amazed at the end of this semester how much I had learned since knowing nothing 9 months ago. The class works to improve vocabulary as well as knowledge of grammar structure. Writing and conversation are also stressed. I went in hearing bad things about the Arabic department at Yale, however I have not had any such experience. I think it's important to find a class as well as section that has a dedicated teacher as well as a motivated group of students who are excited by the idea of learning Arabic, rather than a chore they simply must do.",
    "This is a good continuation of ARBC 110-- the tests are somewhat harder, but if you pay attention and study before them, you'll be fine. There are graded writing assignments which I actually enjoyed but I know were challenging for some students. Keep taking Arabic!",
    "I would recommend this class. Don't expect to be able to speak arabic after the first year, but if you're patient, it can be a lot of fun.",
    "If you already took L1, it's the exact same thing. Vocabulary lessons out of Al Kitaab, 4 written tests, some quizzes, and a final presentation. The day to day homework sometimes takes a while, but it's just routine work. Typical language class really.",
    "I would recommend Arabic 120 to a fellow student, particularly with this professor. I never thought that I would be this far in my studies for Arabic after two semesters, but I definitely think I could go to an Arabic speaking country and do well for myself. The only thing is that Arabic in general is a difficult language to learn and the class is also very time and work intensive. This is not just a whatever class and you have to be very serious about learning the language. THere is always at least one to two hours of homework a night and sometimes there are projects you must also do. The exams and quizzes are definitely manageable and always based off of the work and vocabulary you have been learning, and if you study for the tests you will definitely do well.",
    "ARBC 120 is a class that will require you to dedicate a fair amount of time in order for you to acquire the language, but in doing so, validates the entire experience given the wide-range of implications for knowing it."
