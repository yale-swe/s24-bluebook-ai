   "comments": [
    "Take this class if you are interested in the field of ecology. However, be aware that 95% of the people in the class are required to take it for their major, so there isn't an extreme amount of excitement or engagement when it comes to the material, save for a few people.",
    "A crash course in the basics of ecology. It is pretty fast-paced and math-heavy (though nothing too advanced or complicated). The tests are a little tricky, and the paper is what you make of it.",
    "EEB 220 is a good class that isn't especially hard. I enjoyed writing the paper and felt that it was really helpful in teaching me how to write a scientific paper like one that might be published in a journal. The paper was probably the best part of the class.",
    "This is not going to be anyone's favorite class... it's extremely useful and often very interesting, but not, per se, \"fun.\" Take it because you'll learn a lot of very fundamental EEB concepts which you'll use forever.",
    "It's a great course that is well taught and the material is interesting. The professors are great, I would definitely recommend it to a fellow student. You should take it!",
    "Don't take this class if you're looking for an easy A.",
    "This class is a good introductory ecology class. If you need to take it for your major or for Environmental Studies, it is interesting and helpful base information for later classes. The problem sets and exams are difficult, but if you go to office hours or get help from a TA it helps. The research paper is very interesting and a lot of fun to write. I would recommend it though, it would probably be helpful to have a good math background.",
    "Take this class. Even if you are not E&EB or EVST. Also, if you are one of those majors, especially EVST, you need to study. This is not a gut, but it is also not excruciatingly challenging. Just because you're an EVST major doesn't mean that science is your strength. Work on the paper! It will sneak up on you otherwise.",
    "No, don't take it if you don't have to.",
    "E&EB 220 is a straightforward,intermediate level bio course. Professor Post and Vasseur are both decent lecturers and the information is not too challenging. A lot of the course is based on modelling, which I makes the course pretty dry and dull sometimes. Take it if you have to for E&EB or EVST. If you're just looking for an interesting science credit though, there are definitely better options.",
    "This course will give you a fine foundation in ecology. The lectures are good, but not exciting or inspiring. Section, on the other hand, was a required waste of an hour every week. I recommend Brian over Ignacio as your section TA. The midterms were both fair and similar to each other in format. The final was much more qualitative than the midterms, requiring students to write their responses to open-ended questions in blue books. The professors make the final sound like it's going to be really hard, but actually it is not bad.",
    "If you want to learn about some of the important conversations that ecologists have had (and are still having) about population dynamics, island biogeography, food chains\/webs, and global change, you should take this class! The other reviews overemphasize how much math is involved in this class. There's really not very much, and they provide all the equations you need on the front page of the exams.",
    "I really enjoyed this course. It was well-taught and the math is not extremely difficult, although you must understand that there is quite a bit of mathto learn for the first two midterms. If you do all of the work and make sure you understand how to use the equations given you will be fine",
    "I thought it was well-taught and a good course overall. People talk about it being math-heavy, but it's basic math and mostly just plugging numbers into equations and being able to read a graph. There are only two problem sets the whole semester, and your grades are spread out with a smaller project, a research paper, two midterms, and a final. The final was very conceptual and harder than I expected, so make sure to focus a lot on the last third of the course when studying (which is the less math-y part of the course).",
    "General Ecology is a solid course. It is a rather mathy for the first two-thirds of the semester, but nothing too complicated. Both professors are pretty good lecturers, although it can get a bit dry at times. We covered a broad range of topics within ecology and I personally feel like I learned a lot. Do be aware that this is not a gut course - the exams could be somewhat tricky, and you would do well to keep up with the material rather than cramming. Workload is very reasonable, and even the final paper is not too bad since you have complete free choice on the topic (within the realm of ecology, of course).",
    "An okay course, although it got less interesting throughout the semester, which was disappointing.",
    "great class, interesting and well taught, paper was a pain",
    "You probably have to take this class if you're taking it...lectures are pretty interesting, the quantitative modeling is so irritating, tests are pretty hard. Not an easy class.",
    "Lectures were very informative, and the professors were proficient at explaining the material. the breadth of material covered was a bit staggering at times, so good note keeping is important. the paper is a pain and can be difficult to organize\/structure for non-science people, though there is plenty of support",
    "Although this is not counted as a QR class, be warned--almost all of what you learn will be certain formulas, their parameters, and their graphs. Not quite the fun, looking at pictures of plants and animals kind of science class I was hoping to enjoy. But I guess if you're an EVST major, you really have no choice-- good luck!",
    "Only take if you have to.",
    "It's a class that will teach you the basic principles of ecology, both mathematical and physical. People complain about the math, but it's not complicated, and both professors do a good job of integrating it with the rest of the course. If you know basic calculus, it'll be fairly intuitive, but even if you don't it's not a particular problem or barrier to the course. Both professors are good lecturers and seem enthusiastic about the topic, and they can give good advice and answer questions if you have them. I think the research paper is actually a very good exercise; I came away from it more enthusiastic about the idea of being a research scientist, and it's very interesting to dig into the science and try to apply what you've learned in class to it.",
    "General Ecology is simply a solid course. I found most aspects of it well done, interesting, and never felt like it wasted my time. However, I never was particularly excited about any part of the class either.The workload is un remarkable: midterms, just 2 Psets, a small final research paper, and a final exam. It's a great way to introduce yourself to many different aspects of ecology, and Vasseur and Post do a good job with lectures.",
    "The course description makes this class sound very exciting- with fishery management and human population control etc. But it is all about equations of populations!\/ predator prey dynamics etc. Basically an economics course w\/ all of the math and graphs. It is a great idea that it covered so much material, but concepts are gone over in just one lecture and we are expected to know very specific details for midterms. Textbook isn't very helpful, and neither is section. But the lecturers make it as fun as possible. Wish it was less mathematical and more writing based because it is a requirement for lots of majors and impossible to avoid. Definitely brought down my gpa and I was trying.",
    "I really enjoyed this class. Lectures were interesting, the professors were great, and there really wasn't much work: a short write-up, two very short problem sets, two midterms, a paper, and a final. I would absolutely recommend this course to someone even mildly interested in ecology.",
    "I would recommend this class for someone interested in getting a foundation in ecology. The class presented the subject in an interesting way. The section on climate change was particularly relevant. The research paper was a fun chance to explore a topic of your interest and taught me a lot about how to write like an scientist.",
    "Take it if you have to.",
    "As I non-science major who was somewhat prepared for this course through AP Biology and a general interest in the environment, this was still a difficult course. Although the workload is light at times (just 30 pages or so of reading from a textbook to supplement what is in lecture), the research paper at the end is a challenge if you've never written a journal-article-stlye biology paper. I would only recommend the class to non-science majors who are determined to focus on a variety of ecological topics (including climate change, which was fascinating) and are willing to put in the work to understand the mathematical models during the first two-thirds of the course.",
    "Take it if you have to for your major, but otherwise, find another science credit. While the Davids are engaging professors doing interesting work, there's a disconnect between the very theoretical material we learn in class and the practical applications on the exams.",
    "The material is a little dull because it's mostly an overview of a lot of concepts, but the professors are great!"
