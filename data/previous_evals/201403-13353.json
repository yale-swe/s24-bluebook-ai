    "Overall, this is an interesting class if you're interested in the intellectual history of the Cold War and the Cold War in the third world. If you don't already know quite a bit about the Cold War and the USSR, this class may not be enjoyable or understandable. It could have been clearer in the bluebook and during the first classes that the focus was more on the intellectual history. The research requirements for this class are a lot. 18-25 pages is a lot for an undergrad seminar, particularly if you're taking multiple seminars. The reading is required every week, and crucial for participating and even just following discussions. Definitely requires a lot of time, perhaps too much time, unless this is truly your passion.",
    "Take it!!! Jeremy Friedman is an amazing professor, and the topic is really interesting. Friedman is very good at running a seminar; he doesn't tolerate bullshit but is very accepting of attempts to analyze things. As long as you've done the reading, it doesn't matter how bad you are at analyzing it -- he'll guide you to a good point to make. You do need to do (at least most of) the readings, but he chooses really interesting ones that don't overlap much. The course is also a lot more interesting than US\/USSR-focused Cold War classes. You'll analyze choices between the West, the East, and a third way from the perspectives of those in the third world. You'll look at the world differently -- I promise.",
    "Absolutely take it; just put in a lot of work. It's worth it",
    "Take it. The primary sources for this class are fascinating and you'll be challenged to think about information in brand new ways.",
    "Get ready for a lot of reading.",
    "If you're interesting in the Cold War and already know a decent amount about it, you HAVE to take this class.",
    "Do not take this",
    "Pretty cool class, take if you're interested in the cold war or the third world and you are comfortable talking in class. Definitely take if you like a class that focuses more on critical and analytical ability more than regurgitative learning.",
    "A lot of reading - but a wonderful set of readings that I learned a lot from. Primary source readings were in particular very fascinating - although the reading was heavy and sometimes dense, I enjoyed it thoroughly and did not regret taking this class at all. Professor Friedman can be intimidating, but he forces you to think critically and to only offer useful comments, which increases the quality of the discussion greatly. I would highly recommend this seminar. Be prepared for the amount of work, and always feeling less smart than you think you are, but this has changed the way I see the Cold War, and has taught me so much. Highly recommended."
