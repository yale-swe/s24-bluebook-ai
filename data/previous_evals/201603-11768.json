    "I really LOVED this class. I felt that I learned so much and gained a lot of embodied knowledge. I felt that the way the class was structured was unique and promoted a lot of creativity in a fun and relaxed environment.",
    "I loved this course! \"History of Dance\" is sort of a broad term but I really enjoyed studying the roots of some dance forms along with how they have been translated and spread over time and locations.",
    "I learned about dance theory and the issues within dance performance and composition.",
    "I have4 learned how race, social class, gender and other social components are indirectly intersected in the study of dance. I was able to formulate my own opinions on these intersections, finding or rather proposing new theories on how these relationships came about through the study of the origins of dance. I was able to learn about movement and the different meanings that can be conveyed through kinetics, and how these meanings have been used by choreographers to convey their personal ideas into dance.",
    "Learned a lot about dance's influence in various cultural aspects over time. Also learned how movement intersects with culture, cultural appreciation as well as cultural appropriation. Also learned how to engage in conversation through dance.",
    "Learnt a part of the history of dance that I would have never explored otherwise, very interesting",
    "Learned both about dance history and dance techniques.",
    "Learnt about how different people and dance styles have affected US history and how dance has been used as a form of protest and revolution. We actually danced in the different dance styles which was pretty cool",
    "Inisight into the history of dance and ways of studying dance academically. I learned about the role of race, culture, and gender in dance. I also was able to explore different dance techniques through embodying what we were studying."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I don't think this class needs any room for improvement. If anything it would be great if it could receive some more funding to continue doing cool workshops and maybe do field trips to see some dance shows.",
    "The strengths of this course are everything. The readings were fun to do. The workload was very low. Professor Berson was so much fun to have in class. The essays were also very reasonable.",
    "The writing portion of this class was not very rigorous, which made the class pretty easy but also meant my writing did not improve.",
    "I think the strength softens the course is that it has a very interesting reading list that makes the course enjoyable. The professor enables the students to share their own views on the readings, creating a environment where conversation and discourse is encouraged as opposed to hindered. I enjoyed the dancing, because it allowed students to explore other areas of their physicality and find a method of expressing themselves through movement.",
    "The physical movement aspect of the course was great! Engaging in some of the movements we had read about was a great way of learning the material as well as enabling us to discuss it and its importance\/influence. The videos and group discussion were a great way to engage with the material and bring the readings to life.",
    "Definitely the highlight of my week, I loved going there and having fun!",
    "The final project was fun and instructive.",
    "This class is awesome! I really don't know how it could be even better, maybe offer it every semester? Have more classes like this?"

   "comments": [
    "YES! It was one of the best classes I've taken here. I would take it again in a heatbeat.",
    "Yes take this class! Super fun and not challenging. I high recommend actually doing all the readings and participating to make it a real great experience.",
    "This was a great course, definitely take it! The name of the class is sort of misleading... rather than covering the chronological history of dance, we discussed different issues in dance performance and composition, and wove in the history throughout class sessions and readings (imo this was much more interesting than a dance history class). Jessica is a great professor, and she picked an awesome group of 15 students to take this class. We all had different relationships to dance, and we learned a lot from each other because of that. The class covered complex issues in dance theory, and never really came to any conclusions or resolutions about them, which I actually think was one of the strengths of this course. Jessica was not very critical of our writing, which made the class pretty easy, but means you will probably not get any better at writing by taking this course.",
    "Yes, I would highly recommend this class for anyone who is interested I studying movement in general.",
    "Take this course. It's fun, interesting, and not much work at all. Jessica Berson is a great professor and she's really fun. The workload is light and you get to come to class and do movements instead of sitting in a boring lecture. The class is really engaging and definitely worth taking.",
    "DEFINITELY! whether you like dance or not, take it, it'll be the best class you're taking over the year",
    "Yes! I thoroughly enjoyed the course.",
    "THIS IS PROBABLY THE BEST CLASS I HAVE EVER TAKEN AT YALE! We talked about dance and how it affected history and we also danced ourselves according to the techniques we were studying! You don't have to be experienced in dance to like dance, you don't even have to like to dance to like this class. The workload and the readings are not too bad (and the readings are actually interesting). The class is in a dance studio, so there is no \"seminar classroom feeling\". Please please take this class, you won't regret it",
    "I would recommend this class to another student! All of the readings are very fascinating and engaging. The discussions each week are great, and you each class we are active in exploring the topics we're learning in body. I really enjoyed the class and the final project was really fun!",
    "You will tell your grandchildren about this class. Take it, no regrets.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. It is interesting, interactive, and unlike any other class I have taken at Yale."
