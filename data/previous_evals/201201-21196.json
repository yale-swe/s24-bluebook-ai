    "I really wish I could recommend this class, since the professor was nice and I learned about three really interesting things from it. But this was the worst-designed class I've taken at Yale. There are no exams, just a presentation, a reading response every week and a final paper. This means that there was basically no incentive to ever show up for class (at 9am, really far up Science Hill). The random topics in the class didn't build on each other at all, such that while I found certain readings extremely interesting, I also had to write a handful of reading responses about water on random planets. It's extremely unclear who the target audience for this class it. I really believe that the professor could make the class better, though. Before you take this, check the syllabus. See if it's changed such that there is actually a relationship between what you learn one week and the next.",
    "This is a great science credit - a hidden gem. There are two weekly homeworks, but each shouldn't take more than between 10-40 minutes. I did all my homeworks well in advance and then was able to coast for the rest of the course. There is no midterm, no final exam. You just have to write a final paper, and the midterm project is having your first draft done.",
    "Yes, great science class. If you're trying to avoid taking one of those large science classes for non-majors, this is it. The weekly papers work well for Social Science\/Humanities people who are used to writing responses. And you'll actually learn stuff!",
    "I would recommend this class. There are no exams and the midterm is just a draft of the final. Really manageable way to get a Sc credit.",
    "Terrific course. At first, I was reluctant to take an entire class on water, but actually, it is more of an omnibus science class, as basically everything has to do with water somehow. Professor Lee is amazing! She cares very much and lectures very well.",
    "I would recommend this class to any non-science majors looking to learn useful information in a variety of fields : planetary sciences, conservation, energy, etc."
