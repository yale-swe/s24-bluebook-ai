    "English 114 is a freshman writing course designed to help freshmen adapt to college-level writing. This description makes it sound like a boring and painful mandatory course. In fact, this couldn't be further from the truth. I can imagine some sections were like that, but having English 114 with Anne Schindel was a wonderful experience and I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND taking the course with her if at all possible. Her feedback will help you to massively improve your writing and her enthusiasm helps makes the class so interesting. Also, the material covered is fascinating, relevant, and incredibly important. Class was at once a serious treatment of serious issues and a wonderfully entertaining intellectual adventure. Take English 114 with Anne Schindel!!!! I could not recommend her more.",
    "\"Living Well, Dying Well\" was possibly my favorite class this semester. Not only were we able to discuss the meaning of life and death through various different circumstances and projects but we were also able to discuss out thoughts and feelings in a safe environment. The instructor Anne, was amazing! She went way out of her way to make sure that everyone felt welcome and understood the material. She has a graceful teaching style where she moderate a topic for discussion and it will evolve into the whole class bringing up a wide range of ideas and perspectives. Wonderful class and the topic is sooo interesting!",
    "It is an introductory writing class that will greatly improve your writing for Yale. This section's topic was Living Well, Dying Well where our essays and readings were based on the philosophical\/ethical issues of abortion and euthanasia as well as what it means to live well and what possibilities there are for an afterlife\/immortality.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. The course really makes you think and is a great way to get you talking about what life and death means to you and how much you appreciate your life. The course is very discussion oriented, which is something I really enjoy.",
    "English 114 19 is one of the best English classes you could choose to take in your life. The material will not only maintain your interest in the course but will also make you explore and take stances on issues concerning death that you may have not considered before. I couldn't stand English in high school and was convinced that this would be a course that I would only do because I was forced to. This class proved me wrong. I highly recommend it to another student because it will not only improve one's writing ability, but will also change their outlook on life through the topics we work with.",
    "This is a really great class, and it makes you think about really awesome ideas and topics. It's much harder and more work than I thought English 114 would be, so be warned. I'd recommend the class if you want to get better at writing, learn about an interesting subject, and are willing to put forth the effort.",
    "Definitely recommended if you want to set yourself up with a strong foundation in academic essay writing.",
    "I think ENGL 114 is a class that all Yale students should take to prepare them for writing at the college level. But, the only way this class really makes you a better writer, I think, is by taking the time to meet with the teacher outside of class.In class we did discussions of the topic, which clearly helped write my paper, but as far as what helped my WRITING the most, it was the outside of class office hours.",
    "I recommend it for everyone, especially if you want to make your writing better.",
    "I would recommend English 114 because it definitely helps improve writing skills. Learning how to write an academic paper is not only important because you'll be writing tons of these during your time here, but also because it helps you read academic papers more effectively. The section topic made it really interesting as well. I don't know if I would've liked this class so much if I had a different topic.",
    "Great class to take that helps improve writing skills greatly. Excellent teacher.",
    "English 114 19 was a great introduction to academic writing. It forces students to develop opinions and to become better writers. I would recommend this class to anybody who seeks to enhance his\/her writing skills.",
    "This class was excellent. My writing has improved enormously because of this class and because of this professor. If you want hands on corrections on every essay and draft that will be discussed meticulously during office hours, this class is perfect for you. The themes also are interesting and worth talking about (happiness, euthanasia, suicide, eternal life). Definitely take this class if you are really interested in improving your writing."
