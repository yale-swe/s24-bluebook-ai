    "This is your standard Level 2 Spanish class. It focuses far more on grammar and writing than on speaking. Your enjoyment of the class is largely dependent upon the teacher you get, so choose wisely during shopping period.",
    "The grammar we learn in the class gets harder and harder, but by the end of L2, students will be able to give basic explanations and have easy conversation in Spanish. I do recommend this class to students who are intending to learn Spanish at Yale.",
    "I would recomebd it",
    "I would definitely recommend this course! It was great. My Spanish improved tremendously and it was fun."
