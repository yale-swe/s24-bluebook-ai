   "comments": [
    "Good materials, while some theories not covered due to time limit, which makes it a little bit difficult to understand the methods completely.",
    "I feel like I learned a lot in this course, though I felt like I had to teach myself the material more than I expected or wanted to. I felt that the material was presented in a very dry way that made it hard to follow along. I feel much better about using SAS after having used it more for this class, though. This class would be much better if it were held in a room with computers so we could be doing the analysis along with the professor.",
    "The contents of the course are very useful.",
    "cannot fully inform us the interpretations and how those formulas conducted",
    "",
    "better demonstration in class",
    "This class would be a great one if it was taught differently. It is a shame that labs are not real ones, we would learn better by actually doing things rather than sitting in class and listening. The homeworks are really helpful in understanding the class but are too long (in a problem set there are too many problems on the same kind).",
    "This was a good course. It would have been better if we had more guidance about the final project.",
    "This is a very useful course. The material is challenge but in the end I feel I have learned a lot.",
    "I think we could use more real world examples and use of data. A few homework problems from the textbook is good but spending hours on this homework and then not knowing how to utilize those skills with real data is ultimately not helpful. The exam did more to translate the learning into hands-on work but we could not get help from the TAs and so we either sank or swam rather than learn.",
    "This course is useful if your thesis data is categorical. I really do feel like I learned a lot. The major weakness of this class is the lectures -- they are so hard to follow sometimes. It is difficult to actually grasp the material when it is taught to you in this way.",
    "Good material and capable instructor\/teaching support HOWEVER Some assignments (including the final project) challenged students on concepts that were not expressly\/thoroughly taught... meaning the assessment of understanding preceded the required lessons.",
    "This was a good course overall. The professor could have been more clear about concepts in class but the skills learned are highly applicable to huge datasets",
    "Put great time on homework but was very useful. Loved this course.",
    "I feel that I was able to learn a good deal from this course, but it took a commitment to engage with the material to really understand the concepts and be able to apply them in different ways depending on the dataset and the questions you are attempting the answer. I feel like less emphasis should have been placed on the theory behind certain concepts and that more examples should have been incorporated into the lectures\/labs.",
    "This is a informative course. Adequate examples are very helpful to illustrate how methods are applied.",
    "Power points followed the textbook clearly, assignments went along with the class discussions, for the most part",
    "I was confused most of the time and I think the material could be better presented to students. I was also disappointed that we didn't do more coding.",
    "The homework often took a lot of time, but was also at an appropriate difficulty level. Thus the homework was a fair assessment for the students. The major problem with this course was the final project that was based upon a subject in which no instruction was given. The subject of propensity scores was never talked about in class, thus making the project very difficult to do. Also the subject prompt was very vague. Also we were prohibited from consulting the TA's making the project even more difficult. This class had one major fault and it was that major project, which should be changed in future years.",
    "very good and useful",
    "The course was challenging for a non-biostats concentrator. Despite my familiarity with categorical analysis, I found the theoretical concepts difficult to learn, particularly the use of equations with symbols that I had never been exposed to. The theoretical portions were presented very quickly in class, which made it difficult to follow. I largely taught myself using the textbook and online materials from other universities. The lab sessions helped to make the content more applied, although the TAs were not always able to answer questions. Since this is a key course for public health students, I wish it had been taught as an applied course, with consideration for the various backgrounds of students."

   "question_text": "Please evaluate the instructor of this course. What are the instructor's strengths and weaknesses, and in what ways might his or her teaching be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Instructor: Zuoheng Wang \u00a0Well-experienced researcher, not so good on delivery sometimes.",
    "Instructor: Zuoheng Wang \u00a0In my opinion, Dr. Wang was not a very good professor. She presented the material in a very dry fashion that made staying engaged for the whole two hour lecture almost impossible. She did not seem like she wanted to be teaching, and did not seem approachable. To her credit, her slides were very informative and organized, which I really appreciated. I think the teaching could be improved it was more engaging-- if we worked out problems together as practice, had handouts, etc. Also, I think it is absolutely absurd that she assigned a final project, worth 40% of our grade, on a topic that she did not cover in any lecture, with very little supporting material such as resources on the topic, SAS codes, etc. In the future I would suggest that anything like this be avoided.",
    "Instructor: Zuoheng Wang \u00a0The professor may do a better job in explaining theories and knowledge to students. And be more considerate, for example, check for mistakes before give a dataset out to students as the final project",
    "Instructor: Zuoheng Wang \u00a0She tries to explain things but it can be hard to understand a lot of the times.",
    "Instructor: Zuoheng Wang \u00a0Professor Wang listens to students and pays attention to their comments and needs which is nice. I think the lectures need to be better structured so that at the end of the lecture we know why we are using this or this test in which situation.",
    "Instructor: Zuoheng Wang \u00a0The slides is very organized and with great clarity. However, her English is not very good and sometime I am having trouble following her.",
    "Instructor: Zuoheng Wang \u00a0I think class time could be used more on thinking about real data rather than deriving equations. The theory is useful if we understand how it relates to data sets.",
    "Instructor: Zuoheng Wang \u00a0She really wants the students to learn something from the class. If something is unclear, she will stop to make sure that all understand the material. In office hours she is MUCH more clear.",
    "Instructor: Zuoheng Wang \u00a0Competent. Not always easy to understand",
    "Instructor: Zuoheng Wang \u00a0She did a great job of trying to explain the concepts in class but could do a better job of laying down background information. Overall, great job!",
    "Instructor: Zuoheng Wang \u00a0Professor Wang did a sufficient job in presenting the course material, though as I stated above I think more emphasis should have been put on providing examples of how to apply the different methods of analysis we were learning, which would have made the material much clearer to understand. I thought the course load she assigned was reasonable and did help reinforce the material, though there were a few instances where a homework question did not correspond entirely with that week's lecture. Professor Wang was able very responsive and helpful with any questions or concerns we may have had.",
    "Instructor: Zuoheng Wang \u00a0Dr. Wang's power points were clear and followed the book well. That being said, her explanations of the content of those power points were not clear. They presentations were easy to follow on your own, but it was difficult to follow her in class. The final project for the class required us to perform a type of analysis that we were never introduced to in class. Not only was this difficult in itself, but the professor was traveling during the weeks before the project was due, so it was very difficult to reach her with questions. It was also difficult to get clear answers to questions, as you could only ask through email.",
    "Instructor: Zuoheng Wang \u00a0Dr. Wang was a bit hard to understand in class but one-on-one I learned a lot from her and am grateful for her help outside of class!",
    "Instructor: Zuoheng Wang \u00a0Hard to understand and wasn't very good at clarifying questions. Her notes were easy to follow when not in class, but in lecture I would get easily confused.",
    "Instructor: Zuoheng Wang \u00a0she is very nice.",
    "Instructor: Zuoheng Wang \u00a0Dr. Wang is very nice and it is clear she cares about her students. She is very willing to help students. However, her lectures were very difficult to follow. I found it challenging to understand her and she presented the material very quickly. She spoke the entire 2 hour lecture. While she asked students if they had any questions from time to time, the amount of information presented was overwhelming that it was difficult to know what questions to ask. I often didn't have questions until I was doing my homework, but homework was due on Wednesday and her office hours were Thursday, so by the time we received the homework assignment and began to work on it, her office hours had passed and I wasn't able to receive direction. Lastly, there were a few cases where the content on the homework had not been taught and I spent several days working on the problem set only to find out that we wouldn't be graded on the question that was not covered. Greater feedback on the homework would be useful including how to solve each question. For the amount of time spent on the homework I still don't know if the methods used to solve the homework was correct."

    "I would recommend this course to another student who is interested in working with categorical data in the future. I gained a lot of valuable skills, but it does require some working through some of the concepts on your own.",
    "This is a great introductory course to deal with categorical data. You will have a chance to apply the methods both manually and with the help of sad.",
    "This course is informative, however I would not recommend it unless it is a requirement, or if it was taught differently.",
    "A lot of theory behind categorical data analysis with some statistical programming.",
    "very useful. I highly recommend",
    "This class is half theoretical, half applied. For students without an extensive biostats background, this course will be very challenging. Be prepared to spend a lot of time outside the classroom teaching yourself the material and completing homework assignments."
