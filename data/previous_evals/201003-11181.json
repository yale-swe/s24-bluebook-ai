   "comments": [
    "This is a great course for students with an interest in the Italian renaissance. We surveyed a lot of important texts, and some of the earlier classical texts with which they were in direct dialogue. The thematic approach is compelling and yet we were reading and discussing canonical texts required for exams.",
    "I would totally recommend this course to a fellow student. It is a very enlightening experience to read so many text from the Italian Renaissance looking for common threads. It is very helpful not only for a scholar of the Renaissance but also for any scholar in the humanities. The course also provided a great chance to do original research, in some less studied text. We traced the concept of curiosity from the classical texts of Plutarch and Apuleius, to less studied women in the Italian Renaissance such as Veronica Franco and Moderata Fonte, and we also explored how the theme of curiosity became linked with that of witchcraft, in Gianfrancesco Pico della Mirandola Strix, Gelli's Circe and Bruno's Cantus Circaeus.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student, both for the sake of the material and for the research-seminar training offered. Briefly, this class was about conceptions of curiosity in the Italian Renaissance, but we began with earlier conceptions of curiosity and of the curious - with classical texts, including Plutarch and Apuleius, through Dante, and towards Polizian, Mirandola, Bruno, Gelli, Veronica Franco, Fonte, and to the moderns represented by Nietzsche. We considered all sort of models of the curious - from the witch, to the Ulysses-figure, to the educated woman, to the Circe figure, the figure of the pedant, etc. This class was helpful in allowing me to orient myself in the period and to pursue my own interests along with the themes of the course. There was guidance, but we were all able to research things that interested us, and this sort of mix was very valuable.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. Expectations are clearly laid out, discussions are rich and engaging.",
    "I would highly recommend this class to a fellow student."

   "comments": [
    "On a personal level, Angela's course and her particular approach to reading cultivated in me a healthy level of skepticism, which seems like it might be critical to reading Renaissance texts. The works we read for the course, at least, never seemed to be quite straightforward. The thematic approach I think also brought out the extent to which a Renaissance text could hide a very polemical discourse beneath a seeming harmless layer of fantasy.",
    "I found this course very useful for my personal research. It allowed me to study a text and an author that I had always wanted to focus on. Moreover, it allowed me to establish a basis for further research on the field. I believe that this course will prove very helpful for the rest of my academic career.",
    "This course helped me get a better idea of what a research paper should look like, how a graduate research paper differs from a conference paper, from an article, from a book chapter. It helped me see how each of these academic 'genres' have different expectations and how one might go about transitioning from one to another. I am not sure yet what my dissertation will be about, but this course also taught me a lot about different theoretical approaches and the critical assumptions that we sometimes include in our arguments, not realizing that we are doing so. It helped me see that for every fact or piece of information we include in our work, we are leaving something out, that all explanations are in the end interpretations and that we must consider this when we write.",
    "This course offered the opportunity to read many texts fundamental for my discipline."
