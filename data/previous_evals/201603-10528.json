   "comments": [
    "I became more familiar with MATLAB and I learned more about computer vision, edge detection and segmentation. I also learned about some biological creatures that I didn't know about before.",
    "This is a good, practical class for developing skills related to computer vision while also forming a loose understanding of those ideas' biological analogues. More or less exactly what's written on the box.",
    "Gained a high-level understanding of visual systems, neural networks, MATLAB, and spatial & frequency domains.",
    "Mathematical basis of vision, biology of visual systems in organisms, MATLAB",
    "Basics of the visual cortex, algorithmic applications to vision, -!; how to critical analyze processes.",
    "I learned a lot of computer vision and mathematical modeling techniques to better understand how biological visual perception works.",
    "MATLAB, Linear Algebra, understanding of Vision",
    "In this class I developed my skills working with Matlab, reviewed mathematical concepts from linear algebra, calculus, and probability, and gained an understanding of some basic signal processing and differential geometry. I learned some basic methods in computer vision and machine learning, and gained insight into some of the computations performed by the human visual system.",
    "I learned an incredible amount about the beautiful way that biology informs development of computer vision methods. It was very interesting and engaging to take a class that stands at the intersection of two seemingly disparate fields.",
    "Intuition on computer vision, basic implementation of a range of computer vision tools, including a neural network. Coding on Matlab, which Andrew Ng also recommends (he is the Professor of Stanford machine learning -course). A taste of the uncertainty in figuring out research direction, and using experimental research methods in natural sciences."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The material seems intuitive in a lot of ways but the course seemed a little unorganized at times, which made things feel a little confusing. Students were also forced to use MATLAB without much introduction to the language. This made homework assignments difficult and time consuming at times, even if the concepts made sense.",
    "The material is very interesting and if you're a CS major imo this is a must-take, but only if you're willing to accept the fact that you'll need to learn some of the material yourself. I definitely wish I had taken more math, particularly linalg, before taking this and realistically it probably should be a prerequisite. The professor wasn't that great at lecturing but his grasp over the course material is extremely strong and the interestingness of the material carried the lectures to be pretty solid. Overall a good course, and if you seemed interested from the course title you'll probably get about what you were expecting.",
    "The lecture notes often missed key information on conclusions. Barriers to entry with lots of acronyms and mathematics. Given requisite understanding of these items, was a quite useful course. The problem sets taught me some useful information (and MATLAB).",
    "Strengths: Very broad topics and interesting information to be learned Weaknesses: Teaching was rushed and disorganized, time was better spent not going to lecture and just teaching myself off lecture notes",
    "Strength: broad Weakness: disorganzied",
    "This was a fantastic course! The professor is very enthusiastic and engaging, while the TA was exceptionally helpful and organized. I only wish that the lectures and notes were more organized in their approach.",
    "Love the psets, but class notes were very hard to understand.",
    "Zucker is dedicated to teaching. However, his distributed notes are disorganized, sometimes incomplete.",
    "Since there was so much packed into the course, it felt at times as if we were only skimming the surface of certain topics. While I thought this approach worked well overall, at times I wished there was a more rigorous treatment of the material. I realize the lecture notes were only sketched notes, but it would have been nice if they were more comprehensive, or if additional resources were brought in.",
    "Strengths include the class's interdisciplinary approach, it's way of linking together various topics into a cohesive whole, Professor Zucker's enthusiasm and jokes. Weaknesses include the classic problem of any introductory class: sometimes things can be rather confusing when you don't have the time or background to fully dive into a given topic.",
    "This is a mistreated beast - better planned than the reviews might suggest, but admittedly unconventional for a computer science course. The course is, as it promises, a third natural sciences, as it introduces biological context (brain parts, creatures with visual systems) and more interpretive research situations (comparing edge detectors). But these are not tested on a grainy level, only on the intuitive level. Similarly, math is taught on an intuitive level, with no proofs but some examples and visual aids. The intuition was fascinating, and the problem sets were educative once they were finished. The topics were ordered in an inventive way. However, the scope is large and may be (very) confusing. The single lectures could be confusing when the Professor forgot to mention what question we were trying to solve."

    "Yes! Take this class if you are interested in neural networks, computer vision, and how biology can inform these models. The presentation of material linking these will be like no other class you can take at Yale.",
