   "comments": [
    "A greater ability to trace the adaptations of particular works over time and understand the contexts of each one",
    "This course was interesting... the reading was good, but the lectures seemed so disconnected and irrelevant to anything. There was sort of a sense of general confusion and fluctuation that made everything feel unimportant.",
    "Spending a whole semester looking at adaptations of only one text is not something I'd ever done before, and definitely something that took some getting used to. I think the reading responses were especially helpful in this regard: I liked being forced to think about the texts and about adaptation in general before seminar. It was also really fun to talk about the readings individually, as well as in the context of \"adaptation\" writ large. Those conversations were not only valuable but also fun!",
    "I learned how important it is to be narrow and disciplined in our analysis of a text and its surrounding material! The class felt like a: \"Hey, look how hard actual scholarship is!\" kind of warning sign, though it was not intimidating or closed off to those of us who hadn't interacted much with post-colonialism or Shakespeare. I'm happy I took it.",
    "Reading novels at speed. Seeing how interpretations of a Western literary work can shift over time. Increasing awareness of English-speaking postcolonial countries."

   "comments": [
    "This course needs more structure! Way, way more structure. Also, the reading responses are far less helpful than essays... why are there only two five page papers? That's nothing, especially for a core seminar. Nothing makes sense!!!",
    "Not enough time spent on the actual Tempest, and a little bit too much of an emphasis on post-colonial readings, in my opinion. But the readings were manageable and interesting in general.",
    "The course had many strengths, one of which was definitely the diversity of readings\/screenings, especially in the latter half of the semester! And the seminar aspect was really great--the discussion sections were the perfect size, and I liked that we switched professors halfway. Its only weakness was that the lectures given by one professor often felt disconnected from the lectures given by the other--in general, this was fine, but when both professors gave pretty different lectures within the same class period on completely different things, it was a little off-putting. Also, I wish we'd read the tempest in class and talked about it, if only for one class! I know we all read it before the term started, but it would've been helpful to get others' takes on certain scenes\/themes.",
    "This course let us see the work that goes into making educated, complex statements about a text that has transformed over centuries. I'm glad, in some ways, that the syllabus was so packed, for the message it sent if not for my sometimes-tough experience with it. I realized that making statements about a text is not a simple matter of reading it and having an opinionit's about evaluating why that opinion exists after a foundation of adaptations, and how your hermeneutic horizon affects how you perceive a book. I do wish that: We had read The Tempest as a class more than once, perhaps even three times (at the beginning, in the middle, and at the end) over the course of the semester. I also wish that we had taken a more narrow approach to the adaptations (Caribbean authors only, for example)I sometimes got so pulled in different directions by the adaptations that it felt more like a workshop of different students' projects than a class.",
    "Interpretations of Tempest in colonial regions was a fresh perspective for me. With the little time we had, the message fell flat: if it was simply the issue of dominance from the colonial culture, two lectures would have been enough; if it was the some lingual and political nuances, what we had was not enough. In general, single lectures split between two Professors were wildly insufficient for either speaker. The class should have had two lectures and a section. The movies also needed more explication. The syllabus was superbly clear. The Professors were open for student ideas."

   "comments": [
    "Yes",
    "Take something better organized, unless you have a specific interest in Shakespeare or in The Tempest or one of the other books we read.",
    "Prof. Greenwood's lectures are astounding. The structure of the course was interesting, but not always coherent.",
    "This course was very disorganized. It had the potential all semester to become a really great course but never did. Absolutely regret taking it. It led nowhere.",
    "This class was a great place to not only learn about the Tempest but to listen to other students' views on the same. Professor Greenwood and Professor Manley are both great in the way that they are experts in their fields, but also in the way they engage students and encourage them to bring their individual perspectives to the class.",
    "Yes! Although I don't know if this specific iteration of the course will be offered again... But it was a lot of fun!! Definitely take it if you can--the discussion was always interesting, and most of the readings are really fun.",
    "I would. Be prepared to either read a *lot* or to listen to others, and do not treat this like a literature class.",
    "The focus was obscure. Professor Manley was not the clearest lecturer. The students were not the most engaged. Both Professors were very open to new paper topics and how the class was directed. Professor Greenwood offered personal advice on papers. She was extremely well organized and responsive. She presented her arguments and teachings clearly, and heard student opinions with patience and generosity. I chose the course largely for her and I leave it thankful to her."
