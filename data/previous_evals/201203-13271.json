   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend it to another student who is interested in drawing, but they should be aware that it is a lot of work.",
    "If you take Art 114 take it with Anahita! The class was really enjoyable with her and the workload was manageable. Every week we had one assignment that took approximately 2-4 hrs of work and in class we often went to the art gallery or the graveyard to draw. As long as you are willing to try and show some improvement you will be fine in this class.",
    "I would recommend this course. You will build a solid foundation in drawing.",
    "This class was a solid course for people who want to become a better drawer. Don't take this class if you are simply looking for a humanities gut, as it's more work than you would expect.",
    "Definitely take this class, and take it with Anahita. You'll learn more than you expect to learn and will undoubtedly develop as an artist over the semester. Becoming comfortable with the vocabulary of critique is also a great skill that will serve you in in other areas. Learning the skill of drawing and effective critique make this class worth your while.",
    "You should not let yourself graduate without taking basic drawing. I'd wanted to take it every semester, and finally senior year, managed to make it happen. It was a perfect fifth class. Not that it wasn't work, drawings take a long time, and you really get out of it what you put in, but it was such a different kind of work from my other classes, it felt like a break. I'd never taken drawing before, but it wasn't a problem, Anahita was a great teacher, no matter what level you were at. She really fostered a spirit of kind and helpful critiquing. No one was mean or harsh, but still came up with great feedback. I feel like this class made me see and think about the world in a whole new way."
