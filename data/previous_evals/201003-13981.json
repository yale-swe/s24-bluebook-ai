    "Classics 881 provides a brief introduction to various fields within Classics. I would recommend it to other students, so that they are exposed to these issues at least once before becoming more specialised.",

    "It's a lively introduction to the breadth and depth of the contemporary world of Classics. I would indeed recommend it."

    "It was helpful in that it made it very clear to whom we should turn should we decide to incorporate any of these fields into our dissertation research.",
    "It made me think very carefully about the responsibility of my generation of scholars to redefine classical studies for the new generation.",
    "The most rewarding aspect of the proseminar was the fact that it taught us where research resources are. The various bibliographies and factual tidbits are all very helpful.",
    "This course was mostly helpful in providing brief introductions to different disciplines within the field and in introducing students to the various research materials available to them."
