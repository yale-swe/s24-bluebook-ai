    "This was a very good intro spanish course. The class was well-taught, and I feel like I learned a great deal of information. My only qualm is that my teacher never spoke English. Although I see the point of teaching a class entirely in Spanish, I felt as though I didn't understand a great deal of information during the first part of the semester. If the first half of the semester were taught in English, I would feel much more secure with the basics of Spanish.",
    "Spanish 110 teaches the basic Spanish language. I would recommend this class because a lot of people in the United States speak Spanish, and it will allow you to communicate to more people.",
    "Great class, very engaging, fast-paced for a new Spanish learner",
    "yes spanish is key to life. viva espanol",
    "Great overview of beginning spanish. Tough if you've never taken spanish before.",
    "I would recommend this if you need to take an intro language. I think all intro language classes are a lot of work, but this class is taught very well.",
    "Spanish 110 is a great Spanish class for beginners. It involves a little work everyday ,but it's definitely worth it in the end. I would definitely recommend it to any student.",
    "Take it if you're interested in Spanish!",
    "Anita is the best",
    "This is definitely a good course for easing into the spanish language. The workload is very light and moves at a very manageable pace. The only problem I had was with a few of the other students. Many seemed disengaged, as if they were only taking the class for an easy high grade and a language requirement. Students who want a more rigorous experience mat be better off with intensive spanish, a class that covers L1 and L2 in a single semester."
