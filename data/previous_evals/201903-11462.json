    "This class was the worst. Terribly organized and the professor never bothered to explain any of the concepts well; he would just say they were too hard and that we should just memorize them. I love learning languages but honestly anything I know about Turkish after this course is either self taught or something I asked the TA. This class is a waste of a semester.",
    "Selim never provided a vocabulary list at any point throughout the course so it was extremely difficult to learn the vocab. He does not speak English well and has extreme difficulty explaining grammatical concepts and giving definitions for more nuanced words. His pedagogical methods are not effective for language learning and he assigns tasks that are far above the level of L1 (e.g. hour long Skype calls with native speakers, 300 word essays, long-form presentations, etc.). He also does not give feedback regularly and when he does it is not direct. It is often just a partial grade on a rubric posted on Canvas. The few times that he did give direct feedback was after presentations when he would criticize us in front of the entire class by saying things like \"Your speech was not natural\" or \"Use more vocabulary.\""

    "Never. The professor is unprofessional and sucks at teaching. Hell ask for critiques to help improve the class and then immediately get defensive when you say something, no matter how you phrase it. Had to credit\/D because the grading was so arbitrary I feared for my GPA.",
    "Absolutely not if it is taught by Selim. I have taken three different languages at Yale and Selim is by far the worst instructor I have ever had. He does not understand how to effectively teach a language to L1 students. Further, he is extremely insecure and takes this out on his students. He frequently changed his syllabus and homework policies without warning and would not listen to student feedback."
