    "Yes it is a good continuation of japanese.",
    "This is the first class in the L5 Japanese level, and I think it's a great advanced course. It meets 3 times a week, and each class has a mini kanji quiz. Since it's an advanced level course, most of the classes simply focus on readings or watching films\/dramas and discussing them. There are only 2 tests in the semester, plus the final, and those evaluate grammar and vocabulary, in addition to comprehension of some of the readings.",
    "Great continuation of your Japanese studies. If you studied abroad over summer, this class will help you maintain some of the Japanese you learned. Unfortunately, your speaking ability will suffer due to lack of immersion but at least this class will slow that process down."
