   "comments": [
    "I would recommend HIST 258J to a student who is interested in the subject matter and plans to continue reading \/ researching on his or her own both before and after the class. The class in and of itself is not organized enough (at least in the weekly discussion leader context) nor broad enough (given the limited time in the semester and only one class meeting a week) to give a student a feeling of satisfaction by the end. That said, I have learned a huge amount during the class and feel very well prepared to venture out on my own into this area to do related readings and research both for my final paper and during the summer. In that sense, it is a recommendable class in that it gives the student a solid groundwork in the general currents.",
    "I would, if and only if the student was interested enough in the material to do +\/-300 pages of reading and a reading response each week, on top of a long final paper and a presentation. If you like the subject matter, you will love this class.",
    "I would definitely recommend this - it's a fascinating subject matter with great readings, a wonderful professor, and interesting questions with modern ramifications. It was definitely one of the best classes I have taken at Yale.",
    "Take it -- the readings are always well-balanced, and the Elli Stern Seminar Experience is not to be missed. You'll learn more in a few weeks than you have in most full semesters of classes. Don't take this if you just want to skim by, though; Elli won't let you get away with it.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course! Professor Stern is absolutely fantastic, the readings are very worthwhile, and seminar conversation is great. It makes sense particularly for those interested in Judaism\/Judaic Studies, but anyone with an interest in minority issues and the West would, I think, get quite a bit out of the class.",
    "Highly recommended for those interested political philosophy - especially as it relates to religion - or Jewish history. Any class with Elli Stern is also automatically a treat. But beware of the sheer number of pages and the need to skim.",
    "There is a lot of reading so take the course with that in mind. It will help if you have taken a course dealing with these works before."
