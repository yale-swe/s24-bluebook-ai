   "comments": [
    "One thing I learned in this class was that Buddhism is really really complicated. Sometimes I wish the course slowed down a little bit to establish the foundations of the religion really clearly before diving into complicated imagery. A lot of times I felt really overwhelmed during lecture by the amount of information. Also it would be helpful if readings were posted as files rather than on course reserves. They were hard to access at times.",
    "I thought the material was very interesting, and section was very interactive.",
    "The professor is great",
    "I believe the class is good the way it currently is.",
    "Fantastic section discussions, laidback and knowledgeable instructor, well-selected readings, generally a great course.",
    "The material is very interesting and I am glad I took the class. It was great to learn more about a religion and culture I had no exposure with prior to the class. Sometimes however, the lectures can feel a bit slow and hard to keep up with.",
    "The course was very straightforward but got very monotonous at times.",
    "Frequent gallery visits were a major strength and provided an excellent opportunity to engage with course material."

    "Yes I would recommend this course if you are interested in learning about Buddhist art history.",
    "Yes take this class, the lectures are interesting and not complicated. The time commitment for this class is fairly low and it is not hard to do well in this class.",
    "Yes - if you have the background or interest in Buddhism and would like to learn more about Buddhist art and architecture. If you are completely unfamiliar with Buddhism, this might not be the course for you - for example, many of the lectures and discussions focus on analyzing particular works and identifying deities and characters depicted. That said, the class was at least 50% art analysis, which I had very little background in, so you can probably make it work.",
    "Yes. I found the material interesting and felt the class wasn't very difficult. There were just a few papers and 2 exams that consisted of memorizing information about a master list of images and a small essay so it isn't hard to do well in the class.",
    "It's a solid course if you're interested in the content.",
    "I would recommend this course.",
    "Yes! It's a great foundation class for art history majors."
