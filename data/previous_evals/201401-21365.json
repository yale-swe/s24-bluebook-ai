    "Definitely a seminar worth taking for people that enjoy economic development and economic history.",
    "If you are interested in learning about the economic history of Latin America and are interested in development, be sure to take this course. Even though there is a lot of reading and it is presentation based learning it is a pleasure to learn from professor Zedillo.",
    "Dfinitely the experience of having a class with a personality like Dr. Zedillo is worth it, though you the commitment to do the readings and work in realtion to the course and Latin America. You don't need to be purely an Economist as it is more economic history.",
    "This class is a ton of work and you have to be really dedicated to it, given the fact that you have 300-400 pages of reading per week, a two page reading response, and two 10-15 minute presentations throughout the term. If you are dedicated to learning the subject material and engage with the readings, you will learn a lot. However, be wary of the classroom format, where you spend the majority of the time listening to mediocre presentations rather than engaging in discussion, which I would have preferred. All in all, a difficult class but I thought it was worth it.",
    "I would recommend it if you can get in, it's definitely a valuable experience for your senior year. That being said, most of the learning you do in the class is through the readings, which are quite interesting. Class time itself is not very useful because they are mostly student presentations. Zedillo lectures much less than you want him to, which is unfortunate. Your class experience also depends on the quality of the class discussion, which for my specific class was not so great, but I heard last semester's class had a much better experience. I think the course would be a lot better if there was more lecturing and discussion than presentation.",
    "I highly recommend this class if you truly have an interest in the subject. Otherwise you will not be motivated to do the reading and will fall behind. You must do the reading to succeed in this class because it demands a deep understanding of the material.",
    "Prof. Zedillo is a great professor and fantastic guy. He really cares about his students and is willing to meet with them outside of class. He has incredible insights on the economic history of Latin America, especially given his background. This class has a decent bit of reading (most of which you can skim) and class time is mostly spent on student presentations, but Zedillo is fully willing to interrupt whenever something sounds inaccurate. This can actually make presentations a bit tricky (since he obviously knows more about the subject than any student will), but it's a great experience. I would definitely recommend this class. Where else will you get to take a class on Latin American economics from Prof. Zedillo?"
