   "comments": [
    "Solid intro level class. Interesting material. I would recommend this class to a student if they get Will Gray as their TA. He salvages this course. Probably one of the coolest dudes currently living in New Haven, CT. He should teach the class.",
    "OK class. Pretty disorganized but you can learn some esoteric facts and learn about common assays in the lab.",
    "If you want to see whether Biology is for you I would def. recommend taking the biology sequence.",
    "I would not, this is an intro course but unless you have to take it I wouldn't. The survey of subjects is very large so we end up learning a very small amount about a very wide variety of subjects, such that all we do in the class is memorize details that aren't useful. We memorize the name of a type of cell then immediately forget it as we move into a new topic. Nothing ties together, as soon as we get deep enough into a subject we move on, so that any interest that is piqued is immediately destroyed. This class is a waste of time for all involved, and the grading is focused on following guidelines and memorizing, not at all on the understanding of the material.",
    "BIOL 102 goes into the inner workings and mechanics of cells. It's fascinating material. It's important to keep that in mind, as lectures are often confusing and frustrating. Valerie Horsley is a new teacher, and will definitely get better, but right now she lacks organization which makes the material really hard to follow and learn. I always think that it's good to have a background in bio no matter what your major, so I would suggest taking it.",
    "I would recommend taking it. There's a lot of interesting material. Quizzes were a little nit-picky but having regular quizzes means you can keep up with the material. The instructor was very caring, and TFs are great (at least mine was).",
    "Your average introductory biology class - nothing much to write about, really. You know you're taking this because you're a premed. Like I wrote in my BIOL 101 critique, Yale really needs to reconsider how placement is done for the introductory biology sequence - I definitely should have placed out of this class, considering how easy it was.",
    "If you enjoy biology this is the course for you.",
    "Although the course's subject matter is fascinating, Biol 102 was ultimately frustrating because the material was rarely presented clearly. The professor often contradicted herself during lecture, making exams particularly frustrating. In a few cases, topics that she specifically said would not be on quizzes would later appear there. Doing well in this class is feasible, but you can anticipate needing to heavily rely on your TF to clarify what Professor Horsley says during lecture.",
    "A good intro bio course. More difficult than Bio 101 but more interesting. The course format (ie quizzes) can seem annoying but truly prepares you for the final.",
    "So this class sucked. Professor Horsley's lectures were poor, though they got notably better as the semester progressed. The material, I felt, was pretty unfair for an introductory-level class: too complicated and far too confusing. Many of the assigned readings, for example, were from an upper- (or graduate-?) level textbook that was incomprehensible for those of us with only basic bio knowledge. The papers were also impossible to understand, which meant that many of us didn't read them. (Also, unless you're seriously interested in methods in cell biology research, you will find them super boring.) All in all, I felt like this was yet another poorly-organized and boring science class at Yale. Recommendations if you have to take it: don't do any of the reading, as you won't understand it anyway. Go to every single one of Professor Horsley's quiz review sessions - they are (surprisingly!) very well-taught and very helpful - and study the lecture slides and the study guides, and you'll do okay.",
    "Great class, but it all depends on the professor, as I heard BIO 102 last year was terribly taught.",
    "Biol 102 is essentially what you would imagine, a crash course about the Cell Membrane, organelles, etc. Take it with Professor Horsley if you can. The lecturer makes a difference.",
    "BIOL 102 was not a good class. It was a boring lecture that I did not obtain much knowledge from. I would not recommend it to another student.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student only if they had an interest in biology. It was largely AP biology, and I only learned new material during 1\/2 to 2\/3 of the course. It was fine, but I would have loved to cover some more advanced material. I understand, however, that it was challenging for other people, and believe that an intensive Biology sequence would be a better way to cover introductory material without making the entire class of students who have never studied AP biology suffer.",
    "Bio 102 is a general overview of cell bio. It's a little bland, but ok.",
    "A lot less interesting than Biol 101. You focus on all of the peripheral cell stuff that you don't learn in high school, like which protein coats vesicles headed for the Golgi, and the receptors of White Blood Cells involved in transepithelial migration. Take if you have to, don't if you don't.",
    "Do not take this class unless you absolutely have to. Not because of the professor, she was great, but because of the lack of organization for tests and quizzes.",
    "Yes! Sometimes boring, but necessary for many majors and interesting.",
    "I would recommend Biol 102 to any student interested in gaining a comprehensive understanding of cellular biology. The course covers everything from protein synthesis to cell movement and is a smooth continuation from Biol 101. Professor Horsley is new to teaching Biol 102 but puts in an incredible amount of work to make the material accessible and interesting,",
    "I would not recommend BIOL 102 for students who are not pursuing a biology major because of the dryness of the material and the frequent and very picky quizzes through the course. However, it does provide a good overview of cellular biology topics as long as students pay attention and study.",
    "BIOL 102 was a great way to learn new concepts in cell Biology that I had not before been exposed to. The psets are manageable and the weekly quizzes really make sure you stay on top of the material. Section is not the most worthwhile thing, but it was not frustrating enough to keep me from really enjoying the course.",
    "I took BIOL 102 after BIOL 101. It was a great class. Professor Horsley is amazing. She really wanted us to learn the material and took every possible step to make it happen! I loved it and learned so much!",
    "I would not recommend this class based on the sub par quality of the professor and the teaching fellows, as evidenced through lectures, section, and the presentations.",
    "I would only take Bio 102 for credit if it was necessary for your major. The quizzes can be confusing and the class itself isn't very interesting, as it is an intro cell bio course. Professor Horsley is a nice person, but she is new to teaching undergraduates which means the pacing of the class if off.",
    "Bio 102 is your standard introductory biology class. Many students will take it because they are pre-med, but for those who simply enjoy biology, prepare for a challenging but enjoyable class. The information is actually really interesting and you'll find you'll have learned a lot by the end of the course. The lectures may get boring at times but overall I would recommend this class to a fellow student.",
    "Take if necessary. The material is reasonably interesting and it's not too hard to do well (find a great study buddy!)",
    "Solid intro bio course. At times the weekly quizzes can be irritating, but I think overall they help to drill the material into your brain. The subject material is interesting, and I would definitely recommend taking the enrichment section.",
    "Basic summary of cell bio but the quizzes every week were a little hard.",
    "It's a very manageable class! Take it with Professor Horsley because the material you'll learn will be so clear.",
    "Biology 102 is an interesting general introduction to cell biology, and I would recommend it to anyone hoping to take more advanced courses in cell biology. Lectures were engaging and provided relevant applications to lecture material. The way that assignments are graded, however, is not always reflective of the knowledge of the material and can be frustrating.",
    "BIOL 102 is a nice introduction to cell biology - there is definitely concrete knowledge that you will pick up and through learning about the techniques and experiments that led to such discoveries, you will acquire the vocabulary to be able to read some of the papers that chronicled these discoveries. I would recommend the class to anyone interested in biology and how we have come to acquire the knowledge about cell biology we have today.",
    "It's a lot like AP Bio, if you took that in high school. But of course it goes more in depth for certain topics. It's a great class with a decent amount of work and a very interesting topic of study.",
    "Take it if you have to for a prerequisite like the majority of the people in this class.",
    "Although I feel as though if I had a choice I would opt to not take it, it was probably very useful in creating a base before I move on to taking more advanced Bio sources at Yale. It solidifies the knowledge I already possessed and made things I only vaguely understood much clearer.",
    "Bio 102 is a good class that I think could become really great if Prof Horsley continues to teach it. She is really receptive to student feedback and the effort she put in this year to improve her class really showed. It is not the most engaging, interesting class you'll take at Yale, but it is well done and I think will only improve.",
    "I would recommend it- the material was actually interesting, not what I was expecting from an intro bio class where I figured it would all be mainly review.",
    "I would never recommend this class to a non-pre-med student. Somehow Yale manages to make every intro-science class torture, and that's really sad. How about you guys give us some good professors who are actually passionate about teaching us? Intro Bio, Chem, Orgo, and Physics should not only be pre-med students. They are such interesting classes that all students should be interested in taking. I think if we had better professors, this would be the case.",
    "Take the class! It was everything it was supposed to be: a good intro to the cell and lab techniques we use to study it. I never felt pressured by grades, and it was nice being able to just let the info sink in. By the end, I felt like I'd learned a lot. Dr. Horsley was wonderful, and basically everything I could complain about was corrected very quickly.",
    "BIOL 102 is quite a good intro bio class. BIOL 102 is marked more challenging than BIOL 101, so one should be ready to put even more effort into BIOL 102. BIOL 102 has manageable workload. The weekly papers are fun, especially because there is plenty of guidance. The class effectively teaches theory, practical techniques, analytic skills, and reading and writing skills.",
    "I would only recommend it if the course was for a requirement, not if a student wanted to delve deeper into the area.",
    "Professor Horsley was a lovely person but seemed to struggle teaching he course. She used a lot of interactive activities that actually just took up time and didn't entirely help as much as watching videos may have.",
    "Would definitely recommend. Easy to keep up with.",
    "I would say that if you have to take it, you'll be fine, but I wouldn't take it unless you absolutely have to.",
    "I would recommend BIOL 102 for any student interested in taking an introductory biology course, science majors and non-science majors. There were weekly quizzes and problem sets so keep in mind that it can be a decent amount of work.",
    "Take it if you have to. You'll survive. It's not terrible.",
    "Mandatory for many majors, good introductory class.",
    "If you have to take the sequence this prof is amazing",
    "Good class, manageable workload, find good people to study with",
    "The paper we had to read sucked and were very hard to follow. And that's coming from someone who has done a lot of research and read countless papers.",
    "Only take this class if you have to",
    "Biol 102 is a new way to think about biology and entails a lot of critical thinking and scientific logic. This class places a lot of emphasis on experimental analysis and is a must take so that students get used to science in college. This class is definitely easier if one puts in the time to practice thinking about biology at the college level.",
    "One positive of BIOL 102 is that it's very straightforward. I felt like it was clear what we were expected to know, and it was really just a matter of learning the information; nothing was too difficult to grasp. Of course, if you're not very interested in biology, the class is pretty dull, and attempts to make the course more engaging often didn't work too well, at least not for me. But I didn't have a problem with learning dull information, so I had a fine time in this course. We also read some papers that were kind of interesting.",
    "I recommend it. Even though it is hard work, it is very interesting!",
    "Typical intro science class. You definitely learn a lot.",
    "It's a lot of memorization.",
    "The class is a bit frustrating to do well in, since the grades come down to quiz and exam scores. BIOL 102 should be an introductory course, but if you're learning bio for the first time, you'll have a lot of catch-up work and extra studying to do.",
    "Bio 102 is an introductory course into cell biology. For those not looking to go into premed or major in something STEM or bio related, I would not recommend this course. Many of the concepts learned in this lecture were covered in AP Bio, so for those who want to see what a bio course in college is like, this is not the course for them.",
    "If you've taken 101, take 102. The teaching is variable but if you study on your own, you'll learn some cool stuff.",
    "Understanding the material from AP Bio and performing well on the exam should allow students to skip the intro. bio sequence if they would like to take more advanced classes that have BIOL101-104 as a prereq.",
    "I would recommend this course. The workload is the same as any other Yale intro STEM course, and as long as you make use of the resources, the class should be fine and you should get a lot out of it.",
    "As a required course, it's not so bad. It was a fairly interesting intro to cell biology. At times disorganized, perhaps because it was Professor Horsley's first time teaching the course, but she was very receptive to criticism and clearly cares for her students a lot. I wouldn't take this course for fun but as a requirement it was not bad.",
    "It was a pretty terrible class due to a change in instructor. It may be better in years to come.",
    "I would recommend it on the basis that the instructor isn't the absolute best but the topics covered are really interesting.",
    "Overall the class was interesting but wasn't structured the most effectively. Without Kathryn Gardner the organization of the class wasn't the best including the level of detail taught on the material. I found myself having to guess at how much I needed to know for a quiz and there were times when a concept or process only had a single slide in lecture but an entire question on the corresponding quiz was dedicated to the barely touched upon subject. However, one of the highlights of the class was that it was very effective in teaching you the tools of biology and how to approach problems and questions in the field with a problem solving approach. In addition, discussion sections were built around discussion papers which helped strengthen this connection and emphasis of the class. Overall the class isn't the best but it's not the worst either.",
    "It's a bunch of stuff about how stuff inside the cell works, if that's what you're into. The work is manageable and the weekly quizzes aren't too bad.",
    "Very good course - the lectures are interesting, as are the discussion papers. Professor Horsley is very dedicated to the class, and goes above and beyond. She hosts review sessions on her own time, which is nearly unheard of for a Yale professor. The curve isn't too bad either, so you can focus on enjoying biology. In addition, Piazza is an incredibly helpful resource.",
    "BIOL 102 is a great overview to the concepts and methodology of cell biology. It challenges you to think critically about the material and really think like a scientific researcher to solve cell biology problems. The professor and teaching fellows are very knowledgable, supportive, and helpful. I would definitely recommend this course if you are interested in biology, and especially cell biology research.",
    "Bio 102 is just the second intro module for bio. Take it if you need to. It's pretty interesting and mostly keeps you engaged. Take it if you want some general knowledge about your body & about common experimental practices, or take it if you have to for your major.",
    "102 is an okay course. The course material is exciting to learn and very interesting (you are after all studying LIFE, which is very cool). I don't think I had the best experience because Dr. Horsley was new and needed about three weeks, which is half of the course duration, to get accustomed and learn what works best for the class. Course logistics were not so well-planned in my year, but the content was great. Lots of memorization though, not quite like chemistry where you get to do more applying of what you learn as opposed to regurgitation.",
    "BIOL 102 is the second in a series of four biology lectures providing a general foundation of knowledge in the biological sciences, both for those who intend to major in the biological sciences and for those who do not. BIOL 102 specifically provides a student with an general and comprehensive understanding of cell biology. The material is not easy to master and can be complicated at times, yet I would recommend the class to another student.",
    "I recommend Bio 102. If you don't NEED to take it and you don't like memorizing things, then I would't recommend it.",
    "This class is heavily focused in the nature of cells and cellular membranes. I would recommend it to ones interested in this field.",
    "This semester was Professor Horsley's first time teaching intro bio, so some of her missteps were understandable. However, she tended to oversimplify the material in attempts to make it easier to understand often made us more confused. Overall this course was fairly frustrating and I would only recommend taking it if you have to.",
    "I thought it was a good class in that it tried to help student be able to analyze current papers in biology, but that it was difficult for people with previous experience with biology because we were asked to analyze papers in a generalized manner which often conflicted with some of the details presented in the papers, which made finding an appropriate level of description for the class and tests difficult.",
    "Yeah, sure. Especially if you need it for a prereq.",
    "BIOL 102 was a fine introductory biology course based on the basics of membrane physiology but expands into cutting-edge membrane research and develops a more sophisticated understanding of cell membranes. I would recommend it. It is manageable, interesting, and most importantly the instructors work hard to help all students.",
    "More critical thinking and experiment based that biol 101. I personally preferred this and would recommend the class.",
    "A study of some organelles, transport, protein synthesis in the specific parts of the cell. Cell movement and immunology were touched upon. Emphasis on studying cells using microscopy and understanding experiment and scientific conclusions you can make (i.e. sufficient versus necessary).",
    "Biology 102 was sometimes interesting and sometimes interesting and sometimes not but I think most people did end up absorbing a lot of information from the class (even if they should have absorbed more) and anyone who needs to take biology 102 will take it regardless of recommendations or the actual quality of the class.",
    "It's kind of a pain, and isn't the most interesting course. It does, however, provide a decent amount of useful more basic information.",
    "Biol 102 was very activity oriented which keeps the material interesting and relevant. However, it can be difficult at times and requires careful attention and time to understand all the concepts.",
    "I would not recommend BIOL 101\/102 to anyone who doesn't need it as a prerequisite or who is not interested in the subject on a deeper level. This is due to the fact that the courses require a lot of consistent work and effort that one can only give if they are truly interested in biological sciences or need it for any other science or pre-professional program.",
    "The quizzes are awful because it is often unclear the connection between them and lecture. The material teaches you what you need to know. Section is very helpful.",
    "Difficult course, but fascinating and rewarding. Take it if you enjoy Biology and\/or you are pre-med. It's full of information you've never encountered before, even if you took AP\/IB Bio, so be prepared to work your butt off to make it. But you'll come away feeling like you really have a grasp of the basics of cell biology. And that's worth something.",
    "I would recommend it only to fulfill a major. I would call it somewhat high intensity introductory cell biology.",
    "The biology courses are good for anyone who is interested in biology. It covers a very complex but interesting topic.",
    "Just like BIO 101, this will usually be required so it doesn't matter. However, I do think this course is more useful than BIO 101 in that it stresses an experimental approach to science, which is typically lacking in high school curricula. That being said, I dont think much is communicated effectively in regards to experiments in lecture and a fair amount of self-studying\/asking TAs for help must be done in order to learn. If you somehow have the option, I would only recommend this course to students who didn't learn much about experimental techniques in high school biology and who are willing to put in the work to learn things that are not taught well.",
    "It's a class you have to take, anyway, so there's not much choice there. It's a basic cell biology course, and from what my friends told me, goes a little beyond what they learned in AP Biology.",
    "BIOL 102 01 is a required course for any Biology major, and as part of the biology cycle it must be taken to get credit for the previous quarter's work. Thus, I must recommend it. I did not find it to be a very fun class, but it was not the most work and the material was interesting. the quizzes every week were necessary to keep the students on top of the material, but the weekly and required sections were terrible, and the papers presented within them did not help at all in reinforcing the class's material.",
    "Boring requirement.",
    "BIO 102 is unfortunately just one o fate giant lecture courses that have to cover a lot of material, and not going to be many people's favorite curse. Most people will take it regardless, because it is a prerequisite for a lot of majors. the professors for the course idd a good job of making the course as enjoyable as possible."
