   "comments": [
    "A great course. Focused, but not too narrowly, on medieval translation with particular attention to Chaucer and his French contemporaries. I would recommend the course to anyone with some background in Chaucer who is interested in looking at his work from a (potentially) new angle.",
    "Yes, I imagine the translation theory would make the course appealing to non-medievalists who may not otherwise have an interest in Chaucer or Machaut.",
    "Yes -- ideally, though, the student would be able to read multiple languages (particularly French or Italian) to make the most of the translation portion of the class.",
    "I would definitely recommend English 545 to another student, particularly if that student has not had the chance to study literature in multiple languages.",
    "ENG 545 was an overview of the current state of scholarship on medieval translation and more broadly on how we think about translation and what constitutes an act of translation. It did so by focusing on Chaucer (for many good reasons) as a well-developed and evidenced instance of the paradigm.",
    "I will most certainly recommend this course to fellow students!",
    "I would summarize this course as a good overview of Chaucer coupled with an introduction to translation studies and issues of multilingualism. I would definitely recommend this course to another student, especially if they already have strong, relevant second-language skills, though it might be more difficult to get into without it (or without some prior background in the Middle Ages)."
