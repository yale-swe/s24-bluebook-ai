   "comments": [
    "I learned all about what it takes to govern a state effectively, both from the perspective of a central government, a local government, and a non-state or regional actor. This may seem very broad and easy to define, but the the importance of how to sequence and time policies in order to implement them effectively makes this especially relevant. We also looked into how these functions are changing with respect to current issues across the globe, and had a class with the head of the World Economic Forum to delve deeper into the Fourth Industrial Revolution. We looked into many case studies to further elaborate on Clare Lockhart's 10 functions of government, and I was able to gain insights on what happens in the mind of the policymaker both from talking to Professor Lockhart and from our trip to DC where we met with countless experts of different backgrounds. I also learned how to write an effective and concise policy memo, taught both by Clare and ambassador Amber Crocker, another fantastic experience.",
    "Writing succinct policy memos and learning about the 10 state functions.",
    "I really enjoyed learning from Prof. Lockhart about the different functions. I find it to be a useful breakdown in other courses too. I learned a lot from the many examples given in class to the different applications of functions.",
    "learned about state functions and presentation",
    "This course provides a good overview of what makes states effective, core state functions, and the difficulties in governing.",
    "Gained specific insight into the 10 critical functions of governance and how to conceptualize their relatedness, implementation, and opportunities\/challenges. Learned about a ton of wonderful case studies around the world that helped illustrate good examples of strong\/innovative governance.",
    "The most important two pieces of knowledge I attained from this course draw from bureaucratic cultures. The first was simply to help me understand that they existed and further complicated policymaking, especially during negotiations. Second and more crucially, lack of bureaucratic experience with the countrys institutions from an opposition can pose serious challenges to the basic function of a state recently wrested from the hands of a dictatorial regime. More than this, I learned to continue seeking out successes especially among unsuccessful countries. This will help ensure that any policy recommendations I make in the future are germane and attainable."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This course is faced with the difficult task of trying to fit a lot of material that could take up many years of teaching into one semester, but there is nobody better to do this than Clare. This course has a lot of discussion and Clare was always sure to leave room for it and not lecture us for the entire time. The presentations also provided very interesting breaks from lectures into case studies to apply the concepts we have learned. MOST OF ALL, the DC trip was an unforgettable experience where we went to the World Bank, USIP, Brookings, and others to talk to leading policymakers with time to ask questions based on what we've been learning. All of their talks were oriented towards our class, and they were also very helpful for career guidance. This was one of my favorite classes I have taken at Yale and has changed my perspective on tons of things, I was excited to go every day and will always be grateful for the opportunity to take a class with Professor Lockhart. I wish I could think of weaknesses and ways to improve this course but I am having trouble doing so. I think it would be interesting (hopefully for the professor too) if students had to submit their thoughts about the readings and that week's topic to the professor before class so Clare could see what people are thinking and answer some of their questions that all can't be answered in class because of time.",
    "Strengths: Great group of students, interesting course material! Weaknesses: Seminars time could've been used more productively, especially hearing Prof Lockhart's own experiences.",
    "I enjoyed having several papers each fousing on a different topic but with a similar framework. I also think the small class size contributed to having a meaningful discussion. The DC trip was excellenet. It was a privilege to meet each and every one of the speakers and they all provided with interesting thought provoking insights.",
    "this course should include an overview of government forms.",
    "Strengths: - We went on a DC trip, paid for and organized by the Jackson Institute. We met with the President of the Brookings, the former US Ambassador to Afghanistan, President of the US Institute for Peace, and more. These speakers were articulate, thoughtful, and honest with us as students. This part of the course made me appreciate the hard work and sacrifices our American diplomats and soldiers make every day to keep us safe and promote US interests. - Professor Lockhart is an expert in this area of work. Her firm, founded and led by her, is one of the top NGO's think about state functions and advises many developing countries around the world. She brought useful real-world experiences from her work. During the course she was helping with the US-Taliban peace negotiations, which was quite interesting. - We learned how to write concise, effective memos. This is probably the most practical element of the course. Memo-writing is an art and the best memos take days to craftthey can be highly effective when formulated properly. We had a memo-writing session with a career State Department diplomat and former US Ambassador to Afghanistan, which was quite helpful in thinking about how to write quality memos. Weaknesses: - The readings were not really discussed much in class and they were a bit too long at times.",
    "Strengths: Well curated readings, brilliant and kind professor, a ton of student involvement which was especially interesting given everyone's backgrounds, INCREDIBLE trip to DC! Weaknesses: While I really appreciated the high level of student participation (lots of presentations), presentations often went over and we had less time to discuss the topics.",
    "This class provided excellent opportunities to synthesize the theoretical and the practical, as the state priorities were all based on empirical observation and consultation with practitioners. The memo format prepared us well for writing in the career field, particularly to a government audience. I also think the largely open nature of class discussions helped us to pursue lines of inquiry to a more natural conclusion. The DC trip was genuinely useful, I have copious notes from the lectures that I will definitely be referring back to in future. The most important improvement is: make the readings central to discussion. I only ever did the readings maybe three weeks out of the semester and one of those occasions was only because it was literally required for an assignment. Most weeks I could and did walk into class having done no reading and be entirely prepared for discussion. Other students rarely referenced the reading in discussion, so I suspect they did the same. I would not recommend organizing the class based on the ISE state priorities - or, if it is organized that way, I would recommend spending more class time establishing the justification for each of the priorities. This could be done either by making reading discussion more central, or by establishing the theoretical importance to reinforce readings which provide case studies. Additionally, the class could have done what a lot of other Yale classes do and assigned responses on a regular basis. I think 2-page written responses every other week would more strongly have established the pattern of memo writing and ensure engagement with the materials. The greatest strength of the class was to try to focus on successes to draw out insights that could be applied elsewhere. The study of weak states understandably focuses largely on failure, but study of success among weak states avoids the issue of using already-prosperous, highly-developed countries as a model for nation-states without the resources to effect such changes.",
    "Time management was a major issue in this class and detracted from the learning experience. We often had to miss out important sections because we ran out of time."

   "comments": [
    "This is one of those classes that is what makes Yale such a special place, to have the chance to take a class with Clare is an incredible opportunity and I really encourage you to look at syllabus and if it interests you in the least you should at least shop it the first week. I can't believe more people didn't sign up for it. Not an overwhelming amount of work, and the work is carefully crafted so as to maximize what you get out of the class without overloading you (which she could easily do considering the scope of the class). Even if you don't want to work at all in this area, the material is interesting and the chance to get it from an expert like Clare is an experience you won't get elsewhere.",
    "Yes! Professor Lockhart has so much invaluable on-the-ground experiences that provide necessary context to such complex content. Her stories demonstrate the challenges of conceiving and coordinating local, regional, and national policy strategy. The policy memos offer an opportunity to dive deeply into another country \/ regional context: make the most of it!",
    "Yes, this course is a way to look at issues broadly but also examine specific case studies. I think it was very different from the other courses I took because the scope was wide but still very much structured.",
    "I highly recommend this course! Professor Lockhart is the best professor I have had and she takes her time to make sure that her students are understanding some very nuanced topics that this class covers.",
    "Yes I would highly recommend this course for all the reasons described above.",
    "YES! Professor Lockhart is a wonderful and has really incredible insight into topics of governance in DC and around the world. You learn a lot of concrete information about governance, as well as many case studies! Makes you excited about public service!",
    "Yes; a systematic study of state weakness and success among weak states is vital to anyone in political science. Prof. Lockhart is also a great resource on research and literature recommendations.",
    "It is an interesting intro to the subject. I would recommend."
