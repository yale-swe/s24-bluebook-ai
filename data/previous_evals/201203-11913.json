    "This is the most reasonable yet rewarding science course I've taken at Yale. Some classes (Cell Bio) are rewarding but tedious, and others are simple but easy to slack in. Biochem keeps you on your toes, but the material in amount and detail is reasonable but relevant. Fair exams, good teaching. This is a great class.",
    "I definitely recommend this course. The information (especially metabolism) is very interesting.",
    "I aced freshman orgo, but I thought MB&B was the hardest science class I've ever taken. It will break you. Have you seen the Dark Knight Rises? Remember the fight scene between Bane and Batman in the sewers? Bane is the biochem final, and Batman's back is your GPA. Oh, also, between the midterms you'll feel hope, as if you're trapped in that hole where Bane grew up... so you'll keep climbing. You'll keep falling. But whether you are the one who emerges from the well is something you will have to find out.",
    "A deeply interesting and complex course. You will learn about a myriad of biological components and the ins and outs of metabolism. I really enjoyed this course. You will be expected to do an easy problem set once a week and when midterms roll around you will be expected to know 300-500 slides worth of information (the first part of each test is stating randomly asked facts) and the overall concepts and connections between all these facts. This is challenging but far from impossible.",
    "It's tough, so only take it if you are really interested in the material. MB&B students have to take it. I am MCDB but chose to do the MB&B biochem instead, and I think I made the right choice. The course was so good that I'm looking forward to second semester biochem.",
    "This is a great course. It's tough and there's a lot of material covered, but you never feel like you're just pointlessly memorizing. In fact, the course does an excellent job of forcing you to focus on learning overarching concepts about biochemistry.",
    "A decent class, the problem sets were much easier than the midterms though. Be warned: for every examination you will be responsible to have a textbook knowledge of every minute detail from every lecture, and many concepts have nothing to do with the basic principles of the class. It may seem a little ridiculous, but they don't tell you how much they actually expect you to know, which can be shocking and infuriating.",
    "yes. probably better than the MCDB biochem equivalent and now you can take only one semester and it is valid for the MCDB major! FANTASTIC -",
    "If you need to take it for the requirement, do it. The class average for the first exam is a 75 and an 83 for the second exam with a standard deviation of 10. If you study and keep up with the material, it is possible to get an A, though it is a little bit difficult.",
    "Easy psets, hard exams. Significant amount of rote memorization even though the professors will try to tell you otherwise. Comparable to cell bio in topics except you learn about metabolic pathways.",
    "MB&B 300 is a tough course; definitely worth taking because it was taught really well and is really applicable. Concepts are organized well and taught clearly.",
    "Great class to take! Very interesting course that goes into proteins, lipids, carbs, and metabolism. However, this means there is much to learn, else you'll find yourself cramming a lot of information for midterms and exams. Overall, a great biochemistry course to take!",
    "A lot of brute force memorization. Your test score will depend on how many of the slides and small little details you managed to memorize. The lectures were boring and the professors were not the most stellar at teaching.",
    "It's pretty interesting and well taught. A million times better than the MCDB version (as I've heard from others, i haven't taken both). I heard that MCDB biochem is poorly taught and it's all about memorizing structures. MBB version has great professors and is more about concepts although there is a significant amount of material to memorize. You will not be asked to just regurgitate random structures though, except for quizzes on the amino acids and glycolysis that you will be well-warned about. Problem sets take about 30 minutes per week which is a huge change from psets in orgo, into chem, and physics. Overall, very worthwhile and you probably have to take it anyway.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to anyone who wants a mechanistic understanding of biochemistry rooted in principles, not mindless memorization. If you liked orgo and are interested in current biomedical research, you will really enjoy and benefit from this class.",
    "An excellent course, and a great first look at biochemistry!",
    "I would recommend this class if you love science, because you will learn a lot and get to think about and understand the material, instead of pure memorization. The class material also overlaps a little with Cell Bio, so taking will make the other slightly easier for you. The class is difficult, but structured fairly, and worth putting the time into to learn the material.",
    "MB&B biochem might be the hardest class I've taken at Yale but, as clich\u00c3\u00a9d as it sounds, was one of the most rewarding. The psets are fine but the exams are REALLY HARD. They require a lot of studying and also a lot of just being good at applying biochem logic. But, you learn so much, and I thought it was awesome to understand so much about metabolism. Might be my worst grade but I liked the class a lot.",
    "Great course. It requires lots of reading and time, but I learned lots about biochemistry and had fun doing it.",
    "Absolutely wonderful. Pre-meds make the class more difficult because of the terrible things they do to the curve but Koelle and Biederer are extremely knowledgeable, very approachable and the course is an excellent introduction to biochemistry of proteins, carbs and lipids. 301 is nucleic acids. This is probably the best-taught science lecture at Yale hands down. I would recommend it to anyone with interest in actually understanding how life works by using metabolic and catabolic pathways in concert to combine simple pathways into a beautifully complex system.TAKE IT.",
    "Very difficult, and very, very interesting. It requires a lot of time to go over the concepts and make sure you really understand them, but very rewarding. Also, the material is pretty cool because you get to learn about metabolism in great detail, and how the different metabolic pathways interact (fats, carbs, etc). I really enjoyed it, especially the second half when Professor Koelle took over, who is a very engaging lecturer.",
    "Study of metabolism (specific molecules and pathways, then integrating the two as a whole). Very well organized, manageable pace, reasonable and constructive assessments. Keep up with the material.",
    "Good class. Just memorize everything and you'll do fine. It's one of those classes. If you're an MCDB\/MBB Junior you'll know what I mean...",
    "A lot of information, but it's really interesting if you're into it.",
    "I would not recommend this course unless you need it for your major.That aside, biochemistry is very interesting and if you are planning on taking this course you probably already think so. The course will be redundant in parts (especially after second semester Orgo with ANDY PHILLIPS!) but will at the same time develop your understanding of biochemistry in yet another step of what I'm sure has been a steady march of several years now. Enough is familiar that you will not be overwhelmed, yet enough is new that you will not get bored. Problem sets are very easy, though the lecturers tend to vary in their competence. Koelle is great!",
    "I would recommend it if you are willing to put in a lot of time to memorizing information. I would not recommend this if you don't need it for you major or for pre-med requirements because it is a lot of work.",
    "This class is one that anyone interested in health or medicine should take! The material is fascinating! The curve is tough, but as log as you focus on the material and what you know it will be fine!",
    "I would definitely take this class. Professor Koelle is excellent, and the material is very interesting. Just make sure you have an otherwise light schedule. This course requires tons of memorization and is jam-packed full of premeds. You'll learn alot but have to work to get a good grade.",
    "Great class. Both Prof. Biederer and Prof. Koelle are great lecturers. I found I had to put in a lot of study hours to fully master the material, but I found it all pretty interesting and enjoyable. Take it!",
    "Absolutely great course. By the end of the class, you realize you have learned so much about biochemistry",
    "YOU LEARN SO MUCH IN THIS CLASS. I went from knowing nothing about how the human body works to feeling like I knew a pretty solid amount about how it works. And it feels great! The downside is that the lectures are dull (esp Prof Biederer's.) Which is a shame because the class is awesome overall. It's a lot lot lot of memorization, also. Study forthe tests way in advance so you get time to absorb the material.",
    "Nothing more than raw memorization till the end. THEN everything makes more sense collectively.",
    "I am a senior, and this is the first class I have taken at Yale that I would not recommend to another student. The lectures are ok, but the amount of material covered is ridiculous, and the exams ask for a level of detail that can only be attainted by memorizing every single bullet-point on every single lecture slide. The material is pretty interesting, but until they change the way they conduct the course, I cannot in good conscience recommend this course to a fellow student.",
    "After taking orgo, I really enjoyed this class. I liked that biochemistry is all applied and the material was just more engaging. Don't think it's going to be easy though - there is a lottt of memorization. Both professors were really great - organized, clear about testing us only on material from the lectures, and really enthusiastic about these topics.Overall, I would definitely recommend.",
    "This class is driven by the fantastic lecturers - Thomas Biederer and Michael Koelle. Their lectures are interesting and engaging, their lecture slides concise and informative. It is very helpful to do the textbook readings before the actual lecture. Yes, they are long, but you will have a much easier time following the lectures. At least skim the main points. The main strength of the textbook is that it provides more examples to contextualize the lecture notes. I love the supplements that are appended to the end of the lectures. These are ten-minute lectures that are not tested and are simply there for us to expand our science knowledge. I wish students would be more respectful of this section and not use it as an excuse to leave early.Don't depend on the notes alone to get you through the class because frankly, that will not work. You must come to lecture. Don't count on the curve to work in your favor because this class is filled with competitive pre-meds. The average on our second midterm was 83 with a standard deviation of more than 10 points. You will very easily fall behind if you don't put in your greatest effort in this class.The quizzes are easy and rote memorization. The problem sets are questions from old exams. There are usually only two or three questions so it shouldn't take more than a half hour to do them.The midterms contain more conceptual questions and are hard if you wait until the few days before them to study. I would say the most difficult part of the midterm was the time crunch. The TA's write the test so a lot depends on them, I guess. The sheer volume of material we learn over the course of the whole semester is daunting but the key to this class is to continuously be reviewing. The final was fair and in the words of another student, \"you get what you put into it.\" It was designed to be a two-hour test but we're given 3.5 hours to do it so there is no time pressure. Start studying early (and I mean before reading week). Doing well in this class is no small achievement. This was definitely my favorite class, challenging and relevant.",
    "It's a hard class, but the exams are fair and the homework is easy. Doing the reading is definitely NOT necessary (don't listen to the professors on this one) - just read the book summaries, your own lecture notes, and review any figures\/tricky topics",
    "It's a lot of stuff to study and memorize. Thomas is a terrible professor (you won't understand a word he says), but Michael Koelle was great. The material itself is fascinating though, you definitely learn a ton of stuff.",
    "MB&B 300 was a great class this semester, probably my favorite despite how difficult it was for me. I hadn't taken biology since my freshman year of high school and who knows what possessed me to take this class (that would actually be three of my friends), but I got through it. And through all of the random details you have to memorize, you realize just how much you learned through the semester. And you will never think about your body in the same way because you now know a lot about its metabolism. The midterms and the finals were fair in accordance with the material through the semester, there weren't many surprises. One problem set a week and they don't take more than a couple of hours if you really work at them.",
    "I would recommend this course. The course material is interesting, and you spend time discussing how the material is related overall health and everyday life.",
    "MBB300 is a really wonderful course! It's a great intro to biochem, you learn so many great things, both lecturers are fantastic. Every class is fun to attend because you learn so many things that you can't wait to share with all your friends when you leave the class. There is a lot of information to remember\/memorize for midterms and the final, but other than that it's really not a lot of work. Seriously, take this class it's really really great. You will learn SO MUCH aboutmetabolism that every time you eat you will think about it!",
    "If you want to learn, take this over the MCDB biochem! But only take it if you need to, it's not as intense as orgo but the material is a loooottt.",
    "This was probably one of the most interesting science courses I've taken at Yale so far. The Profs. really know the material and are excited about teaching it to you in a creative way. That said, it is quite difficult and the grading is a little strict. (still, very feasible to do well)",
    "Take it if you're truly passionate about the material and are willing to contend with pre-meds. Take it only if you're good at rote memorization (contrary to what the professors say about biochem, it does involve a lot of memorizing). Don't take it if you're more interested in the chemistry side of it-- only a few mechanisms were covered and the real extend of it was discussing \"intermolecular forces.\"",
    "Really interesting, well-taught class. I am an MCDB major but took the MB&B biochem because I thought it would be taught better, and I'm glad I did because I looked forward to lecture every day. The psets are also not bad and the TAs are pretty good.That said, the exams are really hard and graded very harshly--they are looking for very specific details when you answer a question. But overall it's worth it, because the class is interesting and doesn't require a lot of work week-to-week...just be prepared to spend A LOT of time studying for exams.",
    "Biochem is great! It's really interesting and manageable. Which is great because I was beginning to lose faith in sciences at Yale. It was the first intro science class at Yale that I actually ENJOYED. Mainly because it was interesting, but the lecturers also seemed to like being there.Michael is an incredible lecturer, and Thomas is just a great guy with a good sense of humor. I always looked forward to the 10 minute supplement at the end of class. Definitely a worthwhile class.",
    "Take it. Worth the knowledge you will have by the end of the semester. Make sure you stay on top of your readings though- you seriously don't want to be behind in this class. The curve is insanely high even though the tests are hard.",
    "Study hard because everyone else is. If you don't, you WILL fall behind and not do well on the very important midterm evaluations.",
    "super interesting- don't take it if you're not willing to put in the work.",
    "Biochem is a very solid course to take, and I hear the 300 is much better than the Spring MCDB version. Prepare to work hard, as the material builds upon itself (try not to fall behind, especially once you start learning metabolism!) and the students are generally very capable. You'll come out with a great appreciation and understanding of the subject",
    "Take it only for your major or if you're really passionate about biology.",
    "This course has two parts. For the first 14 lectures, Professor Biederer talked about the fundamental elements of biochemistry (proteins, enzymes, carbohydrates, membranes, etc.), and I thought this was the most boring class I had ever taken. I very quickly lost any motivation to stay awake in lecture or even attend. The saddest moment of the semester was when our TA told the entire section that if we did poorly on the first midterm, it was because we were \"thinking too hard.\"Then something magical happened in lecture 15, when Professor Koelle took over until the end of the semester and blew our minds with the awesomeness of metabolism. Koelle is one of the best teachers I have ever had; he is so excited about the material, and he is so invested in making you excited about it too. On the whole, this course is very much worth it: the first half is pretty awful, but the second half is SO AMAZING.",
    "It's an alright class, too much memorization in my opinion. They tell you it's all conceptual, but it's basically memorizing everything on the slides. It takes 2-3 hours per slide so make sure to keep that in mind. Also, the professors will tell you that reading the book is necessary, but it really isn't--all the info on the tests are in the slides.",
    "I would recommend it if you need it, but it is a hard class.",
    "This is in my opinion the most important\/fundamental class than any\/every life science major should take.",
    "Great class, highly recommend.",
    "Most people taking this class are doing so because they have to. That being said, I found it very enjoyable and not that much of a workload at all.",
    "Definitely a great class. The exams were hard and a lot of material was covered, but if you put in the work it will be well worth it, I learned a lot from this course. The lectures were really good and rather interesting. Would definitely recommend it to premeds.",
    "Odds are, you have to take this class. The actual material was pretty easy; what's gonna get you is the curve. There are a lot of smart people in this class, and a lot of them were a lot more willing than me to sit down to do some mindless memorization so that they could do well on the tests. This class is still somewhat conceptually based, and probably more so than the mb&b version, but the concepts are definitely not too difficult.",
    "I would definitely recommend this to any student with the slightest interest in biology. The class is great just because the material is so interesting. Professor Koelle is a great lecturer who really gets you excited about the material. There's a lot of information, but you come out of the class feeling like you learned a lot.",
    "A good class. I learned a lot and the material was certainly fascinating. The class was also very well-organized, I never felt as if it was unfairly stacked against me. I would definitely recommend it over the MCDB version. But yeah... the curve was rough. It was stressful. Bad memories. That's inevitable in a class full of pre-meds, I guess? :(Also a note on studying for the midterms: I mostly studied from the textbook and only looked at the lecture notes last minute for Thomas Biederer's test and did really well. I did the same thing for Michael Koelle's test and did, uh, not so well. So I would recommend studying more from the textbook for Biederer's midterm (but look at the lecture notes too!) and more from the lecture notes for Koelle's midterm.Study hard and you'll be fine... probably.",
    "This is a great course. Be prepared to work really hard, though.",
    "Memorize all the lecture notes. You'll still struggle with the midterms\/final, but at least you should get the fill-in-the-blank questions right. So much material to learn.",
    "Definitely take this course. It is really interesting and very well taught.",
    "It is only recommended to people who need it or are particularly interested in biochem. The subject matter is pretty dry, and there is too much memorization. We were constantly told that the goal was to understand how the processes moved forward rather than to memorize every reaction. However, the tests asked lots of really specific questions like \"What protein is responsible for some process\" which isn't understanding, it is memorization.",
    "Most likely you are taking this class as a requirement for your major or for pre med. Either way this was still an enjoyable class. However we did cover a lot of material. The problem sets were very easy and with the lectures you can complete them in about an hour. The midterms tests require that you memorize a lot of small facts, but also understand the bigger conceptual ideas. By the end of the class I felt like I learned a lot of useful information. A lot of what we learned was very medically relevant, which was very useful for all the pre meds in the class. There are two midterms, two quizes, 9 problem sets, and a final. The midterm averages were decently high. The curves has top 20% A next 20% A- then next 20% B+ and so on.",
    "This is a great class. Everything you need to know is printed on the lecture slides and the book serves as just another resource in order to reinforce what you have learned. Most students cant just go through the lecture slides alone without the readings because the readings help bridge some of the gaps and gives context to many of the lecture topics.You are expected to know practically everything on the lecture slides. For exams: If it is on the lecture slides--> know it. If it is extra info from readings, then you may not need to know it.Really though, this is a great class and I learned a lot. If you have the time to devote to studying a day or two for the exams and really make sure you don't skip the details, you will be fine.",
    "This class is incredibly difficult. You must absolutely have enough time to put into studying the material or you will easily fall behind and it's really hard to catch up.",
    "I would recommend the class, but I would say be prepared for extremely difficult tests and little support outside of lecture and your own study group.",
    "MBB 300 is probably the best class I have taken at Yale so far. I will admit, I have dozed off during many a lecture (but that's just because of the timing of the class and a lack of sleep on my behalf). If you keep up in class and actively take notes, you realize how fantastic both lecturers are at presenting the material. Not to mention, how interesting and applicable the material is itself. I found myself making connections between the first half of the class and the research I carry out in an actual scientific lab.",
    "The second half of the semester is better than the first, if you take it with Biederer and Koelle. You do learn biochem, but I found studying for the tests very tedious. They claim that the tests are conceptual and not memorization-based, but they always have questions that ask you to identify an obscure enzyme that was listed on just one slide.",
    "Definitely recommend this for anyone majoring in biology-related subjects. It helps you understand how proteins work, and the material that we cover ranges from relatively old discoveries to things that are still uncertain.",
    "This was a great class-- one of the best taught science classes I've taken at Yale. The professors tell you what is expected straight up. Read the textbook to improve your understanding, but most importantly, go to class (do not miss a single class!) and take notes on the slides they give you. Sit near the front to stay focused.",
    "This is a great upper level science course - very well thought (although both professors have different teaching styles, you will learn to appreciate both) and very well structured. The material is also interesting and applicable",
    "This is not the class to take with a heavy schedule. The material is interesting but there's so much memorization to do for the tests, and you definitely won't do well if you try to cram. Make the class your priority.",
    "Most people take this class because they have to for either a major requirement or pre-professional requirement, so the curve is difficult and LOTS of details are expected on the exams.",
    "Yes, even if you're not pre-med or a science major, I would recommend this course as it was very interesting.",
    "A lot of material to digest quickly. Do not overload yourself with other intensive workload courses. Do not waste your time reading the textbook. Memorize all the facts on the lecture slides.",
    "This course is not easy. It is one of the toughest courses I have taken at Yale so far, and I have taken a whole lot of the demanding premed ones. The competition is brutally fierce. That being said, I have never taken before a more worthwhile and fulfilling course than this one and another one I was taking concurrently this semester. Totally worth it.",
    "I would recommend this course. It is very well thought. Everyone does really well though so it might be difficult to do better than the average since most people in the class are always studying.",
    "I would recommend this course! I think it's really important for any future doctor, but I also think it is very well taught and very interesting for whoever would like to know more about how the human body functions. Needless to say, there is a ton of information to memorize and it was a lot more difficult todo in the midterms and final than was previously expected. There's a lot to connect and many small details that, despite the professors' sayings, are actually tested for. If you can stick through and manage, great course.",
    "Really well-taught course that presents an overview of biochemical principles. The lectures are all very digestible, the professors are great, and the exams are fair, though they do require a good amount of preparation. The course does a great job in introducing fundamental biochemical concepts, and I really do feel like I have so much of a better understanding of these concepts after the course.",
    "If you are interested in biochemistry, you should definitely take this course over the MCDB version. The professors are both great lecturers.",
    "If you liked Cell Bio, take this class; it's mostly the same stuff with a bit more detail and different emphasis.I thoroughly enjoyed Biochem. The professors are excellent teachers, and moreover, the love what they do (also, Prof. Biederer has a German accent and looks like a pirate). Though there is a metric ton of information that you need to memorise and synthesise, it was less \"grunt work\" than many other science courses (i.e. the homework does not take very long and seemed to be designed to test your working knowledge of the material versus just a meaningless set of problems to do).Overall, I would recommend this (at least if you need it for premed or your major)",
    "Take this, don't take the MCDB one.",
    "Yes. This was one of the better science classes I've taken here. You'll learn a lot of interesting material, and the professors at least tried to be engaging, though covering so much made this difficult. I found it hard to pay attention during lecture, but it wasn't too difficult to learn the information before the exams. The curve's pretty generous and the weekly work is minimal-- the problem sets should take less than half an hour.",
    "Amazing course! You start by understanding the basic building blocks at play: basic review of thermodynamics and entropy from general chemistry, amino acids, how they come together to form polypeptides and fold into proteins from an energetic standpoint, etc. This involves some tedious memorization (the side chains of all the amino acids, how many amino acids go into the turn of an alpha helix, etc.) but all of it pays off as you take the next step to understand exactly how enzymes work (substrate binding, how they actually lower the activation energy, their kinetics, etc.) and how transporters' structure helps them to perform their roles in the cell. Meanwhile, you learn about carbohydrates and lipids and see how all of them come together in membranes. Then, you make the leap from individual proteins and structures to biochemical pathways, in which you learn about the beautiful molecular machinery in metabolism. You gain an appreciation for the interconnectedness of it all and the intricate feedback mechanisms that keep our liver from exploding or our blood from getting so acidic that we go into a coma. The professors understand that they are teaching to a largely pre-med audience, so they bring in clinical applications where they can. It's a beautiful subject taught by professors who know their stuff and teach it REALLY well. In concept and execution it was probably the best science class I have taken at Yale (from a junior MCDB major).The midterms and final require a ton of memorization, but this is unfortunately necessary if you want to be able to appreciate the whole picture and understand how things connect to each other. Other than decently difficult tests, your only assignments are problem sets that are just 2-3 problems from old exams. They are a good invitation to review the lecture slides, but require little thought and stress (took 1-2 hours maximum each week). Take this course! You will appreciate the beauty of science all the time!",
    "I would say that biochem is your standard pre-med course but with easier problems sets and harder exams. Its also your standard pre-med environment with the grading curve based on the class' performance. Take it if you're genuinely interesting in the material- sometimes the lectures were pretty fascinating. Be prepared to put in a LOT of study time.",
    "Great course. One of the best science classes I've taken at Yale. Biederer and Koelle are a dynamic duo and make sure you understand the bigger picture of biochem with complementary details. Make sure to keep up with lecture notes ecause the material builds on itself and is very rewarding if you keep up. You don't want to miss out because of procrastination.",
    "This class is tough so I'd only recommend it if you are MBB or Premed. If you're MCDB you should probably just take the easier version in the spring which is only one term long and offered through the MCDB department."
