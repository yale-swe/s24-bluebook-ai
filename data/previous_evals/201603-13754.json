    "Intensive schedule putting visual research and designing together is very effective on gaining knowledge on the history of costume\/clothing. But sometimes I think we don't have enough discussion on the play itself, which indeed might be less important at this stage.",
    "The teacher was so nice and with her big experience introduced to us new interesting details about historical costumes.",
    "I think the class is well structured. I enjoy learning about the history of clothing and implementing it to a play's design.",
    "I enjoy the course throughout the whole semester. The course is well arranged as two or three weeks for one play in chronological order of its costume period. The atmosphere of the class is super chill. Love two professors and the way they teach, not much pushing but they do have deliver a lot during casual talking over every ones designs."

    "Putting sometimes on explaining different costume terms at the beginning of the semester or each period might be useful. May be could also provide an overview of the scope of what this course will cover for the year too?",
    "Nothing, everything was great.",
    "Even though I understand the benefits of an historical reference, I would have loved a few more opportunity to get wilder with the design and not be grounded in a historical period",
    "I wish we could have much more opportunities dealing with the real fabric. And more opportunities to see the actual present of the costumes on the stage."
