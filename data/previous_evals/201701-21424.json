    "I learned so much about African fiction!",
    "This was my first class that had theory and my first experience integrating it into my work. I also wrote the longest essay I've ever written.",
    "Wow...where to start with this class? I came into the semester having no exposure to African literature, and emerged with a whole world beginning to open up to me. This class humbled and challenged me, in that it didn't allow me to rely on my sturdy footing of literary and cultural analysis that has served me so well in all my other humanities classes. It actually forced me to be new to a field, to lack the language and background to bring me to the \"answers.\" (As Professor Newell often reminded me, the texts you explore will often invite you in, and at other times will shut you out, remind you that you are a trespasser here.) And yet, despite the newness and complexity of the issues and challenges we were exploring, I actually finished the class feeling that I had soaked up a lot not just answers, but also questions, to cast necessary doubt and uncertainty on the ways I usually encounter texts.",

   "comments": [
    "Seniors who are not taking this course for their major should be able to write two 10-15 page papers, as well.",
    "I loved it as is! The books were great, and reading one a week was a good pace for me. I rarely read the essays or theory for each week that accompanied them, but I was still able to participate in discussion every week.",
    "Great course! The reading list is great and I really enjoyed class discussions. A little more emphasis on theory might have good good for structure, but overall great class.",
    "Strengths: very engaging class, entirely discussion, difficult Weaknesses: very large, hard to speak more than a couple of times",
    "The texts were absolutely amazing. Some of my favorite books I've read at Yale in my whole life, in fact. Professor Newell was much of the strength of this class. But the other students were also great, willing to wrestle with questions that remained unresolved at the time of our last class meeting (and, to my knowledge, still have not been solved!).",
    "Amazing!",
    "This course was absolutely wonderful. Steph did an amazing job both crafting the syllabus and leading class discussion. She used this class to connect books using magical realism in ways that I haven't seen elsewhere and gave the students the agency to tackle the material."

    "A great introduction to African fiction! The course needs more non-white participation.",
    "Yes, take this! If you do the reading you'll learn so much during seminar, which I always looked forward to (it's one book a week; some are shorter than others; it was almost always doable). The one long paper was the only class assignment--I liked this set up because it let me focus on reading during the semester, and really hone in on one topic to write a paper I was really proud of in the end. That said, this might not be the class structure for everyone, especially if you'll have a lot of other papers to write during reading week. Steph is lovely and I really appreciated getting to know her over the course of the semester. She enjoyed discussions as much as we did, which made class that much more fun. I chose to take this English class over another one because I wanted to explore literature that I wouldn't otherwise, and I am so glad I did!",
    "Absolutely, take it. Steph is brilliant, kind, and approachable. She will guide you through some really hard texts so that you come out with a complex and nuanced understanding of the works. Some really great books (many of which you prob won't ever read if you aren't independently interested in african fiction) and our year even had an author visit! Only one paper, but it's 25-30 pages, so it's pretty killer... but you in theory get started early and Steph is available for office hours\/chats\/emails.",
    "Absolutely! Take this class, you'll love it. I frequently read books for this class, felt underwhelmed by then, but then came out of seminar excited and fascinated. Any class that can do that is worth taking. 90% of the time class really adds to what you've read. And the reading list is great to begin with. Plus Steph is fun and a wonderful professor. Not much downside to this class.",
    "I would only recommend it to English majors and those who will take it seriously. Reading the materials just once didn't feel enough.",
    "One hundred percent, would recommend. This is a class that is founded on engaging, eye-opening, heart-shaping stories, but will also force you to ask the hard questions about culture and history and difference and how we choose to talk about these things. So whatever your background with African fiction (I had none), you will encounter and confront challenges to representation, narrative, and notions of sanity that will sometimes boggle your mind. As you wrestle with these questions, you'll also be reading about what it's like to hunt flies when you're trapped in the body of a chameleon, an entire section of a city flooded with milk, and an epic escape through a latrine (not to give too much away). So the class keeps you on your toes in more ways than one, and also tells you some great stories along the way. On a more practical note, class discussions are exciting and actually make you want to read the texts. It's a book a week, but they're wonderful books. Not to mention, our visit from author Elnathan John at the end of the course was a once-in-a-lifetime experience!",
    "TAKE THIS COURSE!!! Steph is amazing!!!",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class. Steph is an amazing professor and I learned so much in this class beyond the course material. I also learned so much about the course material itself. This has been on of my favorite classes at Yale. Yes, you have to do all the reading but the class discussions are so generative and just built up my enthusiasm to take the class again."
