    "This class did a great job of summarizing and explaining modern Chinese economics.",
    "A new perspective on China and the US.",
    "I learned about China's economic past, present, and future learning macro drivers of the Chinese economy as well as the political motivations of society and government.",
    "I learned extensively about Chinese economic development, the history of Chinese leaders, and the future imperatives of a growing China. Moreover, I am better versed with the complications of the US-China trade war and how a potential trade agreement may or may not address the underlying problems.",
    "I learned about the history, economics, and socio-political background of China. This course was a great course for someone who did not know anything about China going into it. I learned that There are several shifts China must make to become a moderately prosperous society, such as shifting from manufacturing to services, building its safety net to address its aging problem, shifting from surplus saving to saving absorption, and from imported to indigenous innovation",
    "the major challenges of the Next China, the analytical tools to analyze the problems\/challenges of the Next China, how to view the US-China conflict from a multilateral perspective",
    "The course was very insightful in not only learning about China and its future problems and plans, but what it takes for a country to succeed and how to analytically observe a country and the micro and macro problems it may endure.",
    "An overview of whether or not China's current economic system is sustainable",
    "As someone who was already very knowledgeable about China and grew up there, I didn't learn a great amount and was familiar with all the issues\/topics Roach talked about. However, it was very insight to get his take on issues, and learn about his personal perspectives on those issues, especially on the financial\/economic side (he was former chairman of Morgan Stanley). I also learned a lot about Japan, as Roach likes to compare China to Japan (for good reasons). The most amount of knowledge I gained was from doing all the readings (as one of the rare few) and on the financial side of things.",
    "Very few. I guess I'm now moderately conversant in some problems confronting modern China.",
    "So many things about China. If you internalize every concept in this class, you are truly so much better off in our world's future (because China will play an increasingly large role in global geopolitical affairs).",
    "I developed an understanding of the complex relationship between the United States and China. I gained insight into the history of governance in China and why that has shaped the country to be what it is today. We also learned what the goals of the Chinese are going forward and what key areas need to improve in order for China to transition to \"The Next China\".",
    "I learned about Chinas recent past and where it could potentially go, obstacles for growth and what China is doing about them, and why China is positioned where it is on the global stage.",
    "Solid overview of the economic (and political) situation in China",
    "I developed a much deeper understanding of China's economy and how it compares to that of the US.",
    "I got a broad overview of topics relevant to Chinas development. The first half of the course establishes a framework to examine Chinas transition imperatives and in the second half we apply the framework to several ongoing issues.",
    "I developed a stronger intuition of how to apply microeconomic and macroeconomic concepts learned. I also developed a stronger expertise in Chinese economic and political issues.",
    "- Interdisciplinary understanding of the Chinese economy and politics - Became interested in Chinese\/East Asia tech and market growth in comparison to Western countries, an idea I hope to continue looking into",
    "I learned a lot about the current state of chinas economy and US China relations!",
    "A very comprehensive introduction to the history, economics, and politics of China, as well as frameworks for evaluating the future of the Chinese economy.",
    "I don't think I got many skills, although I did end up writing a 15+ page econ research paper. I did gain a lot of interesting knowledge about China and the economy's history and trajectory.",
    "cool sections lectures can be a bit dry but really good certain days",
    "Macroeconomic analysis, applications of macroeconomic development, recent Chinese history and growth, how to write a 15 page paper",
    "Learned lots about Chinese economy",
    "You learn first and foremost how to analyze global affairs style problems. Then, you learn about all the possible considerations in China's relationship with the world, its relationship with the US, and it's dynamics through time. If you want to understand the economic, political, and social beliefs of the Chinese nation, then take this course.",
    "I didnt learn much.",
    "This class gave me a very in depth look at both the past and present of the Chinese economy, and what China will need to do in order to be an economic superpower in the future.",
    "I learned a lot about China in the past, present, and future.",
    "We learned a vast knowledge of the recent history of China's economy and Professor Roach's opinions on the future of the economy.",
    "Learned about China's economy, past and present, and how its shaped by its politics",
    "I developed both an analytical and theoretical framework tied to understanding the Chinese economy and its relation with the rest of the world. I learnt a lot about macroeconomics, in a very applied way, which I particularly enjoyed.",

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: a great professor; interesting information; guest speakers; my TA Hans conducted a really good discussion section Weaknesses: no accountability for readings(could not do any of the readings all semester and will not impact your grades on the midterm or the final)",
    "I think the lecture topics sometimes swam together a bit. It's not a huge deal, but I think I could sometimes lose a sense of directionality in the course.",
    "This course was incredibly interesting and there was a lot to learn! The course did a pretty deep dive with \"The Next China\", viewing it from almost every lens other than possibly a health one. It was very interesting, and I learned a lot and Professor Roach clearly knows a lot. His slides can be a little dense, and difficult to understand in isolation which is why coming to lecture is important, to understand he skew of them. But, looking back on the structure of the class, there are key themes that are very salient and interesting to know about.",
    "Strengths: Professor Roach has real world experience that he shares with the class. The material itself is interesting, even if the presentation is not always the most engaging Weaknesses: The course is heavily skewed pro-China. For example, the professor inserted the word alleged the one time that he mentioned the detention of Uyghurs in western China. On a slide, he labeled the condemnation as human rights exceptionalism. These biases can become very frustrating, as it is clear that the narrative is more complicated than the professor presents. This blatant politicization causes students to call into question the other material from the course. Professor Roach should try to present all sides to these complicated issues and leave political opinions as far as possible from lectures.",
    "This course was a fantastic course in which I learned a lot, but was never stressed. The workload is pretty low, with just a midterm, paper and final, and all are graded very fairly. Professor Roach is a great lecturer too",
    "sections were kinda a mess with random people talking at each other but not with one another. lectures were pretty boring with super long readings, but overall, material covered with pretty interesting, although quite broad.",
    "The slides tend to be interesting enough to keep attentive. The guest speakers seem irrelevant and kind of off topic as they do not go into the same detail as Professor Roach.",
    "Lectures are interesting but at times dry, maybe teach some more economic concepts. Also gets really repetitive",
    "Strengths: Roach is a great lecturer and the course is well-organized, especially the learning material. The reading selections were also quite good and challenging (mix of articles, books, and IMF\/World Bank reports, etc), although a bit lengthy Weaknesses: not really, from my perspective. Readings may get a bit much to handle esp if you're juggling a large workload but they really help in understanding the course\/taking the final. Also, there are a lot of definitions\/concepts that Roach doesn't clarify (does he expect us to know financial terms? smh) and you will have to look up\/ask your TF in section.",
    "Interesting class but dry sometimes",
    "Very interesting, wide variety of concepts that are covered very well. Sometimes the slides are a little too cluttered-- they require further at home scrutinization to truly glean all the info.",
    "I think one of the biggest strengths of the course is Professor Roach. He is clearly passionate about the subject and also well-educated in that field. I also thought that the structure of the course was great. The midterm and final exam were nicely spaced apart, and the midterm paper in the middle gave us a chance to write on a topic that we were passionate about.",
    "It was pretty well organized overall, but there were a couple of guest lectures and I do not feel that they were particularly well-integrated into the overall course.",
    "Strengths: Engaging and interesting lecture; Roach is an incredible orator. Material is super interesting as well, and the class is very relevant to daily life in the business world. Roachs slide decks are super thorough. Weaknesses: Grade is entirely dependent on your TA, like many lectures, which sucks. Try to screen your TA before signing up for section.",
    "Lecture was boring so never went, and in fact I think I was better off for having skipped lecture because Roach would basically just read the slides, which were comprehensive enough to read on your own and understand everything anyway. Section grading is also super arbitrary and depends on whether your TA likes you. Readings were almost always unnecessary, although they could be quite interesting. 15 page paper was a huge pain. That all being said, I learned a lot in this class, and the material was super interesting despite the shortcomings of the course structure.",
    "The course was quite interesting but I feel like some of the reading was not connected to lecture. I think the material from lecture, readings, and section could have been tied together a bit more effectively.",
    "Strengths: Breadth and depth Weakness: Too many readings. Theres no reason to assign 150+ pages of reading every week when we dont need to know it all, discuss the main points during lecture, and are taking 4-5 other courses with their own work.",
    "The strength is the teaching. Both the professor and the TFs really try to help you succeed. The weakness is maybe the length of discussion sections. Having student and TF presentations doesnt allow for enough time for discussion.",
    "The strength of the course is both the breadth and depth of the content covered. The weakness of the course is the organization. Sometimes it seems unclear why the lectures are sequenced the way they are, and material that links two topics might be spread weeks apart in the course.",
    "- Very well structured - I personally enjoyed the lectures and the way discussion was structured (a few students lead on a given topic each week)",
    "I loved the content of the course I didnt know much about China and I thought the course was a great way to learn. I did think the PowerPoint slides were unnecessarily dense.",
    "No weaknesses. Fantastic professor and very intuitive and solid structure.",
    "We don't get grading rubrics, which in this case lead to harsh grading, in my opinion. We wouldn't need the rubrics if we were given a bit more direction for how the grade would be determined.",
    "strengths are sections and relevancy to current events weaknesses are lectures go a bit too fast",
    "Its a great class, Stephen roach is really cool, and I loved my TA Few weaknesses, although I would have liked to be forced to hand in a rough draft of my paper; but that is asking a lot. I could have used a little more guidance though",
    "Good content and great lecturer Clearer notes",
    "Strengths: easy grading, easy assessments, helpful TAs, very informative lecture slides. Cons: Lecture itself didn't add very much to my learning the material outside of what was written on the lecture slides.",
    "Lecture is dry and the slides are not presented in an easy to understand way. Challenge of the class and even explicit expectations for assessments and grading vary widely by TF.",
    "I think that for the most part the class was very interesting. For the lectures, I truly enjoyed each one and felt that I was learning and retaining a lot of the information, and the information didnt feel repetitive so each lecture provided me with something different. I feel that in section however, the student led aspect felt a little disorganized and couldve been used more efficiently.",
    "Lecture slides were detailed.",
    "Strengths: You learn a lot of material and have the opportunity to go very in-depth in the essay into a topic of your choice. Weaknesses: readings were too long and dense that I rarely completed them.",
    "Strengths: got to eat lunch w Professor Roach and Kenneth Kang of IMF (and it was delicious). this course definitely tried to teach both breadth and depth, and I learned a lot about China as a whole",
    "The primary strength of the course was how knowledgeable Professor Roach was. He really is an expert in the field and did a very good job of simplifying a lot of difficult concepts and topics. He also peppered the course with very interesting guest lectures which I enjoyed. Sometimes lectures got a little tedious and hard to follow, the only minor flaw of the course.",
    "Strengths: detailed lecture slides Weaknesses: discussion sections had nothing to do with the class"

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in economics or global relations. The workload is light and the lectures are interesting.",
    "Definitely recommend it, just watch out for the 15 page essay. Otherwise you have a very low workload all semester other than readings that no one actually completes.",
    "I definitely would recommend this course. If you are interested in China and economics\/global affairs\/political science, this class is a must. There are so many elements of this class that are really informative, and it is a really good applicative econ\/political class. A great focus on qualitative material, rather than hard quantitation.",
    "I learned so much in this course! Professor Roach is an absolute baller and THE leading voice in US-China relations. His lectures were very intriguing (if you make the effort to follow along), his slides were meticulously made, his office hours are readily available, and his expectations are clear.",
    "I would only recommend this course if you are looking for a fairly easy economics credit or are highly interested in Chinese economic development. I did learn about these topics, but the professor did not treat them in an apolitical manner. Instead, he taught according to a very strong pro-China viewpoint, which became frustrating by the end of the course. Moreover, there is only a midterm, final, and term paper due around Thanksgiving. This made it possible to disengage during busy weeks.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student, but especially econ majors looking for an easy yet interesting credit. Grading is not difficult in this class, but you still learn a ton from lectures and sections. There is a 15 page paper which I spent a long time on, so beware of that",
    "The first half of the class is well-organized and highly interesting, but it really fell off after the midterm - the course didn't feel like it had any overarching narrative, with each lecture covering a seemingly random topic related to China's economy. Roach is an incredibly knowledgeable and impressive professor, but the lectures are filled with buzzwords that don't seem to mean anything. Workload isn't too bad (midterm, final, 15-page paper), but get ready for a lot of pro-China sentiment in the lectures.",
    "yes, if you need a pretty interesting\/relevant Economics elective that really is more history than economics-heavy",
    "Yes, it is a very interesting econ course that actually provides real world data rather than simple equations or hypotheticals. the topic is also extremely current and impactful",
    "If you're interested in China, yes. It does a good job tying in how Chinese culture and history ties into China's current economic problems.",
    "If you don't know a lot about China or Chinese economics, and are interested, I highly suggest it. Even if you already do, it's refreshing and intriguing to hear Roach's perspective and debate in section.",
    "Probably not. I'm skeptical of the vast majority of claims made in this class, and there's little room for analytic rigor given just how broadly and superficially we discuss the challenges\/opportunities facing modern China. Did I gain any more broadly applicable skills? No. Did I gain any insight about the topic? Only a bit, and most of it of a crude, factual nature. Not necessarily an easy A either, but relatively low workload.",
    "yes",
    "Yes good class. Learned a lot",
    "Absolutely! Professor Roach is wonderful and the subject matter is very interesting. It is also a course that is very much relevant today as the trade conflict between the US and China is currently going on. It is a great Econ elective and just a great class in general if you are interested in learning more about US and China relations.",
    "Yes; Professor Roach is a great lecturer and an expert in economics, and the material is very interesting.",
    "Yes, but only if you can get a good TA as your TA is the sole determiner of your grade.",
    "Sure? I'm torn on how to answer this question because for me this was a course in which the material was super interesting, and that certainly speaks positively about the course because it's a coherent yet diverse body of material Roach handpicked. At the same time, the course was not well taught, and the grading scheme was almost completely opaque. So it's a mixed bag, but I'd take it if you're interested in learning about the Chinese economy (and are willing to use a Credit D if necessary).",
    "This course is strongly biased toward China's economic and government model. It's probably the course at Yale where I have most often disagreed with the professor, and I don't feel like each side of issues was given equal weight. However, I do feel like I learned new things and was pushed to consider my viewpoints where I disagreed, so I would recommend this course.",
    "Yes! If you're interested in learning more about China's economy and development, it's a great course.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone seeking an analytical framework through which to understand Chinas transitions. As a double major in economics and East Asian Studies, this class was perfect!",
    "Yes, I think the course covers important issues, and Professor Roach's perspective on the issues is very unique, evidence-based, and rational.",
    "Yes. Regardless of whether you are super interested in economics or not (I know i personally was not going into the course), you gain a broad understanding of Chinas history and how past economic and political events impact the China of today and will impact the China of tomorrow",
    "Id definitely recommend this!",
    "ABSOLUTELY. To econ and non-econ majors alike, this is a fantastic course -- you will not only learn a lot about Chinese politics, economics, and history, but you will also internalize frameworks that will allow you to draw parallels with other countries' economies.",
    "As a sophomore non-economics major taking this class with just preparation from AP econ from high school, I learned a lot, however sometimes struggled understanding concepts. It helps that major themes are repeated, and that we can ask TF's questions in section. Overall I am glad I took it, and would recommend as long as you don't know much about China. (otherwise it could be boring)",
    "yes because of how relevant it is to current events",
    "Yes! Best economics elective there is. Cool guest speakers. Really interesting material if you are at all interested in Chinese development or the economics of developing countries.",
    "10\/10! It's a great course for people interested in International Economics.",
    "Yes it is a great intro into how China plays a role in current affairs",
    "If you have any interest in learning about China's government, past, plans for the future, or international relations, then take this course. It's easy to manage with the rest of your workload and it's very comprehensive in the scope of topics it covers.",
    "No. Quite a misleading class, with very little economic thought and a lot of political commentary presented as fact. There are better primers to China.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to another student because it gives a very in depth look at the Chinese economy and it gives you insight as to what China will have to do as it makes its economic transition.",
    "Yes, very informational about China and the US-China relationship and co-dependency, which is very relevant now.",
    "No.",
    "If you have an interest in China, yes. If not, no.",
    "Yes, if you're trying to learn about China as an East Asian hegemon, if you want to be informed on China-US relations, if you just want to see China from an economic lens",
    "Yes, definitely. If you are interested in anything related to the Chinese economy, this is a great course to take. Prof Roach is brilliant and very engaged, making lectures interesting and thought provoking. The workload is also very manageable.",
    "Its not that stressful, but everything depends on the TF you get"
