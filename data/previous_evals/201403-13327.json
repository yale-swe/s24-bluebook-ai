    "Put simply, this class was a treat. Honestly, it's a chance to just sit around and listen to Prof. Merman reminisce about his experiences in Paris, and tell awesome stories about the craziness of the post-French Revolution era. Reading load is heavy but not mandatory -- as long as you do most of it you'll be able to participate in class, and most of the books are interesting and enjoyable anyways. The final paper is a big one (20-30 pages), but you have literally all semester to write it. At the end of the semester, I honestly can't say that I've learned a lot of concrete facts\/historical information, but I've definitely gotten much more of a feel for French culture -- and also just had a ton of fun hanging out with Prof. Merriman (who's really the best, super chill and kind, and an incredible scholar as well). Take it!",
    "You learn about the emergence of modern Paris, from the Revolutions to Haussman to De Gaulle. If you are seeking a low-key environment to learn about this era, look no further.",
    "This is a quality history seminar. Merriman is incredibly knowledgable and a great guy. Discussions were enjoyable and laid back. Term paper should be started early.",
    "Great course! Very interdisciplinary, you get a great sense and understanding of literature, art, artchitecture, political philosophy and of course history.",
    "Take this class if you have any interest in France, the time period discussed, or urban movements. Even if you have no interest, Merriman will make the class worthwhile, enjoyable and fun.",
    "Take it if you've spent a lot of time in Paris, or if you want to hang out with Merriman, or both. Very relaxed until the final paper."
