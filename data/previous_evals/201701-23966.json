    "The workload for Principles of Development was often long, and rarely informative. We have the opportunity to practice writing fundraising appeals for both Business Writing and the Development PWA. Considering that we were using a made-up theater for the homework, often it felt like we were making up the assignment itself, in addition to our response to the assignment. In reality, you don't get to choose the circumstances of the theater for which you are trying to raise money. Furthermore, the assignments were rarely if ever discussed in class, which felt as though they were ancillary, rather than integral, to the course. As such, any insights gleaned from the homework would never be discussed again. At the same time, the classes we would have prior to doing the homework were not adequate preparation for the assignments. Andy's comments on our assignments were helpful - but again, since we were writing for made-up theaters, his comments were context-specific, and I struggle to understand how they will be helpful for me in any theater other than the one I created for the class."

    "The syllabus for this course, and the use of digital resources, left a lot to be desired. The syllabus was confusing to read, as it was unclear whether the reading and assignments for each class were for that week's class, or for the following. The syllabus also changed format halfway through the session, at first listing each class meeting as two classes (each 1.5 hrs long), then changing to single classes. The repository of digital materials on v2 was also disorganized, such that it was hard to find the reading for any given class on the site. It would be better if the readings were arranged in folders by the classes in which the readings were to be discussed."

    "As an instructor, Andy's style tended towards telling stories of his own experiences, which are necessarily limited by the work that he has done. As such, anyone who was not interested in large-scale development for New York theaters was somewhat disadvantaged by his lessons. Andy also has a tendency to talk over the class, not allowing the students to contribute fully, even as he encouraged conversation by asking questions of the class. He would ask a question of the group, and then speak at length with his own answer, without seeming to listen to our responses. Often, he would repeat things that I had said in response to his questions, phrased a different way, as if I had not said the same thing a moment before.",
    "Class often felt like we were just hearing stories and not basics that we could then apply to other facets of Development or even other classes. The knowledge didn't seem as transferable. Also, there was a heavy reliance on theatre and New York City which was hard because many of us may not go back to NYC and need to know how to apply knowledge to other markets AND because we had a non-theater manager in our class. I often felt like she wasn't getting as much from the lectures that she could have been if it was structured differently."

    "The insights we gleaned from practicing development writing in the homework were never borne out in class, and the classes were rarely adequate preparation to do the homework. As such, my learning in the class was somewhat limited. Given that Andy's field of expertise happens to be in the sector in which I want to work, I benefited somewhat from his stories, but even then, many of his stories were context-specific. Furthermore, the fact that our main textbook is 35 years old also limits the amount I could possibly learn. The fact is that the development landscape has changed since the mid-80s, and I feel that we did not do an adequate job of discussing the current landscape outside of Andy's particular experience. In total, I do not think that I learned to think better as a development officer by taking Andy's class. Honestly, I learned more in three weeks in the Development PWA about thinking like a development officer than I did in a semester with Andy.",
    "I found that teaching the fundamentals of development was left to the reading, while the class time focused on real world examples and stories. Since everyone had varying degrees of experience with fundraising, the course felt uneven. It would be helpful to go through the basic building blocks of fundraising so that everyone is on the same page throughout the class."

    "- Updated textbook - More discussion outside of the specific context of large nonprofits in New York - More discussion of principles, rather than specific exercises in writing for a fake theater. - It might be good if homework assignments were designed to test our ability to make relationships or communicate aspects of a\/our theater, rather than practicing writing a specific type of development communication (which we also have the opportunity to do in our Business Writing workshop).",
    "Update the syllabus because it is hard to read and restructure how lectures are taught. It would be great if it was more of conversation. It happened in one class and that was the best one we had.",
    "For the final project, I would have liked feedback and guidance during the presentations. The in-person asks are the most intimidating part of fundraising. Feedback during the exercise, and the opportunity to try again afterwards, would be beneficial."
