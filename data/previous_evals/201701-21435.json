   "comments": [
    "!! I learned Self Discipline by actually writing every week and ending up with a full-length play! I really needed that.",
    "I gleamed more insight into the business of playwriting, how well-made (and not so well-made) plays and playwriting careers are constructed, and how to better approach writing a full-length play.",
    "Having never written a play before (much less a full-length one), I learned an enormous amount in this class. The readings were great and varied, and it was especially helpful to learn from everyone else's work. Having to workshop new material every week is really challenging, but it helped me get over my nerves and focus on how I could improve my own play.",
    "I became better at reading and thinking about plays at a literary level, and also at analyzing\/discussing other people's plays.",
    "Probably the greatest benefit of this class is that it required me to produce content on a regular schedule with the feedback of my peers."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: It's such a blast, highlight of my week, we read surprisingly amazing plays, everyone super friendly. Weaknesses: Didn't feel like I always got that much out of workshopping from my fellow classmates -- reading aloud was helpful, and Prof Margulies and Tori were always helpful, but sometimes it felt like everyone was just counting down to their turn to share.",
    "I love that the reading list allows us to study contemporary playwrights, so that our work feels as if it is entering the conversation of contemporary American theater. The peer workshop setup allows me to receive feedback from both those in the class as well as Professor Margulies, so that I am always considering how to improve my work from myriad perspectives. As is the case with these workshops, the courses major weakness is that if you dont write your play chronologically, most of your discussion time is spent with people asking contextual questions rather than giving direct critique of your pages. However, this is the way the workshops always work, and until theres a better system, a pages-by-week workshop system it is!",
    "The weekly workshop was tough but helpful, and I liked how much we got to know each other and each other's work. I think the weekly prompts could be a little more specific in the first few weeks of the course, although I understand that this is a self-directed advanced course.",
    "Weekly writing assignments were great for getting us to dive into our plays early on, and I liked the opportunity to read\/discuss one to two plays each week. I wish that we had more benchmarks for our play beyond the weekly writing assignments (i.e. a midterm set of pages). Perhaps a meeting with Prof Margulies could accompany this midterm assignment.",
    "This class was great. If you're serious about playwriting or even long form writing in general, it's worth taking."

   "comments": [
    "Definitelyif you are serious about playwriting, this is the class for you. The small class allows you to really explore everyones work, at the same time you are working on your own play, and Professor Margulies gives incredibly valuable feedback.",
    "Definitely take this if you're interested in playwriting -- I had basically no experience, but it was still a useful and interesting class. Plus I got to read and discuss a bunch of plays that I wouldn't otherwise have picked up.",
    "I'm very grateful to have taken a class with Donald Margulies - I appreciated his insights on my writing\/on the plays we led. The course is very self-directed. If you put in a lot of time on your play throughout the semester you'll get a lot out of it. If you don't, and just do the minimum for the weekly assignments, you'll have a whole lot of play to write before the last week of class."
