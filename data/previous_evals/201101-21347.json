    "Recommended to anyone in American or Comparative. A perfect introduction to issues and problems in the study of democracy.",
    "I have highly recommended the class to other students. I think it is valuable for anyone who is interested in collective action and choice and American Politics.The format of the class is great. Also, the fact that it is condensed in the first half of the semester helps in counterbalancing some of the usual crunch towards the end."

    "The course introduced me to a literature I had thus far not been familiar with. It also pushed us to think about what makes a good research question \/ paper and to come up with new ones.",
    "The course addressed questions and theoretical approaches that are relevant in and beyond the subfield, and are thought-provoking. The course was a good forum for brainstorming ideas and engaging with the existing literature in various subfields (American, PE, Comparative)."
