   "comments": [
    "Russian is a pretty good language to start with. I didn't have any previous exposure to the language, but I was able to pick it up with a moderate amount of work. You'll have a small amount of homework every night, but even if you're not too good at languages you'll be able to pick it up, as the course moves at a pace that's not too fast and not too slow.",
    "I would recommend this course to a fellow student. It's a relatively easy course in my opinion, and despite the fact that you have homework every night, it isn't too difficult.",
    "I would definitely recommend Russian 110 to another student. It's not a stressful class but you will learn a lot and it's really fun.",
    "Not very complicated: an interoduction to the Russian language that covered verbs, cases, and, of course, the alphabet. I would absolutely recommend it -- who doesn't want to study Russian, especially when it's sowell taught?",
    "This is great class. Professor Titus is an amazing teacher and person. You wont regret taking Russian from her. The work is challenging but not oppressive. Take it. There's absolutely no reason not to!",
    "It's a very interesting language to learn, but it's a lot of work (as with any L1 course) so it's best to be interested in actually using the language abroad eventually.",
    "Russian is an awesome new language to learn. And although it is supposed to be one of the most difficult languages to learn, the class is taught in such a way that it is manageable. The textbook is very well organized and sequenced in a logical manner.",
    "Yes, if you want to learn Russian and Russian language.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. It's clear, well-organized, and reasonably graded. You will never feel jipped or unfairly tested (either too easy or too hard). Professor Titus is a GREAT teacher. She's very funny and animated, two characteristics not to be undervalued when you're looking at 9:20 am classes.",
    "Russian 110 is difficult--Russian overall is a difficult language to learn, and it requires a lot of effort in order to succeed. However, it is definitely an interesting language and worthwhile if you want a change of pace from the traditional romance languages and you know how horrible the Arabic program is at Yale. Julia Titus is very understanding of how difficult Russian is to learn--she admits her husband failed when he took the course twice."
