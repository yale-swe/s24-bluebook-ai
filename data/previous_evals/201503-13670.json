   "comments": [
    "Yes! Great interesting and engaging class! Especially for those looking to one day work in or with an IO",
    "A little boring at times, but if you WANT to learn the material and like the UN and international affairs, you'll probably like this. Can be very dry.",
    "I would recommend this to someone who is interested in IR, because if not, it would be very boring. The structure of the class is interesting in the sense that its a large seminar, so if you like a more intimate lecture setting, this is the class for you. IO was a very theoretical class, and there was much less application than I expected going into the course. Quite a reading heavy course, although it isn't necessary to do it all. Participation in lecture was part of the grade, so if you don't like talking much, it can be a small problem. For people who are good at keeping on top of readings will excel at this class. For the midterm and final, Professor Hyde provided a extensive study guide in which all the terms and essay questions on the test would come from that study guide. The study guide, however, was very long. Overall, an okay class. Not amazing, but not bad either. Would also highly recommend taking this class with Intro to IR because there is quite a lot of overlap.",
    "GLBL 256 01 provides an excellent overview into the strengths and weaknesses of International Organizations (IO's), and why governments would choose to work through IO's rather than unilaterally. This course explores concepts on state sovereignty, realist and institutionalist theory, and democracy promotion while questioning the inherent value of each. The structure of the course as taught be Professor Hyde develops critical thinking skills across various issue areas. This resulted in me questioning some assumptions I didn't even realize I'd had and has allowed me to reach a far greater understanding of focus shaping International Organizations across the globe. I would suggest this course to any student interested in global affairs.",
    "International Organizations is a great course which covers fascinating topics ranging from how the UN deals with problems to how states and IGOs and NGOs interact. The use of multiple viewpoints and theories enables the students to form their own opinions, catalyzing a better understanding of the topic. I would highly recommend this course to any student wanting to learn about the web of Global Civil Society and how its interactions shape our world.",
    "It's okay! Not the best class, unless you are SUPER interested in IOs.",
    "Brief overview of international organizations such as the UN and NATO. Take if you have little to no knowledge about them.",
    "This is an in-depth overview of all issues having to do with the international community, and how international organizations responding to international issues can affect the decisions and actions of different countries. It is very expansive in its content since there are so many international organizations to discuss, which can make it difficult to keep all of them straight throughout the course. I would recommend this class to anyone hoping to learn more about how international organizations help and hinder decision-making on an international scale.",
    "Very interesting course!",
    "Good conceptual overview of IR, this would be a good course to take freshman or sophomore year. It might not be exactly what you expect so pay attention in the first few classes to decide if you like it, it doesn't really change format from there, A heavy reading load but light assignments.",
    "I think a lot of people came into the course thinking that it would be pretty easy. It is very straightforward: readings, midterm, final, 800-1000 word op-Ed. And each exam comes with a study guide that gives you all the potential terms and essays. But be forewarned, you actually have to do the readings and study pretty hard for the exams to do well since the review guide is actually quite overwhelming. That bringing said definitely not that difficult of a course if you just keep up with it. Also definitely do use on doing the readings from the first half well because those are the ones that show up through the rest of the course.",
    "Very satisfied!",
    "Good class! Really important for people interested in global issues, and important for thinking critically about how organizations, bureaucracies, and larger institutional systems function.",
    "Don't take this class if you're looking to take a class on how particular international organizations work. This class is much more theoretical than that. That said, I thought it was a very well-run course. There are no surprises on the midterm and final exams because the professor gives you a comprehensive study guide beforehand. The op-ed assignment is tougher than you might think, though.",
    "A lot of reading and can be boring if International Organizations are not your interest.",
    "Difficult class that is graded very harsh, very theoretical with no concrete information. Don't take! Lots of reading",
    "I probably would not recommend this class to another student",
    "It is a descent overview of theory and concrete examples that will serve as a good basis for further discussion on international issues. The coursework is manageable and the lectures are enjoyable. Take it if you are interested in the material; take it if you need a fifth class.",
    "I loved this lecture. Professor Hyde is always engaging, and her lectures are very much in tune with the students-she knows which lessons are not as interesting, and she always incorporates in-class discussion to keep us thinking. I was never once bored. Even if this isn't your specialty, I would highly recommend taking International Organizations, or anything taught by Professor Hyde."
