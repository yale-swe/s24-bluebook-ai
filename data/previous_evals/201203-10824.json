    "Yeah. I would strongly recommend it, because we would learn much about atmospheric and oceanic dynamics from it.",
    "Yes, definitely. this course should be a must for anyone in G&G.",
    "Recommend after taking GFD class.It is a hard class if one does things appropriately and at the same time it is a very easy class if you skip reading papers and don't spend time to understand material (sadly this happens in most cases).",
    "- Definitely recommend if you've learnt GFD previously.- Recommend a sincere audit in your first year, and a definite recommend in your 2nd year, after taking GFD.",
    "It's a useful class to gain deeper understanding of fundamental geophysical fluid dynamics concepts. The class is six units, two weeks per unit. Each unit covers a concept, including the paper(s) (first week) and a fluid mechanics experiment (second week).It's helpful for any first or second year Atmospheres and Oceans student."

    "I learned a lot about atmospheric and oceanic dynamics from this course, and it helps me a lot on my own research.",
    "the knowledge gained from seminar is more deep, which is very helpful for research and getting ideas.",
    "- Helped me get started with reading with papers, which I believe is a weakness of mine.- Helps you realize where you stand when it comes to making scientific presentations and talks and tells you areas of improvement."
