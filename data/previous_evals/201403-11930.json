    "The course is really good! I enjoyed going to it every day. Juliana is awesome! She always showed up with an energetic spirit that created a very fun atmosphere for learning!",
    "I would recommend it if they took it with Juliana because she was the thing that made the class fun and intriguing. The material itself was a little dry and boring but the enthusiasm that Juliana had made it a little more exciting to learn about.",
    "Spanish was a lot of fun, and even though it was for the language requirements, it was one of the better classes I took this past semester. I highly suggest taking SPAN 120 with Juliana. There may be a little more work in this class than others, but that's because it meets everyday, but the daily exercises can be done in between classes and doesn't take up too much time. Longer homeworks were slightly more annoying but manageable. Standard oral, audio, and written exams that are graded pretty generously.",
    "Definitely improves Spanish skills.",
    "Spanish 120 is very well taught. My favorite class this semester. It takes some dedication, but I would highly recommend.",
    "Yes, I would highly recommend this class to another student. It is an intense language class that incorporates very interesting cultural aspects. Greatness."
