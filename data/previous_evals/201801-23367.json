    "Some of the discussion on intellectual property, ethics, and publishing was helpful.",
    "Responsible Conduct of Research",
    "Some interesting things about intellectual property, ethics, and research processes. I enjoyed discussing these topics with peers and other faculty (besides my own research group), as it showed new perspectives. Although I don't think much of my opinions changed (most people in the room agreed with me on most topics) a few definitely did. I learned how to request permission for figures from other groups' papers. (Links on their paper's web page.)",
    "Very little. We already covered this information at the beginning of the fall semester.",
    "Nothing. Ive already learned all this material from my undergraduate career.",
    "Learned about Ethics in data, research, and publication",
    "Responsible conduct of research, like data, publication, etc.",

   "comments": [
    "I felt the time could be shorter. For two of the sessions, the material could have been covered in an hour but we spent nearly 3 hours.",
    "No weakness. Maybe this course can be made into an online course with an exam.",
    "The presenters did not speak concisely. The lectures could have been accomplished in half the time if they practiced a bit beforehand, to clarify their own thoughts. Much of the time was just waiting for them to think about what to say next, or for them to repeat something they said many times before, without emphasizing a particular important aspect. Strengths: the topics presented were the most important (general, not field-specific) aspects of research ethics and research practices.",
    "This course was terrible. Lectures were long and rambling without any indication of how long they would last. Lecturers would slog through the slides, reading every bit of text word for word and then proceeding to mumble the same information again in their own, but less succinct words. All of the information provided in the three lectures could have been condensed down to a single 45 minute lecture, rather than 5 hours.",
    "While I know this course is needed to comply with government grants, but I felt like this class was too long. The first lecture was better since we had discussion groups. The other two was 2.5 lectures that could have been taught in 30 minutes. They should incorporate more discussion groups. Since the class is going to be taught again, I think it would be a better use of time to have to class held all at once on a Saturday, if possible.",
    "They were such long courses that doing more engaging activities would have been helpful",
    "Very useful contents.",
    "Weaknesses: lectures too long, often quite boring",
    "Make it more structured.",
    "gives significant information",
    "I think it is a good course to let us know the basic information to start an academic life.",
    "Sessions are too long and uninformative. Hong Tang's session was better than the other two.",
    "Interactive components are good.",
    "It taught responsible conduct of research",
    "One of the sessions was very long and engagement dropped the last hour.",
    "It offers us many basic rules for doing research. The only weakness is that some part of it took more than 3 hours."

    "It's required, but if it weren't, I would not recommend it. Rather than improve my understanding of research ethics, I learned that ethics is boring and painful. It was almost as if the lecturers secretly wanted to dissuade us from following ethical guidelines by making the class so miserable.",
