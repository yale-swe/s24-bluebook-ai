   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend it to someone looking to improve their fluency or review their spanish (I had taken AP spanish but not since junior year, and this was an excellent fit for me). We didn't learn that much new grammar, and we learned less vocabulary than I expected, but it's excellent for improving your speech.",
    "This class is decent. At times it can be stressful because so much of your grade is based on participation and everyone is trying to participate. Their also is a wide range of ability levels, so it can be difficult at times to carry on a cohesive group conversation. The workload is manageable, but gets heavier when you start reading the novel towards the end of class.",
    "This is an interesting class with minimal work, but your Spanish will not improve that much.",
    "See paper evaluation",
    "You have a course packet that you follow pretty faithfully. You go through units like immigration and the detective story for example. Each unit has different readings. If you do them, it makes class discussion a lot more enjoyable. You get more confident with speaking as the semester goes on, but besides that, your Spanish probably won't improve too much.If you don't feel comfortable going into a more advanced Spanish class right off the bat, I would recommend this class to bring up your confidence. Otherwise, go for one of the more engaging L5 courses.",
    "Conversational Spanish is a fun and easy class. However you can't really improve your conversation skills that much in this setting, because at this stage getting better is about talking as much and as often as possible which doesn't happen in a three times a week seminar. Take it if you want an easy class or need to fulfill the language requirement.",
    "Advanced Conversational Spanish is the best way for students who are close to achieving fluency in the Spanish language. It teaches one the skills to communicate more freely and openly, and more importantly, it gives one the confidence, through practice, to speak better.",
    "A rather lackluster discussion-based class in which you do lots of readings and then have dry discussions. I would recommend it only if you're looking to finish the language requirement having come in with AP credit and don't care that much about improving your Spanish that much and getting intellectually excited about Spanish.",
    "It's good to get the requirement out of the way.The class helped me with Spanish, I guess. My conversational spanish did improve some.The class was kind of a hassle though.",
    "This is a great class if you really want to get your speaking skills up and running. You will definitely leave this class feeling more comfortable communicating in Spanish than before. Despite the name, this is a conversation class alone, not a grammar class."
