   "comments": [
    "An overall good course. Jacobs-Wager is an AMAZING professor, and her lectures will really stimulate your interest in the material. We were all sad to see her go after midterm. Wertz is fine--he's funny and is good at explaining the material, but he talks a bit slowly. The material integrates some current examples (e.g. ebola) at the end, which is a nice capstone.",
    "Microbiology is exactly what it sounds like--it's about microbiology and its history, applications, and greater implications for our world. You learn a lot about bacterial biology and how they interact with us and the environment, as well as how we as humans have learned to work or fight with microbes over time.",
    "Great and interesting class. I think it is important that every MCDB student takes this class because bacteria are ridiculously interesting and very different from our own cells. Be warned, however, as there are only two midterms and a final, meaning that your grade can really fluctuate a lot until the very end.",
    "DO NOT TAKE if John Wertz is co-teaching this class. He was the worst (e.g. using abbreviations on slides and not knowing what they stood for, calling microbes \"bugs,\" writing exam questions that basically relied on us memorizing trivia). Jacobs-Wagner was pretty good -- she was a clear lecturer, at least -- and I feel like the material could be interesting and substantial, but with Wertz teaching the second half it was just terrible.",
    "the material learned in this course is really interesting, even for a Poli Sci major like me with no intention of pursuing a career in research. Jacobs-Wagner is an engaging instructor whose passion and energy inspires you to like the course content a lot. Wertz was better at recounting the history of microbiology and teaching us about the larger importance of microbiology in the world",
    "Expect to be introduced to a lot of new and interesting material. Professor Jacobs-Wagner does an amazing job at teaching the material. Both her and Professor Wertz are also greatly accessible for questions and clarification. Expect to put a lot of time into preparing for exams (again, lots of new material!)",
    "In comparison to other MCDB classes, this one is definitely more laid-back. There is no homework or discussion section, but this makes the weighting of the two midterms and finals very high. Overall the material is very interesting and understandable, and the professors are great. I would highly recommend this class.",
    "It's a lot harder than what I expected from reading last year's reviews. This is not a gut class and although it may seem like you can skip class because the power points are provided, that is definitely something you should not do.. The topics covered were extremely interesting and applicable, especially towards the end. They were also very very detailed at times, and I'm pretty sure I'll never need to know some of the things I learned\/they'll never relate to any other subjects, but they are interesting topics! PS. It's in the farthest place possible: 12th floor KBT.",
    "The topics covered in this course were interesting for the most part. The workload consists of three exams (two midterms and the final). While there is no other work, this may put some pressure on you, and there's quite a bit of memorization involved for the exams. Professor Jacobs-Wagner and Professor Wertz were both pretty good lecturers.",
    "It is definitely not easy. I struggled greatly. Also, most people in the course are MCDB majors or Premed, so the curve isn't that favorable :(",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone who is remotely interested in microbes - or maybe even if you're not, because this course might make you interested. It's well-taught and not a lot of work at all - no homework, just two midterms and a final exam. It probably would be helpful to have a basic background in molecular biology.",
    "An intensive review of microbial biology that delves into everything from genetics to metabolism to infection. A great class, especially if you're more interested in bacteria and their vast effects on the environment than eukaryotes.",
    "One of my favorite classes at Yale and definitely one of my favorite science classes! The first half is more cell biology of microbes and the second half is more applications and the role of microbes in disease. The material is great, the tests are fair, and Prof Jacobs-Wagner is fantastic. Prof Wertz is very nice but it was his first year teaching it and he seemed much less interested.",
    "Really great course--take if Prof Jacobs-Wagner is teaching!",
    "General, broad intro to microbio. It's a good class, though not exactly thrilling. It's just two midterms and a final, so not lots of work, and the material is not very complex. A nice elective",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to students with sufficient biology background.",
    "A wonderful course - really fascinating material (microbes are so cool!), and both of the professors are great. The TFs are also a really good resource - even though we didn't have an official section, they held very helpful review sessions and clearly put a lot of effort into helping students, so take advantage of them.",
    "Yes. 4\/5 stars. Especially for those working with bacteria or another microorganism in lab. Recommend in combination With MB&B biochem 2",
    "It's a class that does a good job mixing science-things with fun facts. if you don't mind memorizing a lot of facts, i'ts a lot of fun. All of the grades are from exams, so its not that work-heavy either.",
    "The material for this course is very interesting. If you are interested in biology then I would definitely recommend this course as bacterial evolution and adaptation offer an insight into biological processes. Moreover, these mechanisms often go unmentioned in other courses so it is nice to have a way to explore this material. However, it is a typical pre-med course so there is a lot of emphasis on memory.",
    "Yes! This course is a really great MCDB credit. There are two very different teaching styles, each encompassing one midterm. The final was pretty consistent. The first half of the course by Professor Jacobs-Wagner is taught really well and you come away feeling good about understanding complex systems. The second half taught by Professor Wertz may be dry at times, but the lectures on infectious diseases were SO interesting! I loved learning about botulism, tetanus, anthrax, HIV, Ebola, TB, and so many more! The downside is you have to memorize the full latin names for the various bacteria causing the specific diseases.",
    "The class throughout the year is pretty relaxed as there are no psets or regular assignments; your grade is based off 2 midterms and a final. That being said, it is important to go to lecture and stay on top of what the professor emphasized because the slides dont help on their own. There is a lot of material but you should be keen to know what to focus on and this can cut down studying.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. Really interesting material, especially as the semester progressed, that was presented in an accessible manner. I didn't realize until the end just how much I had learned and actually retained. The exams took some preparing for, but were fair if you had kept up with the course. Take the class, you won't regret it.",
    "No daily work, attend lectures and go to the review sessions before the midterms and final. Very easy and straightforward if you're taking this after cell biology or biochemistry. Wokld recommend taking the lab concurrently since the courses progress roughly in parallel. Lab is pretty chill as well",
    "The material is fascinating, and the first half of the course was very well taught (Jacobs-Wagner). This semester I think there was a new teacher for the second half, and he wasn't as good of a lecturer. Although the material he presented was interesting, I often found myself falling asleep or simply skipping lecture, because a nap was more useful. Happy I took the course, though, because I learned a lot."
