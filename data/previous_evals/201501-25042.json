   "comments": [
    "This is a superb course. The reading of texts from different fields yields insights on how we do and should make choices (which has many more implications than it may at first seem to). This discussion is then linked back to political science in the very interesting fourth unit on collective choice.",
    "Overall, it's a pretty good class! Though it initially felt a bit disjointed, the class's topic steadily cohered and began to make sense together as the class went on. The readings were pretty interesting, and I liked the lectures overall.",
    "The readings are interesting and Landemore is nice, but she grades pretty harshly. Also, lectures can get boring at times, but overall I think you come out with a better understanding of choice theory.",
    "I wont recommend this course to someone who wants a free ride experiencing college, but to someone who is really motivated to learn something new and is willing to put in several hours of extensive reading.",
    "I would recommend it.",
    "This might have been one of the courses in which I learned the most in Yale. The readings are very interesting and Prof. Landemore is like no other. I would certainly recommend it, although evaluation is challenging."
