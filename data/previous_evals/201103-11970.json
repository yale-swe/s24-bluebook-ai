   "comments": [
    "Sometimes I wanted to cry because this class made me feel so inadequate as a student. If you don't have experience in both linguistics and neuroscience research techniques in particular, this class can be really difficult. But if you do, then this class is really rewarding. You do learn a lot not only about prosody and meaning, but about how to evaluate research.",
    "It will take a while to get used to Prof. Pinango's teaching style. She's very passionate about her research but at times can be somewhat scatterbrained and unclear. You will do A LOT of literature reading and may find that you draw out less knowledge than you had hoped for; this, however, is in large part due to the current state of the field, as there remains so much left to discover and understand. Take this class ONLY if you have a true interest in neurolinguistics; it will have its ups and downs at times, but ultimately (hopefully) it will feel rewarding.",
    "Shop Pinango and see if you like her style of teaching. I loved it. But some could consider it too scattered for their taste.",
    "Great if you have a background, but I think this would be horrible if you're not used to Prof. Pinango's conception of brain and language. It's really interesting, seminar is really cool, and you learn a lot. But it also doesn't accomplish nearly as much as you would expect and I think we got mired down in figuring out small things (often because people weren't used to her terminology and frameworks). If this is your thing, definitely take it, but be ready for a lot of frustration.",
    "Interesting course, but you have to be sort of a self-starter because you'll have to kind of figure a lot of things out on your own.",
    "I would strongly recommend LING 201 to any student with an interest in brain\/language relations and neurolinguistic research. The course load is challenging and the reading dense, but the work is well balanced with only one seminar a week. The 2hr discussions often flew by in what seemed like 20 mins. I would recommend an introductory linguistics course before enrolling in LING 201, as a working knowledge of prosody, syntax, and semantics would have been valuable tools in exploring the ideas and research presented in class. Prof. Pinango is an excellent teacher and is available outside of class for one on one discussions that are vital to an individual understanding of the theories discussed in seminar. I would suggest this class without hesitation, as it gave me the confidence and interest to declare as a Linguistics major.",
    "I would say only take this course if you are fascinated by the material and willing to spend hours poring over research papers, and grappling with very confusing questions about how language is organized in the brain and how this question can even be approached. Class can be very frustrating sometimes--know what you are getting into when you decide to take a class with Professor Pinango. She is brilliant, but she has a very abrasive style and does not always provide the class with much direction. I usually really enjoy her teaching style, but I definitely see how it could be upsetting. I do wish she would actually lead the class more. ITs great to hear from my fellow students and class discussion is always fascinating, but Professor Pinango is the one who really knows her stuff. Its ok that the class goes off track and we tend to meander into discussions that last the whole class period, and we never get through the intended material, I don't mind that, but I think the course needed a little more sense of direction like neurolinguistics had last semester. I also wished professor Pinango had returned more of the papers she assigned and provided a little more feedback. We wrote seven total (I think) and I only ever got two back. That made it a little hard to know if I was making progress."
