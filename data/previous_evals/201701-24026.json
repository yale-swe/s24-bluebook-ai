    "I enjoyed both the lectures and the discussions about discrete articles. I really appreciated that the readings were short and to the point. I read everything assigned for this class because the amount of material assigned for each class was so reasonable. When faculty over-assign reading, it becomes impossible to do all of it when things get busy, and the result is that I will often do none of it for lack of any basis upon which to pick and choose. For this class, the readings were so well chosen, interesting, and reasonable in length that it was a pleasure to do all of them.",
