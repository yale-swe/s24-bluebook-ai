   "comments": [
    "I wouldn't take this class unless you have to. It's simply not worth the class time, and it's really frustrating when you're not learning that much.",
    "Take it to continue learning Arabic, you definitely won't learn if you don't take it. Be proactive.",
    "Although an overall solid course for advanced Arabic students, the workload for this class can be very overwhelming. On any given week, expect to give at least 10 hours, especially if your colloquial Arabic is weaker than your Modern Standard. You have to juggle a variety of mediums, including written texts, news programs, essays and in class conversations. You'll learn and grow in the process, but this is not like other L5 langauge classes: it's really the necessary extension of L3-4, building understanding and communication skills instead of delving into a particular subject matter in depth, as most other language courses do. All in all, the best Arabic course I've taken at Yale.",
    "Take it if you want to continue with Modern Standard. The biweekly videos cover interesting material. Basically consists of reading\/video with comprehension questions, learning 50 vocab words\/week, a 5 minute weekly news presentation, and bi-weekly short essays. But the teaching and methods are variable and the course only glances at grammar. Good, but room for improvement.",
    "L5 is a series ofwriting and discussion based around Arabic news videos. It is time intensive and evolves a greater development of writing skills then speaking skills.",
    "Arabic 150 01 is the only L5 MSA course available. If you want to keep up your fusHa, take it, but you likely won't get very far beyond your present language ability... Plus, the multimedia materials are usually very dry (good practice for a state department job, I guess!)",
    "I would not at all recommend Arabic 150 to future students. Unless you have a lot of time to spend memorizing vocabulary words that you will encounter once the whole semester, and want to struggle with a disruptive, rotating professor system... don't take Arabic 150. I would rather study Arabic on my own. In reality, I am sad at the fact that I would not recommend Arabic 150 to another student. For I love the language, and find it fun to learn and use, but not through this Yale L5 language course.You will only learn how to memorize quickly and present news articles in Arabic.",
    "This class uses only primary Arabic sources and moves along very quickly. If you're comfortable with the language, this class is for you. If you're not, you will struggle greatly and spend a disproportionate amount of time on this class.",
    "This course is challenging because the the texts and videos are hard to understand, although class is not very demanding. I liked the subject matter-current events and issues in Arab culture. It's not as intense as L1-L4, but still a challenge. You definitely get ample opportunity to improve your writing, listening, and speaking.",
    "I can't tell you how Arabic will be next year. I only hope it's better, because save for the show in which we watched an old Syrian man get raving mad at his laidback counterpart that asserted that the Arabic language was (or was going) extinct, it was like a black hole that sucked away happiness like it would suck away random spaceships in a sci-fi movie but, also like in a sci-fi movie, but a bad one, the black hole suddenly blinked out of existence, releasing my happiness, just when it was most propitious, releasing my happiness back to me.It's really quite sad that the class discourages those who have genuine interest in pursuing mastery in the language from continuing in their quest. Check it out. The syllabus, especially, and hope you get Sarab.",
    "Other than the enormous and completely excessive amount of homework that did little to teach me Arabic or further my language abilities; the uninteresting subject matter assigned; the vocabulary that often did not seem particularly useful; the vocabulary lists that seemed to have been spellchecked only once and were in fact according to my native speaker friends not consistently reliable; the grammar that we barely learned even though (if you were really interested in learning fus7a well) there was a lot we should have at least reviewed, the lack of discussion time in class meaning that I could never practice my fus7a; the lack of dialect help or correction meaning that I could never practice the very little dialect I knew (which we all know is practically more important than fus7a anyway although there are a billion of them); the almost complete absence of reading material meaning that my reading skills in MSA deteriorated even as my listening skills improved only microscopically; and the fact that my Arabic actually got worse than it was before, this course was fine. In the face of everything, Sarab and Aziz were great!",
    "Not really. You don't really learn much. We memorized a bunch of vocab and had quizzes on them. Boring material. Unnecessarily long and tedious take-home exams. Not a pleasant experience.",
    "Before you get used to the level\/type of work (i.e. in the first few weeks of the semester), this class feels like an INSANE amount of work. However, it starts to get more reasonable once you get used to the kind of assignments. (Because you're getting better at Arabic!)This class really seems to be more media-focused (as opposed to obscure grammar and literature-focused) than it was in the past, and I think that's a really good thing. It's basically all using authentic materials. The talk shows seem kind of long at first (and sometimes the topics are BIZARRE--like, schools of Sunni jurisprudence? Seriously?), but they're not too bad. MAKE SURE YOU ACTUALLY LISTEN TO THE SHOW INSTEAD OF JUST READING THE TEXT. Not only is that what you're supposed to do, it makes figuring out what the hell they're talking about SO much easier.Overall, if you want to improve your Arabic, I would recommend that you take this class. If you've done well in other Yale Arabic classes, don't worry about it too much--it's not a huge increase in the amount of work--it's just that the work is harder. Keep in mind, though, that because of the way the course is set up, you will only get as much out of it as you put into it. I cared a lot about keeping up my Arabic, so I put a lot of time into it, and I feel like it turned out well. If you aren't actually willing to put the time into studying the vocab and not half-assing the assignments, you will probably not get any better at speaking Arabic, and you will also probably want to kill yourself. Seriously. This class is only worth it if you care.",
    "After 2 years through the first 4 levels of the Yale Arabic program, this is a breath of fresh air. Gone are the miscellaneous children's stories, and there are slightly more interesting readings. Any grammar is basically a review from the previous year. This is much better than the lower Arabic levels.",
    "This course is a lot of work in big spurts. Some days you'll have nothing, others will be a ton of work and this system can be very frustrating. I did not find that it helped me further my arabic that much, but it is also the kind of course where the more you put in the more you get out.",
    "Strengths - used contemporary material based on the spoken word, and used transcripts to accompany video\/audio instead of text by itself. Weaknesses - poor communication and co-ordination (everything is run through Shady). Overambitious and unrealistic work expectations make it hard to really engage in the material or even complete it all. Still, better than L4 in spring of 2010.",
    "Harbor no illusions. This is a lot of work, and hard work at that if you take it seriously. Think about how badly you want to learn Arabic, If a lot, then take it, because you will learn a lot. But it is about asmuch work as 2 of my other classes.",
    "Great improvement. Take it if you're willing to work steadily. Not terribly hard, and hardly perfect, but worthwhile."
