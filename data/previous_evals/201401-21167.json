    "I felt like I was thrown into an ocean and occasionally nudged with a long pole towards shore. A very gentle, very subtle nudge. Throw me a life buoy, please?",
    "Take it. This is the payoff for making it through the Plato and Aristotle show: a parade of interesting philosophers with ideas ranging from very reasonable to totally out there. No, not every one has much influence on current thought, and not every one is totally comprehensible, but they're worth it.",
    "Directed Studies: Philosophy is definitely an intense course. The works in the second semester get increasingly more difficult to comprehend, but working through them both in and out of class, especially with friends, really pushed my mind to grow and taught me to analyze philosophical texts to an extent I never could have imagined a year ago. All in all, it is a lot of effort, but I definitely think it was worth it.",
    "Of the DS sections I took, this was easily the most challenging, mainly because the texts got much much harder. Leibniz, Kant, and Hegel are utter nightmares. On the plus side, many of the texts are very interesting and a steep departure from what was read the previous semester. Prepare to be challenged, but it's worth it.",
    "Absolutely. I loved DS, all of it, especially philosophy. This was one of my favorite classes of the entire year. The reading was influential, eye-opening, and absurd, in some scenarios. I would love to take this course again, or have it continue. Definitely recommend it.",
    "Second-semester DS philosophy has thinkers (Kant, Hegel) that are much more challenging than first semester's philosophers. But, the philosophy department does a great job of encouraging growth in students' philosophy skills, so these challenges were always rewarding rather than overwhelming. Lectures were, generally speaking, extremely helpful. Professor Watson is a kind and understanding professor, and she did a lot to create a warm, vibrant classroom environment, and to allow for discussions to be student-led. Unlike the typical DS philosophy section, almost half the classes were dedicated to pairs or group work. After a while, I didn't really like this--I felt it was cutting into the time we could be using to discuss the big problems as a class. Also, I wished we had engaged more in the philosophical practice of defending the philosopher from objections, rather than just raising objections and moving on. The other philosophy classes that I sat in on (once or twice, when our professor was out--this is what typically happens when DS professors are sick or have conferences), tended to engage more with the meaty philosophical problems, whereas our class tended to bring up many ideas and then kind of gloss over them. But overall, class was fun and usually elucidating, and paper feedback was very helpful and encouraging!"
