   "comments": [
    "Math 301 is a fun class if you have the right expectations for lecture. I.e. go to lecture to supplement things you learn in the book. Some outside reading will be useful. Also, go to the review sessions before all midterms and the final!",
    "The only reason you should take this class is if you want to take Math 305. The material is manageable, but Professor Jones makes it unnecessarily complex in both his lectures and on tests.",
    "If you have taken 230\/231 (especially with Asaf Hadari), not much of the actual material covered in 301 is new, which may be disappointing to you. That being said, I really appreciated going over the material with more rigor than was required in 230\/231. I feel a lot more confident in my epsilon-delta arguments having now been more careful with the analysis.You may or may not like Professor Jones. Initially, I was frustrated with his digressions and peculiarities (I had hoped for something more grounded and straightforward), but eventually I just decided to take him at face value. I'm really glad I did--I ended up appreciating him a lot more. He really carries an awesome wealth of knowledge about math and science and history, and it actually became a lot of fun to hear him tell stories and digress about the topics we were studying. He is quite good at analysis, too: I really began to appreciate the problems he presented and the ways in which he approached them. I would even think about asking him to be my advisor at this point.",
    "It's a solid class for a potential math major.",
    "I despised Math 301 for the first half of the semester. Peter Jones is an odd lecturer--he is often unclear and distracted, and spends a lot of time telling unrelated stories (although these can sometimes be pretty entertaining). The material was 90% review of Math 230\/231, with a very small amount of additional rigor (but definitely not enough to justify an entire additional class). Also, Peter Jones' exams are quite strange.I only stopped hating this class once I completely gave up on the possibility of learning anything, and just sat back and listened to Professor Jones say crazy things throughout lecture. He is a very nice man, and very enthusiastic about this class, even he is bad at lecturing and designing tests.",
    "If you have taken 230, you will see familiar concepts in analysis presented in a different style. The class was fun and Professor Jones was great, although his lecture style is very different from Hadari and could be off-putting at first. Make sure to go to office hours and the review sessions before exams - Professor Jones is very helpful and gives great advice!",
    "So Prof. Jones is a nice guy, but his lectures verge on being impenetrable. The material shouldn't be too complicated, but his tangents--while sometimes amusing--often make it very confusing. Also, for a class that is supposed to teach how to write rigorous proofs, Jones' in-class proofs don't always set a good example. His exams can be quite ugly and tricky, but the review sessions he holds before each exam usually show how to get through most of the test. Homework is fairly light, but some problems can be tricky, and Beals is not a very good book. In all,the class is not great, but sort of necessary for anyone who wants to take more advanced math classes (take Cr\/D if you can, I guess).",
    "301 reiterates some of the material from 230-231, but adds enough to be worth taking (also never hurts to go over it from a different perspective). It took a little bit to get used to Peter Jones' teaching, but once I did I really enjoyed the class.",
    "Jones just talks about nothing at length. When he gets around to a proof, he'll be halfway through it before telling you what he's proving. Nine times out of ten, he will state facts without proof for the entire class. I wish someone else taught such fundamental material."
