    "Highly recommend for any MCDB or MB&B senior.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to other students in MCDB and MB&B. This high-level course discusses some very novel methods in the field, as well as some of the older discoveries that defined the field. Being able to learn from Prof. Breaker, who is at the top of ribozyme and riboswitch research makes this seminar a very unique experience for undergraduate and graduate students alike. Take it!",
    "This is a laid back reading course on a range of topics in RNA biology, including long non-coding RNAs, riboswitches, and ribozymes."

   "comments": [
    "It didn't contribute to my research in particular, but it is fascinating to hear about current RNA biology and RNA technology, and I think it's essential for any biology major to be up to speed on this topic.",
    "This course truly deepened the knowledge of the field, which is one that I do not engage with regularly in my field (cell biology). However, I have always been fascinated by nucleic acids and genetics and being able to discuss both of these research areas at a high level will definitely benefit me in any research path, as these discussions have certainly re-framed some of my thought processes."
