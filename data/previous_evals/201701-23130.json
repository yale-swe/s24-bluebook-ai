    "I learned a lot about social reform movements and the various interactions between different people\/groups in the US. the course was structured so that we learned about what a high-level seminar should be and how to succeed in such a class.",
    "Writing history papers. This class helped my understanding of how to do so incredibly.",
    "I learned more about historical writing and analysis from this class than I have from any other class at Yale. Prof. Ben did an excellent job of connecting us with Yale Library resources, as well as dedicating class time to teaching us about how to structure and execute an effective historical essay."

    "one other thing that would have been helpful would be a 5-minute stretch break in the middle of class a 2 hour seminar can feel super long.",
    "Excellent syllabus that flowed nicely. I felt challenged and engaged by the readings, but not too overwhelmed. I would have liked to have had a clearer description of the first writing assignment and perhaps a little more structured guidance in writing the final paper."

    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. The readings are fascinating and Professor Zdencanovic does a great job of leading seminars.",
    "An excellent seminar for anyone interested in US social history. Definitely take it if you get in."
