   "comments": [
    "Writing about music is a cool class because you get to read about popular music and culture for homework (we even watched a Talking Heads video once). Unfortunately, the class was really male dominant, and the professor definitely favored the aggressive guys. Overall, material is great, but watch out for an aggressive classroom dynamic.",
    "This class is SO interesting and so fun! No matter how serious you are about writing about music, it is a great way to improve your writing skills AND these skills will translate to other facets of your writing. The work is entirely manageable and it's a great alternative to English 120 for people with a specific interest in music.",
    "Lots of introduction to new music, at least for me! It's eye-opening! And if you already know the music, then you get to see what a writer may say about the music. It's absolutely great!",
    "Writing About Music is probably one of my top 3 Yale courses and I recommend it in a heartbeat. I'm a CS major who loves thinking about music, and this is one of the few courses at Yale where you get to discuss pop music from cultural and analytical perspectives, which is amazing because pop is so so relevant and intersects so closely with race relations, feminism, and all sorts of other amazing topics that we got to discuss through a music lens. You will probably get the most out of this course if you have a general knowledge of pop music of the last 30-40 years since that's what you spend the most time on, but you have a lot of freedom in the assignments to write about whatever interests you (I wrote about Video Game Music, Mumford & Sons, and Mahler to give an idea). The papers and readings are very manageable and Prof Sexton gives such great feedback (he's a writing tutor) that you will want to spend a lot of time polishing these papers. The focus of the course is mainly on thinking about and evoking music and you will guaranteed improv in these areas by the end of the course. Workshopping is well structured and actually gives useful feedback. Our class also bonded pretty hardcore because it was a bunch of music lovers thrown into a room talking about amazing readings and giving our own thoughts twice a week. I don't have enough amazing things to say about this course: perfect class (and writing credit!) for a fan of music.",
    "I definitely would recommend it because it changed the way I think of why people like the music that they do and helped me write more. Especially if you're interested in music journalism, take this class.",
    "Take Writing About Music with Adam Sexton! It's an awesome way to get to know new music as well as gain a different perspective on the music or artists you may already know. The great thing about this course is how accessible it is -- we had some students with significant technical training and others (like me) with much, much less, and we were all still able to learn a lot from the readings, the professor, and each other. You will probably find that the reading and writing for this course feels a lot less like work than the stuff you're used to doing, especially if you're someone who comes from more of a science background.",
    "Amazing. If you can get in- take it. You will learn so much about music and how to really talk about it.",
    "I would describe this course as both a workshop for writing craft, and a discussion section for popular music and popular music culture. The weekly writing exercise Professor Sexton had his students complete (in which he asks his students to \"evoke\" a song played in class) is incredibly helpful in building our skills in writing about music, but more importantly helps build skills in writing about culture. Moreover, the discussion element of the classroom continues to foster an ability to critically and thoroughly dissect, analyze, and discuss popular culture. That said, I would highly recommend this class to another student, as it widens one's toolkit in how to talk and write about the culture that surrounds them. In addition, Professor Sexton is an incredible professor who can balance a lighthearted atmosphere with rigorous class discussion, and it makes the class simply fun to be in. It will make whoever takes it a better writer, without a doubt."
