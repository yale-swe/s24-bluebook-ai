    "This class is very informative and interesting. There is a lot of reading. The reading is very important to the discussion, so the weakness is that there is so much reading. However, the strength of the class is also the value and extensiveness of the reading.",
    "Awesome course. Best I've taken at YSPH. Shelly really cares about the students and it shows. She has stripped her own ego from its delivery and created an incredibly open, honest yet intellectual environment.Weakness: Too much reading which compromised my ability to do work for other courses. Sometimes I wish our discussions were a bit more structured.Strength: I really learned a lot about the topic because I was forced to do so much reading. Shelly is awesome in so many ways. Having us over to her house at the end was really marvelous. She is a wonderful facilitator, mentor, teacher, professor. Bravo!",
    "This was a really great course for people who are interested in health disparities. Too much work for people who are not.",
    "This is one of the best courses I've taken at Yale, or anywhere. I learned so much, and genuinely enjoyed coming to class. I have just a few points about what might be improved to make this class even better.There is a TON of reading, and although it's really interesting, I think some of it could be eliminated.Each week students are assigned to lead discussion, but as discussion moves forward, it rarely comes back to the students who have spent time preparing to lead it. Either bring the discussion back to these students or don't make them prepare to lead discussion.Having some speakers would be great - even if they're outside of class time and optional.",
    "Great course. Lots of work, but interesting material.",
    "Strengths: engaging, interesting, and worthwhile! definitely the best class I have taken while at Yale. Class discussions were great, and the small class size allowed students to get to know the professor and others in the class. You walk out of the class with a comprehensive and deep understanding of health disparities.Weaknesses: the workload, while worthwhile, was huge. This compromised my ability to do work for other classes. Having discussion leaders wasn't always useful.",
    "FABULOUS class! I wish I had taken this class earlier, it would have definitely shaped my coursework differently."

She was always available to meet with students and more-than-willing to mentor them. She was always organized and well-prepared for class.",
