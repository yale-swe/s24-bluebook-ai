   "comments": [
    "You get cheat sheets when you take midterms!",
    "To put it simply, ENAS 151 is MATH 120 minus the theory\/proofs and plus the application.",
    "Do not take this class unless you've already taken multi-variable calculus. This class is not designed for first time learners and you should not take it unless you are absolutely serious about an engineering major. I literally studied for the final for a week and still completely failed. The material is just hard to understand and the teaching or in the professor's words \"facilitation of the learning process\" was poorly done.",
    "Benefits of ENAS 151 over MATH 120: -cover more material -get to bring equation sheet into tests Drawbacks of 151 over 120: -you spend less time on each topic -longer psets -more textbook learning",
    "I did not talk to people in math 120 much, but this seems to be the better option. The weekly study halls were a good environment to work on and learn the material. The grading also seems to be better in my opinion. If it is not required for a prereq, I would not take because I think there are better QRs you could take.",
    "Would recommend! Sohrab cares so much about his students and you'll learn a lot!",
    "If you have to take Math 120 or ENAS 151, you should take ENAS 151 because it will be a more rewarding, easier to digest, and more practical course.",
    "Multivariable calculus is difficult and time-consuming no matter how you take it, but if you have to or want to take it, take the ENAS version. Sohrab might lecture at a faster pace than might be comfortable for some people, but he truly wants you to learn and do well in his class. The study halls are great, and there are always review sessions before each test. Plus, you get to make your own cheat sheets for every assessment (with the number of cheat sheets increasing with the amount of material covered), so actual learning and not memorizing are the major goal.",
    "Take it if you can't get into the Math 120 section with the actual professor and you're looking for a more applications-based multivariable calculus class. If you take it with Sohrab though, it'll definitely be a lot harder, especially if you didn't take multivariable already in high school, but he intentionally makes it easier for you by dropping psets, giving you 10% for completing all the online prelectures, and weighting exams more if you do better on them. The psets aren't long but sometimes the problems are very challenging, so it's also very beneficial to have a study group.",
    "I would not recommend this class to another student.",
    "Definitely take it over 120. Don't be scared by any rumors about workload or anything- just read the book, put in the time and you'll be golden.",
    "ENAS 151 is a great class for someone who wants to gain an in-depth understanding of the subject. Sohrab is an excellent professor who will provide all the resources you need to succeed. Be prepared for a heavy workload though, which will challenge you significantly more than any high school math class.",
    "ENAS 151 teaches many aspects of multivariable calculus and how to apply them to certain problems. The instruction focuses on real world applications. I would recommend this class to another student.",
    "This was a very good multivariable calc class. I liked how it was directed towards engineering. Sohrab really does a good job teaching the material. I feel that the only students who do not understand are the ones who do not fully subscribe to his methods of teaching. instead of teaching boring proofs of the formulas, he teaches real-world applications. Also the cheat sheets make it so students can work on learning the math and not memorizing formulas.",
    "This class seemed to have more proofs than Math 120 (which is the actual reason you are reading this review). The applications were briefly mentioned in class, but were never tested. Take this class if you want a lecture + study hall, take Math 120 if you want smaller classes but no super helpful study hall.",
    "I recommend this course to people who are good problem solvers.",
    "If you want to do engineering, do it. You may realize, like I did, that engineering is not for you through this class. If you do not want to do engineering, dear God do not take it."
