   "comments": [
    "strengths - important biostats concepts learntweaknesses - very theoretical",
    "The course covers important chapters of data analysis.",
    "Not sure why this course is only a half term, as it is such an important course. I felt that many topics were not given the time and attention they deserved, simply because there was not enough time. This course could really use a SAS lab, as well. In practice, most of us will be using SAS and not doing calculations by hand, but I felt there was not much guidance or training about how to do things in SAS.",
    "Sometimes it was hard to follow, especially when theory-heavy material was introduced. It was difficult at times to use a textbook by the instructor b\/c it only offered a singular way of explaining a concept. It could have been helpful to see more approaches to a problem. Book\/ class material did not always prepare the student for the hw.",
    "The course covered a lot of material. I would have appreciated if the homework assignments had been more even, instead of only covering the first few lectures (and generally being assigned several weeks after going over the material in lecture).",
    "Too much theory, lecture needs more application",
    "It's very very useful for data analysis, it's better if it can be tought for a whole semester instead of half, for we need more time to reading outside the classroom.",
    "excellent course. I knew nothing about modelling disease before I took this course. This course lead me into the world of modelling disease and analysing epidemic data.",
    "excellent",
    "Strengths: This course provided practical skills in analyzing and interpreting epidemiological data.Weaknesses: We did not have the chance to get to the \"design\" part of the course and instead focused more on the analytic aspect. The content of the course could have been spread out to one semester.",
    "I which I had done linear regression before taking this class!",
    "The course provides a great introduction to basic statistical methods for epidemiology. The book is well written with plenty of examples and is easy to follow (quite a rare thing for a statistics book)!",
    "To improve the course have more homework and a take-home final instead of an in-class exam so that we have more opportunity to learn by doing.",
    "Good course with good instruction. Definitely would benefit with a good grasp of regression techniques.",
    "I found this course to be useful, however I feel that there was a little too much theory involved. It was hard to follow the theory teachings, and they weren't as practical as some of the other aspects of the course.",
    "I enjoyed the course and thought it was really useful and interesting. I enjoy Dr. Holford (I took his GIS class). The assignments and textbook were useful in learning the material. The final was tough, but fair. This course could have definitely been a full semester."

    "Instructor: Theodore Holford \u00a0As noted above, sometimes it was hard to get an explanation that offered different perspective since instructor wrote the textbook. Outside material could have been helpful.",
    "Instructor: Theodore Holford \u00a0Dr. Holford was an adequate lecturer. The slides were well-organized, though the lectures could be a bit dry at times. The homework assignments were generally quite reasonable.",
    "Instructor: Theodore Holford \u00a0Holford is a solid professor",
    "Instructor: Theodore Holford \u00a0He is a very good teacher, and the examples he gave us is helpful and easy to understand, and he is good at SAS and can explain many difficult questions.",
    "Instructor: Theodore Holford \u00a0a very nice and knowledgeable instructor",
    "Instructor: Theodore Holford \u00a0He's a great professor",
    "Instructor: Theodore Holford \u00a0Dr. Holford's lecture are often times abstract, and I had some trouble understanding the statistical equations. However, he is always willing to hold office hours and answer questions through email.",
    "Instructor: Theodore Holford \u00a0Excellent. He is an expert in the field",
    "Instructor: Theodore Holford \u00a0Professor Holford is extremely knowledgeable in the subject that he is teaching. Even more so, I approached him from time to time with questions outside of the scope of his class (and sometimes quite unrelated) and he was always willing to take the time to help and answer my questions.I also found him extremely approachable and would definitely take him again if given the opportunity.",
    "Instructor: Theodore Holford \u00a0Dr. Holford wrote the book. He is very knowledgable of the course topic and teaches with his book so the homework is consistent with the classwork. There are times where he gets very theoretical which makes it difficult for non mathematicians to follow."

    "Not much emphasis on design of studies, but you will learn how to analyze epi studies. I would recommend the course for students who want this skill.",
    "Somewhat hard to follow at times but good overall conceptual material.",
    "Take it if you have to - it's biostats.",
    "Useful, but much on the theory of the forumlations",
    "This course is very useful and helpful for students who major in public health and useful to data analysis. I would recommend it to my friends.",
    "the best course I took at Yale. I definitely will recommend to my friends.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student if you want to gain practical experience in analyzing and interpreting epidemiological data. The course focused on epidemiological principles, and I learned very, very useful information about statistical tests and epi-related information. I definitely got more out of this course than Epidemiology I (introduction course).",
    "This course provides a great introduction. The book alone is worth taking the course over as it is extremely helpful and will definitely be used as a reference for a long time.I would highly recommend this course for students looking to get the concepts at an introductory level.",
    "It helps to tie together concepts from other courses and I would recommend it.",
    "Overall a good class with good instruction. Be prepared to master the symbols that Holford uses in his book and class. It will help you understand better."
