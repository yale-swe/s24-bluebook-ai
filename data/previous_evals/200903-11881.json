    "Do it.",
    "If you are in teacher prep or interested in becoming a teacher, take the course.",
    "If you are in anyway interested in education policy or development of the child, you should take this class. The readings are interesting and Burt leads discussion better than anyone else.",
    "This covered was a good survery course for those interested in educational issues that educators have to consider, especially those with a psychological underpinning. Good fifth class.",
    "Education Psych is a good class. It's enjoyable but not very demanding. If you have an interest in education or psychology, it's a good class to take but otherwise probably not (which is good since about the only wayto get in the class is to be in the Teacher Prep program or a senior psych major). The class is fairly self-directed. There are weekly readings, but you can survive the class without doing them. They are, however, very interesting and worth reading if you find the material worthwhile.Professor Saxon is a wonderfully happy and jolly man and he makes the class a joy, though sometimes it is tough to discern what he is trying to accomplish in his lesson.",

    "Chill, fun, very interesting! Great class!",
    "DO NOT take this course unless they change the prof.",
