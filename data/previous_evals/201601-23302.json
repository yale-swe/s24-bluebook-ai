    "The projects. The course included 5 major group projects, with the option to complete the projects individually. The projects were large and challenging, with one project at each of five major levels of management. Having to plunge in to work out what one would to in a real-world management project at the Operations Implementation, Operations Planning and Oversight, Tactical, Strategic and Policy level was invaluable. Discussing the problems with others, pooling background knowledge and looking for answers together (including seeking instructor support) was a productive and skill-building way to practice management. The opportunity to use the Toggle program to plan for the best combination of sustainabilities in forestry work, relative to chosen values, was excellent. Overall the course was a great overview to resources management. Professor Oliver has worked in the field for a long time and is himself a wealth of knowledge and experience."

    "The initial project, at the Operations level, was a very large one. It could perhaps be divided into two submissions, to allow a smoother start to the semester. In-class discussion of each of the levels of management presented could include more depth and breadth. I say this somewhat tentatively though, because other material presented is also valuable, and I am hard-pressed to say what should be sacrifices."

The five major projects were well designed to be challenging, yet do-able. I am a more knowledgeable person now, with some management skills in development and a great overview of both the big picture of managing forests and many of the details of a variety of levels of management."

We had the option to work in pairs, groups or alone, and these were able to shift from project to project as needed, so I think one found one's advantage or disadvantage and adjusted accordingly. I found working with others to be a positive experience to determine how to approach a project, to pool knowledge and to learn together. Some of this learning came in working on a project and some came in sharing the projects in class."

Professor Oliver has a wealth of knowledge and experience, and he works well with work groups and individual students, supporting at every turn as requested. The projects are challenging, very satisfying to complete. The course gives a solid overview of the scope of managing resources, with a focus on forestry. Be prepared to start the projects as soon as you can and to put in significant time on them. Strongly consider working in pairs or small groups."
