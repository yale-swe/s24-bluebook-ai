   "comments": [
    "I now have a deeper understanding of how different cultures and societies have reacted to changes in climate. I also was able to practice writing large volumes of good material, which is something I was looking to practice in preparation for my senior thesis.",
    "I learned a great deal about the relationship between various cultures and the climate. The class exposed me to aspects of climate change that have been largely overlooked in my other environmental studies classes like the social dimensions of climate change. The thesis of the class can be summarized as the idea that climate change is not an unprecedented issue-- we can look back at history to consider how humans have interact with a changing environment.",
    "I understood the political nature of environmental debates and denial, which was previously not highlighted to me.",
    "This is an excellent introductory course into the anthropology of climate change. I gained insights into the history of thinking about the relationships between climate and society, the influence of those historical discourses on modern climate discourse, the creation of climate knowledge, the varying relationship between climate change and politics... I would recommend this course to anyone who is interested in thinking about the inter-relationships between climate change and the functioning of social and political systems.",
    "I gained a much deeper understanding of how human societies have interpreted the weather from ancient times until now, and how we can add greater nuance to traditional understandings of weather and climate. The final paper also gave me the chance to refine my own research and writing ability.",
    "I learned a great deal about the intersection between anthropology and the environment."

   "comments": [
    "This course could be greatly improved with more discussion. While the lecture was interesting and insightful, I felt that I learned the most and was more engaged when students had more time to share their thoughts. It also seemed that people always wanted to have more time to talk based on the fact that we almost always went over class time once it turned to discussion for the last 10-20 minutes of the session. I also would have appreciated feedback on our commentary essays earlier in the course. Since the assignment was always the same, just for different readings, it would have been beneficial to carry the professor's comments into the writing of the next essay. This semester, I did not receive grades of feedback on any essays until I had submitted all three. I feel this inhibited me learning and ability to improve on these assignments.",
    "I loved the readings, I wish I had had enough time to read them all as throughly as they deserved. Each was unique and provided a different perspective which Professor Dove was able to relate to that week's theme. I would suggest that the class time be restructured a little bit, to allow for more class discussion time.",
    "Strengths: The readings for the course are excellent. Almost every one of them is worth you time because they take on perspectives and questions that you have probably never considered before. The reading load is heavy-- so it may be best to do a close reading of whatever is most interesting to do. Professor Dove sometimes gave very creative and surprising lectures, and gave lots of feedback if requested. I am not sure if the 30 page research paper was a strength or weakness... it was a HUGE challenge, the largest project I have undertaken at Yale so far. Weaknesses: There is no assessment on the readings if you are not leading discussion, so there is little to no incentive to do the reading at all. Often, this makes class discussion difficult when few people have done the readings. Lecture was sometimes very interesting... but other times very dry and difficult to stay focused for nearly two hours. Often the discussion was relegated to the last 10 minutes of class which was not enough time to have a meaningful discussion. The class would be better structured if perhaps 45 minutes was reserved for class discussion, and this would also encourage students to do more of the readings.",
    "Strengths are how insightful Prof Dove's comments was, the weakness was that there was little of anything else to learn.",
    "This course would be enhanced by having at least an hour long discussion section in addition to the lecture. There was so much interesting content in this course but very little opportunity to actually discuss it.",
    "Weaknesses- far too many readings assigned, meant that most students did not do readings unless they were assigned to write a reading response about it Also not nearly enough structure or incremental deadlines for the thirty page paper, leading all of us to be very overwhelmed at the end",
    "The course could be improved by having more discussion during class sessions. This would help keep students interested and engaged instead of zoning out for a lot of the seminar session. The class does have many strengths, which include the fantastic readings that are assigned, making me think differently about what I thought I knew every week, and the style of the assignments, which push you but do so for a reason and benefit.",
    "The course readings were fascinating. However, the professor mostly talked the entire time, not leaving much room for student discussion."

   "comments": [
    "Yes! Professor Dove is very knowledgeable and invested in each student and their final paper. Would highly recommend to anyone who would like a little practice in writing a longer paper or thesis style assignment.",
    "Yes, do not be afraid of 30 pg paper! Do not expect much discussion from the class, but Professor Dove is a super engaging lecturer and very helpful in working on the paper if you go see him.",
    "Yes. It is an important class for environmental studies (or other students) interested in climate change because it takes a novel approach. It is interdisciplinary and adds dimensions to the scientific lens of studying climate. You must be ready to write a thirty page research paper. START EARLY. This will take more time than you anticipate because researching enough to develop a thesis that can last you the whole paper is difficult. But the workload through the semester is manageable, so you should start early.",
    "No, unless you really direct your own learning and make it productive using the research paper at the end.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to other students as it will help them to think more clearly about what climate change is and might mean for our social and political systems. It will help students to develop a critical way of thinking about climate change discourse.",
    "Interesting content but be prepared for The Paper. You will grow to love Michael Dove though!",
    "I would recommend this class to another student. It probably is not for you if you are taking it on a whim and do not have any background in environmental studies because of the intensity of the final paper. But, I think this class is a must for anyone who is thinking of going into a field related to climate science or the environment, since it challenges a lot of previously held assumptions in a constructive and informative manner. Professor Dove is a great resource and getting to know him is another benefit of this class.",
    "I would recommend this if they are willing to write a 25-30 page paper!"
