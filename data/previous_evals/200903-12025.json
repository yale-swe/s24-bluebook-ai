    "This is an excellent class if you can get in. The workload is not extreme, but you are expected to produce quality work in revision. No other intro class at Yale gives you the experience of writing creative short fiction like English 140, and it is a shame that only one session is offered per term. You learn the ropes of writing fiction very quickly - the roughest of drafts can result in really excellent stories by the end of the year.",
    "Sure",
    "Yes! Great class - albeit some people's stories were simply horrible.",
    "I really loved this course. When time came for my stories to be workshopped it was stressful, intimidating, and just pretty much miserable. That being said, that only happens three times and the rest of the time it's great. You do fun exercises and read fun stories and talk about other people's stories. Class was never boring and it was a great change of pace from a lot of other classes. I would definitely recommend this if you can get it.",
    "We wrote original short stories, workshopped them, and read some intriguing professional stories as well. I loved it, and would totally recommend it to anyone who likes to write. Also Professor Woodard is outstanding.",
    "THIS IS an AMAZING COURSE. I took it hoping to get a writing credit and found out on the first day that it doesn't even carry a distribution but I figured the fact that I got in was perhaps a good sign, so I stayed and I don't regret it. I found my style of write, I wrote a story that is longer that any paper I've written ever in life --- my choice. Make sure you take it if you get especially if its Dean Woodard!",
    "I would absolutely recommend it. It is the best class I've ever taken. Ever. I adored it.",
    "In a word: fantastic.",
    "writing seminar. don't need to be a proficient english student, it's a nice intro course",
    "For the course you are required to write two stories. For one of the stories you write three drafts and for the other two. Throughout the course you are required to write exercises weekly. These exercises help you explore different writing styles. At the end you submit everything in a final portfolio. It is a great class!",
    "I think that English 140 01 was a surprisingly strong class. Throughout the course \u0096 but especially towards the middle and end \u0096 I could really feel my abilities as a writer and a storyteller starting to grow. I think that I became a more confident and competent writer, and a more flexible and knowledgeable storyteller. I think that, in many ways, I also gained a deeper understanding of who I am as a person through the process of writing and thinking about my own short stories, which is something that I really appreciated, though I didn\u0092t anticipate growing from the course in this particular way. I enjoyed most of the stories Prof. Woodard asked us to read, and I thought that, on the whole, the workload was rigorous, but fair. Finally, I\u0092m not entirely sure what Prof. Woodard did in order to get my classmates and me to grow in the ways that we did, but I know that she definitely did something. If I had to guess though, I would say that her greatest strength as a Professor is knowing when to push and when to just let her students be themselves \u0096 giving her students space to figure out who they are and what they\u0092re trying to say, but also making sure that their ideas come together and work as living, breathing stories.",
    "Absolutely take this class! I loved it! One of the best classes that I have taken at Yale, and Professor Woodard is one of the most dedicated and supportive professors that I have found.",
    "Take this course! English 140 is an excellent introductory fiction writing course. Whatever your previous experience or abilities, English 140 will push you to become a much stronger writer."
