    "Yes",
    "It's a fantastic class. It's too bad John only teaches it once every three years or so - I would definitely recommend. Great books, great films, great discussion.",
    "Great class on an important topic.",
    "Definitely, if you are interested in French history particularly during Vichy. It is definitely a very focused topic, so get ready to delve very deeply into about 4 years of history. There isn't a huge amount of guidance for the paper, but it actually worked out really well. I would recommend it highly.",
    "Good course on various aspects of France under Vichy. Lots of reading, but Professor Merriman is reasonable, and the final paper is no big deal if you get started early, which Prof. M encourages you to do. Take the course if you have a real interest in the subject, because it can get monotonous. Also, be wary if it seems like your classmates aren't going to be engaging.",
    "YES. Easily one of the best history courses I have taken at Yale. Such a fascinating and important period. It's one of the great privileges of being at Yale to be able to take seminars with such eminent scholars in their field as Prof. Merriman. The syllabus is a good balance of the iconic texts of Vichy history and films that strongly contribute to the course. It also gives a very strong sense for the (contentious) historiography of the period, and how history books can strongly affect national consciousness and memory. It's only offered once every three years, so absolutely take it when you can!",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student; the subject is interesting and very relevant to understanding French History and how french society has been shaped. And Professor Merriman is a gem, take any of his classes and you won't regret it!",
    "The course focuses on resistance and collaboration, giving examples from all over France and looking at several cities as case studies. The breadth of reading is significant, ranging from the background of anti-Semitism in France leading up to and during WWII to the policies of Vichy during the war itself. Expect to read on average a book a week, but there are also some weeks where the workload is much lighter.",
    "Reading-intensive course on a very short period in French history. Definitely recommended.",
    "Chill seminar. You just have to read and come prepared to discuss for the entire semester. The only written work is a long term paper at the end (though this is still a big task!).",
    "I thought History 231J was a great seminar. It was fun and interesting. I learned much more about the Vichy Regime than I ever knew before. I also would definitely recommend this course to any other History major. It has a lot of reading, but only one long paper and one presentation."
