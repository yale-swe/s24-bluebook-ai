    "Take this class if you're interested in what promises to be a traditionally awesome G&G fieldtrip or if you want to apply a lot of the concepts you've already learned in geology. You really should have a good understanding of the fundamentals to get the most out of this course, however, as it moves through topics really quickly, and discussion often focuses on the unanswered questions in the study areas. That's why it's 1\/2-grad 1\/2-undergrad!",
    "Great way to finish up your years in the G&G major. Lots of fun friends, good geology! The trip will be INCREDIBLE, so make sure to join on if you can!",
    "A fantastic, interesting, and engaging class that focuses on particular regional geology. The class includes a field trip to the region of focus.",
    "Regional Perspectives is a must for any G&G major who likes going outside. Sitting through the semester class enables you to take the 2-3 week summer departmental field trip, in exotic locations around the world. The topic of this year was Great Britain. Overall, I liked the class, especially in its lecture-discussion-quiz\/presentation format. Dave Evans gives great lectures and is super knowledgeable in the field. It's also good to have the opportunity to present topics and papers yourself. The quizzes were fair, and taught you to pick out what's important in a paper. While student presentations in the second half of the semester were interesting, I learned less when the class lost structure. But there's very little work all semester, and a huge reward!",
    "Take it!! Great class with a trip during the summer",
    "A cool seminar on the geology of a specific region (in our case, Great Britain) using a lot of different topics within geology. Also includes a field trip to the region during the summer. Definitely take it if you're a major!"
