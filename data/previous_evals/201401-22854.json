   "comments": [
    "I would not recommendthe class to graduate students, for the reasons mentioned above. The graduate students, all of whom have significant work experience, are used to give the undergraduates a good experience in the classroom.",
    "The course is an overview of great strategic thinkers, such as Machiavelli, Clausewitz, and Sun Tzu. Professors teach it in rotation, so a different subject expert leads the discussion every class. Comments by students from the military, government, business, and other fields add variety and great stories to illustrate points from the texts.Take this class if you want to make connections with powerful students and professors, or if there's a summer experience that you want to write about and need funding for.",
    "I'd recommend this class if you are interested in historical military strategies. the given summary of the class is inappropriately broad (\"the calculated relationship of means to large ends\")--the class actually has a somewhat narrow focus on historical military strategy.",
    "Before you decide to take GS make sure you are taking it for the right reason. As most professors at Yale are very liberal, this is a cool opportunity to learn about a point of view that you might not be exposed to. Nevertheless most people taking the class were very unhappy with it. Don't just take it because it is selective, you will be miserable. Also don't just take it because of the grant money, there are plenty of other fellowships at yale, and this is a full year commitment so it is not worth that. I felt like because many of the students were not taking the course because they actually wanted to learn about the texts or GS in general, most people did not do the readings and thus the seminars suffered.",
    "Absolutely - an essential part of a great liberal arts education.",
    "The very unfortunate thing is that other students will not ever see this, or any other review of this class - because the professors have brilliantly managed to hide them by making it a grad class, which undergrads can't view reviews for. But, anyway, if you see this and you're interested in taking GS - don't take it for the classroom experience. It sucks, and I feel like I literally haven't learned anything that I couldn't have read off Wikipedia. That said, the summer funding and free food are cool, and may be worth selling out \/ putting up with a miserable class for.",
    "I would because you walk away from this course with an immense knowledge about how to think strategically. Rather than being bogged down in fruitless details, this course allows one to to look at the bigger picture and the appropriate trends and historical patterns that allowed thinkers and statesman of the past to be successful. Thus, the past informs the future and allows future leaders to learn from the successes and failures of the ancients to better apply their theories and practices to the complexities of the modern day.",
    "This course is overall very good, but there is no incentive to do the readings when the professors just talk at us. Also, there is not metric that we have for how the papers will be graded. It seems to be that if the professor agrees, you get an A; if they don't agree or they don't like the question, you get marked down. I don't understand how a paper can simultaneously be an A and a B paper.Kind of interesting sometimes, a lot neocon\/con hogwash other times.",
    "The benefits of taking this course are obvious.",
    "Terrific course. Fantastic syllabus. A brilliant galaxy of professors.",
    "Yes, for the entire experience. I think the least strong component of GS is the humanities seminar precisely because the 'combined' sessions at the end are kind of directionless, but the rest is exciting",
    "Great resources and professors. The theory behind GS is actually very interesting and intellectually stimulating. The seminar sessions were the best; I don't think there should be any lecture classes at all.",
    "I would recommend History 985 to a fellow student. The class covers a broad range of material and is quite interesting. Sometimes the discussions were a little one-sided, but overall it was quite an interesting class.",
    "Would definitely recommend! One of the best courses I ever did."

   "comments": [
    "I was able to read some of the classics of strategy (and know what they are!) and I have not done this before. This was helpful to me, and something I take away with gratitude from the course.",
    "I feel like I know more about principles of grand strategy, which has given me a new perspective in my leadership positions on campus. I have a better grasp on the significance of concepts like friction, uncertainty, the element of time, etc.",
    "I took this class because I wanted to learn about non-military strategic approaches to global problems, but I did not get very far toward achieving this learning goal as the focus of the class centered on individuals and nation-states as actors in zero-sum settings.",
    "It did not deepen my knowledge of anything. I felt like everything I learned could have been copied from a Wikipedia page.",
    "Notat all. It's essentially an irrelevant, frivolous class.",
    "tremendously. in all sorts of ways.",
    "Ventures into another discipline. Not related to research, but somehow related to the rest",
    "As an EPE major, it helped me think about strategic elements more.",
    "I feel that I got a stronger understanding of how to use historical events and philosophies to analyze current events and questions as a result of this class."
