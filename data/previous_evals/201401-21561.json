   "comments": [
    "Boring class that focuses on niche issues and manages to fall into a grey area between sociology, political science, and history. Do not take it; take something in one of those actual disciplines.",
    "It looks at various insurgent movements across the country and world and discusses the challenges they face and tries to employ models that describe and guide them. I would recommend it, it is not a ton of work and I think I have learned some interesting stuff.",
    "Its a ton of work, lots of readings etc. but you can get a lot out of it if you really care about the movements discussed in class. You learn a lot of really cool, in-depth things about particular social movements that you might have just glazed over in previous classes. For a course that covers a lot of material, I think it does a surprisingly good job of making you feel like you really know a lot about a movement and aren't just skimming through.",
    "The course is an overview of tactics and strategies of collective action, a fairly straightforward array of empirical examples and the theoretical underpinnings of activism. Pretty boring unless studying abstruse readings about activism piques your interest.",
    "I recommend it as a writing credit. However, the lecture was overwhelmingly dry at times. I know Professor Wood cares about the subject, but I wish it could be more engaging.",
    "It's a pretty straightforward intro class. Take it if you're interested in social science as a way to understand the world.",
    "No strong feelings either way. I would do it if they have any interest in social activism and how it works, but if not, don't bother. It doesn't really spark any interest.",
    "I would recommend this course because it is an interesting lecture with a fair workload and a great professor.",
    "I would hesitate on recommending this class to another student. Unless you really, really love the subject matter and want to explore it in a class, hold off on this one. The structure of class and the lectures, along with the unnecessary curves on the midterms make this class a bit frustrating. I do recommend the Writing Track if you really want to get something out of the class but that will also be influenced by the quality of your TA.",
    "Pretty easy, straightforward class. You'll learn about specific case studies and more theoretical concepts about free-riding, economics, the tragedy of the commons, and models for social action. Tests are fair, I'd probs take non-writing option if possible; you only have to write two short 1\/2 hr long essays on the test, a few extra reading responses, and a short final essay.",
    "This course was effective in explaining why movements occur and why other elements are relevant in movements. Only take this if you're interested in the material.",
    "A quite good class. It's very theoretical, but professor Wood does a good job of illustrating with concrete examples. It's not hard, but it's not a gut either--the material is thought-provoking and it's easy to engage with it on a deeper-than-surface level. Professor Wood is a very good lecturer, the readings are (mostly) interesting. The only complaint is that I took the non-WR section and the frequent reading responses were just really annoying; I would rather have done one longer paper than 5 short ones. You should take this course if: -You are interested in the fundamental mechanics of social movements -You can take exams quickly (the exam isn't hard but is sometimes longer than you're given time for)"
