   "comments": [
    "The first half of the class was great, but the second half featured PSET problems which were long, boring and esoteric. They should switch back to using textbook problems or spend more time coming up with problems people can get themselves to care about. Borrow the textbook (Arora-Barak), and don't take it if Chapters 7, 8 and 17 feel pointless to you.",
    "Complexity is such a rare topic to be taught at any university, and a class like this made accessible to undergrads is a true gem. I would definitely recommend this class to anyone who wants to explore the limits of 365 in greater depth.",
    "The course was great at the beginning of the semester. Truth be told, I was still excited about it up until the spring break. Afterwards the psets turned into paper-hunts and I saw no point of them. I have gone from loving this class to hating it."
