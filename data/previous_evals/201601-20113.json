    "Instructor: Graedon Hileman Zorzi \u00a0I really liked Graedon as a teaching fellow, but felt that he could occasionally be a better facilitator for the reading material rather than necessarily projecting his own interpretation upon it",
    "Instructor: Graedon Hileman Zorzi \u00a0Did a good job of leading discussion sections. There were times when he would take over a bit, speaking at length about his own interpretation, but this was not a frequent occurrence. He can be hypercritical. This is not inherently bad, but there were times where it didn't seem like there was anything on the other side of his criticism. His criticism could take the form of disagreement for the sake of disagreement, without any constructive lesson at the end of it. Once again, this was not a constant occurrence, but happened enough to be noticeable, and was not particularly helpful when preparing my presentation for class. But, he was very helpful in writing my paper.",
    "Instructor: Graedon Hileman Zorzi \u00a0I found Graedon to be a good teaching fellow who was very comfortable challenging us and pushing back on our assumptions.",
    "Instructor: Graedon Hileman Zorzi \u00a0He was good. Sometimes he talked a little too fast and it was hard to catch everything he was saying. However, his email response time was not very good. But when he was available to meet he was helpful.",
    "Instructor: Graedon Hileman Zorzi \u00a0He was great at synthesizing all of the readings and highlighting probing questions.",
    "Instructor: Graedon Hileman Zorzi \u00a0Graedon's responses to students during the sections often seemed confrontational in tone.",
    "Instructor: Graedon Hileman Zorzi \u00a0I felt like Graedon's knowledge wasn't always conducive to this course. When we were talking about American politics (Nathan Hatch,Alexis de Tocqueville, etc.) he really showed his stuff but unfortunately that was not the majority of the time. Additionally, Graedon could do a bit more planning for section. It often seemed like he did not know what he wanted to talk about and just kept asking students what their forum posts were on. I feel like his attitude and his response to students comments\/questions could be improved. Specifically his continued response of \"can you expand on that\" or \"what do you mean by that\" after each comment or question.",
    "Instructor: Graedon Hileman Zorzi \u00a0Me experience my TF was great. He always encouraged different opinions during sessions and also guided us to explore the texts in right directions.",
    "Instructor: Graedon Hileman Zorzi \u00a0He was good to help students find themselves comfortable in discussing in the sessions.",
    "Instructor: Graedon Hileman Zorzi \u00a0Excellent. Led great discussions. Always available to chat."
