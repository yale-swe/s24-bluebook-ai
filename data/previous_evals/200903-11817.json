   "comments": [
    "This class is an upper level psychology class where you are expected to read several studies and come prepared to discuss them. The class is great if you're interested in child development or infant cognition. If those topics don't excite you, then reconsider taking a class where you spend two hours talking about them. Karen Wynn is a great professor and one of the top researchers in the field, so it's wonderful to learn from her. Grades are determined by either completing 10 weekly papers (around 500 words) or 5 weekly papers and a research proposal. I completed my senior essay in this seminar, and Karen was a great adviser who gave constructive feedback and responded quickly.",
    "Great senior seminar - Dr. Wynn is very open to student suggestions for seminar topics, such that discussions are always pertinent to student interests. Workload is manageable if you write the weekly paper consistently (and well!).",
    "take it but know that you will probably not talk about infants as much as you think",
    "If you are interested in developmental psych and enjoy reading articles about infant and comparative cognition studies, you will enjoy it. Sometimes, grad students take over discussion, but you definitely get a chance to say what you want to say.",
    "Great psych seminar. The position papers can get a little taxing after a while, but you get the hang of it. I would encourage you to do the reading. This class really taught me how to read psych papers and think critically about them.",
    "Yes, I would recommend the course",
    "I would recommend it to another student if you're interested in developmental psychology and studies in infant development and psychology.",
    "An interesting discussion of a variety of topics related to development. I would recommend this course to another student, because it provides a lot of interesting course material.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to another student. Seriously, what's not to love about babies? More to the point, very low workload (you have the option of writing a 500 word reading response each week or writing 5 reading responses and a final paper) but a ton of interesting material.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to seniors and juniors interested in exploring and discussing recent research in infant psychology. It goes into far greater depth in the topic selected for the semester (which varies from year to year) than Developmental Psychology, and all readings are empirical articles."
