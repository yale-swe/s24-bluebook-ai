   "comments": [
    "This course is a strange and amorphous creature, since it depends entirely on the ingenuity and inclinations of the student that chooses to take it. Its simultaneous strength and weakness is, of course, that it's almost entirely self-directed. It's uncommon for professors to set their students assignments of any sort (other than the ones required - prospectus, short draft, full rough draft, final copy), so the meetings with your advisor center on what you're able to dredge out of the material you're working with. This is a course that demands a great deal of self-discipline; I did the greatest part of writing over Spring Break, and I know many students who didn't work far ahead enough and found the final few weeks extremely unpleasant as a result. Above all, you have to genuinely love what you're writing about, and genuinely believe that it will continue to generate meanings for you no matter how much you write about it. If you do, and you can steel yourself to write over fifty pages of material, then I would recommend the senior essay wholeheartedly.",
    "Writing my essay was a wonderful experience, and I am glad I chose to do it; the experience of writing a long paper on your own is rather different than writing it for a class, and I think every English major should try it.What faults there were were largely my own: I did notthink enough about my topic before choosing it, I did not set clear and early deadlines to give myself more time to work through the paper in multiple drafts, and I had unrealistic expectations about the scope of my paper (covering an artist's career takes a book).Some of the highlights were of my own making, some were due to my adviser: research is just a wonderful thing, and I think it's great to work on topics that allow you to look at old magazines, artwork, photographs, records, whatever--there is, if I can say this, a certain sterility to the major otherwise, and whole new worlds open in the books you are reading when you can connect them to other texts, histories, etc. etc. etc. Writing gets easier as you go: that's an important moral, and one which suggests I ought to have started writing before I did.",
    "I absolutely recommend doing a senior essay. Putting in the original research is incredibly valuable, and it's an amazing feeling to hold in your hands a piece of writing that is all your own and the product of a full semester's work. One thing I'd recommend is to make sure your advisor is totally invested in the project; my advisor was hard to reach via e-mail and on one occasion missed our meeting entirely.Still, an independent senior essay is a great choice, and if you're willing to put in the work, it might be one of your most valuable experiences here.",
    "Only if you are very passionate about what you want to do.",
    "YES! If there is a professor who you like...do your SENIOR ESSAY with them!",
    "Yes, absolutely! And if you do a little bit from the beginning it can be a pretty painless experience.",
    "Good if you know what you want to do. Depends on advisor - choose wisely."
