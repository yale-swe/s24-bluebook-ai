   "comments": [
    "Yes, I would strongly recommend this course. It is always interesting, relevant as both a \"current\" and \"historical\" study, discussion section is enjoyable, and the assigned readings are compelling.There is a major time requirement associated with the course, since lectures must be attended, but this is the only drawback.",
    "This is an interesting and fun course. It provides a lot of useful historical background that will set you up for a better understanding of US foreign policy today.",
    "Overview of the ideas, institutions, and events that have shaped the United States since its founding. Highly recommended.",
    "This class advertises itself as introductory course on the history, themes, and enduring debates of American foreign policy. It delivers on all counts. I would absolutely recommend it to somebody interested in those topics or looking for a better understanding of American national security policy.",
    "I would only recommend this course to another student if they had never taken an American Foreign Policy course in their undergraduate career. This course gives a very basic understanding of American Foreign Policy, and considering the short tenure of a Master's degree program I would not suggest a fellow student taking this course. Yale has so many fantastic course offerings for International Relations Master's students that taking this course would deprive them from experiencing other Yale faculty who are clearly experts in their fields. In addition, I would not recommend any student taking a course with Professor Gottlieb, in his course on American Foreign Policy or otherwise, as he was by far the most disappointing professor I have encountered in my academic career."
