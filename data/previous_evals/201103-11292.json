    "The professor tailored lectures to both his expertise and the interest of the students in the class.",
    "Professor Khalil is a rare teacher at Yale. He really invests in his students and works to encourage their strengths. He is also very open to feedback about the course and actively seeks input into how the course can be improved. These attributes make the course a very worthwhile endeavor.Professor Khalil has an extensive understanding of both science and management and experience in both academia and industry. He uses these abilities to engage students in a wide breadth of subject areas. I enjoyed the fact that he encouraged us to engage him in topics we were studying in other classes. This helped me to synthesize and integrate what I am learning at FES.",
    "The professor. He is easily one of the most caring and invested professors. He is a great resource if you know what you want to know. It was a pleasure going to class e en on Fridays.",

She has a background in environmental health and environmental epi. I feel that was a valuable member of the classroom.",
    "She was kind and responsive.",
    "Both were available. I never went to office hours, but that was because both the instructor and TA were available before and after class to meet with me and the other students. We also communicated through email and the instructor was prompt in responding. The instructor seemed invested in our projects."
