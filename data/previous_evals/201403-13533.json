   "comments": [
    "I would certainly recommend it.",
    "As M. Cattaneo is not a regular Yale faculty member but a practicioner at the Worldbank, this course will probably not be offered in this form anymore (or at least not in the next couple of semesters).",
    "Great class! Lots of interesting and diverse topics. Articles are very interesting and having different student present on a topic each week keeps interest levels high and makes for stimulating discussions. It's pretty light in terms of work load but you need to be good at public speaking!",
    "Yes definitely, really interesting and manageable course work. Best look elsewhere for in depth theory, though.",
    "The readings are helpful. Not sure whether it is necessary to take the course though.",
    "Solid introduction to the issues of global trade.",
    "I would recommend the class, if the class size was smaller, as originally intended.",
    "I would recommend this class to a student who is interested in the international trade field, or anyone interested in working for international organizations focusing on trade and development. All major topics are covered including global value chains, environmental protection, FDI, and organizational bodies such as the WTO.",
    "Yes, I would recommend the course because it gives a broad overview of some of the most important development-related topics in international political economy from a practical perspective. However, I would also suggest to my friend to enhance the reading list through his own research on more critical voices.",
    "I think this is a great class for broad learning about current trade and development issues."

   "comments": [
    "It gave me an overview of many relevant topics and helped me find a few areas I am particularly in. It also informed my understanding of the role business\/the private sector has to play in development work.",
    "This course strengthened my interest in the fields of international trade. Especially the development perspective I haven't been accustomed with before was a major take-away from this class. I even consider doing a summer internship in this field.",
    "I didn't know anything about global trade policy and now I feel pretty well-informed.",
    "Yes! For sure! I came in with very limited trade knowledge, and felt that Prof. Cattaneo had some very interesting insights about the discipline.",
    "This has definitely deepened my knowledge, considering I only had taken theoretical classes in the past, and now I am aware of practical matters and current obstacles in the field. Particularly the topics on global value chains were very interesting, and I would like to work with such subjects in the future.",
    "It allowed me to explore quite a few topics that I have been interested in learning more about, while suiting my professional and research interests very well."
