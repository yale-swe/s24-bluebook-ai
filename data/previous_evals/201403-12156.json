    "Interesting material, but not an easy class.",
    "I would not recommend it because it is a really tough class for intro level",
    "A fascinating course surveying various methods to approach the study of the mind. Lectures were engaging, and Brian Scholl does quite a good job of stressing real world applications to the points he addresses. TFs were very helpful and accessible, whether via email or office hours. Very fair workload - a midterm, paper, and final, along with reading questions due in advance of each lecture. The readings are interesting, even though it's not absolutely critical that you do them all on time. Highly recommended! (assuming Scholl is teaching it - I know he's taking a sabbatical next year).",
    "This class is great for anyone who wants to learn how humans work! The lectures are sometimes long, but Professor Scholl makes everyone laugh, and his expectations for his students are reasonable. This course doesn't have a lot of work, just reading responses for each class, one 7-8 page essay, and a midterm and a final. You should go to the lectures because there is no textbook, but people who haven't gone to lecture have also done fairly well in the class. It's a good class! Take it!",
    "Yeah i enjoyed the class",
    "If a student is interested in the Cognitive Science fields, whether it is perception, attention, visual awareness or language, I would definitely recommend it! I am a prospective psychology major, so the field was very intriguing to me. However, I probably would not recommend the course to those who just want to \"check it out\" because it is a serious time commitment and the material is quite challenging to do well in.",
    "Approach it with caution. I probably would think twice about taking this class. He deceives you into thinking it'll be the most amazing experience the first couple of weeks, and then you come to realize that you often walk out of class not really sure what you've learned that day. He also has a tendency to make really scripted jokes that are borderline racist and sexist, which makes the class kind of an unpleasant experience. If you're looking for a good intro psych class, take Intro Psych with Marvin Chun, instead. That being said, I did come out of the class having learned an interesting perspective on the field of psychology, so it wasn't a total waste, it just wasn't the greatest experience.",
    "Fun, very interesting subject matter, would recommend!",
    "Would recommend.",
    "Do this class, especially if Scholl is teaching it. It's like psych, but with more interesting topics (granted I took psych in HS).",
    "This class is amazing if you want to learn more about how people, especially you yourself, think and act. It gives a great perspective on cognition and behavior that you can apply in your everyday life. However, it covers a wide range of topics instead of going too in depth into any of them (there's no textbook) so I wouldn't necessarily take it if you're more interested in psych. Grading is comprised of three parts - two exams (midterm and non-cumulative final), a final \"thought paper\", and nightly pass\/fail reading questions based on scientific papers. The exams are straightforward, and the reading questions are simple (typically 45-60 minutes to read and do the questions per class twice a week). The readings aren't covered in detail on the exams so it's not necessary to read extremely in depth. The paper is fine but requires careful thought and reasoning, so don't leave it until the last minute.",
    "This class basically tells you all about how the mind works. Although it will seem like you aren't learning anything because nothing you learn is concrete and in the end you learn hat it tells you nothing about the mind. Do not take if you don't plan on doing CogSci. And if you MUST take it take it Credit\/ D. Don't be drawn in by the professors charm you will regret it later.",
    "It is a good introductory class that may change the way you see people's actions and the mind. It is helpful no matter what your primary field of study is.",
    "I wouldn't recommend this class during fall of your freshman year. You really have to be able to survive on your own in this class or you won't do well. I generally wouldn't recommend to anyone unless it was for their major.",
    "Absolutely, BUT ONLY IF you are a Cognitive Science major. If not, take into to psych with Professor Bloom. It's practically the same material and you will not 1. fall asleep in every lecture and 2. be put under the misery of having to look at the most arrogant and self-centered person in the entire world.",
    "CGSC 110 is a good overview of the field of cognitive science, especially if you want to learn how the mind works from all different fields. If you come into the class truly interested in the mind and cognitive science, the reward will be enormous. However, if you are unsure about cognitive science or hate social sciences, the course may be annoying. There is a lot of content that may not be necessarily be presented in the most concise and organized way. If you are especially wondering if you want to major in cognitive science, taking this class will help you make this decision. Professor Scholl is entertaining, slightly cocky, but very knowledgeable and always eager to help.",
    "Not for everyone - I had a lot of friends who dropped the class - but if you are interested in the topics, it is a very well done class. It's hard at times, but the concepts and the idea behind the field is so intriguing that you really want to stick with it even if you don't like some things.",
    "It's a good first semester freshman year class. No section.",
    "CGSC 110 is a fantastic class, and I highly recommend taking it at some point. It is so much more than your average psychology class, and the concepts and methods discussed in the class are so varied and fascinating. At least once per lecture, something just blows your mind, so that is pretty cool. I also took this class at the same time as PSYC 110, which I would recommend if you are interested in taking both classes. The material in both classes complement each other nicely, and while some of it is redundant, it is helpful for reviewing concepts and experiments.",
    "After the introduction lecture, I thought this course was going to be amazing. I have to say I was let down. Cognitive Science is very inter-discriplinary, which is great, but I found myself incredibly bored with the amount of detail we went into for topics I found uninteresting (how an fMRI works, for example). Every lecture is different, and some are good and some are bad.",
    "This is a great class. Everything about it is good. At the very least shop it and you will see what I am talking about. The class basically looks at how the mind works (and how we know that). You'll come to class everyday thinking you have a rough idea of how that piece of meat between your ears functions, but then he'll show you something that will blow your mind. The workload is not all that high (most of the work involves reading some papers and writing paragraph responses- there is one essay at the end of the semester that will probably take you a little while). The tests are graded fairly. Brian Scholl is an amazing lecturer. Plus its a SO credit for what is basically a science class.",
    "It's a case study approach towards some topics in cognitive science. A good survey course but not the best.",
    "I thought Intro to CogSci was an awesome course, made to appeal to a wide range of students. The workload is really as much as you make it-- for a prospective Cog Sci major like me, most readings are fascinating and you'll want to do them. For the majority of students, it is possible to get by doing much less. I shopped both Intro Psych and Cog Sci and chose the one that appealed to me most after the first lecture, and for anyone in a similar situation I highly recommend doing the same thing. You probably won't regret it either way. Overall, fascinating course.",
    "The course doesn't rely on a textbook, allowing it to be diverse and current in its material (some of which is produced by Prof Scholl himself). However, many students find that this limits the depth of the course -- but it seems that many intro courses will often resort to the spiel of \"look at this cool thing! to understand why it happens, take course X next semester!\" Lectures are always exciting and entertaining (though occasionally Prof. Scholl becomes a bit self-indulgent in drawn-out jokes and rants), and the three guest lectures (Santos, Scaz, Knobe) are all fantastic. Readings and brief reading responses take an hour per lecture, exams are easy and easy to study for (just come to lecture). Midterm paper is extremely open-ended and TA's are very willing to help (use it, they're the ones grading the paper).",
    "I think the class what somewhat interesting but I would recommend the intro classes it encompasses more like psych or computer science or linguistics",
    "I would say that it was a fascinating class about cognitive science and that I would highly recommend it.",
    "Course material was interesting, but sometimes presented in a confusing manner- the flow of the course wasn't always very logical to follow. Lots of specific examples, which often seem more important to memorize than broad themes or ideas. Good if you think like Scholl, more difficult than it should be if you don't.",
    "I would recommend this class because you learn a lot of interesting things. The lectures occasionally get a little dull towards the end of the hour and 15 minutes, but overall it's a great subject.",
    "Do not take this class. I don't recommend it. It will cause only frustration.",
    "Could be good, could be bad, all in all a course that is what you make of it (like everything here). I personally thought the material was a bit diluted and sort of Pop-Sciency, but it is not bad for someone without a heavy science background. Scholl seems like he's full of it, but he's actually a nice guy who really cares about teaching. Take it if you feel like it!",
    "I would definitely recommend intro cog sci to anyone. The material is interesting, it's not too much work, and Professor Scholl is great!",
    "I would recommend this course even if you are not taking it for the major. It is taught very similarly to Intro to Psychology which I took first, and there were certain overlaps but not too many. Definitely go to class because the exams are 95% lecture and 5% readings.",
    "This is a great course! Brian Scholl is an engaging professor and makes every lecture very interesting (and funny). The topics discussed in lecture are pretty much fascinating and cannot be found in any other course at Yale so this class is truly unique. The workload is manageable although studying for the exams can become stressful if you don't start in advance (exams can be tricky as well). Overall, it was a good course and I would recommend it to other students.",
    "Don't take this class if you want to really study something in-depth, but it's a good introduction to the huge variety of topics one could study in cognitive science. The readings are sometimes dull, sometimes very interesting, and they definitely add to the class. This is not a gut. A lot of people don't take this class seriously and then are surprised by how tricky the midterm and exam can be. That being said, it's easy to do well if you're genuinely interested in the topics covered in the class. Prof. Scholl is a great lecturer.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this to another student. Professor Scholl is super fun and engaging and you will look forward to going to class. The paper is pretty hard to write, but the tests are reasonable. Cognitive science, though, teaches a lot of abstract concepts. I found myself before the midterm feeling like we had barely learned anything concrete. I know now that this field is not for me, but I definitely don't regret taking the course.",
    "It is an enlightening class, but doesn't have much application in real life. It is fun to take, so it's best to take it as Pass\/Fail.",
    "Cogsci 110 is AWESOME! Take this class - Brian Scholl is a dynamic, insightful, and super engaging lecturer who could make these topics matter even for students who have never thought about cognitive science.",
    "I absolutely recommend CGSC 110 to any students interested in the subject. I took it alongside PSYC 110 and found that the two enlightened each other without creating much overlap. Take it if you want to think about humans in a totally new way!",
    "It is a really great exploration of the cognitive principles of our mind. It felt relevant and always exciting",
    "I would definitely recommend the course if you have any interest in any of the fields of Cognitive Science, or if you are interesting in CogSci but not sure what part exactly.",
    "This course was a whirlwind tour of the most interesting advances in Cognitive Science; it answers the most puzzling questions we have about the human mind. Absolutely fantastic. A must-take class.",
    "Interesting, exciting course, if you don't mind much breadth and less depth.",
    "CGSC 110 01 is a great class to take fall freshman year. It is not difficult and the workload is not bad, yet class is very interesting. I would recommend students to take it.",
    "I would recommend this class because it is interesting and not a lot of work. You learn about a lot of cool and unique topics unlike other classes.",
    "I wouldn't recommend.",
    "This is a very good survey class to spark your interest in the field. Light workload and really engaging material. Just make sure you go to lecture and pay attention. Would definitely recommend!",
    "I really enjoyed this course. It both asked and answered very interesting questions and I learned a lot about my brain. It took me a while to figure out how to effectively organize my lecture notes because it isn't immediately clear how the curriculum is structured and how the topics tie together, but after a few weeks I got the hang of it. It is a very broad overview of some of the topics cognitive scientists study. The homework readings were often long but were usually about fascinating subjects. Not all of the topics tie together and they will often carry over from one lecture to the next. Think of the class as 10-12 miniature pods of cool information. I would recommend it to a fellow student.",
    "Cognitive Science 110 is an exploration into some of the many concepts discussed and studied in the field of cognitive science. It is a great class if one wants to become acclimated to these ideas and is considering studying them in the future or if one is simply interested in various ways that cognition can be studied beyond the traditional psychological approach. I would recommend the class to my fellow students, because it's a fairly straightforward and engaging way to be introduced to the ideas of cognitive science.",
    "PSYC 130 is a great class if you are interested in the theoretical aspects of Cognitive Science although it does offer some practical applications of the concepts brought up. PSYC 130 shouldn't really be taken with PSYC 110 since the material does overlap a little. However, by itself, PSYC 130 is pretty solid--it's not \"easy\" but it's not terribly difficult either. The material learned in PSYC 130 makes great discussion material with friends and family.",
    "Take intro Cogsci if you're interested in computer science and how it intertwines with psychology. A great class, but designed for a very specific set of interests.",
    "I would recommend this class to someone who is interested in creative thinking about cognitive science. If you prefer to have a lot of material to learn in a more conventional academic setting, intro to cog sci may not be for you. The amount of material to learn is minimal; instead, you should be thinking about the material like a scientist, thinking about practical applications. Some people may shop the class and find it very interesting, but realize later it really isn't for them. Yes, it's interesting because the material is about human nature (you will find yourself seeing cognitive science in everyday situations all of the time), but if you don't care about explaining the underlying mechanisms that explain human thought and behavior, you may struggle. Definitely shop it to see if it's for you, or consider taking it Credit\/D, but just because it's interesting early on doesn't mean that you will enjoy writing eight pages of almost solely original thoughts (you will be discouraged from doing research) about how a particular cognitive science concept applies (or doesn't apply) to real life, which caused stress for many.",
    "This course was a broad overview of various topics in the field of cognitive science. Strengths: reading and interpreting many scientific papers, current research, engaging lectures and material Weaknesses: no in-depth coverage of any one topic (inherently), final paper assignment was vague and ineffective in either accurately measuring what you learned or encouraging you to explore beyond the syllabus, certain topics covered disproportionately (e.g. Turing machines, linguistics) I took it because I was interested in the Cognitive Science major, though I think this course hardly reflects work one might do in the major. Nonetheless, I gained exposure to cool concepts and areas of study I hadn't previously considered. Take it if you're thinking about applying to the major. If you're looking for a fun lecture just for kicks, this probably isn't worth your time.",
    "I would definetly recommend this class to anyone who has an interest in Cognitive Science.",
    "Its a interesting course that covers many topics.",
    "I would absolutely recommend Intro to Cog Sci to all students. It really is an interdisciplinary field, and you can apply the knowledge you gain in this class to so many other subjects, not to mention your own understanding of yourself and the progressing world. Professor Scholl really makes an effort to keep all the material exciting and relevant, always pushing you to identify connections with the real-world consequences of learning about the mind. Some of the units can be kind of tough and hard to see the significance of, depending on what your main interests are. But for the most part, the stuff you learn in this class will blow your mind and you will probably leave class every day feeling like a super genius for being able to understand this crazy intangible mind-thing even a little bit better than before.",
    "Cognitive Science is so broad that I can't necessarily recommend this to any specific type of person. Essentially, if you're interested in some aspects of how the mind works (not like psychology, where you learn about how different brain areas interact, especially through chemicals, etc.) then this class could be fun. Warnings: It's an intro class, so don't expect too much depth; just enough to get one interested in a certain field of cog sci. There's a midterm and a final that's in-class and not a real final (only material after the midterm), and they can be a little rough because it's difficult to know how to study for these exams. (The class material can sometimes be vague and contrived.) There are reading responses for decently long readings for EVERY class and sometimes the reading questions seem like typical elementary school questions that are basically just testing if you read it and not to make you think more about the topic which was very annoying. I did most of the readings (readings aren't on the exams, just stuff he goes over in class) and I wouldn't say it was worthwhile. Overall, if you want to go into this field, obviously you have to take it. Otherwise, not very highly recommended.",
    "if you are curious as to what is cognitive science and need an extra credit i highly suggest this course. It is a good way to learn about what the most interesting things of this field are. however unless you are planning on majoring in some aspect of cognitive science you will not get much out of this class in the long run. If you are interested in cognitive science then this is a great course as it is super fascinating however if you are not innately interested then take something like intro psych instead.",
    "CGSC was very interesting, After taking the course, you look at simple everyday phenomena differently because CGSC explains them. You learn lots of cool facts that are fun to talk about. However, because it was an intro class, you do not go in depth into a few topics, but rather skim the surface of many topics, which can be seen as both a positive and a negative. For me it was a negative, because while I feel like I am more knowledgable in general, I do not feel like I have developed any skills but rather only memorized facts. It depends on what you are looking to get out of the course. I would definitely recommend it if you are wondering if you are interested in the sciences related to the brain (cog sci, but also neuroscience, psychology, etc.) because it gives you a good overview of those topics without much commitment.",
    "A phenomenal course! I have absolutely no complaints. It was definitely a highlight of my week (twice a week, that is). Brian Scholl is brilliant, funny, engaging, and easily one of my favorite professors. My only desire is that it would be offered both semesters for future students\/cog sci enthusiasts!",
    "I thought the class was going to be easier than it was. It was a very difficult class. However, the information is extremely interesting and even helpful in everyday life. I feel accomplished having gotten through the class and would definitely recommend it.",
    "I would say it is an overview of the range of topics cognitive science can address and the disciplines used to approach these questions. While this encompasses a wide range of topics, the course was unified by the overarching themes and questions cogsci attempts to illuminate. I would recommend the course to anyone interested in exploring the possibilities of cognitive science, though the course does not go very in depth into any of the topics it touches on.",
    "It's an interesting survey course and a good way to learn about a lot of different subject areas in one class. However, it often lacks coherence. The first half of the class is dedicated to the more conceptual, abstract basis of how cognitive science is approached, but the second half of the semester is dedicated to much interesting topics that apply the material from the first half. The class seems like a cocktail party class - it'll leave you with a lot of interesting material to talk about but doesn't really go into depth about any one subject. Also, the name cognitive \"science\" is a bit deceiving. The class doesn't really involve hard science (chemistry, biology, etc.) but it is scientific in terms of methods of study.",
    "CogSci is a lecture which requires really good note taking skills. Professor Scholl expects you to study the slides for the tests, so I might take notes on the slide if I could take the class again. I would recommend it as an interesting class with cool assignments.",
    "Enjoyable course; super interesting; horribly graded. Don't go in expecting a good grade. Probably a good Credit\/D course, because you WILL get credit but it's a lot of tedious work and the exams are poorly graded.",
    "I think this is a great course to get exposure to Cognitive Science. Professor Scholl is a wonderfully engaging lecturer and you learn some really interesting material from a lot of different fields throughout the course. I think the way the course is graded is very fair and the reading responses, though they may seem like a nuisance, are a GREAT way to keep you on track and give you more exposure to the material being presented in class. For all these reasons, I would definitely recommend the course. Just make sure you study hard for your tests and complete your reading responses and you should be fine. The one thing to watch out for though is the thought paper. I found it really difficult and found the prompt really ambiguous. So try to check with your TA beforehand to make sure you have a good topic and that it adequately answers the prompt, because it can be pretty tricky!",
    "I absolutely loved this class. It gives a great introduction to the field of cognitive science, focusing on a different field through different modules. The lectures were engaging. Professor Brian Scholl is a dynamic lecturer; I always looked forward to class, as Professor Scholl speaks about the most intriguing phenomena that cognitive science explores. The workload isn't too bad. We basically had reading responses for every class, a final essay, a midterm, and a final. The reading responses were a bit annoying, but they're totally doable and usually really interesting. The exams were fine, as long as you attended every class and really studied the material. However, the exam procedure was completely absurd; because the exams have to be pre-named, there is usually a line out the door come exam day, as we all have to receive our personal exams from our TA's. This means the first people to come to the class got more time on the exams, which I think was unfair for people coming from classes before the exam. But, overall, it's a really great class and the workload isn't too bad.",
    "An interesting analysis of different components of different subjects and fields with various processes and aspects that all play into the interdisciplinary field of cognitive science. I would only recommend this course to students who have a preference for such a large lecture environment without much participation or stimulation.",
    "Intro to cogsci is a great class. The material is really interesting and professor Scholl does an excellent job presenting it. The lectures are always entertaining and engaging. While the readings can be very technical and difficult to understand, they do a great job of introducing you to the field. I felt like I learned a lot about not only how the brain works and performs various tasks, but also how people approach studying the brain. In addition, the workload was very manageable and the tests were fair.",
    "Fantastic course. Need to take at some point of your Yale career. It was annoying having to do the reading responses, but often left class feeling inspired or amazed.",
    "Great Cr\/D. Better version of PSYC 110. Scholl is amazing. Thought paper was a tough assignment.",
    "It's extremely interesting and will certainly change the way you see the world. The lectures are sort of like a series of Ted Talks. They certainly have the capacity to surprise you and influence the way you think about complex topics like rationality and consciousness. Since it's like a series of Ted Talks though, you don't get a ton of engagement with the material and it can be difficult at times to connect the concepts. Since the lectures are organized around themes rather than fields of cognitive science, it sometimes feels like you are just learning random facts in cognitive processes rather than a holistic integration of material. So certainly take it if you're interested in some surprising phenomena, but beware of the loose structure (also since there are a ton of tryhards the class is barely curved) [but 1\/4 of the class still gets an A]",
    "It is a challenging course to adjust to. It is very much application-based so be prepared to not just memorize course material for the exams.",
    "Even if you're not thinking about the cog sci major, this is a good class to take - it is important for everyone to have at least an introductory exposure to this exciting and rapidly developing field.",
    "A course that teaches a bunch of general concepts of cognitive science but doesn't go in depth on most of them. Overall would recommend if you think it sounds interesting, but would say don't be afraid to drop it if it doesn't pique your interest. I personally didn't find it particularly interesting but decided to stick with it-- poor decision as the class just ended up feeling like a dead weight that didn't allow me to focus as much as i would have liked on other classes.",
    "Intro CogSci is a very interesting, cool course. At points, you may be frustrated by Professor Scholl, but definitely worth taking if you have any interest in the topic. It's basically a more rounded version of intro Psych.",
    "Definitely take it if you're interested",
    "This class is difficult, and most people do not do as well as they would hope on the midterm. The final is a lot like the midterm though, so if you learn how to prepare for his exams, then you can end up doing well in the class. The exams are fair; they test how well you truly understand the information. When studying for them you should see if you can explain the concept to yourself almost as well as the TA can, and that will show you that you have really grasped it. It's a really interesting class and the teacher is funny and engaging. I learned a lot and I'm glad I took it, though I will not be pursuing Cognitive Science as a major.",
    "Good survey course, but won't go very in-depth about anything in particular.",
    "Intro to Cog Sci is an absolutely fascinating course on the human brain and how it works on many different levels. As a person not majoring in the natural sciences, I nonetheless recommend this class to anyone who has even a tiny bit of interest in this subject. The class is not a gut, but is also not that hard.",
    "This is a great class if you're interested in the material. The workload is manageable, the lectures are generally engaging and focused, and if you invest in the class you'll definitely learn a lot of interesting stuff.",
    "Take it. Don't even consider psych. Just take cog sci, no questions asked. You'll love it.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course because it is very interesting and not too time consuming.",
    "Definitely take this class. The workload is not bad at all, and you will learn so much just by going to lecture. You may even be persuaded to choose cogsci as your major!",
    "A very solid course. Brian Scholl is the man and the lectures are wonderful. Other than the semiweekly reading responses, there isn't much work.",
    "Yes I would recommend it for anyone who isnt too well versed in psychology. Its a great intro course. Learned a lot.",
    "Intro to CogSci is an overview of how the mind works. Professor Scholl will wow you in the first few lectures. The information was fascinating, but a lot of it we just brushed over since the focus of the course was to cover the whole field of cognitive science. There are no discussion sections, so that doesn't help with the fact that so much of the information is just brushed over. It was nice not having a textbook and reading actual scientific articles.",
    "Overall I found this course to be very enjoyable. The material was not always fantastic, but it was far more interesting than your typical course. You have to do readings for each class and answer reading questions. This can seem like a lot sometimes, but you only really need to skim a couple pages to answer the questions. Grades come from those reading questions, a midterm and final, and a paper on pretty much and topic discussed in the class. Workload is very light. I would certainly recommend this as a fun 5th class.",
    "This class is all about the lectures. There is no textbook, so you need to pay attention and take thorough notes. If take good notes, submit all of the reading responses, and write a good paper, it is not difficult to do well. While the content is interesting, many of the students found Scholl to be annoying and arrogant. If you're an upperclassman, be warned that this class is filled with freshmen and taught as though everyone there is a freshman.",
    "Great, interesting and very novel class. Definitely recommend it.",
    "The tests are very hard, especially in comparison to the seemingly relaxed lecture environment. Because there is no textbook, going to lecture is very important. I'd recommend this course to anyone with a long attention span and great note taking skills.",
    "Intro to Cognitive Science is really interesting but is definitely difficult. The information is fantastic but definitely requires you to go through it repeatedly to understand it in the necessary ways for assessments. It takes a lot of time to complete the assignments, but they are usually not too difficult. Make sure to develop a relationship with your TF, they are very helpful in the course.",
    "Sort of life psych but with a quantitative approach to certain topics. Some units are more interesting than others, but overall still an engaging class.",
    "It is a great class if you want a survey of the entire field. Interesting and has applicable.",
    "I would recommend this class. It was a greta introduction in the field of cognitive science and makes me want to study further into this field. The reading questions can get a bit tedious but the readings can be interesting sometimes. I would recommend taking this class Credit\/D however because the grading can be arbitrary and really depends on what each teaching fellow is looking for.",
    "I would recommend Intro Psych over this class.",
    "I would definitely recommend intro to cog sci to a fellow student. It was incredibly interesting and engaging. I hadn't even heard of cognitive science before this class and now I'm even considering a major.",
    "Cognitive science was one of my favorite classes that I have ever taken. The readings were interesting, the teacher was great, and I learned a lot. While it is not for everyone, I would recommend this class to anyone interested in majoring in Cognitive science.",
    "I would recommend this class if you are interested in cognitive science, it is an interesting and low stress overview.",
    "Lots of gimmicks with little continuity in knowledge, learning, or curriculum. If you have a choice to take another Social Science credit, you should probably do that.",
    "I recommend the class.",
    "It's a broad overview introduction to the interdisciplinary study of cognitive science. I'd recommend it to someone with the caveat that they understand the somewhat shallow nature of the material and class environment.",
    "It's a good course. Professor Scholl is pretty funny and engaging, and the material is definitely cool. While it's not a ton of work, expect to have at least one reading response due every class (twice a week), a midterm, and final, and a final paper. The course has a lot of overlap with material from Intro Psych, but takes it from a more scientific approach. Definitely worth taking if you've got any interest in that sort of thing.",
    "Fun class, not quite sure how meaningful it was. Seemed more of a sample class for other subjects such as linguistics than really diving into cognitive science.",
    "This class is a very broad overview of the field of cognitive science. It covers many topics very broadly, and there aren't a lot of specifics. I would only recommend this class to a student who is pretty sure they want to major in cognitive science but aren't sure which area. For the general student, I wouldn't say it was worth taking because it was very broad and didn't dive deep into any of the material covered.",
    "Overall the class is good. I am not sure how much I have learned from it but the topics that are presented are interesting and very well presented. Readings are a lot of work to do but I think the class is very good and would recommend it",
    "I took this class to assess whether or not I was interested in the Cognitive Science major. The class turned me off from the major entirely, but that doesn't mean it is a bad class. I recommend the class to those who are generally interested in the mind. If you are uninterested in an interdisciplinary approach to superficial information, then I suggest you avoid the class.",
    "The course itself is a bit dry in content, embellished by Scholl's great lecturing style and cool examples. A more focused cognitive science class with less topics but more depth would be much better and interesting, and you could choose the specific area of cog sci that you are interested in. Take this course if you like the sound of cognitive science and may have interest in it, and see if you like it or not. It works well as an introduction course for students who have a slight interest in these kinds of topics.",
    "YES. Take this class. I'm a firm believer that anyone should take a neuro-related course at some point in their career, and this is the perfect mix of science and psych too. I'm a junior psych\/neuro major and have taken a few neuro courses here, but there was not major overlap, so really I feel anyone, no matter their experience level, should give it a go. I never took intro psych here, though, so I don't know about the overlap there.... The only slightly annoying thing about this class are the mandatory reading responses for every single class. For most classes, there are about 2 of them. I will say, it kept me up on my reading, which I probably wouldn't have done otherwise, but they're sometimes not even brought up in lecture or the exams, so it seemed like a bit of a waste to me. Also, they can be hard to remember all of the time.",
    "As a freshman, I'm so glad that I began my Yale career in Intro to Cog Sci. It surveys a fascinating array of the various subfields of cognitive science. Brian Scholl is a wonderful speaker, being both funny and compelling. The work assigned is not excessive, and it really helps with learning the content.",
    "Amazing lecturer, very interesting material, the readings are worthwhile, take it!",
    "A course that covers vast ranges of extremely interesting material without a whole lot of work, but one in which is is incredibly hard to get a good grade in because of he difficulty of the tests and essay. Don't take it just for fun.",
    "A good class, pretty much what you'd expect from an SO. The lectures and some readings were interesting, although the tests are harder than you'd expect based on the accessibility of the information, so GO TO THE REVIEW SESSIONS. The TF's lay out what you need to know to get a decent grade.",
    "I do not recommend this course because I do not feel as if I learned very much about cognitive science, which was the whole point of taking the lecture.",
    "I would recommend this course.",
    "I would recommend Intro to CogSci to another student! The lectures are engaging, the workload is light (just 2 midterms, a thought paper, and readings\/reading questions), and the topics covered are interesting.",
    "CGSC 110 is a large but engaging lecture that introduces you to the general themes of cognitive science and many areas within the field. I would definitely recommend the course to someone interested in the mind in any respect because cognitive science makes you consider things you never have thought of before, and shows how without cognitive science, we are instinctively blind to how our minds work.",
    "Professor Scholl is an incredible professors who manages to hold your attention with his occasional humor and witty comments. If you're looking for an interesting and engaging introductory class, then I recommend that you consider this course. You'll learn about both why your brain's cognitive functions work and how your brain succeeds in completing incredibly complex tasks seamlessly. The workload is really manageable. In terms of weekly assignments, Professor Scholl only required that you complete assigned readings with assigned reading questions before lectures. (on Mondays and Wednesdays) The majority of your grade will come from one midterm, one final, and a final paper. This class requires no textbook as well. Which is a really nice fact. Nonetheless, this course is not any easy 'A'. You will have to study considerably well. This class covers a LOT of material. I personally struggled with it. That being said, I did enjoy this class. I hope you will as well! Good luck!",
    "The course gives a great introduction to those interested in cognitive science or just curious about why we think and behave the way we do and the implications of these findings.",
    "I would summarize this class as a very fascinating introduction to not only how the mind works, but also the research that is being done to further our understanding of the human brain. I would absolutely recommend this class to another student since I enjoyed it so much.",
    "I would definitely recommend the course. I do not want to go into the field, but I found the wide range of topics covered by the lectures to be very interesting. The workload was not very heavy either so I never felt like I was falling behind or being stressed out.",
    "Absolutely the highlight of my semester. Professor Scholl has a style of lecturing that makes you feel like you're hanging out with a really funny friend... and then you leave and you're like, wait, I wasn't chilling with a friend, I was learning a crazy ton about really fascinating topics like the mind and Turing machines and decision-making, how cool is that? I swear, an hour and fifteen minutes has never gone by so fast. The TFs were great-- don't be afraid of how big the lecture is, because they do an awesome job of making it feel more personal. Definitely, definitely, definitely recommended."
