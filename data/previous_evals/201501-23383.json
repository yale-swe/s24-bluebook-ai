   "comments": [
    "This course has great potential. I think the instructor brings fantastic experience and ability to communicate these learned lessons to students. I thought the single area where the class could be most improved is a movement away from the dry, textbook material, toward a larger emphasis on case studies, including the instructor's own experiences. I understand entirely the need the instructor felt to give the course an \"intellectual foundation,\" but I don't think using the rather elementary textbook was the way to go. I would suggest more case studies, more real life discussions, as well as continued guest speakers. The best part of the class was the instructor's interaction with students, as well as pushing us all on evaluating real life problems.",
    "Strengths: Free-flowing, adapted to student interests, good discussion Weaknesses: No real structure and blurry expectations",
    "This course has a lot of potential. Since this is a new course and it was the first year being taught, there was a lot of disorganization and trial and error. The class on pubic speaking in the beginning of the semester was particularly traumatizing and poorly run. The guest speakers, while for the most part very interesting, did not always seem to flow well with the content of the course. I enjoyed working in groups towards the end of the semester- these group break out sessions seemed to work very well especially in terms of engaging students who might be less inclined to participate in class discussions.",
    "This was the first time the course was taught therefore there are many aspects that need improvement. Given the experience of the professor, it would've been great to have more insight on process of public health communication or at least preparing for a news release on the particular topic. The assignments were unclear and the lectures could've been more active. Strength: Guest lectures were great. Textbook for the course was good.",
    "To be honest, this is the worst course I have taken at Yale. It had no direction. I'm not sure what I learned from this course. The best part was some of the guest lecturers.",
    "This course has a lot of potential. It is the only rigorous course in health communication at YSPH (for some reason). Robert Bazell is clearly an expert in communications, but the course spent too much time on theory. The description for the course speaks of roleplaying various real-life situations, and assignments that teach students to communicate health issues effectively, yet the only real assignment was a simple essay. If the course is restructured to meet its own description, it could be great.",
    "finally we have a communications course at YSPH! i'd say the topic is great, the instructor has so much to offer, but just needs to find his own style and not worry about following a textbook so much. great combo of different guest speakers and different topics. more case study sessions would be really great and engaging. more case study looks at bob's time in the professional world would be great too. don't you worry about being anyone other than you!",
    "It could have been a bit more organized and structured. However, this was the first time this class was taught, so we all knew that there were was room for change.",
    "This is an incredibly important topic and I absolutely think the class needs to exist, but it was not well taught this year. The material is good, but there was not enough practice with the concepts. There should have been more quizzes, more role plays or group work, and more focused blog posts. These are all doable, and I'm sure next year will be much better!",
    "This course could benefit from a total overhaul. It was unfocused, unorganized, and I can't honestly say that I learned anything over the course of the semester that I hadn't already gathered from professional work or other coursework at YSPH.",
    "I really ripped this course apart in my mid-term evaluation, so I won't go into those details. However, I was happy to note the changes that came from our evaluations after spring break. The class seemed to have a little more direction, and I felt more engaged than before. The final project was actually interesting, and I enjoyed doing it. It would have been cool to have been a project we progressively worked at throughout the semester. Perhaps have done some side projects associated with the final paper (ie develop marketing materials, write news articles, op eds, etc) There would need to be many more changes to the course, should it be offered again (which in my honest opinion, I think it should, despite the my overall underwhelming experience with it)",
    "I like the course so much. Dr. Bazell was great teacher and trying his best in teaching a brand new class. He did a great job",
    "The course has a lot of promise. The subject matter is interesting, and Bob has the experience to offer incredible insight. The course was not as fluid and well-organized as other courses, but that was to be expected in the courses first iteration. The main interest of the course was that it focuses on a subject that compels a lot of people. The text was fine and offered decent framework, but I think the true value came from examining real life examples of communication efforts and analyzing them. There were a lot of guest lecturers, and most of them were great! I particularly enjoyed the Harvard Business guy and Harold Jaffe. From a personal perspective, I would have enjoyed more structure in the overall set-up of the course. We figured out a lot as we went along, but I think future classes will benefit from having a clear idea of what to expect from the semester and a clear timeline in which to complete assignments."

    "Instructor: Robert Joseph Bazell \u00a0Professor Bazell is a gem; he is a great resource to the University, and I am happy he is involved in this course. There is no one better tot each this class. The course would be better serve if Professor Bazell were more himself, rather than holding himself back to focus on the \"textbook material.\"",
    "Instructor: Robert Joseph Bazell \u00a0Robert wanted to be engaging and meet student needs but it seemed that he didn't know how to best go about doing that. I enjoyed him as a person but not as much as a professor.",
    "Instructor: Robert Joseph Bazell \u00a0Robert Bazell has an extensive and rich background in health communications. His first hand experience as an NBC health correspondent is impressive. However, there were many times when the lecture content did not always flow well and assignments were not always clear.",
    "Instructor: Robert Joseph Bazell \u00a0Tends to cut off students when speaking and doesn't allow them to finish expressing themselves before interjecting. Improving on listening skills would improve his teaching.",
    "Instructor: Robert Joseph Bazell \u00a0While I respect Dr. Bazell's long, impressive career, he is not well suited to be a professor at YSPH. He seemed to have done a lot of outside research on public health, which I appreciate, but his lack of knowledge on the subject was palpable.",
    "Instructor: Robert Joseph Bazell \u00a0This was Professor Bazell's first time teaching, and you could tell. He seems uncomfortable with the material he presents, had many misunderstandings of the school of public health (thought everyone was an epidemiologist, for instance), and provided in general a lack of oversight in the course. I think it will eventually improve, for instance our last three lectures were ones where the discussions brought us to new topics and were really helpful.",
    "Instructor: Robert Joseph Bazell \u00a0The guest speakers were great, but it also would have been nice to have gotten more lectures and discussions solely with him. He's a great person to learn from!",
    "Instructor: Robert Joseph Bazell \u00a0Good potential, but not quite there yet. My biggest thing would be that he needs to commit to what he's saying. If he's goING to give a presentation, he needs to give it and act like it matters, rather than going through overly quickly and half-saying things. Nice guy though!",
    "Instructor: Robert Joseph Bazell \u00a0The professor was very sweet and I had no idea the experience he had in the field (pretty cool to learn from a chief correspondent during the anthrax outbreak, and for one of the first anti-vaccine stories) I wish he brought more of this into the classroom. You could tell he was nervous to speak in front of the class, but I think he overcame that \"fear\" after a session or two. He was also very helpful when we would reach out to him beyond class for advice on the project.",
    "Instructor: Robert Joseph Bazell \u00a0I like the course so much. Dr. Bazell was great teacher and trying his best in teaching a brand new class. He did a great job",
    "Instructor: Robert Joseph Bazell \u00a0Bob did a nice job. Sometimes the way he expressed himself was not always clear and fluid, but I believe he just had a lot of ideas he wanted to share. I believe I would have followed along better if he slowed down at times and clearly articulated the ideas he wanted to express. Sometimes he showed a slide with a lot of words or pictures and attempted to let the slide do the explaining. A brief \"orienting\" comment or clear asking of a questions would have helped me follow along. Bob is about as nice as can be, and I know the course will becomes more polished in future semesters."

   "comments": [
    "This is a great course that is still in development. The professor is the course's largest asset, and as he finds his feet and trusts his instincts more, this course will be even better.",
    "I would not recommend this course mostly because I feel as though I didn't learn new material. Although, it was an enjoyable enough two hours because we spent the majority of the time discussing different things.",
    "This course has potential and will likely be much more smoothly run next year. Students considering this course should be aware that it is highly interactive and requires extensive class participation.",
    "This course has great potential if revamped.",
    "I would not recommend this course to a fellow student.",
    "i would definitely recommend a student to take this course because i can only assume the course will grow and develop in years to come, and it's an incredibly relevant topic to all public health professionals. this course has the potential of being one of the most applicable and practical courses at YSPH.",
    "Yes, I would recommend it! Public health communications is more important and relevant than we may initially think.",
    "A general intro to the theory and practice of health communications. This year was it's first year and it was honestly a pretty bad class, but I would shop it if you're interested in the material. I think it could be a lot better next year",
    "This was the first time a course in Health Communications has been offered at Yale, so the curriculum is a little scattered. However, there are a few gems throughout the class. It's not an entire waste of a semester, just need to make the most of what you have.",
    "I like the course so much. Dr. Bazell was great teacher and trying his best in teaching a brand new class. He did a great job",
    "This course is a great intro to health communications. It is a fascinating subject with loads of potential, but the course is brand new and is not a polished product yet. Bob has tons of impressive experience, which is an asset, and he can offer wonderful insight. There is tons of flexibility in terms of focusing on content that interests you, so if health communications is something that you want to know more about, the class is worthwhile."
