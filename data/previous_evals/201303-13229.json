   "comments": [
    "I would recommend the course only for students with a strong economics background in addition to summer math camp. The course was very challenging and assignments were time consuming. Overall, it was a valuable experience, but terribly difficult for those overloading on courses and not strictly focusing on economics.",
    "This course will help with your understanding of how to frame a problem. While I think this is a very valuable skill, I would not recommend it to anyone who does not already have strong foundation in calculus and an understanding of mathematical notation.",
    "To fellow students, I would stress that the course is only worth taking if you are very comfortable with mathematics and\/or logic, or have had a reasonable amount of prior economic\/modelling training. I would also stress that, if you do have these priors, then it is very much worth taking, because it helps you to bring a level of precision to your thinking that is uncommon in other areas of political science.",
    "This is a challenging course, but one that teaches the basics of modeling in a very thorough manner. I would certainly recommend it to any students who were interested in using models in their work, and I would also recommend it to students who felt it was likely they would encounter substantial research based on modeling. It seems like one course that everyone should take if they have time."

   "comments": [
    "This course gave me techniques to help undersand complex problems and will be very useful in my future professional career.",
    "I am not sure how this course will contribute to my research, but I believe it will be very valuable regardless of what kind of research I plan to pursue. I think all political scientists-in-training should take it (regardless of subfield).",
    "I am quite certain that the course improved my knowledge of the discipline. I could see the improvement in my own ability to read papers based on formal models as the semester went on."
