    "The course provided just what I needed - an opportunity to practise and be critiqued on my communication skills. It pinpointed areas for improvement. It tried to cover a lot in quite a short space of time and more opportunities for practising would be useful - but we can access that through the FES comms people at any time, so this course was great for just making me aware of my own strengths and weaknesses. It was great to learn alongside my peers and be able to give and receive criticism as a class.",
    "The course was very useful and helped improve my communication skills.",
    "This was too much work for a 1 credit class. VERY valuable information\/feedback, though. I believe that everyone at FES should be required to take this class during their first semester.Would be helpful if there were a way to incorporate this into our full semester of classes rather than having us do weekly assignments. For example, we would be required to put the concepts into practice in our other classes as part of the Communications class. Instead of having to make up short presentations\/speeches\/panels, have us be evaluated on how we perform during our regular course load.",
    "This course should be expanded into a 3 credit course. I found it exceptionally valuable and I think everyone should take it.",

    "This is an excellent course-- almost feel like it should be mandatory for all FES students!",
    "The course is very valuable, but I can't say it's a great deal of fun.",
    "This course is incredibly useful to students hoping to gain experience in public speaking, it really should be \"required\" (though it's better that it's not) it's just that useful!",
    "Ironically, the instructions for some of the assignments were unclear and many people were confused as to what exactly was expected for the assignment. I suggest Vance make the instructions as clear and explicit as possible."
