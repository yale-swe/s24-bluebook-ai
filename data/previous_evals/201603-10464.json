    "Very in depth study of various separations processes.",

    "To quote an past evaluation that was quoting an even older evaluation: \"If any other teacher besides Professor Osuji were teaching this course, we would never have gotten through all of the material. But Professor Osuji dragged us through this course the same way Achilles dragged Hector behind his chariot around Troy, which I guess in the end was a good thing for us.\"",

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This class was taught mostly as a PowerPoint recreation of the text book which was a very ineffective tool for learning. I feel like this did not facilitate learning in the class and made studying for the midterms extremely difficult.",
    "The material is very challenging and not always intuitive. There is a lot of information covered to an in depth degree; one of the more challenging classes of chemE. While the material learned may not be the most interesting, the problem sets require and build the problem solving skills essential for engineering classes.",
    "Strengths: assignments included opportunities to solve using Matlab and to find information online Weaknesses: We only had a week to do \"biweekly\" psets which meant that we alternated b\/w having no work for this class and having overwhelming amounts of work. There also wasn't much time to go over solutions from the previous psets and to try and understand things that we may have missed the first time around. The course could be improved if perhaps the off-weeks where there are no psets assigned we could work on H.W. corrections for extra credit. It would also have been fun if we had a more real world engineering separation project like designing a carbon capture system or a water filtration plant.",
    "So I learned a lot. Professor Osuji's dedication to get through so much material is commendable -- I can't deny it. But this class is brutal. The first half of semester (actually most of the semester) problem sets would take me at least 30-40 hours a week. I didn't take a 5th class I wanted to take because of this class. I spent no time on other classes, my health declined, overall not great. It did lighten up a bit towards the end, but that is a VERY relative term -- the problem sets still took much longer than any other class. On top of that, some problems would require tables, charts, equations, developed in book problems we hadn't even covered, so you would waste hours trying to figure it out, go to office hours, and find that the Professor was equally as surprised to realize what the solution required. And for the record, as someone who studies A LOT, the second exam was completely ridiculous -- it did not cover any of the important concepts we learned in class and in the book -- and I would know because I arguably studied consistently more than anyone else in the class. It was supposed to test concepts and be problem set like, but was not at all. I am still fuming thinking about it.",
    "The course material, isolated from the instructor, is not an impossible task. The material is dense and comes in waves of detail, but with methodical instruction, it can be made very digestible.",
    "This course was painful and upsetting to me. I learned very little compared to the time I put in. If the problem sets were solvable by the TF, that would be great. In addition, I think the easy concepts of this course would be well accompanied by some medium level problems and not just ones that take 5 hours to program and solve."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Interesting course, but workload is too high to satisfy mere interest. Only take if you have to. You will not enjoy this course if you take it out of curiosity.",
    "If Osuji is teaching it try to find another year to take it. He will make your life hell. Everything is \"trivial\" to him and he has no understanding that most of his students are taking 3-4 other courses. The problem sets will take 40+ hours to complete and understanding the material is impossible given you will be spending countless hours trying to figure out Matlab to complete problem sets. Then to top it all off he'll give you a lab report during reading week because he could not get the data to the class 4 weeks before when you actually do the experiment.",
    "If Prof. Osuji is teaching this class, good luck! Work together and definitely go the the TA session and office hours. The psets will take a long time, but since they are usually biweekly, it's not completely miserable.",
    "This course recommendation does not matter because if you are looking at this course you have to take it. This class is completely and utterly brutal. But if you are in it -- go to office hours! Professor Osuji is great one-on-one to talk to about concepts and problems. Don't make the mistake of spending hours trying to do problem-sets on your own. Trust me, most of the time you are probably missing some key equation, chart, data, or there is error in the book and you would never figure it out. Go to office hours with the TA and the professor for it is so much more efficient. You will cover more material in this class than any other class you will take, and you will definitely pay for it in blood, sweat, and tears. To quote a past evaluation that was quoting an even older evaluation: \"If any other teacher besides Professor Osuji were teaching this course, we would never have gotten through all of the material. But Professor Osuji dragged us through this course the same way Achilles dragged Hector behind his chariot around Troy, which I guess in the end was a good thing for us.\"",
    "If possible, take this course with a professor that is more in touch with students, otherwise the material that is inherently reasonable and understandable will become overwhelming as the instructor overloads the students while deeming much of the general difficulty in understanding as simply trivial. An encouraging and nurturing environment is needed to truly succeed in this course and to come away with a feeling of having learned and achieved something, not simply survived something. Assignments take about 30 hours of work to complete, even when working with others and getting help from the TA. Exams may or may not be related to the material of the pset, so it is best to be prepared for a wider range of material than what was simply discussed in class or covered in the psets.",
    "You should only take this course if you have to and good luck."
