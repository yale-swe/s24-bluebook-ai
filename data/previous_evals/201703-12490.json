    "The answer to the threat posed to the humanities by STEM fields is not the slavish acquiescence to its methods but an assertion of the unique critical perspective afforded by the humanities. Learning about psychoanalysis put many modern problems of psychology into historical perspective and increased my understanding of them immeasurably. The dismissal of psychoanalysis as unscientific, and therefore not worth studying, amounts to nothing short of a total misunderstanding of what is at stake in its project.",
    "I became familiar with key terms and concepts in psychoanalytic discourse--in particular, within the Freudian and Lacanian corpora. I was given the experience of tracing the evolution of a body of thought from its empiricist nascency to its life within structural and post-structural linguistics and even unto its Marxist and politically critical deployments. The final writing project was both constructive and pedagogical in aim. Prof. Fradinger is a brilliant pedagogue bent on producing the same. I've discovered this emphasis on producing good teachers is too much a rarity at this institution. The joint task of producing a piece of writing that made psychoanalytic themes accessible and yet using them toward rigorously constructive ends was a great opportunity in writing-to-learn as well as mapping the points of connection between my own research and this body of thought. As a result of this course, I'm now comfortable both referencing, defining, and marshaling these concepts in my own constructive work.",

    "Yes",
    "Of course I would recommend this course to another student with interests in psychoanalytic discourse. It's only because Yale continues to offer courses of this scope and caliber that it is able to remain a leader in the study of the humanities. It's a rare opportunity to be able to study Lacanian psychoanalytic theory from someone as erudite and thoroughly pedagogical as Prof. Fradinger.",
    "I would highly recommend this course. Thanks primarily to Professor Fradinger's pedagogy, it acquainted me with a mode of thinking that has changed the way I move through the world."
