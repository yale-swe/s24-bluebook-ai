   "comments": [
    "Strengths: a lot of materials that would be very helpful for my later research and studies",
    "Appreciated format of homework and video lecture; discriminant analysis homework hard to do without consulting instructors",
    "I think it's very very nice that Dr. Reuning-Scherer incorporates code from multiple languages but it does make the class a bit hard to follow, especially if you're waiting for him to cover it in your language. R is quite different from SAS\/SPSS so it's hard to take from his SAS\/SPSS lectures and apply them. Especially when some of the models\/functions in R could be explained in more detail (what different options are in the functions or how functions from similar packages work). I think the time on other languages could be scrapped (or saved to online files for people to access if they need) and the course could focus on R only. YSPH is transitioning to R anyways so there won't be a great need for SAS for those students anyways.",
    "Many methods are learned without going into assumptions details",
    "Strengh: detailed instructions on different tools",
    "explains concepts very clearly",
    "The spacing of the homework assignments was nice--regular but not overbearing. It would have been great to have a class reviewing what to use in which contexts (I know that was the original plan), so maybe in the future that class can happen sooner, or a resource can be developed that can be easily shared with students in case the last class is canceled again in the future.",
    "Strengths are Jonathan's excellent teaching and the structure of the course. The main weakness I found was that it was almost too applied. I felt like some non-programming homeworks would help me to understand the concepts more completely. As it stands it felt like I was learning more about R packages than statistics.",
    "Maybe require that people come to class? Was hard to engage when you felt like you were the only one in class",
    "Good slides! A success flipped class. Maybe need to slow down a little when the course content becomes overwhelming. It takes quite some effort to wrap my head around the things but it takes only a few days to forget everything. I suggest removing some of the content like \"this method and that method\", which are all options with the same goal, and just focus on some widely used methods.",
    "Very engaging lecture no weakness!",
    "This course holds practical application above all else, which is unusual - and amazing for this kind of application. I went from an R rookie to having a suite of practical knowledge and being able to apply multivariate statistics to my own work in the space of a single semester! I will say, you have to be self-motivated to get everything you can from the course.",
    "Great teaching, very engaging",
    "The course is well structured.",
    "the professor did a great job describing and breaking down each method to summarize them, however the online structure made it difficult to feel fully engaged with the material.",
    "Instead of using a plethora of statistical tools and packages, maybe just focus on one or two instead, and we learn whatever we can using those tools.",
    "The sheer size of the course makes it somewhat less engaging than smaller classes."

   "question_text": "What advice would you give to a student considering taking this class?",
   "comments": [
    "Take the class after you can use R\/ SAS",
    "Best to review the syllabus and see if you'll actually have data that's useful for multivariate. It's not as applicable as regression for certain disciplines.",
    "Very helpful if you want to learn statisticl analysis and how to use statistical tools such as SAS, R, SPSS",
    "Office hours can be really helpful if you are ever at a loss or have an idea but are not sure how to apply it. Otherwise, self-guided learning is made possible by the great scripts our professor has created. This is not a very time-intensive class and I expect the knowledge gained will be very useful in the future!",
    "The requirements are just for application of the data analysis methods. But if you want to know more about the overlaid mathematical principles, the materials are also provided.",
    "This is a broad-overview, and nicely paced as long as you know R",
    "Take this course if you want to have an authoritative overview of statistic.",
    "Very cool statistics with freedom to choose what program to use",
    "Do your homework before the class moves too far past a section, and pick a data set that you care about at the BEGINNING of the semester - it makes the course significantly more interesting and ensures you get the most out of it if you care about the material you're analyzing.",
    "Lot of work but interesting",
    "It is a great class to get an overview of many relevant multivariate statistical methods.",
    "Try to meet with the instructor often, as well as find a group to do the homeworks with.",
    "It's a good course but don't make it the only stats course -- take inferential stats etc before and something else after. Also great if you have your own data and want to use this course to analyze it.",
    "Be sure to pick out a dataset that's appropriate for multivariate analysis as soon as possible, so you can use it for most if your homework. That way, you've already done most of the statistics for the final project by the time it's due.",
    "This class is good place to acquire valuable skills if you are planning to go into any type of endeavor that involves analyzing data."
