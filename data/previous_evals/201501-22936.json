    "If you can get in this course, TAKE IT!! Seriously! And if you can't get in the first time, try again the next semester. This course is just that good. You learn skills and techniques tied to video production, such as Final Cut Pro, DSLR cameras, Panasonic cameras, camera rigs, green screen, etc. So you get really well acquainted with the DMCA. It takes a while to get everything done, so keep that in mind, if you have a large workload. You learn about video art (so not so narrative-based just keep in mind) and what it means to work in a time-based medium. Best of all, Sarah is one of the best instructors you'll meet at Yale. She really wants everyone to succeed and will help the person get to that point. Best yet, she's great at creating a safe space but also at objectively critiquing people. This also depends on the people in the class but I think this semester, we got lucky. It was a great experience and if you can get in, take it!",
    "Probably the best and most useful intro art class I've taken at Yale. If you have any interest in video--particularly if you have a technical interest in video--take this class.",
    "I took it because a friend recommended it, and it ended up being my favorite class and among my favorite art classes I've taken here. I found that editing and film compositing is very intuitive and the video medium is super fun to mess around with!!",
    "One of the best courses I've taken at Yaleabsolutely take it! You will learn so much from the exercise-based approach. The course will be whatever you make it, and you'll want to make it something special. Sarah is an amazing creative mentor.",
    "Take it!!!'",
    "Sarah's class is really wonderful--it wound up being a great space to learn about video art as a medium (it's history and some contemporary uses), and also to share some of our own work. I really felt like this class gave me a handle on the mechanics of using a camera and editing footage in final cut pro. A lot of the beginning classes might be review for those with video experience, but after that the class becomes more about watching videos and each others work. Students make four videos.",
    "If you are interested in learning about and making video art\/experimental film you should take this class-- you will most certainly be exposed to pieces you would not otherwise see\/you will build up quite a bank of video chops. Incredible class if you are interested (but not for the faint of heart).",
    "10\/10 WOULD ABSOLUTELY RECOMMEND.",
    "Take this class! I had no experience at all with video before this class, and I learned so much. If you're already very experienced with film this might not be the right level for you, but for sure shop it to see.",
    "I would recommend this to any student at Yale College."
