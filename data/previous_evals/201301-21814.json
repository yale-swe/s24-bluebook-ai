    "Definitely take, but make sure you have the right amount of Greek before you go for it, otherwise you'll quickly get left behind.",
    "Fabulous.",
    "This class is too fast-paced for beginning students, but I would recommend it to intermediate Greek students.",
    "Really great language course focusing mainly on the translation of books 1, 6, and 9 of The Odyssey.",
    "Highly recommended for someone who wants to get their foot in the door for atudying Homer.",
    "Overall, this course is very good, and I would recommend it. You will translate about 3 books from Homer's Odyssey and so leave with a solid exposure to Homeric Greek. There are regular quizzes which are rigorous and leave some students with just enough time to finish, as well as one short presentation and some homework assignments.If you are a stellar student or happen to gel well with the prof., all will be good, but she does have some particularities to her personality that can render the course difficult. She can be somewhat dismissive and demonstrate preference for certain students, so proceed with caution."
