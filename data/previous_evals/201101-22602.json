    "What this course is depends very much on who your PI is. If you have a good relationship with them and are going to be doing substantial research during the semester, you might as well take the intensive research course. The only difference from the regular one is the 20-hour requirement, but a lot of people spend that long in the lab in the regular course, too.",
