    "This is not my first time taking the EPC. Every semester has been a delight in its own ways, learning about such interesting topics.",
    "As an advanced student, I was not required to attend lecture so much of my knowledge gained was dependent on the client. Unfortunately, our client project was not as successful as prior EPC experiences, though this was in no way a reflection on the EPC course or instructors. In fact, both Lisa and Josh were fantastic in guiding us through a difficult process."

   "comments": [
    "Unfortunately, not well but not at all because of the course. It's a project based course, so the pitfall was in regard to the project and not the structure of the course. The project supervisor for the course was helpful and supportive, and the guest lectures I attended were excellent.",
    "Very well. The project description was a bit advanced for the actual work though. It was written by a staffperson in the client organization whose expertise was well-beyond that of our point person, and indeed the level at which the project would ultimately be conducted (due to the lack of a baseline assessment). However, we were able to find a middle ground that worked for everyone.",
    "It did not align with my expectations because the client turned out not to be clear on what they wanted because the project they used to apply already existed--it should have been approved to be part of the course package.",
    "Very well.",
    "Well, but as mentioned - the client project proved difficult to wrangle."

    "Strengths: Opportunities to work with clients on real projects, opportunity to work in a team, opportunity to become highly knowledgeable in a particular area. Weaknesses: Requiring students to attend all guest lectures, not accepting projects that involve heavy data collection or with a supervisory team in more than two countries",
    "There should be a deeper, more through evaluation of the projects.",
    "The only weakness is in how the lectures have at times very little (or absolutely nothing) to do with the project I was working on. This did make me disengage slightly.",
    "The success of the class is largely dependent on the client project to which you are assigned. I think the instructors do their best to vet projects, however, it might be helpful to better communicate what work needs to be done by the client in advance of the clinic. I feel like many of the clients sign up to have their project selected, but haven't done the requisite planning and groundwork to actually manage a clinical team or groundtruth the project's assumptions."
