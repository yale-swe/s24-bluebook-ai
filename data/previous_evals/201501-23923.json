    "If you want a lot of thankless work and silence-filled discussions but also a great-looking syllabus of readings: take this class.",
    "PLSC 419 Arab Revolts, Revolutions, and Reform was an excellent class to read about and debate and understand the most difficult and dynamic issues about the Middle East today.",
    "This course is a thought-provoking and interesting introduction to the Middle East and the Arab Spring. There is a lot of flexibility in the course to make it what you want.",
    "Take this if you can. It is a really interesting look into Arab uprisings and its causes. Lust present varying opinions really well and is in general a great professor.",
    "Great course! Manageable workload and interesting material. All very relevant to any modern-day study of MENA region \/ international politics and relations in general.",
    "MMES 419 was a great course overall. COURSE MATERIAL: Strengths: i. The best part of the course. There was a wide variety of material which started very well with big questions like the robustness of Middle East authoritarianism and moved forward to the main actions that happened during the revolution. There was then a move towards post-revolution activities. The commendable part was that we even discussed ISIS at the end, making the course end at something highly relevant and current. ii. Some material variety was welcome. The use of films Perspeolis and The Square in the middle of the course was a refreshing change and was an excellent decision. iii. A wide variety of famous, mainstream authors were chosen. Some of the authors such as Eva Bellin also recurred so we saw the development of their thought processes. Some were from professors at Yale e.g. Adria Lawrence Weaknesses: i. I emphasize above that the course had a good flow but this was only the case for the first three weeks or so. The syllabus and readings on the other hand were not structured well. The readings felt very disconnected by the fifth week. Some people in class claimed that they saw the connection\/flow but I really did not buy that. Too often, an article that belonged in Week 2 was added to Week 6 and there were futile attempts to connect the piece to Week 6s theme (more ahead) rather than Week 2s. ii. Serious lack of historiographic analysis or consideration of history. The course is ultra-modern, to the extent that it does not appreciate the crucial influence of history on the development of the modern Middle East e.g. major themes like Nasserism, the Iranian revolution, colonialism, Baathism. There are definitely people in the class who know these very well but there are people who have never read anything about them. And even if some people know about them, they need to be connected to study of the modern Middle East. History is not too crucial with Arab revolts in Egypt, Tunisia etc. but once we get to Syria, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain plus discussions of Islamist social movements, international involvement and terrorism, history becomes very important. iii. The course is not accessible to people new to the Middle East. I was not new to the Middle East so the class was fine for me. Im not sure if this is a weakness because the course does not claim to be accessible to everyone (it suggests some familiarity with the Middle East and statistics) I feel this should be emphasized more. I was actually very very familiar with the Middle East before the class but there were frequent instances when I couldn't understand discussions. INSTRUCTOR: Strengths: i. Professor Lust is very intelligent and knows how to lead a class discussion quite well. She can be very interactive. She speaks the right amount of time and lets the students speak for the right amount of time. She knows how to spur discussion, debate with her students very professionally and asks all the right questions. She helps us to visualize things sometimes as well. ii. Professor Lust is very accessible. She is always willing to meet up and talk about papers, ideas and problems. She travels a lot but still makes herself accessible through Skype if someone needs to contact her. iii. She puts in more effort into the course than I expected. She seems like a busy person yet she gave us comments on almost all of our weekly responses (500 word essays) and always returned them as printouts on time. She also put comments on our final paper drafts so we can have annotated feedback before we submit our final drafts. Weaknesses: i. Professor Lust expects her students to answer in particular ways and talk about particular things. She has very strong pre-conceived notions of what is right. She will be nice about them all the time but she is not very open to new perspectives and student hypotheses. She needs to question research literature more esp. statistically ungrounded research"
