   "comments": [
    "A really good class to take if you are looking to continue your study of Russian. Grading is fair, and it's easy to get into a routine with the nightly workbook assignments. It really helped me with feeling comfortable speaking Russian more. I would definitely recommend this class!",
    "It's a second level Russian course that develops more vocabulary and introduces new grammar structures while reviewing all the cases, nominative, accusative, genitive, dative, prepositional, and instrumental, in singular and plural form.",
    "Russian 130 was for me mostly review, but it was a much more deliberate (and much needed) approach to grammar than I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d had previously. I would definitely recommend Russian 130 to a student entering with a similar background to me because though the pace at times felt rather glacial, it did afford quality attention to the gritty details. I would recommend Russian in general to someone looking for a new language because it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s awesome.",
    "I would highly recommend Russian with Irina Dolgova to any student interested in the language, culture, or literature. Irina Andreevna is a superb teacher, and she makes learning Russian far less painful than other instructors I have had.",
    "Focus on lots of idiomatic topics is veg helpful. Lots of translation, which I enjoy less but with a language as complex as Russian maybe it's necessary. The teacher is very kind, helpful and enthusiastic.",
    "Very challenging - but worth it."
