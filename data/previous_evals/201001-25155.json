   "comments": [
    "This course offers a good overview of issues in countries following civil wars and conflict. Papers offer a chance to explore specific countries and topics in greater detail. This class is basically an Africa-class in disguise. Don't be fooled by the cross listing. If you want to learn more about Africa and conflict resolution this is a good class for you. I would recommend this class. Prof. Simon is a good teacher.",
    "Great course if you are interested in countries with a violent history. Although there are a lot of papers, they are very manageable and very open-ended. I would recommend this course for anybody interested in conflict, especially in Africa.",
    "Great class, but a lot of writing. Expect to be working hard on these papers, even if they seem straightforward at first. Definitely recommended, but only if the topic is of interest to you.",
    "I would recommend this class if you're interested in the material. If not, then you might get lost.",
    "This class mostly covers Africa and attempts at reaching peace in these countries. It is a really interesting way of considering nation building and figuring out how to deal with some of societies biggest problems after going through wars and periods of violence. It puts parts of history and modern events into a better context.",
    "This was a much easier class than I originally thought it would be...the reading (at least when I took it) wasn't required, which was GREAT. The papers (3 short and 1 long at the end) were all pretty self-explanatory and fairly graded, more or less. The lectures aren't the most exciting thing you've ever heard, but are solid, and the material itself is interesting. This was a great fifth class.",
    "It's ok to lean the background of conflict politics, but not that necessary. Take a class focused on certain types of conflicts, or on one in particular, instead",
    "Highly recommend this class. Professor Simon is absolutely great and the writing assignments are manageable and interesting to write. You will learn a lot about different parts of the world, and you will want to go to class.",
    "If you like the subject, you will learn some on this cutting edge topic. But if you don't like sort of rambling and long lectures, I don't recommend it.",
    "I would recommend this course to a fellow student. There is no need to come to lectures because the assignments do not pertain to the lectures at all. You do not have to read any of the books except for A Human Being Died that Night, which is short and a very good read anyway. The assignments are very interesting because it allowed me the liberty to research on a topic that I've always wanted to know more about but never got around to doing it. As far as the lectures go, they can get kind of boring, but Prof. Simon is great at covering the many theories pertaining to conflicts, which is good to know if you are interested in learning about this topic.",
    "The papers are a lot of fun because they're case studies, but the lecture is boring and unessential, as are the readings. I would only take it if you want a class where you don't have to show up to lecture and love researching\/writing on your own."
