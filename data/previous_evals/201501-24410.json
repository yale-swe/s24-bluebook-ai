    "I would recommend it if you want to improve your spanish grammar, but know it is a ton of work. Similar to AP Spanish.",
    "Very intense course. I took it credit\/D and it was still a lot because of all the homework. Would not recommend to fulfill the language requirement because there are easier options, but take it if you want to stay on top of your Spanish and learn some more in-depth grammar rules.",
    "Advanced Spanish Grammar is a course that covers familiar topics in Spanish, from ser\/estar to the subjunctive, yet goes in more depth and allows students to really explore their nuances. I felt that I was both challenged and rewarded, as my Spanish really improved throughout the course. Know that there is a significant amount of work, but since much of the work is graded on effort as opposed to completion, I felt that it was great practice for the exams, since it allowed me to make mistakes and learn from them. I enjoyed that class was a mix of listening and talking to classmates, which helped students gain conversational experience. I had Professor Seymour, who was an incredible kind and knowledgeable instructor!",
    "This is a great course. It is extremely well organized and gives you a great foundation for Spanish grammar. It is a lot of work, but the class is fun and the atmosphere is great. Professor Seymour is the sweetest and cares deeply about her students.",
    "SPAN 243 is a very grammar intensive course, as you can probably imagine. Because this is the case, though, by taking this course you will lose some conversational\/speaking skills since that's not what you're practicing every day. Even so, your grammar will get very good after taking this class.",
    "Advanced Spanish Grammar has a lot of homework that is all pretty similar, but the homework is very effective at drilling in grammar and is interesting enough. There is some room for creativity in the occasional writing assignments which are always fun, and we also read some interesting stories. For an L5 class, it is remarkably similar to a regular Spanish class of a lower level, but with a focus on the more nuanced grammatical rules that are necessary in the development of fluency. My speaking skills hardly improved during the course of the semester.",
    "You will have to devote many hours to completing the busy work for this class, but if you want to improve grammar it is very useful.",
    "Very straightforward, there's a couple grammar exercises or some writing for homework everyday and you go through a bunch of grammar concepts. Did improve my grammar a lot. Professor Seymour is great.",
    "Before enrolling, read the name of the course. This is a Spanish *grammar* class. If you want to improve your *grammar* and are willing to put in a lot of time doing *grammar* exercises to get there, sign on up. Know, though, that this involves a lot of busy work. Your grammar improves, definitely, but there's very little conversational practice, which is a shame. Class is pretty chill and reasonably enjoyable -- Professor Seymour is kind and helpful, and the class environment feels low stakes and exercise-oriented, not unlike a high school Spanish class. The homework, though, is a lot. Because I'd like to reach fluency in Spanish, I don't regret taking this class - it feels pretty foundational for people looking to become competent speakers. But it's time-consuming and not especially inspiring, and so if youre not looking to continue your Spanish after the completion of this course (either abroad or in another class), it may not be worth your time."
