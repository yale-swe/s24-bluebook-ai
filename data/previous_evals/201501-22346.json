    "I think that the primary strength of this class was as a music appreciation class - Professor Plantinga wants his students to enjoy the music selections. The connections between music and philosophy isn't always very clear. This class is more of a lecture than a seminar, but has a lot of readings - some interesting, some fairly dry\/complicated.",
    "A great class! You will get to listen to wonderful music and talk about it. There is one term paper and you can choose any topic that interests you. Prof. Plantinga is one of the best in his field and super helpful."
