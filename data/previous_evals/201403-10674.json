    "Strongly recommend.",
    "I would summarize this class as a fitting companion seminar class to CBIO 602, and would recommend it to anyone in 602 who would benefit from a deeper understanding of the experiments and thought processes related to 603 topics.",
    "I would recommend 603 to another student who is interested in cell biology and would like to have additional motivation to read cell biology papers. The workload is appropriate.",
    "Very good accompaniment to 602.",
    "It is a good course which helps students get to know various fields in Cell biology. I would recommend this course to other people. Also, during the discussion we can learn some good ideas from other people. The course is a good training for graduate students to develop the capability of critical thinking."

   "comments": [
    "It helped me to think through what experiments could be done to test various aspects of cell biology and why certain experiments or analytical techniques are appropriate for answering a particular scientific question. Professors also volunteered helpful advice about graduate school or the scientific process in general, aiding in my overall understanding of my role as a graduate student and the thought processes and tools which I should employ while a student at Yale. In both CBIO 602 and 603, professors also provided history of important scientific discoveries made or analytical techniques developed at Yale specifically. This has prepared me to be a worthwhile contributor at this Ivy League institution; having learned what biological advances have taken place already in the Elm City, I am now better equipped to both tell them to others and make my own discoveries.",
    "This course improved my reading of primary literature and gave me additional insight into topics in cell biology. I think my future research will be informed by the approaches that I learned from reading the papers for this course.",
    "Learned to critically analyze papers, which is an important skill. Discussions were usually interesting and effective.",
    "It is a good course which helps students get to know various fields in Cell biology. The course is a good training for graduate students to develop the capability of critical thinking."
