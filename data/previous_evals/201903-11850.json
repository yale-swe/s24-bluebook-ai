   "comments": [
    "I became much more confident in my Spanish-speaking and writing abilities.",
    "My knowledge of Spanish, especially my ability to speak and write the language, was enhanced by this course. I feel very comfortable carrying out conversations and expressing myself in the Spanish language than before. I very much appreciated the small seminar-like nature of the course and the ability for us to have conversations with one another about interesting topics.",
    "I definitely learned how to speak Spanish really well, but be aware that this class is very rigorous and demands a lot of time and energy. I learned how to communicate much better in Spanish, as well as read and write with greater speed and comfort. However, I often felt as though every word I was saying was under evaluation - the class focuses less on building confidence in aspiring language students and more on criticism and negative feedback.",
    "Better Spanish skills, especially in speaking and writing"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "There was a lot of work for the course, and, at times, it could be extremely overwhelming. But I think part of the strength of this course is that it really immersed you in Spanish and forced you to understand what was happening.",
    "Strengths: size (small and intimate), and the topics discussed throughout the course are quite interesting. Weaknesses: there is SO MUCH work in this class (kind of an overwhelming amount) and not all of it is necessarily helpful in building the skills that this course seeks to strengthen; this is probably one of the most work-intensive courses I've taken at Yale, which is saying a lot",
    "The course does not really encourage a love for the Spanish language as much as it demands constant work and effort. The sheer volume of assignments and responsibilities makes learning a new language less of an exciting an opportunity and more of a daily burden. In a single weekend, I once had a 300-word essay, an 8-minute recording, grammar exercises, new vocab to review, and a Spanish midterm that week. That is simply unreasonable and encourages burnout rather than genuine engagement with Spanish culture, literature, and language.",
    "Strengths: a lot of practice and a lot of grades throughout the semester Weakness: Too much work on a nightly basis which meant that I couldn't devote enough time to each assignment to get everything out of it that I wanted to.",
    "The strengths in this course are that the work spans across all skill levels including writing, reading, speaking, and listening so our abilities improve evenly. There are many elements incorporated such as movies, short stories, songs, and debates that make sure the class is never boring. However, the workload is sometimes unmanageable especially considering this is a MWF class as opposed to every day."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Yes, if a student is looking to improve their Spanish, I would definitely recommend taking this course.",
    "This course is only 1 credit, but it's basically like a 1.5 credit class just because of the workload, so I would recommend this course to another student who really wants to and\/or has the time and effort to improve their Spanish language skills. However, I would not recommend this course to people who are planning to take 5 credits or aren't that into learning Spanish as a language. I'd say in general that the course does a good job of reviewing a lot of grammatical content while simultaneously exploring modern day issues that are relevant to Spanish-speaking communities but there is a really large workload, with basically one graded assignment every class.",
    "Probably not. I think language should be an opportunity to experience and immerse oneself in another culture, and this course focuses more on academic rigor than on that alternative goal. Learning a new language should be an adventure and treating language study as solely rooted in grammar tables and essays makes it hard to develop a passion and a love for Spanish.",
    "If you are capable of taking on a large workload (readings\/homework every day along with quizzes, oral responses, forums, debates, papers etc. every week), then I very much recommend the class as you definitely understand your weaknesses and improve on them."
