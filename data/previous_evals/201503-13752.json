    "Take it if you need a low-work EENG elective",
    "Internet Engineering was very easy, albeit unorganized.",
    "If you're at all interested in how the Internet works, this class covers some good material. Leandros is very helpful and clearly an expert in his field, although lectures can be a bit dry at times. It starts out a bit slow, but I found that the in-class labs which began a few weeks in really helped me get a stronger grasp of the material. My advice to students taking this course would be to make sure to keep clear in your head which level of Internet architecture each lecture is detailing, since several have similar characteristics and it can be easy to get confused. The midterm (no final exam) was thankfully open-note - Leandros let us read from both our own notes from class and the lecture slides, so we were allowed to use our computers, as long as we weren't connected to the Internet. The final project is interesting and not too difficult, but be sure to actually start early, since you'll need to set up an NITlab account, get a \"slice,\" and reserve nodes outside of class time, which can take a few days with troubleshooting taken into account. Another advantage to this course is the small class size - with only about ten students, we were able to set up a \"support network\" (read: fb chat group) for lab troubleshooting, etc.",
    "Take it if you need a credit. The material is FASCINATING (to me at least, I'm an internet nerd) but you could just go on Wikipedia and learn everything in a week. Psets are busywork. Labs are fun.",
    "This was a good survey of the full internet stack. The labs are in-class and low pressure, but illustrate how the network system works clearly. It involves working with actual linux computer nodes in a distributed cluster in Greece, which is very neat to work with. You definitely should have an EE + maths background before applying though.",
    "This course provided a great look into network protocols and their implementation. In particular, it was presented in such a way that no extensive prior knowledge of protocols or internet topology was needed but by the end I felt as though I had a fairly comprehensive knowledge of these topics. I would highly recommend this class to anyone at least tangentially interested in learning about the structure and function of internet technologies."
