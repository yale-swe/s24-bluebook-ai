    "This course helped me think critically about historiography and the terminology we use in describing social processes. It made me a better thinker.",
    "I have developed an extremely critical eye towards anthropological work. I have also learned how to contextualize social movements in history. This class was very challenging in the best way for me.",
    "The politics of race and ethnicity in Latin America, anthropological debates, nationalism and the role of Afro descendants and indigenous peoples in nation building.",
    "The course was heavy on the theory, which I appreciated learning but for which I lacked some background. I appreciated learning about systems of knowledge, and the course helped me narrow down potential senior theses. Professor Echeverri is extremely dedicated and happy to discuss any and all related topics with you.",
    "An amazing critical appreciation for knowledge production on and histories of race and ethnicity in Latin America. Very creative list of assignments varied in nature, such as book reports, research projects, and debates.",
    "I gained insight into the nuances behind ethnicity and race in Latin America. I didn't have any previous experience with anthropology, but this course definitely allowed me to gain insight into different anthroplogical frameworks that one can use to study indigenous communities."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This course should be open to all undergraduates and not just juniors.",
    "I was extremely impressed by the structure of this course. Marcela gave the students a lot of power to lead the discussions while keeping us on topic. I liked the reading responses, the paper, and the presentation. Overall great curriculum.",
    "There is a lot of reading for this course, and almost no way every student could do every reading for each week's class.",
    "The course fosters great discussion and the content is absolutely fascinating. It's incredibly important stuff, toosome of the most marginalized voices are centered in the class. The reading can be really heavy if only because of its dependence on a background knowledge of theory that many in the class lacked, so sometimes there was a sense of not knowing exactly what was going on in the conversation. But, when we did know what was going on, it was truly fantastic.",
    "One of the greatest strengths is that all the material is extremely interesting, but this is often weighed down by an overwhelming amount of work. At times it is difficult to get as much out of the class as desired due to such an ambitious workload.",
    "Excellent course! Beautifully designed syllabus that built on itself with each week.",
    "I believe that both a strength and a weakness of the course was the sheer number of countries that we studied. Through the readings and in class discussions, we were able to draw links between different trends across historical time periods. I do think that at certain times, it was a bit difficult to keep straight what was specifically occurring in each country, as our focus changed week by week. It was definitely clear that Professor Munoz wanted to build a foundation for us to study the politics of knowledge week by week which was definitely helpful by the end of the course. Along the way, however, it didn't always feel as clear what exactly it was we were working towards."

   "comments": [
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to any student interested in the roles of race, ethnicity and knowledge in nation building projects. The material and readings were all very interesting and rewarding.",
    "I would highly recommend this course. Professor Echeverri is brilliant and very kind, and the course challenges to think critically about formations of ethnicity. The readings are difficult, but the class is well worth it.",
    "Yes. You will love Marcela. Take this class if you are interested in the intersection of anthropology and history. Will be challenging but is very thought-provoking and worthwhile. I was often frustrated by how much it was making me reconsider my own worldview, but it was ultimately for the best. An inspiring class.",
    "This course had a huge anthropological focus, so I would mostly recommend it to students who are very interested in anthropology.",
    "Yes! It's valuable knowledge that everyone at Yale should know at least a little bit abouthistories of oppression, systems of knowledge and how they relate to building power, and so on. Important if you want to understand how the world works!!",
    "I would recommend it for the material and fascinating subject of the class, though only if the student has the time and energy to put into it.",
    "Without a doubt!",
    "I would highly recommend this course to any other student at Yale. For anyone interested in studying Latin America, this course will provide a variety of different theoretical frameworks for studying the region from social movement theory, ethnicity\/race, indigeneity, human rights, and more. Definitely expect to leave the course with more questions than answers, but also a better sense of the complexity of different issues surrounding race, indigenous rights, constructions of history, and beyond. I do think that this is the type of course it might've been helpful to have had taken at least one other course on Latin America beforehand, but I do feel that I've been able to engage with the material even as someone who didn't necessarily have a strong background."
