   "comments": [
    "A great class that isn't obnoxiously difficult, but is just enough work to ensure that you actually learn the material and can make educated statements about development and democracy in Africa. Professor Carlson is great, and the class conversations are always interesting. I would definitely recommend this class to another student.",
    "It's a very literature-focused survey of the basic problems surrounding development and democracy in Africa. The reading is a must, but is overall manageable. Class discussion was the highlight of the course; I always came away feeling like I'd really gotten something out of it. The assignments, however, are frustrating and sometimes unclear. Overall, I would recommend it, but make sure to figure out exactly what the professor is expecting before starting assignments.",
    "Definitely :)",
    "I would definitely recommend this to a student interested in Africa or development or democracy, this is definitely the class for you. There could be no better introduction. No prior knowledge necessary.",
    "I would recommend this class to anybody interested in Africa and development. It helps if you have some economics background (knowing how regressions work, etc) but I don't think it's necessary. Professor Carlson is a wonderful professor and the topics each week have interesting readings and yield great in class discussions.",
    "I would recommend PLSC 414 because I thought the reading was enjoyable and the format of the class is good - the reading responses are not too demanding but are very helpful when writing the final paper",
    "A survey of the major developmental issues in Africa, with opportunities for the students to understand flaws and questions in the research. Final assignment allows the student to synthesize everything learned to tackle a developmental issue from all angles.",
    "Take the course. Helps you analyze a lot of the issues impairing development in Africa such as health care, corruption etc"
