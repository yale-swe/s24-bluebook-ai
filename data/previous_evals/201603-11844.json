    "This course is one of the best I've ever taken at Yale. It was by far the most liberating course. You learn about very important aspects of life, yourself, your body, story-telling, and embodying story. You don't have to be a dancer for this class to change your life for the better.",
    "Bodily organization for clear movement; transposition of communication into several different modes; self-knowledge, both physical and intellectual; interdisciplinary approach to story telling.",
    "In this class, learning was through an embodied experience. I grew in my ability to understand my body and the space I inhabit while also learning dance history and technique.",
    "Balance, harmony, story telling technique",
    "I learned so much in this class about my own body, about the power of the body, and the importance of knowing yourself in being successful. Maybe that sounds cheesy, but it is completely true."

    "The strengths were Ms Renee Robinson and her way of teaching. The way she organized the semester and every class with the readings and topics of discussion were very helpful. The activities we did and the topics for each week facilitated a strong momentum for the course that built us up to be prepared for our final performance really well. I've never had a professor who is so engaging and who teaches in such a straight forward and accessible way. She really cared about what each student had to bring to the table from their previous studies, and tapped into each and everyone of our interests. I had the most fun and the best after leaving classes where we really danced and moved together. I also think the mid-term paper was a great exercise to reflect on what we'd done in the course so far in order to move forward and keep allowing things to sink in deep. The only places for improvement are in the assignments. It was confusing to get assignments on Canvas from an anonymous TF that we never met, and she often posted reading or writing assignments with too short notice (one or two days). It would have been more helpful to get our papers back with direct feedback so that we could improve and know what Ms. Renee Robinson was looking for in the assignments, or individual notes if the papers weren't graded yet. It was also difficult to complete an assignment when the instructions and due date were ambiguous. It would have been ideal to both talk about them in class and to have a written prompt with a set due date and hand-in instructions. Students often aren't looking to the syllabus, but directly to the professor for information on assignments. There were just a few snags and confusion with assignments that I went into a lot of detail with, but that was really only a small aspect of the course. Overall, it was an incredible experience that felt to be planned and executed in the best way possible for our individual and collective learning and growth. The strengths BY FAR outweighed any weaknesses.",
    "I wish this class had met every day for two hour - it functioned both as a dance technique class and as a seminar and it is incredibly difficult to fit both those elements into two class meetings a week, especially because dance technique is best learned, like most physical practices, through repetition. If we had had floor barre five days a week...or had some days be just technique and some more discussion based? I also feel that discussion between students in the class was relegated largely to an online platform which wasn't really focused on - maybe more emphasis, not necessarily in class itself, on discussion would help students learn from each others' experiences with the floor barre as it landed in their individual bodies. For example, I would have loved to have heard more students read their writings about Revelations!",
    "The strength of this course is in its space to be an individual and to bring in all of ourselves to the classroom space.",
    "It was amazing. I loved especially all of the visitors and the trip to see Ailey in NYC. PLEASE offer it again!"

    "I would recommend this course to anyone who is looking for the tools to get more in touch with their center and their body. It was an incredible course and Ms Renee Robinson is a legend. It was an honor to get to see and work with her twice a week. She brings in amazing guests some weeks, and her methods of teaching are so accessible and inclusive of all of her students (dance background or not). You definitely learn a lot about yourself and a lot about the intense work that goes into creating a dance. Every class begins with Zena Rommett's Floor Barre. Floor Barre is life-changing and I think many of the students will continue to practice it after the course is over. The knowledge and experiences we gained over the semester were invaluable.",
    "Everybody needs this class. You learn to think with your body, you learn to listen to your body, and you get to spend time with Renee Robinson and her endless wisdom and unbelievable insight into both the body and what it means to be human. You leave class every day feeling physically, intellectually, and emotionally more spacious, bolstered by Ms. Renee's ability to find the beauty and the story in everything, by her insistence on you being good and enough in this world, and by her emphasis on challenging yourself and taking risks on personal growth - \"what's the worst that can happen? Greatness.\" PS I think the 'intellectual challenge' thing is unfair for a course like this, because your body is what is challenged 'intellectually' and we don't have language for that kind of intelligence. We had a lot of writing assignments and readings, but what was really challenging (and it was REALLY challenging) about this course was not that kind of workload, but integrating traditional academic modes of learning into studio practice - trying to understand what Ms. Renee was teaching our bodies in the context of these other more familiar things.",
    "I would recommend this course to just about everyone, especially people who are afraid of dancing or have felt uncomfortable in their bodies. This experience was not only highly personal but also healing in more than one way.",
    "Yes!",
    "If it is offered again, TAKE IT!!!!! This class enriched my perspective on life. Renee is the most elegant and compassionate woman, and she has so much beautiful knowledge to share. Any moment in her presence was a blessing. She helped me view the human body and soul in a different light. One of the best classes I have taken at Yale, hands down."
