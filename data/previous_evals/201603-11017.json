   "comments": [
    "I learned about a whole field of history with which I was previously unfamiliar. The course covered a huge span of time, so there were many lessons to be learned.",
    "I knew very little about American Indian history going in, so I learned a lot about the different ways that contact with settlers occurred. I learned a lot about the relationship of the federal government to American Indians and about the modern challenges and successes of Native people. Finally, I feel like I gained insight about many of the stereotypes of Native people that exist.",
    "This course was an incredibly thought-provoking and engaging class on the history of Native Americans from their perspective, objectively examining the events and cultural shifts that impacted, in some shape or form, each of the more than 500 Native American tribes and nations in this country.",
    "I obtained a broad background in the major turning points of Native American history, as expected. I didn't learn many new skills but I now have enough background information to pursue further my interest in the American West.",
    "Appreciation of the history of Native America and improved writing skills.",
    "I learned a huge amount about the history of American Indian people.",
    "I learned so much about Native American History, which was really important since I had learned barely anything about it in lower and high school. Not only did I learn facts, but I also learned how to talk about Native American law and history.",
    "The correlation between history and treatment of Indians vs now and how similar it actually is.",
    "I consider myself someone who is very knowledgeable about US history, but this course added an incredibly important and almost totally neglected element to the conventional history narrative. The course traces American Indian history from pre-Columbus to the present. I learned the most from the guest speaker on teaching American Indian history in schools and the lecture on Marshalls legal cases. The first half offers a very important lens into American Indian relations with Euro-Americans, reflecting both the horrific consequences as well as how American Indians resisted and adapted.",
    "Very interesting course! Extremely comprehensive coverage of the evolution of American Indians in North America.",
    "great insights in the historiography of this hisotry",
    "I feel like I gained a new appreciation of and perspective on the historical struggles of Native Americans.",
    "I learned a lot about Native history and Native law in particular.",
    "I learned how to study the past and present simultaneously, connecting themes and investigating causation.",
    "A new way of looking at history that typically isn't taught even at the level of higher education.",
    "I learned about a fairly unheard of subject within history. I knew almost nothing about the subject beforehand, and now fee like I know a good amount about history of native America",
    "American Indian History is a fantastic introduction to the indigenous history of the United States. It's an excellent re-telling of US history, with a focus on indigenous sovereignty over time.",
    "I learned about the history of many natives and not just my own. I learned about contemporary history of natives and the varying perspectives of authors like Sherman Alexie and Louise Erdrich.",
    "This course is amazing if you want to learn about Native American History. I feel like I gained so much knowledge about American history from a completely different perspective. The course was also useful for understanding contemporary Native American issues.",
    "You will get a deeper understanding of the main trends, policies, and factors that have affected the Native American community throughout history. You will especially realize the importance of sovereignty, economic, and education policy as influences of Native American life.",
    "Knowledge: history of American Indians from all around the continent, from pre-Columbian Era to modern times. Skills: historical writing. Insights: subject matter is approached with a great deal of, well, love. And that's amazing.",
    "I developed a much more comprehensive knowledge of the diversity of Native American history, as well as a better understanding of the variety of forces shaping white-Indian relations.",
    "I learned a TON about native history of America. I took the course Cred\/D fail and honestly was not that engaged, so my comments are colored by that.",
    "I learned about the often understated or ignored impact of Native Americans upon US History along with current issues in Native communities including Indian Law.",
    "I was given the opportunity to learn about an entire part of history that was not taught in-depth at any level of my previous schooling. I learned about a new perspective of this country and the beautiful cultures, and what they have had to endure, of Native American tribes.",
    "Learned about Native American history and contemporary issues.",
    "I learned to be a better listener.",
    "I gained a general knowledge of Native American history from this course.",
    "I learned a huge amount about the involvement of American Indians in the history of the United States, in terms of both political development as well as social dynamics that continue to affect us today. We also explored the historical perspectives on this involvement and how they reflect the views and agendas of their authors and their times.",
    "I learned that, contrary to my time in high school, I actually really enjoy history, and can use history to further my success moving forward in life. I also learned how to prepare for major papers and tests through my fantastic Teaching Fellow, Justin Brooks.",
    "I learned about a lot of history that I was never exposed to, but is very important to me as an individual with Native heritage.",
    "This course really helped me develop my writing and comprehension skills.",
    "This was a very important history course that works to counter the typical early American history that we are brought up learning. I appreciated the historical tools I was taught to take a new approach to history, using perhaps less traditional sources.",
    "Whatever 'knowledge' of American history I had before taking this course was skewed, because I had no knowledge of American Indians. This survey course gave me enough knowledge about America's indigenous history to learn about other aspects of the country's history in a more truthful way. For example, one of the first truths we established was that Columbus did not 'find' an undiscovered land; he conquered a land that was already full of complex societies. These simple statements have been skewed by lower-level historical education, and this course set the record straight, and opened my eyes to contemporary indigenous challenges and issues.",
    "In addition to learning deeply about a subject I hadn't really encountered before, I gained the ability to interrogate popular historical and cultural narratives in order to find more nuanced truths. The class readings especially excelled at offering me a clearer picture of American Indian history than I ever could've hoped to receive in a general American history course in either high school or college.",
    "I learned a history that I've never been taught, a history that every student in the U.S. should have to learn about.",
    "Intro to American Indian History was an incredible overview of a history not often taught in classes. I really appreciated the opportunity to learn about different tribes and loved the readings for the class which provided me with a great understanding of the history of Native Americans.",
    "I learned: - That, before this class, I had never thought of the US as a \"multipolar\" place, where there were several empires vying for supremacy, where Britain's pervasiveness was never a foregone conclusion - The concepts of \"the middle ground\" and the \"undetermined encounter,\" or the idea that protagonists in our history --for example Sioux warriors and white settlers -- don't always fall into predictable patterns of the helplessly oppressed and the unmatched aggressor - Regarding writing: How to be unmistakably clear in the \"doers\" in my sentences, sweating the difference between white settlers, white colonists, white military members etc. - Regarding writing: I tend to reach for idioms to warm up my writing, and Naomi encouraged me to resist this temptation and to go for clarity and specificity instead - Regarding reading: Justin taught me that, in order to get through all of my reading, I can't think of homework time as story time. To read effectively, I have to ask myself, \"What is the essential question\/problem this author is setting up? What is their response? How have they substantiated this response? How did they interpret the evidence in front of them?\""

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: breadth of time and geography, incorporation of guest lecturers, assignment structure and variety Weaknesses: lectures were often difficult to follow, would have been helpful to access slides or an outline for the course online",
    "This course has interesting readings and covers a lot of history. I really liked the structure of the class, with the first half being largely history leading into a midterm, and the second half being more about modern American Indians. However, I also found this class quite boring. Professor Blackhawk is an extremely dry lecturer who is frequently very confusing in his wording of things. Also, there was so little connection between reading materials and lecture that they almost felt irrelevant to each other. Some weeks, the quantity of reading was unmanageable.",
    "The course was strong in that the material was fascinating and taught by a Native American professor who is an expert in the field. It is also very thorough and provided a lens of history that is not offered in most high schools. I will say that one weakness is that the lectures and the readings felt disjointed at times; what we learned about in section had almost nothing to do with what was said in lecture.",
    "The readings, for the most part, were engaging and enjoyable to read. Some, like the Merrell book, were dense and difficult to follow, but others, like the two which we wrote about at the end of the semester, were a perfect way to cap the course. Lectures were difficult to stay engaged with and, because the lecture slides are so sparse, one really must attend them to get the information presented.",
    "The biggest weakness is the course content - one of the final comparative books was centred on a rape account, and whilst it is of course important to understand how different societies suffered, the theme of rape can be exceptionally distressing to young female readers. Rape is not a theme that solely affects one ethnicity or group of society, and all young women, and even men, are at risk of it. Reading about the theme can therefore be extremely upsetting. The course should definitely have warned students about the content of the books in the syllabus. The strength was the enthusiasm of Professor Blackhawk and the amount of information that he managed to cover.",
    "The lecture is kind of boring even though Prof. Blackhawk is obviously brilliant.",
    "This course's strengths are that it provides a basic understanding of Native American history -- essential for many students as elementary and high schools rarely give this history the focus it deserves. So the content is a strength, as is Prof. Blackhawk's instruction. His lecture style takes a little getting used to - at first it can be hard to determine what he's saying is important to focus on, but after a few weeks, understanding his lectures comes more naturally and you begin to understand the nuances and humor of his lecture style. The readings in this class represent both a strength and a weakness -- some of the readings were incredible and taught me so much (i.e. The Round House, Custer Died for Your Sins), but some of them felt very removed from lecture material and were hard to get through (i.e. Aloha Betrayed).",
    "For me, the first half was the strongestBlackhawk does a great job of seamlessly adding the lens of American Indian history into the typical narrative of American history. I absolutely enjoyed the readings for this course and felt they fit very well with the material we were learning. The midterm was very fair as well. Blackhawk is not the most engaging lecturer (though I bet he is a great seminar instructor) For me, the second halfthe American Studies partfell flat, it lacked a structure or focus and didnt really convey a lot of information. Without a test to prepare for or key words to guide lectures, I felt like I honestly did not learn that much overall. While I really enjoyed the final paper reading, for me, the essay question options were not the best formulated.",
    "The instructor (Prof. Blackhawk) would sometimes speak too quietly and it was hard to understand -- maybe turn up the volume on the microphone. Otherwise great!",
    "lectures were not engaging",
    "I thought that at times the lecture was a bit hard to follow, and it would be nice if there was some sort of reference available outside of just notes taken in the lecture to refer back to for the midterm.",
    "It covered a lot of material and sometimes felt a little scattered but Prof. Blackhawk is incredibly knowledgeable so usually the info was interesting enough to make up for this.",
    "This course could be improved with more organized lecture slides containing bullet points of main ideas.",
    "Lectures droned on and often traveled in circles. While they ended up arriving at the desired conclusions, I often felt myself drift off until I had no idea what was happening. Also, the course exam's ID section required more information than was actually taught.",
    "I enjoyed how the class transitioned from focusing on history and policies, laws, wars, etc. to focusing on present Native American history, culture and life. I loved when we learned about education, the arts, literature, etc. This is how I found my specific niche in American Indian History which was exactly what I was looking for and wanted to learn about. Sometimes the lectures can be dry and Professor Blackhawk almost seems somewhat apathetic at times, but I know he's a nice guy who really cares and I really enjoyed that.",
    "Courses were well prepared but sometimes felt like listening to a well written essay. Interesting and insightful but sometimes hard to follow.",
    "The content and readings of the class are very strong. The readings are mostly secondary sources, with two excellent novels as the final assignments. Weakness is that Professor Blackhawk's lectures are not very well organized and can be scattered, pros are the opportunity to talk about such important content!",
    "The lecture can be hard to engage with even though the content is great.",
    "Because the final paper is focused on two books, it makes the lectures after the midterm less important to your grade. Obviously important to the sake of learning, but you'll only need that information for section.",
    "While the material is extremely interesting, lecture can be a bit dry and difficult to follow. The readings were also a mixed bag. They started out a bit boring, but some of the books we read at the end of the semester were amazing.",
    "I really enjoyed the final paper and the freedom that students had in choosing what to cover. Also, the attention to detail when looking at specific government action in education and tribal economies was great, and made the class more engaging. At times, Professor Blackhawk would go on tangents that were hard to completely follow, and he sometimes was hard to hear through the microphone maybe more of a technology issue. I also felt we could have focused more on social ills on reservations and current movements to better conditions in Native communities. There seemed to be too much of an aversion to analyzing negative aspects of Native life. Lastly, I would have enjoyed a more thorough evaluation of law\/sovereignty law.",
    "Strengths: Prof Blackhawk is not the most dynamic lecturer but is an absolutely great guy, doing some amazing work. Full coverage of Pre-Columbian times to modern times is great, and geographic representation is pretty good too. Awesome TAs and guest lecturers, and overall the subject matter is treated with a great deal of respect and care, which is necessary and wonderful. Weaknesses: Sections did a great job with prep for papers but neither lecture nor section really prepared for the midterm exam...I had been attending lecture consistently and taking good notes and still struggled massively with the giant list of IDs we were given right before the exam.",
    "The overall shape of the course is really well structured, starting with Precolumbian life and ending with the Native American Renaissance. However, the quality of lectures definitely varies. I'm glad I took the course, but it was sometimes hard to tell what was most important.",
    "If prof Blackhawk could project his voice more, it would help!!",
    "The class examines a lot of interesting material; however, I had a bit of trouble understanding the professor. One way to remedy this would be to include more of the material on the lecture slides.",
    "Lectures were slow and disjointed. They could be improved with more coherence and pace.",
    "It's a fun, interesting survey course for sure; the material is engaging, and the readings were especially cool. Sometimes the material was also a little disorganized, though, and I found it difficult to understand any historical narratives or chains of cause and affect; I more of saw groups of loosely connected events.",
    "I feel very guilty saying this, because the material itself was very interesting, but I often got bored and lost focus during lecture. Even when I could focus, I often felt confused about what specific thematic elements or events were being talked about, as the lectures were sometimes frustratingly vague and difficult to follow. That said, I highly enjoyed the assigned readings and thought that the papers were interesting and helpful to my understanding of the course material.",
    "I thought the lectures were very interesting, but I think a lot of what you can take away from this course is dependent on who your TA is, and in the future, this issue should be addressed.",
    "The lectures felt unfocused at times, particularly in the second half of the semester. While all the material was interesting and important, I would have appreciated a better understanding of the arc of the course.",
    "Proffesor Blackhawk tends to drone on, and makes it hard to understand what he wants us to know. Justin Brooks was the only reason for my engagement in the course material.",
    "The strength of the course lies in the material, but it was not delivered to students in an effective way. Lectures were often not helpful, and the readings were frequently too dry and not engaging. The inclusion of two novels at the end of the semester felt very disjointed.",
    "I really liked this course, but it was at times a little hard to gain all the knowledge Professor Blackhawk expected us to learn. He spoke about lots of history, but jumped around and left holes in between areas\/topics.",
    "This course will teach you a lot of interesting and important information. I came into the class thinking I would have very little interest in Native American history (I needed a WR credit), but I ended up finding the material very interesting and it was stuff that I had known very little about previously. The reading list is also quite good. Although I only read a couple of the books in full, I read all the articles\/book excerpts, and they were consistently very interesting. The biggest drawback of this course is Ned Blackhawk himself. His lectures are pretty disorganized, and his lecturing style is very difficult to follow. As the semester goes on, you do start to get used to it, and his lectures improve as you get towards his specialties in more contemporary history, but it can still be pretty difficult to force yourself to sit through these lectures.",
    "Professor Blackhawk's lecture style is very difficult to follow, and the course readings do not coincide with the lecture.",
    "Professor Blackhawk has a great personality and is fun to listen to! He does have a tendency to mumble which can make it difficult to follow the lecture. Also, I heard last year they went to see Mary Kathryn Nagel's Play, and was disappointed we didn't have a similar cultural experience this semester. Would have been cool to take some sort of trip to a work of art, theater, or even look critically at a museum exhibit.",
    "This course has a great goal and message. I would appreciate a little more direction at the beginning of the course in lecture and in section. For the first few weeks, I really wasn't sure where we were headed or what the purpose of the course as a whole would be.",
    "For the most part, the course sailed a clear path through Native history from Columbus to the present. My grasp on topics relating to legal and jurisdictional issues remains tenuous, however, despite having a great TA from the law school. Covering the exact workings of the field of American Indian law with a bit more clarity would go a long way in improving the course.",
    "The class is taught by an expert, but more importantly by a Native expert. This is it's main strength. The lecture format should be revised, it was very interesting but often redundant. Also the technological issue with the microphone and the speakers made some lectures impossible to hear.",
    "I felt like at first the course was very \"to the book\", and then completely changed and got incredibly analytical at the end",
    "The course offers a chance for students to learn American Indian history, a history not taught often in classes. Professor Blackhawk has incredible insights and a great sense of humor, and while he speaks quietly in lecture he is such a great teacher. The readings were interesting, sections were great, and the work was interesting.",
    "Lectures feel like the professor is just reading off his notes. And the lecture slides don't have much information so it makes it hard to study for the midterm. However overall the material presented is very fascinating and was stuff I never learned in high school.",
    "Strengths: - Completely essential history that often gets omitted or misconstrued. Mere exposure to these readings and to this narrative is paradigm-shifting in and of itself - Guest speakers (like the founder of \"The Ways\") Weaknesses: - Although Blackhawk's humor leavened his lectures by the end of the semester, he was not the most captivating lecturer. I wish that I had felt like he had designed his lectures for our sake, that he tried to make it as comprehensive and comprehensible as possible. I think he could achieve this by writing an outline of the lecture on the first slide as opposed to disparate terms, and I wish he had paused at certain moments in lecture to summarize where we had been and where we were going . Also, I wish that Blackhawk had called on the TFs (specifically Justin) to share their strategies for taking notes in lecture at the beginning of the semester because they were model students."

   "comments": [
    "Take this course if you have any interest in history. It is well-taught and will change the way you see many topics in American history.",
    "I'd recommend only if you are willing to make it through some pretty boring lectures. The reading material is interesting if you're someone who will actually do the reading, but the lectures are simultaneously very dry and very difficult to understand. This is kind of a gut (or at least people treat it as such).",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. I enjoyed it thoroughly.",
    "For someone with an interest in the material, yes. For someone just taking it to fulfill a certain distributional requirement, no.",
    "This is a fine course if you have an interest in Native American history. I would take it if you are more interested in the current-day challenges rather than the actual history, because the class is definitely more focused on the modern-day.",
    "Yes, I loved the reading and my section!",
    "I would recommend this class on the basis that it's really important for everyone to have a basic understanding of Native American history, especially because most lower\/high schools don't give it the focus it deserves. I think this class solves that problem. On the other hand, it's not the most engaging class -- while lecture was interesting, I didn't absolutely love it. It's definitely a pretty easy class with important course material and relatively good readings (with some gems scattered throughout, like The Round House). If you feel like you're lacking basic knowledge of Native American history, take this class - you won't really lose anything for it, although it won't be the most mind-blowingly good class you'll ever take, either.",
    "Yes, interesting with a pretty manageable work load.",
    "Yes, this course profoundly changed how I view American history. This course provides one fo the most clearest answers to the question abut why one should care about history and hwo history relates to the present. If you come to lecture, study for the midterm and come to lecture, you can easily do well. More so than most other history professors, Blackhawks method of assessment is very kindhe gives you several options for midterm essay questions so you can prepare, you have the key terms as well from lecture. If you dont do well, it is really purely your fault.",
    "Yes -- very interesting!",
    "take it for a less than average workload but not too light gut.",
    "This is a great easy writing credit, but please don't treat it like that. If you take the time to do all of the readings, you'll gain a lot of perspective on Native American history and culture, which doesn't get a lot of scholarly attention.",
    "Take this class! Not super difficult, though the essay prompts can be kind of vague. The readings are great!",
    "If you are interested in the subject, you will find this course interesting! There are some lectures that are less interesting than others, but Professor Blackhawk does a great job trying to incorporate different mediums to facilitate learning and approach different topics, which keeps the class fresh and relevant. Super interesting to learn lots of new things!",
    "Always. The subject matter is something that people will not learn unless they actively engage with it. And this is one of the top educators in the field of American Indian History, so there's no one else better to learn from.",
    "This class was very interesting and did not require too much work. The lectures were interesting, the lecturer was funny but a bit monotone. Great class.",
    "I would recommend this class! Especially to anyone who has not had the opportunity to take indigenous studies or indigenous history before. The readings and content of the class are great. Don't take along with too many other lecture courses, though, or if you aren't good at listening to lectures that can be scattered\/disorganized - make sure you can handle Blackhawk's style of lecture before confirming your schedule.",
    "I would highly recommend taking this course WR especially if it sounds interesting to you. The workload is slightly less than other WRs.",
    "I really do recommend this course! It can be a bit boring at times, but I feel like overall I gained a lot of important knowledge. The workload was also totally manageable and the grading was fair.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student. You will definitely learn more about this history and gain a deeper appreciation for the complex issues underlying Native life.",
    "Great course! I took it as a last-minute fifth class lecture and ended up enjoying it so much, and also finding it far more crucial to my primary work than I'd thought. Prof Blackhawk is a pretty dry lecturer but is an absolutely great dude, so if you're willing to really dedicate to lively sections and cool papers, then it's worth it.",
    "I would recommend the course-- it's really important to become versed in such a recent field of history.",
    "I honestly took this course to get an Early Americas requirement. Don't take it as a fifth class if you are not going to be engaged. I wasn't engaged and it felt like a waste of time going to lectures because Blackhawk is quiet and not the most engaging lecturer. I didn't do enough of the readings or go to enough classes or pay enough attention to really give a fair assesment, so basically don't do what I did. That said, The Round House is really good and you get to read it at the end of the semester.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student because it teaches a lot of interesting material.",
    "Yes! It's a good survey course about an extremely important subject. These histories should be included in mainstream U.S. history courses, and it's upsetting that they aren't.",
    "I think I would tentatively recommend this course to another student, because I found it really interesting and it changed my perspectives on history in general a great deal. I just found it difficult to be engaged in the course, despite my interest in the subject matter.",
    "Yes - the material is important to know and not taught in other history courses you may have taken.",
    "Yes, good writing credit",
    "I would likely not recommend this class to another student because it failed to give students information beyond a simple outline of American Indian history.",
    "YES! This is very important history and is taught by an incredible Native professor. You learn how to draw conclusions and connect the history you learn with what you read in Native fictional books and to current events.",
    "Yes, I would tentatively recommend this course to another student. The lecture is a bore and extremely hard to follow, but the subject content is very important and interesting. Luckily, lecture is not extremely important. The readings are interesting. Take this if you have any interest in History or American Studies.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student- whether they are a STEM or humanities major. It's important for everyone to learn American History from a more critical indigenous perspective. It is an introductory class that has to cover a lot of material in a short period of time, so don't expect a lot of depth, but, overall, you will gain better understanding of the country's history.",
    "Worth it for the deep, specific examination of an aspect of American history almost always left out of high school textbooks. Learning about the sheer diversity between tribes, the varied methods of marginalization across space and time, and the Native struggle for recognition and sovereignty left me more informed, empathetic, and inspired.",
    "I would recommend this course--it is an essential history taught by a Native expert. Yale should offer more courses like this. Professor Blackhawk is not the best lecturer, but he is an incredible source of knowledge, and his lectures show this. You'll learn a lot, and be a much better citizen as a result.",
    "Absolutely! This is such a great introductory class to American Indian history. Professor Blackhawk is incredible - just make sure you like his lecture style. He has great insights, a great sense of humor, and covers the material so well. The readings are actually quite interesting, there is a list of IDs and essay questions that you study from for the midterm, and the final essay on two different novels is a great alternative to other finals."
