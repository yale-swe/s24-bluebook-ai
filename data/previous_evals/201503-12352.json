   "comments": [
    "We went over a lot of different concepts, but it was nice because we didn't go too into depth to any of them so it didn't get too challenging. Definitely a great class for people that aren't the best at math.",
    "this class is like pre-calculus, through real-world applications of math. the small class size and frequent readings and assignments made it easy to follow along. there were three exams and a final project that were simpler than homework. professor smith is very receptive to feedback, communicative, and accessible to go over things. i would recommend this class to those hesitant to dive right into calculus, or anyone who wants to sharpen qr skills.",
    "I would highly recommend this to other students.",
    "Ya definitely take this class especially if you need a QR! Initially, the class is hard but it gets easier as the semester goes by. As a humanities student, It took me a while to get used to using the right side of my brain. What's more frustrating is that you totally know how to do the math but you just haven't done it in so long so it takes a lot more relearning than anything. Also the textbook is super vague and very unhelpful. If you take this class, you must go to office hours and watch some Khan Academy. The information is interesting and I definitely see myself using it in the future. Overall, you should def this if you need a QR. Weekly problems sets are rough especially if you're not used to it, but the grades of the assignments are so nicely spaced. Feels like high school again!",
    "Great teacher, but not a very easy class. As a non-math person who would drown in large lectures (like fractals) this was a good class. I had to do work, but Prof Smith is very helpful and accommodating; he had flexible office hours, and provided midterm and final review sessions and practice tests.",
    "This class was an excellent way to get a QR requirement out of the way without making you feel like you were wasting your time. It was relevant but challenging, with ample opportunities to get help.",
    "MATH 107 is a collection of units of specialized math applications for use in the real world. For example, in one unit we learned to measure the apparent magnitude of stars, while in another we learned probability concepts. I would recommend it but would add that it can be a lot trickier than it first appears to be, mostly because the textbook is hard to understand.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course, particularly to those who are lacking in a math background. This is the perfect way by which to strengthen your fundamentals in the subject, and gain not just confidence in the material, but enjoyment.",
    "Great for real world math !",
    "Math 107 01 is a very entertaining class, where a student is presented with everyday scenarios, they must find out how to tackle the question first and then solve the scenarios. It could be easy as solving the probability of getting a 6 on a fair dice or difficult as solving the differences of intensity between a rock concert and a whisper. Math 107 01 will not disappoint you because Professor Brett Smith will make sure that you understand his class, and he has plenty of office hours, where you can go further in depth with a specific question. If you're going to take your first math course at Yale, this is the class to be in.",
    "This is a simple QR that spans a lot of subjects without delving too much into any one in particular (which makes it easier or harder depending on how you look at it)."
