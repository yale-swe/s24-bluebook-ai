    "There are better courses on the Middle East. Unless you're really dying to know about politics, and are ready to grit your teeth through unhelpful, forced discussions tangentially related to the readings, and at times completely unrelated to the topic, find something better. It shouldn't be too hard, given the quality of this class.",
    "I would highly recommend the class.",
    "This course is a very broad overview of issues in the Middle East. I suggest taking this course only if it is taught as a true lecture, not as a seminar, or you may not benefit from Prof. Lust's knowledge. She could spend the entire time asking students questions and waiting for them to respond, rather than delivering the information herself.",
    "This course was a lecture - that got converted to a seminar - and I think that made it better in quite a few respects. I think all of the students in the seminar - myself included - need to take some slack for not adjusting quickly enough to a seminar atmosphere from a lecture one - but once that transition happened, the class was great. Three things in particular stand out for me : a) I think the class struck a great balance between reading academic papers and academic work, and reading slightly more journalistic\/popularly accessible writing. In addition to that the course is a really good survey - it covers religion,history, politics, country-specific studies, and democratization in the region. You definitely leave the class with a better understanding of what are the forces that drive change in the region. b) The smaller class setting allows for more disagreement on the actual meaning of the academic literature - it meant that we could fight about what conclusions were to be drawn from papers, or what the future of a given country was going to be - which was hugely enjoyable. c) Finally, as a WR student, the class has a constant stream of short essays through the semester, which is good way to both improve your writing skills, and allows you to piece together the broader trends behind the reading. Yale should have more of these - \"leminars\" - lectures that also serve as seminars aka smaller lectures, where the focus is on breadth, and not necessarily depth."
