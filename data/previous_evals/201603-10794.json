    "1) Learnt a lot about microbial processes in wastewater systems. 2) About Pathogens. 3) Microbial Kinetics. 4) How genetic manipulation can help produce reliable and suitable microbes.",
    "I learned about the phylogeny of microbes and ways the characterize them using DNA analysis. Emphasis was placed on modeling the growth of microbes and rates of substrate removal for wastewater treatment. Also learned about additional applications such as biofuels. Learned how to compile redox reactions for synthesis and energy. Useful skills developed involved extending Minod kinetics as well as chemistry to reactor-scale situations. I came into the class having taken courses in microbiology and wastewater treatment in prior years, but this was an in-depth look at the processes involved. I feel much more confident in my understanding of the reaction mechanisms.",
    "I learned about bioreactor analysis, the parameters to consider and optimize in bio-processes, basics of microbiology, and the importance and utility of organisms in environmental engineering."

   "comments": [
    "Strengths: engaging, fun, relevant course material (didn't spend too much time on a topic just because it was a \"classic\" or something like that), great teacher and TA Weaknesses: The HWs were often either missing information or accidentally misleading. The excel-heavy HWs did not help me learn much more, they just took a really long time.",
    "Strengths: Professor Peccia handles the course very well. Very good and systematic approach. Useful to all students interested in wastewater or microbial research.",
    "Strengths -Thorough look many aspects in the field -Knowledgeable and experienced instructor -Small class size allowed for interactive classroom Weaknesses -Flow of material at times seemed somewhat disjoint",
    "It was taught well and only the important information was conveyed. It was extremely interesting. Homework was challenging and required good problem solving skills; practicing these is important for research. Only one suggestion: once we were told some information would be tested in a certain way, and then it wasn't tested in that way. I know several students, myself included, prepared to answer questions in that manner that had been announced and not the one that appeared; it affected grades somewhat. I learned so much, though, and really enjoyed the class."

    "Yes! If the student is interested in applied environmental microbiology, they will gain a lot from the course.",
    "This course was great. I would recommend it because it's useful, challenging at times, and reasonable."
