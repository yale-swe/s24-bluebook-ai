   "comments": [
    "Biophysics is a fairly new field, so you go into the class not knowing what the heck you will be learning. But by the end, you have a good idea of what the field is about--shows that the course was successful. Yorgo Modis is a bit bland, and the crystallography material is a bit difficult to understand. Prof. De La Cruz on the other hand is an amazing lecturer, a rarity in the science department at Yale. PSets are easy and manageable. Overall great class.",
    "yes, do it credit\/d if you're not a major because it's a pretty interesting class without too much demanding homework besides psets\/paper readings",
    "Well if you are a MBB major you need to take it so yes. The material is interesting but never really covered with great depth so some people might not like that",
    "Absolutely take it especially if you are an MBB major.",
    "This class is great. Definitely take it. The material is quite interesting, and the professors have very clear lectures. They are veryenthusiastic about the material and really want to make it easy for us to understand. Oftentimes, the material is connected to biological applications. There are also interactive activities\/demos that make the class fun. The TAs generally answer questions during discussion sessions: go to them, it'll make the material easier to understand. There are also discussions sections where you talk about papers that you read-those are good papers and pretty laidback. I went into the class being a bit intimidated, but this course exceeded my expectations.",
    "Biophysics has been consistently improving, and it was a great class this year. Professor De La Cruz is outstanding, and Professor Modis also knows his stuff. I was really surprised by how much I enjoyed this course. If you're not an MB&B major (so this class isn't required), I'd strongly encourage you to shop Enrique's first lecture .. you just might be convinced to take this class!",
    "Take it if you need it",
    "More than half of the course is about experimental methods in biophysics and biochemistry (spectroscopy, microscopy, crystallography, fluorescence, etc). This is information that all scientists should know but often does not get formally taught, so this course is helpful for learning that. Grading is somewhat lenient and overall this isn't a high-stress course. One midterm, one final, some problem sets, and journal clubs.",
    "It's a well-rounded course about some issues in biophysics. I'd recommend it if you're interested in a not-too-deep coverage of the topic; otherwise, I'd taken another course if you wanted to get into more depth.",
    "I think this is a great course to take as a senior. Wait until then.",
    "The Professors are awesome, though they are somewhat constrained by the curriculum. The curriculum definitely tries to do too much in too little time, and ends up encouraging memorization as a result. The material is super interesting, though if they either made this a two semester course, or cut down on some material, it would make a big difference.",
    "I would definitely recommend it! Both Enrique and Yorgo were great and are very committed to teaching and improving this class every year. The topics covered were interesting, and I found them very applicable to stuff I was doing in lab. The exams (1 midterm, 1 final non-cumulative) and problem sets are realistic and fair, and the paper discussions (4) were always really interesting!",
    "I wouldrecommend it to students in the MBB major because the materials, such as reaction kinetics, fluorescent techniques, crystallography, etc., can be really applied in other classes you take for the major.",
    "A well structured and informative course that's worth taking. The research methods that you learn fromthis course will expand your range of understanding and will especially help if you are working or intend on working in a lab.",
    "Gotta take it to be MB&B major... isnt the worst.",
    "Take it only if you're an MB&B major with this requirement or really want to learn techniques in biophysical methods. Otherwise, not worth your time.",
    "I would recommend this class, especially if it can be taken before senior year",
    "Biophysics is one of those courses that you'll probably only take if you're an MB&B major. It's not too rigorous, and is certainly less of a challenge than physical chemistry, since it focuses mostly on the practical applications of physical principles rather than the detailed calculations. The exact curriculum for the course seems to change a bit every year - this semester we covered equilibrium, kinetics, spectroscopy, and X-ray crystallography, but other years have definitely covered various microscopy techniques. None of the assessments in this course are that difficult or time-consuming, and you should have few problems doing well as long as you stay on top of the material."
