   "comments": [
    "If you've watched Inside Job and Too Big to Fail and are curious - TAKE THIS COURSE. It helps you crystallise a lot of concepts and clarify a lot of your misconceptions about the financial system and crisis in general. It gives you a very functional understanding of the workings and relationships that exist in the financial system. A good glass to gain a solid grasp of the relationships and intricacies of the financial markets - more of a history class for sure. You will not be doing any calculation or model derivations so if you're looking to be a quant and gain those skills, this is not the class for you.",
    "Take it! Informational and great",
    "Good lectures, interesting topic. Nice to interact w som students.",
    "The class is exactly what it sounds like---you will learn the timeline, politics, and economics of the financial crisis. Prof. Metrick is an excellent, engaging lecturer, and Geithner is obviously extraordinary. A good class to take even (especially) if you're more interested in policy than finance. The simulation was not the best, group presentations are a chore, and I'm still unsure how I feel about the flipped classroom, but it was still worth it.",
    "Extremely easy class. Two presentations, an 8 page paper, and weekly online quizzes. If the materials interests you too, this is a must-take.",
    "TAKE THIS COURSE! REALLY. I feel like we have all heard the terms: securitization, mortgage backed securities, Repo 105s.. but don't actually understand what they mean. Understanding what happened in 2008 and how it happened is so important, not just for economics majors. I highly recommend this course.",
    "yes. take it. minimal work and very interesting.",
    "This class is interesting, but it is extremely time consuming, as you have to watch the lectures outside of class. The worst part about this class for me was that most of the assignments are graded on a scale of 1 to 3, which makes it very difficult for an undergrad in the class to know how they're doing, especially when a lot of the grading was pretty arbitrary and a large portion of your grade is based on group projects. If you're interested in the material, it's a very engaging, though demanding, course. If you are not interested and don't have some background, you will find it dull and frustrating."
