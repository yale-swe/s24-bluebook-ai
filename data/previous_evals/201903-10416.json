    "I learned how to think more critically about color. We discussed how our perceptions of color are influenced by our surroundings, the other colors present, material as well as culturally imposed systems of organizing color.",
    "I learned to understand the interactions between colors and how we can use these relationships in art.",

    "Great course! I really enjoyed that it was a very small class size (not intentional), very hands-on and accessible. Also, it's really nice to have an art class that is a bit outside\/mixes normal designations of media (sculpture, painting etc.) I wish we had time for midterm individual discussions to check-in on how we were doing in the course.",
    "I liked the lay out of the class and the assignments, we had enough time to complete the assignments and they felt challenging but not stressful.",

   "comments": [
    "Yes! It is unique, interesting and allows you to play and think in very hands-on ways about color - something that can often feel abstract. You also have a lot of freedom in free studies to consider color in different ways that make sense to you.",
    "Yes. If you are interested in art but have minimal experience I suggest this course. While there are weekly assignments you will not be graded down if you follow the instructions to the best of your ability and demonstrate clear effort, additionally the final project is one way you can work with any medium you choose so you will have a chance to explore the elements of art that you are most drawn to.",
    "If you are interested in color, art major or not, for sure take this course!",
    "Yes; Halsey is so enthusiastic about the class material and is always encouraging students and making them feel good about their work, no matter how it turns out. Class discussion is also interesting, and you learn a lot from seeing other students' work.",
    "Yes, it was a great learning experience that engaged with both literature, trips, and physical projects."
