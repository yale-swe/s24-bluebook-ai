   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The professors bring a wealth of knowledge and lifetimes of reflection on the relationship between past, present, and future. However, most students appeared to lack the historical context to engage fully with the class, and neither readings nor mini-lectures at the start of each seminar managed to plug that knowledge gap.",
    "Having both Westad and Kennedy present and engaged in discussion was an experience second to none. What I appreciated most was the way in which they addressed they treated the students as colleagues or peers, addressing their questions and comments thoughtfully and constructively. As such, class discussion was generally meaningful and devoid of superfluous pandering. I also liked how Westad periodically reminded the class of the present-day relevance of certain historical trends. I think it would help students better retain the amount of material they were asked to read if, instead of one term paper, they are assigned one ten page paper covering Kennedy's portion of the course, and a second ten page paper covering the second half of the twentieth century. By the end of the course, the lessons of the first world war and the interwar years were already beginning to feel a bit distant. Also, this way students receive some feedback on their writing before the end of the semester.",
    "One of the best courses that I have taken at Yale.",
    "I think this class may have been a bit too large. Some class discussions were stilted because of the class size. On the other hand, maybe this class works better as a lecture.",
    "Strengths: Great insight and natural lecture style from both Westad and Kennedy Weaknesses: slightly unstructured, floating deadlines, and topic-pacing could be adjusted to give equal attention to Cold War",
    "The time spent on all events from 1890 were, for the most part, evenly weighed. Which resulted in significant events getting less time than it deserved. I would like to see more time dedicated to key events in order to develop a robust understanding of the issues and decisions that led to the outcomes we can observe in history."

    "I would recommend it for students with extensive background in political and diplomatic history of the 20th century.",

    "Certainly.",
    "Absolutely. Professor Kennedy and Westad are sharp thinkers and terrific lecturers. They also both try to get to know their students in a casual setting which is refreshing.",
    "Yes, I loved Westad and Kennedy. Great men, and honor to have learned from them. Very thoughtful.",
    "Yes, if you are interested in the relationships and power dynamics of states."
