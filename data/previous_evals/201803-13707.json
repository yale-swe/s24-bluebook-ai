    "Immunology is beautiful and complex",
    "I learned a ton that I didn't know about immunology. This course really stands apart from other biology classes at Yale in terms of introducing students to new information.",
    "Innate and adaptive immune systems, the cell types involved in immune responses as well as molecular mechanisms (including signaling pathways and secreted molecules). We also talked about immune diseases (like immune deficiency, autoimmunity, allergy, and cancer) that relate the fundamental knowledge we learned in the first half of the semester to the real world.",
    "Broad knowledge about the immune system and how it interacts with and responds to the environment.",
    "Learned about the innate immunity, adaptive immunity, molecular and cellular basis of immunity, applications of immunology (biotechnology, immunotherapy)",
    "I felt I had a very good general survey of immunology from this course and understood what it meant to work in this field of research.",
    "I felt I had a very good general survey of immunology from this course and understood what it meant to work in this field of research.",
    "I developed knowledge of fundamental immunology concepts. We learned the overarching patterns and principles underlying immune system functioning. We also learned about some of the specific most important mechanisms of immune system functioning.",
    "A wide level of cursory knowledge into the background of and issues in Immunology. Lectures are given on a rotating basis by different professors, which is good in that each professor is quite passionate and bad in that there is absolutely no communication between professors which makes it difficult to feel like the class material has much cohesion."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Although it was great to have different professors come in to talk about their respective fields, this made the course seem kind of fragmented. Scaling down the number of professors I think would be beneficial to students.",
    "The team teaching format is wonderful, but sometimes redundant. Its also hard to see the board in the room where the class is held",
    "It's a bit disjointed at times, but that's a consequence of having every lecture be taught by someone who is an expert in the subject area.",
    "The course was taught with a coherent narrative\/topic progression, but the professors often did not know what had already been covered, so it might help make lectures more cohesive if professors knew which topics had been covered beforehand. The broad range of professors helped connect the topics to issues in medicine and research that they personally work with.",
    "Strengths: there really isn't anything particularly strong about this class that I can call \"strengths\". Weaknesses: too early in the morning (9:25 am). The entire course is taught by at least 10 different professors, each giving just a few lectures on their respective fields; this kind of organization makes the class feel kind of random sometimes. Also, the lectures are not ordered in the best way possible; sometimes you would wonder what is the purpose of a particular lecture which doesn't seem quite logically related to previous lectures. The logistical aspects of this class are questionable (for the midterm, one of the questions got LOST after we turned in our exams and it was eliminated from the exam. Excuse me???). The grading is too slow (we didn't receive our homework 3 scores until AFTER the final ended) and the midterm took something like a month to grade. Also, the professors do not use slides but write on the blackboard with chalk!!! And some of them have really terrible and illegible handwriting (like Eric Meffre). BIGGEST WEAKNESSES: they didn't have Akiko Iwasaki and Ruslan Medzhitov giving lectures this year, which made me feel really sad!!! Akiko is my lab PI and Ruslan is her husband, who almost won the Nobel Prize for the discovery of TLR sensors. They are the best in their fields and I wonder why they didn't invite them over to give lectures!!! I really didn't like some of the professors they had this year (like Eric Meffre, P. Cresswell, Noah Palm, J. Pereira). BIGGEST WEAKNESS NO. 2: The exams are too focused on memorization (which is true for all Biology classes at Yale, I guess) and don't give a shit about understanding of the big concepts and logical reasoning\/problem solving. The exams ask you to recall insane details that you sometimes feel you've never seen before.",
    "Strengths -- the course material Weaknesses -- the course is organized poorly for student learning. By having multiple lecturers come to teach the course and having the schedule and order change around, lecture material often had no connecting narrative that led to it being difficult to understand material that spanned multiple lectures. Furthermore, many of the questions on examinations and assignments asked questions in vague ways but expected very specific answers -- I'd recommend a course coordinator that is ultimately responsible for the course to more seriously consider the kinds of questions asked on the exams and alter them as needed. Also, the course coordinator should disseminate to lecturers what information students have learned about up to a certain point, as often times lecturers would come in and repeat information we had already learned from a different class.",
    "Strengths - amazing lecturers (who also happened to discover a lot of the stuff your learning!), having a course booklet with summaries with all of the lecturers was extremely extremely useful for reviewing the content Weakness - sometimes organization of content was a bit disorganized because the later lecturers didn't know what know earlier lecturers had taught but it was always good to review the content, not being able to ask questions (like a week) later to the professors also made it hard to study",
    "I did like that this course was team taught, since it gave the sense that each topic was being taught to us by THE expert in the field. However, I do wish there had been slightly more sharing of notes between professors, so theyd know what we already knew or did not know. For example, we learned about PD-1\/PD-L1 in at least three different lectures. It was a strong reinforcement, but perhaps not so necessary. All of that being said, though, if no changes were made to the courses team-taught style, I would not be upset either!",

    "One strength is that this course covers a wide range of topics, both well-established immunology concepts and more novel concepts. One weakness is that the ordering of topics did not seem to work as smoothly as it should. Some professors were unsure of what we had or had not already learned, so there was some confusion that I think could have been avoided if lessons were ordered differently and if professors were more aware of what past professors had already taught. Otherwise, I thought the course did a good job of making a vast amount of information digestible.",
    "The course is strong in the foundation of immunology it gives, if not its ability to convey what doing immunology looks like. It doesn't especially encourage you to go deeper on subjects you find interesting. The class is very disjointed overall and you get the feeling that people are only taking it for the requirement."

   "comments": [
    "Yes",
    "This is a wonderful course with second to none faculty",
    "Yep. Take it if you need an upper level elective. Especially if you're applying to medical school. I feel way more knowledgeable about the immune system now.",
    "I would highly recommend this class to any undergraduate interested in pursuing a career in medicine, especially those interested in treating cancer, infectious disease, and disorders of the immune system.",
    "Yes, if you're interested in immunology. No, if you're just going for an MCDB elective (I think there are better ones out there like dynamical systems).",
    "If you want to learn about the immune system and how it interacts with our environment, take this course. However, be prepared to come in and pay strict attention during lectures and to operate with different lecturers and styles. Also, you will likely have to do a great deal of self study to prepare properly for this course, as it is not organized terribly well.",
    "YESSSS TAKE IMMUNOLOGY ITS SO COOOL. You'll fall in love with the subject like a TCR binding its favorite MHC+peptide. The content is soo soo interesting and almost all the lectures are really really good (especially Schatz)! The class is small enough where you can ask questions during the lecture too! Although it's a rotation lecture (so sometimes its hard to know what's important from lecture), having the CLASS PACKET and JANEWAY textbook made reviewing and studying much easier. There's a lot of memorization (CD-blah-blah and IL-blah-blah-blah) but there a lot of different connections between the many lectures which makes learning them mindblowing. There's actually not that much work and because there's only 3 psets + midterm + final. However, rotation lecture also makes it hard to know what to study and the TAs were super great in reviewing and helping us focus our studying attention. You will leave many of the lectures like wow I wish I was as cool as a CD4+ Th2 T cell.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student because it provides a great, comprehensive introduction to immune system function. There were many concepts I was confused about coming into the class that I now understand very well.",
    "If you're into immunology, take it--but with the knowledge that it's a lot of work, not all of which will feel gratifying or even as if it's teaching you anything."
