   "comments": [
    "If you are interested in truly interested in understanding French culture (not just berets and baguettes), improving your verbal language skills, and increasing the accuracy of your written French, take this class! I can't speak to the quality of the other sections, but having taken both French 151 and French 160 with Mme Sherak, I can definitely attest to the quality of her teaching!",
    "Take this class if you would like to learn about current events\/affairs (religion, business, politics) and discuss it in class with your peers. This is a really stimulating class and Sherak was a phenomenal professor.",
    "French 160 is a course that will teach you enough about both vocabulary and French culture for you to hold a meaningful conversation about France with native speakers. I would recommend this course to a friend because it really is effective.",
    "I would absolute recommend the course. I have a better grasps on the French language and I also have a great sense of French and Francophone culture. Not to mention that your french drastically improves.",
    "You have readings that you have to do before every class and about two written assignments a week of about 300 or so words. Then you have a few tests (I think about four) and two orals throughout the year. There's also a presentation project (it's not hard at all). You get to class and discuss the readings or films. Everything you learn is through interaction with the other kids in the class and from Sherak's interjections. That's what I loved about it. There's no note taking or anything, you just get to practice your french which is exactly what you want out of a conversational class. With that being said, be prepared to participate. Don't take this class if you don't like speaking in French or if you have no motivation to improve your speaking skills because a huge part of your grade is just participation which Sherak takes very seriously. However, our class discussions were very interesting and I don't see why you wouldn't be interested in the topics that we discussed this year. If Sherak is teaching it, take it definitely. She's incredibly approachable and will never hesitate to help you out in whatever you need. This was my favorite French class at Yale so far. I will say that the class atmosphere was uniquely relaxed and fun. Hopefully, that's the case for whatever class you get- but you can't really control that- it just kind of depends on what kind people take the class. Take it with some friends if you can- that's what I did and we had a blast! This class is the bomb.com just take it fasho fasho.",
    "I would recommend this course to a fellow student who is very proficient to fluent in the language and wants to increase their speaking confidence, while participating in a debate style class. I would not recommend this to any student who is still learning French or who is relatively unsure of their speaking ability, also I would not recommend this course to anyone who tends to sink into their seats and not talk--conversation and class participation is a must--which is also very nice if you do speak well, because that's really all you do: read the homework, show up, argue, leave!",
    "It is a good culture class. I would recommend it over 150."
