    "Easy and informative. Why not? Great fifth course.",
    "I would highly recommend this course. I knew so little about Korea before taking this, and now, I am much more comfortable discussing the country's history and its culture. This is also a good way to get introduced into the Eastern art sphere. The work can seem daunting, but the professors are so engaging that you want to keep up with the coursework.",
    "This was a very interesting course. I would definitely take it again, given the choice. I had no Art History or Korean History background at all, but the class was enjoyable and informative. I learned a lot about Korean Art and Culture. Definitely take it if you are looking for an interesting class with a manageable course load. A midterm, paper, and final distribute the work and grading well.",
    "You do learn a lot, bough lectures may. it always be cohesive. Workload is completely fine, and the professors are fine.",
    "I do recommend it, but a background knowledge of Korean or Korean history would be really beneficial. There's a lot of history and Korean terms that might be confusing. This is the first year the class was taught, so I think some organizational kinks that were present might be resolved the next time this class is offered - take it!",
    "EAST 353\/HSAR 353 is a wonderful class, and I would definitely recommend it! Professor Kim and Professor Koo are very caring, and you will learn a lot about Korean history, from art pieces in the premodern period to the contemporary period."
