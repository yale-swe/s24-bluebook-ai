    "Lectures: boring and unnecessary if you do the readings.Readings: super fun and easy until you get to Aristotle.Section: A BLAST.Papers: not too challenging, but the grading is REALLY TOUGH.Basically, take the course if you are considering a philosophy major. If not, don't take it. If you do anyway, take it credit\/d\/fail.",
    "This was a great class. You get a very good introduction to Plato's The Republic and Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics. 2 papers of 3 pages and 2 papers of 6 pages, no final. Everyone should take this to get an introduction to the founder's of Western philosophy.",
    "Definitely take this course. The readings are fairly short, Professor Harte is a great lecturer, and the discussion sections are a lot of fun.",
    "Very interesting course--I enjoyed the subject matter and the way it was presented, though you have to be ready to spend more time than you'd expect on 4-page essays. The writing aspect was much more logic based than I expected; get ready to abandon the usual literary essay.",
    "This is an overview of significant works of Plato and Aristotle, with a few lectures spent on other ancient philosophers. It is a great course to take, even if one does not plan to continue with philosophy. I would recommend this course to anyone with even a passing interest in philosophy.",
    "Every college student should read Aristotle and Plato. Period. This class is a great way to learn about the ancients without overwhelming yourself with work.",
    "It is a requirement for the philosophy major if you have not taken DS, so my answer to a non philosophy student would be absolutely not to take it.",
    "A good class - as good a survey can be. Not the best class to take as an introduction to philosophy unless you know you will like ancient philosophy. It's a bit too broad and it's difficult to get a good idea of many of the ideas of the ancient authors in the limited time, because the arguments are usually quite complicated. The main problem with the class is that the level and depth of analysis we were expected to provide in our papers was beyond that which was offered in class, which was quite limited since the class is a survey.",
    "With Professor Harte, I give this course an enthusiastic two thumbs up. With others professors, be cautious. Without wanting to rag on another professor whose classes I have only shopped, I will say that I have had friends take the course with professors other than Harte and had an OK-to-much-less-enjoyable experience that I did. I think this material has the potential to really turn people off even, sadly, from philosophy generally, especially those, like me, who didn't come into it with some innate or previous-acquired interest in the material. Professor Harte manages marvelously to introduce people to this material in a way that makes it engaging and interesting. I actually ENJOYED writing and working on two of the papers! I cannot speak for the quality of the course when taught by other professors.",
    "A good class for figuring out whether you are interested in philosophy or not--very much straight-up philosophical analysis. Do not take it if you think it will be an easy class about discussing big philosophical ideas by Plato and Aristotle. It is more about understanding how each philosopher specifically argues for a certain conclusion. I would not recommend it for someone who wantsto take a philosophy class as just another elective. Only take it if you are seriously interested (or think you might be) in philosophy. Papers are tough.",
    "I would certainly recommend this course. For prospective philosophy majors, this will provide a chance to see if you are really interested in philosophy. For everyone else, these are some of the most important ideas ever, and every educated person should be introduced to them. Be prepared to read a lot of Plato and Aristotle, as this course is very centered around those figures and diverges only briefly. It is not a survey course in the sense that is not intended to provide an introduction to a plethora of ancient philosophers. The lectures were informative, if a little dense, section was really fun, and the readings were generally very manageable. The grading of the four papers (two shorter philosophical analyses and two longer papers) is demanding, but fair.",
    "I would recommend this class if you have little experience with philosophy and are interested in learning about the topic. Or if you're a philosophy major and want to graduate (but be prepared not to find it useful).",
    "This lecture is as dry as the Gobi desert. Professor Harte is funny twice (I remember the two funny jokes very well... too bad there weren't more than that) and the section was fun because most of my friends were in it and it was out of control. The Plato readings are great, and I really enjoyed reading them for homework, but the Aristotle sequence is a total nightmare and honestly, a waste of time. I really do not like that guy.",
    "Phil 125 provides a brief overview of the origins of Greek philosophy, then (more importantly) delves directly into Plato's 'Republic' and Aristotle's 'Nichomachean Ethics,' using pieces of other works to support and clarify the arguments. In Phil 125 I gained a solid foundation in philosophical analysis (not to mention gained the capacity for informed, intelligent conversation with my DS friends!). I really enjoyed the course material, as it introduced essential philosophical foundations but remained focused so as not to become burdensome or boring. Some of the readings are tough--the transition into Aristotle is mildly difficult--but I felt the course was extremely rewarding. Whether this is your first philosophy course, or you just missed a good classical training, I would absolutely recommend this course.",
    "This class is great for picking up the basics of ancient greek philosophy and how to write a philosophy paper.",
    "Take it if you're interested in Philosophy as a major, but don't take it if you're just interested in Philosophy. There are other less rigorous classes, as counterintuitive as that seems, that will allow you to get an understanding of Philosophy and the major without hurting your gpa as this one potentially will.",
    "Great class to survey Plato and Aristotle. Good to take if you are at all interested or want to take philosophy seminars at some point. Required class for philosophy major. Prepares you well for other philosophy classes and writing\/logic.",
    "intro to ancient phil with tough grading. take it if you need to.",
    "Great foundational course in ancient philosophy. Take it if you're thinking about philosophy, don't take it if you're thinking it will be easy--it's not. Light reading load, but philosophy papers can be tedious and this class requires them to be. Interesting but not riveting lecture. I am glad to have taken it though I cannot say I particularly enjoyed taking it. Funny how that works.",
    "I would recommend it if you are interested in philosophy.",
    "I highly recommend this class to anybody. Philosophy major or not. It's a great introduction to some of the greatest things ever written. Also Verity Harte is so so educated and she is an extremely well spoken, informative, and organized lecturer. Loved this class.",
    "Take it if you care about the material.",
    "Definitely, if you're the kind of person who likes rigorous thinking and textual analysis. Definitely don't go in expecting to BS your way through the course.",
    "Phil 125 is a good intro class for philosophy - the grading isn't too hard, and the workload is really reasonable, so that if you want to really engage with all of the material you can and it won't take over your life. The readings are pretty interesting and Professor Harte is a great lecturer. Sections are also set up to be very enjoyable and helpful for paper topics.",
    "Very interesting course. Focuses largely on the major works of Plato and Aristotle. I recommend it to anybody who likes to think.",
    "Philosophy 125 is a great intro to Ancient Philosophy. This course explains the origins of western philosophy in an engaging manner. The work load is light but interesting. With Professor Harte, it was four short essays and less than 20 pages of reading every other day.",
    "This is a pretty dry class. Yes, its a requirement for the philosophy major so take it if you must, but the grading on the papers is pretty tough and lectures aren't (for the most part) super engaging.",
    "I would recommend this course for a student wishing to read a quick survey of Plato and Aristotle. There is not too much reading, but just enough to get a good picture of the main ideas, which is preferable to most. The course is not too hard, but teaches the basics of philosophical analysis, and prepares the student well for more rigorous philosophy courses.",
    "Good intro to Plato and Aristotle. A little dry, but very useful, and required if a Phil major without DS. Be sure to sign up for a good section so you actually get to discuss the material!",
    "PHIL 125 is a good introduction to Ancient Philosophy. There are no exams, which means you will be assessed based on 4 papers, each of which focus on particular ideas in the texts. Therefore, you may find yourselfskipping over unnecessary readings. Therefore, take Ancient Philosophy only if you are truly interested in the material, or you need to fulfill a History of Philosophy requirement.",
    "Intro to Ancient Philosophy is a manageable course if, like me, you have never taken philosophy before; however, it may turn you off philosophy. Verity Harte is a superb lecturer and made the material almost accessible - but not quite. There may be no way around the fact that the basics of Plato and Aristotle's philosophy, despite being integral to Western civilization, are not that captivating to me.",
    "This is a great class. The reading load is light and well-selected. Professor Harte's lectures are directly responsive to all of the readings so you never feel like your reading was wasted. She's very sharp and has cool things to say about ancient philosophers. Her lectures are also very engaging and easy to pay attention to, on the whole. It won't be boring even if you've already done a good bit of philosophy. One thing to be aware of is that the class is mostly interpretive and analytical rather than evaluative, so if you're looking for a chance to rip into Socrates, you won't get that many opportunities. It also very focused on the arguments of Aristotle and Plato, rather than their history or the historical context of the dialogues--I'd say much more of a PHIL class than a CLCV class. The work was extremely manageable if you have a handle on how to write philosophy papers at all. Take it!",
    "A brilliant class, both due to the material and the professor.Material: We primarily read the Republic and Nicomachean Ethics, both of which arguably have \"How must I live?\" as their main question. As such, the material felt very useful and \"relevant to my life,\" while also being intellectually stimulating, an end in itself.Professor: Prof. Harte was wonderful. Her lectures are very organized and easy to follow, as she gives out a printed outline detailing her intended line of lecturing. She also seems like a wonderful person, as she did not exude self-importance, added humor to lectures, and used endearing examples (often mentioning her dog Rusty, for example)."
