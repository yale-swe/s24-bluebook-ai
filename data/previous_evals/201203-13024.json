    "This is a great introduction to Western Philosophy, which I would recommend to any student, not just future philosophy majors.",
    "It really depends on what you're looking for. If you don't mind the way that philosophy is often taught (I did) and if you're interested in the material, do it, but if not then it's a complete waste of your credits. DS just works for some people and not for others.",
    "DS philosophy covers a lot of classic works and is invaluable in gaining a background in Plato, Aristotle, and other philosophers. Professor Whittle seems to have a strong understanding of the works, but often discussions could have used better guidance or been more interesting.",
    "DS Philosophy is excellent. Subject material generally very interesting and a great intro to philosophy, though sometimes seemingly irrelevant. Professor Whittle has an interesting method of teaching, where we reexplain the arguments ourselves to understand them throughout out the class. This can ber very hit or miss. He is also a very fine grader.",
    "Setting aside the routine pro\/con arguments for Directed Studies, I would highly recommend Professor Whittle. His grading and paper comments are fair, and even generous, but always discerning and useful. The discussions are - for the latter half of class - mostly directed by the students' concerns and questions, which leads one to some very interesting places. On the course itself: I didn't ever feel that the class became laborious or boring, whereas I imagine other, more technical philosophy classes might.",
    "Yes I would recommend this class",
    "Yes, it is a very interesting course covering a lot of important material. The readings can be a bit confusing but class discussions usually clear up questions.",
    "Philosophy was definitely my favorite part of the DS curriculum. I started DS having read only the summer reading, and now I've read everything from Plato and Aristotle to Aquinas and Augustine (though, to be fair, the same material would be offered in Intro to Modern Philosophy). Class discussions definitely improved as we got used to each other as a class and learned how to talk about philosophical texts, and the papers were on interesting topics but also taught us to analytically assess arguments. Professor Whittle has a bit of an awkward manner, but he's a brilliant professor, particularly when it comes to analyzing the nuances of an argument. He wasn't great at moderating class discussions, as they often tended to get into tangents about one particular aspect of a text, but he was good at making sure the class understood the structure of the argument the author was making, which really helped when we had to reconstruct those arguments on the final."
