    "I really enjoyed the topics from week-to-week. I really wish the class would have been less focused on group presentations, however. It would have been nice to have part of the class be lecture-style based on the readings, with the rest of the time spent on discussion.",
    "Strengths: Interesting topics, friendly atmosphere, innovative talks.",
    "The seminar format facilitated active discussion and spontaneous criticism, but I would have liked to see Professor Levy lecture more. I know she is a great researcher, and hearing her talk would probably be more stimulating than listening to class debate.",
    "I really enjoyed all the different speakers and I felt that we covered a good range of topics.",
    "did not learn much from group presentations. Need more outside info brought into class. videos, speakers etc",
    "I think this class covers a lot of very interesting topics. The aging community isn't addressed this extensively in other classes, so I think it is very valuable.The one improvements that I would suggest would be to make the student presentations each week only 15 minutes instead of the whole class.",
    "Great!",
    "This class was not what I expected. A bit disappointing. At times subject matter was difficult to connect. Good guest speakers",
    "The course provided a good baseline for understanding and critically thinking about public health issues in the aging population.",
    "The coursework and readings were fascinating but group-led classes seemed to undermine the interest of the readings. I would have preferred more teachings and engagement from Dr. Levy as she is the expert. Guest speakers were great.",
    "Very interesting class, has definitely changed my view of aging. It wasn't what I was expecting but that's a good thing."

    "Instructor: Becca Levy \u00a0It is difficult to evaluate Professor Levy as an instructor because she did not teach very much. When she did go over the readings with us, she was great. I wish she would have been the main instructor rather than my classmates.",
    "Instructor: Becca Levy \u00a0Nice, kind, caring, responsible, creative.",
    "Instructor: Becca Levy \u00a0She is very intelligent, approachable, direct, and fair. Great teacher.",
    "Instructor: Becca Levy \u00a0Dr. Levy is great! I really enjoyed the more discussion format than compared to strait lecture.",
    "Instructor: Becca Levy \u00a0great!",
    "Instructor: Becca Levy \u00a0Great instructor. Very supportive and always available for questions and suggestions.",
    "Instructor: Becca Levy \u00a0Professor Levy is always willing to meet with students, provide guidance, and offer helpful feedback on assignments. She clearly cares about her students and is passionate about the topic of aging.",
    "Instructor: Becca Levy \u00a0Dr Levy is very supportive and helpful when approached with questions. I enjoyed her discussions and enjoyed the class. I understand the class was originally a seminar, and I know the importance of student presentations, but I think a few less student lead discussions and more professor lead discussion would be more helpful and engaging.",
    "Instructor: Becca Levy \u00a0Incredibly knowledgeable and engaging. Asks thoughtful questions without being rude and includes relevant comments on assignments.",
    "Instructor: Becca Levy \u00a0Amazing teacher. She was clearly an expert in her field. Would have liked for her to talk more in the class, however."

    "If you're interested in the main issues that accompany the aging process, this is a great class. Just be aware that much of the information is self-taught and reinforced by student presentations as opposed to lectures from the professor.",
    "It added to my knowledge about aging and the elderly.",
    "A solid discussion of the topic.",
    "a lot of reading and writing",
    "For anyone interested in the topic of aging, this is a great class. The readings are interesting and the course provides students with exposure to many facets of the aging process.",
    "I think it is important for everyone to understand the unique issues surrounding the aging population and would recommend this course to anyone interested in SBS.",
    "Interesting class, be prepared to do some work!",
    "This class is nothing like you might expect. It is basically a reading class and I was much more interested in a lecture format which would have facilitated much more learning. Not really my style for a class at all."
