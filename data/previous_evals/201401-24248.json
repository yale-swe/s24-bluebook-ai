   "comments": [
    "Yes, makes you look at higher education differently!",
    "Would recommend shopping the course, if you don't find the professor repetitive or boring then the material is worth learning and reading about.",
    "Solid course, you learn a lot about higher education and about the learning process and student development. You also get an expert examination of your writing. I would recommend it to another student because Professor Hersh is great and you really learn to improve your writing.",
    "Yes, if you want to engage with peers and discuss this issue, it's great. If it would bug you to talk about one topic for a whole semester you might want to think twice, but I really enjoyed that aspect of it.",
    "A summary of potential issues facing the current world of higher education, and what they mean for the correct way to attain it.",
    "A wonderfully run course that is one of a kind in that it explores a single question all semester: What good is college, and how can it be made better? Some students found it frustrating or slow to dwell on a single topic, but I thought it refreshing to really ponder a deep question for a whole semester. The discussions were always lively, the readings interesting and relevant, and the course structure nudged me to be responsible without being an overload. Professor Hersh was an instructor that grew to be a sort of mentor over the course of the semester. He really takes the time to give timely, frequent and relevant feedback, and that helped me improve as a writer and thinker. He's also eager to share his personal experiences and struggles as someone who's thought a lot about human development and higher education, which was interesting to learn about.",
    "Overall, this is a very good, interesting course exploring Liberal Arts educations. It is quite a bit of work but is very rewarding!",
    "YES YES YES loved it.",
    "If you are a person who cares about learning and is a college student \u2014 and I believe that applies to a great majority of students on this campus \u2014 this is by far the most important seminar you can take, regardless of major and regardless of your intentions behind coming to college. As the lone freshman in this seminar, I found that it grounded me with what should be essential background knowledge for all incoming freshman at an undergraduate degree at a liberal arts and sciences college. In this seminar, you will come to understand (1) Why one should attend a liberal arts and sciences college, (2) What that college \u2014 with the right effort on the students\u2019 end \u2014 should develop in that student, intellectually, emotionally, socially, morally, developmentally and wholly, (3) What a student ought to learn during her time as a student, in terms of both the sorts of classes he or she should aim to take as well as the skills she should develop and to what extent, and (4) All the issues today that challenge the integrity of that education, from the giving to the receiving ends. This seminar is important for students who wonder: Is there anything worthwhile I am getting out of college besides my degree (or even that)? How should I spend my time at college to get the most out of it? What should I major in? Has my Yale education been worth it? Am I going to be a strong applicant for jobs after I graduate? Since these questions apply to practically all college students, it should be a requisite for any beginning freshman. But since it is not, seize the opportunity to learn what matters in this seminar, as soon as you can. It is challenging, controversial, life-changing and a transformative seminar experience. All of this is without mentioning the quality of the professor: Simply put, Professor Hersh is one of the most talented and empathetic educators you can work with. He is an expert in the field of higher education, meaning he himself is an authority on how college students ought to be taught, how classes ought to be run, and how students ought to grow from the college experience. Be humbled: You are dealing with a master. Fight tooth and nail to enroll.",
    "YES! Everyone at Yale should try to take a class focusing on content similar to that covered in this course. Such a class will change the way you view your education and will assist you in fully harnessing all that the undergraduate experience has to offer.",
    "If the student wanted to improve his or her writing in a class that was mostly discussion-based and was VERY interested in liberal arts in higher education, then I would recommend it."
