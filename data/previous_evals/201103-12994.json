   "comments": [
    "I would summarize it as a basic, not too challenging, language course. I learned a lot and would definitely recommend it.",
    "It reviews a lot of Spanish and is pretty difficult. I would recommend it since it is probably necessary to take.",
    "Yes--take this class if you want to learn to speak Spanish better. It's that simple. I mean, you have to fulfill language requirements somehow. Profesora Asensio is by no means easy, but she is a great, dedicated, and fair teacher. (And adorable.)",
    "So you wanna take Spanish L3, eh? Take it with Pilar. When I read the evaluations, someone called her an angel. I verify and support that evaluation.",
    "I would recommend it. It is a lot of review of spanish 120",
    "Spanish 130 is a class you take on the path to proficiency. It doesn't promise proficiency, and much of the grammar is repeated from L2. But the class allows a lot of time for speaking out loud, which I find is lacking in a lot of Spanish classes, and which I feel is most important for developing an ear for the language. The class isn't really \"exciting\" in the sense that you don't really explore the language -- it's really more about working towards an understanding of the language.",
    "A great way to improve one's Spanish. I'd definitely recommend it. Having class every day was good for getting practice at speaking.",
    "If you're reading this, you've probably already decided to take Spanish 130 (or you have to take it), and are just wondering which section to pick. Profesora Asensio is really a fantastic teacher, and you definitely won't regret choosing to be in her section."
