   "comments": [
    "A strength of this course was the small size that allowed for a lot participation. A few weaknesses were that it moves very quickly for an introduction and the material is infrequently tested, only on one midterm and a final.",
    "I really liked all the practice problems we did together in class, and got the chance to do on the black board. I really appreciated that the slides were posted on blackboard, as were the problem set solutions, and the Piazza site we had access to at the end of the year. I also think the tests were quite fair. Sometimes the problem sets gave me difficulty, and on rare instances, I felt as though some problem set questions were at a much higher difficulty than what was taught in lecture."

    "I would recommend this course to someone who knows that they like economics already. For someone who just wants to explore econ for the first time I definitely would not.",
    "Yes, I really would. The professor makes the class very engaging and interesting, and the material is quite relevant to everyday life. I find myself applying things I learned in class in many scenarios outside the classroom."
