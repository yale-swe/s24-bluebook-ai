    "This class is a history of English prosody, with a focus on writing poetry in the styles that you learn about. There are a series of poems that you write, one short (but fairly challenging paper) on scansion, and a midterm and an in class final.",
    "Learning the technical aspects of poetry and applying them in weekly \"exercises,\" which end up being poem-like. You read student-written poems in class (anonymously) and a ton of other ones from Hopkins, to Shakespeare, to Stevens and Williams. This class makes you appreciate poetry so much more than I ever thought possible. One piece of advice: DO THE READING. ESPECIALLY FUSSELL. If you don't, it will come back to bite you in the ass.",
    "So, so wonderful. Such an enjoyable seminar experience and some amazing insight into the lives (and gossip) of contemporary poets. A great class with some amazing people. You're in for exactly what you sign up for: the study and practice of prosody. I wish sometimes there was more structure within the classes. But I think the beauty of it was that we would get lost sometimes. Some great quotes from the class, too!",
    "Recommend it wholeheartedly. The material felt so important and so foundational that I wish I had known to take it earlier. Master Laurans is incredibly knowledgeable (and comical...) and has teaching this class down to a science.",
    "Take this course if you want a good historical overview of English verse. Although this was my first class in the English department here at Yale, it was not all that hard to follow with the material and to do the verse exercises since the course is, as Master Laurans describes it herself, \"like a pleasant after-lunch chat about poetry\".",
    "A light, delightful run through the history and technicalities of English verse, from anglo-saxon alliterative verse all the way through free verse. Weekly \"verse exercises\" allow you to try to write poems on a regular basis. Each week, Master Laurans prints the best ones with names removed and the class discusses them -- careful with these, don't expect a real workshop experience here. These are more appreciations than they are critiques. This said, having a forum in which to be constantly trying forms and writing poetry is extremely valuable. If you wanted to take poetry classes and didn't get into any, this is a good way to keep busy and learn skills until next semester's apps are due."
