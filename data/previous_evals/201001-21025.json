    "It contributed directly to my research, and I just consider myself fortunate to have had the opportunity to take this with Prof. Joseph.",
    "For the final paper, I wrote a historiographical analysis of a kind of scholarship in the Mexican case that I wanted to take in for its comparative value vis a vis my own interests in a different country. Although my topic was not central to the material of the course itself, Prof. Joseph gave me the freedom to pursue a final paper that suited my own needs outside of his classroom."
