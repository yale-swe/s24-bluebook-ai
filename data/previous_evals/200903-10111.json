   "comments": [
    "Definitely take this class if you have any interest what so ever in the South or Southern Literature. It is one of the top 3 classes I have taken at Yale and I will remember it forever.",
    "This was an excellent class. The syllabus and the subject matter were fascinating and extremely well thought out. Professor Mahurin is a difficult teacher, but always willing to have meetings before and after a paper; I really felt my reading and writing improved in this class. Professor Mahurin also brings humor and a clear interest in the South to the classroom setting.",
    "Most engaging course I've taken at Yale.",
    "I highly recommend this course. If you have any interest in the South, Southern literature, or one or more of the authors on the syllabus, absolutely take it, you will not regret it. It is really fun but you get a lot out of it, and even if you've read all the books already your understanding is enriched.",
    "THIS CLASS WAS AMAZING. My classmates were super super cool. Sarah is the best. Great conversations held every week. Wonderful syllabus. Also, it's very interesting to look at some classic literature in a different light. We really tried to see why these books could be \"Southern Lit.\" So fun.As a word of caution, this is a serious English class. As a non-English major I was really disappointed with my grades b\/c I thought it wasn't going to be such a serious English class...but it was. And it was great but difficult.",
    "take it. sarah is a great teacher, and you will have a lot of fun, i promise. just take it.",
    "Great books (mostly), very free-for-all way to study them. You can't go wrong.",
    "The class provides exposure to Southern literature and culture generally, for which I could recommend the class because it fills a void in Yale's curriculum. No other class examines the idea of the American South as this does. Many books I really enjoyed in this class are probably not taught in other Yale classes. A book a week can be demanding at times, but ultimately is manageable; the readings are so enjoyable that doing them is more of a pleasure than a chore.",
    "This class is a wonderful exploration of the South's image in our culture and the Southern identity.",
    "Southerners and \"others\" alike will LOVE this course. TAKE IT.",
    "We read Southern books and watch Southern movies and talk about them. It depends a lot on who else is in the class. Luckily our class was awesome."
