    "In this class, I practiced my listening comprehension and oral production a lot. At the very beginning of this semester, I could not even speak in a sentence, but now I can to some extend express my own ideas clearly in class. Ms Fraysse is so nice. I feel involved in her class. When I had a very low score in my first evaluation, she had a talk with me, helping me to improve by giving me a great many useful sugestions. And after that, whenever I got a little progress, she was so happy about it and encouraged me a lot. Also my classmates are really active during discussion. It is really a great experience for me.",
    "Reviewed major grammar topics including subjunctive, conjugating and employing passe compose\/imparfait\/conditional, learned different expressions and vocab. Improved reading ability.",
    "I have developed a deeper appreciation for French language and the French culture.",
    "The formal laws of tenses and moods. Confidence in writing. Appreciation of French art and cultural heritage.",
    "I became a more confident speaker. My grammar also improved.",
    "I learned a bunch of french",
    "Developed general skills in French and polished up concepts known prior to taking the course.",
    "I think my grammatical skills in the language and knowledge of the French culture grew.",
    "A greater ability to use different tenses within the French Language."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strength is the massive practice in a single semester. Meeting everyday, the class helped me to improve my French within a short time. At the same time, it is also a weakness regarding the time commitment. At the very beginning of the semester, it took me about 2h30min to finish everyday's homework so that I have only limited time left for other works. In the three months, my skills improved a lot and I can do the homework faster, but it still occupied a great many of my time. I think massive practice is good, as it is necessary for improvements. Maybe it is me that should try some other strategies in my time scheduling.",
    "Lots of focus on grammar and vocab - definitely learn a lot, but also gets boring by the end of the semester. All the homework assignments blend together because they're all very similar.",
    "This course is very good at immersing one completely in the French language, but I felt as thought the audio programs were a bit tough to follow. For things like forming the subjunctive, I often felt as though if I didn't have knowledge about it prior to Yale, I would not have been able to learn from the audio programs, so I felt I could have easily gotten lost.",
    "I think something that could be more helpful for the class in general is more engagement with current events and francophonie. For me personally at least, while certainly Apollinaire, Truffaut, Molire, Voltaire, and all the other classic creators we were exposed to were tremendous, it was sometimes hard to connect on a personal level. I feel that more diversity in the curriculum would help people understand the implications of un monde francophone, and encourage them to seek out french-language activities and creators that they particularly connect with. A particular strength is the constant practice required by this class.",
    "The small class size and highly regimented, module-style of teaching was incredible. The emphasis on in-class conversation was likewise helpful.",
    "This course made it easy to keep up with the fairly high course load by providing frequent checkpoints and giving many opportunities to ask about difficult material; I think it covered a broad scope of information very efficiently. One grammar textbook was listed as a required text on the syllabus, and was much more expensive than the rest of the required books, at about $85 to rent for the semester. It was not assigned for reading or for exercises at all throughout the course. Just as a matter of cost, I think in the future this book should be used often in the course, or listed as an optional resource.",
    "The online system has a sharp learning curve, and lot of it is outdated. Maybe too much reliance on capretz.",
    "I think this is generally a well run course. I have no real complaints.",
    "Strength was that I was always engaged and it is helpful to learning French. The activities sometimes were very repetitive and there would be long pauses in between the recordings -- something I wish I could skip over. Its overall about 1-2 hours of homework everyday, and sometimes there are essays on the test day, which is double the work."

    "I really recommend this course to other students who also have interests in learning French. It really helped me improve a lot. I started learning French just in a year, but now looking back, I really made a great progress and I am so grateful about it.",
    "Yes, if you want to improve your French skills. But it recognizably is a decent amount of work.",
    "I think that I would absolutely recommend this course to anybody interested in pursuing French.",
    "I would most certainly recommend this course to another student. For me, there was a lot of daily homework, especially in the first month, but I feel more confident in my French skills, and excited to learn more.",
    "Yes. Mme. Fraysse is an INCREDIBLE teacher, and I learned a great deal.",
    "I would. The professor is good.",
    "Yes; the workload is intense at times, but the french course is a great track and makes the required language credits a productive use of time.",
    "Yes, but expect a lot of work.",
    "Yes, its a lot of work, but this course will definitely develop your skills",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student who isn't taking another language and any courses above 4.0 workload."
