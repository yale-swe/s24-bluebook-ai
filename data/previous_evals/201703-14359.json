    "Writing",
    "It is difficult to answer this question when the Professor is capable of giving us a lifetime of education in a term. Professor Shore guided us into gaining not only skills and insights meant for a historian but also those of a scholar of the craft of writing. I learnt a lot this semester from her, perhaps the most I have from any mentor ever, in academia. I am grateful for the same and hope that I will be capable enough to pass this on to my students.",
    "Developed a much deeper understanding of the components of totalitarian ideology and thinking, as well as of regional historic dynamics. Op-ed assignment format has been very interesting and useful as well."

    "Strengths The Professor was interested in us and our growth as scholars for life and not only for this particular class. Leaving her class on Mondays felt like one was ready to take on the world and its chaos. The practice of starting with a 'happy anecdote' was great too. The fact that the class attracted some of the best scholars who were ready to share their opinions was an added benefit.",
