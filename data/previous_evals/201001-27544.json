    "Fun and exciting, but challenging. Expect to pull one all-nighter a week, or take during a light semester. Or organize your time better than I do. All hand-work, no digital, so be prepared to have your room covered by small bits of paper. But overall I found it very rewarding. It was intimidating taking it without having much other artistic experience, but I found it inspiring rather than overwhelming. Try to take it with Henk--he's wonderful, supportive and personable, though still very high standards.",
    "Take this course if you're at all interested in gaining a basic knowledge of the way graphic design works. Be prepared for a lot of work, and don't expect to be able to get it all done the day before. You'll be doing a lot of work by hand, not by computer. It's fun, but be ready for the time-commitment.",
    "Take it!",
    "Yes I would definitely recommend this course to another student because knowing the basics of a good design\/composition will help you in other fields besides just art."
