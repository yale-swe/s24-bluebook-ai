    "I learned a lot about French literature since the early 20th century, and learned to discuss this literature at a grad-school level.",
    "This course offered a unique thematic approach to the study of modern French literature. Through an examination of the ideas of chance and constraint, we traced a genealogy of writers who otherwise might not be read together. The result was that the guiding concept we thought we understood were themselves altered and rethought throughout the course. The discussion, conducted in French, was challenging and rewarding. Wonderful course, overall."

   "comments": [
    "The course was incredibly impactful, and I learned a lot from my peers, though I feel that more specific feedback would have been appreciated.",
    "The syllabus was phenomenal. The balance between theory and fiction was ideal. I would only say that we spent perhaps a bit too long on the Surrealists and OuLiPo in the beginning of the course. The highlights, for me, were the lesser known contemporary authors."
