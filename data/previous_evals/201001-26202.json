   "comments": [
    "To those students interested in medicine, I would recommend this course to satisfy their language requirement.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. It is very easy as far as language classes, but also really well-taught and comprehensive. I would especially recommend it to pre-med students who are thinking of working with a Spanish-speaking population in the future.",
    "Definitely! It's great for brushing up on slightly rusty Spanish, because of the brevity of the texts and abundance of cognates as new vocabulary. It's a fun class, a lot of partner work, discussion, activities, and games, and not terribly difficult. The subject material, if you have any interest in health, medicine, or biology, is fantastic as well.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. It's a very easy L5 class and the work is minimal. As long as you answer questions in classes occasionally and do the homework, you can't really do poorly.",
    "This was a good course for learning medical vocabulary in Spanish and for practicing writing and reading skills. As a pre-med student who works in a free clinic in Fair Haven on the weekends, I found this to be very helpful. However, due to the size of the class (nearly 30 students) there were few opportunities to speak beyond short answers to simple questions. Given that speaking skills are probably the area where most students could use improvement, this was a setback. There are homework assignments due at the beginning of the every class (short written responses no more than 1 page), a midterm and final exam, and a group oral presentation at the end of the semester. The readings and homework take up a decent amount of time, but the tests are pretty easy.",
    "This would make a great fifth class.",
    "YES! A great experience, whatever your ability of L5 Spanish (believe me, they ranged from faltering to fluent, and no one felt uncomfortable). Take it - you won't regret.",
    "I strongly recommend taking this class for L5 language credit--I think it's a lot more fun to learn in Spanish about health and anatomy than about whatever nonsense you learn in Conversational Spanish. Many of the readings are genuinely interesting. That said, watch out for grade-grubbing pre-meds (like me, although I don't think I'd consider myself grade-grubbing). Also, you don't get to speak Spanish all that much: lots of reading and writing.",
    "You learn quite a lot of medical terms in Spanish, though its not really new information. There is reading and a writing assignment due for each class, but besides that the workload is in no way overwhelming. I would recommend it to a student comfortable in their Spanish abilities.",
    "TAKE THIS COURSE. It's early, but Prof Carreras is incredible and the class is both fascinating and relatively easy.",
    "I would recommend this class.",
    "Good class, take it if you have an interest in medicine and want to keep up your Spanish skills.",
    "It's exactly what it sounds like--learning about the body and medicine in Spanish, but it's really great, Mercedes Carreras is nice and helpful, the exams are really straightforward. I'm not pre-med and didn't really get bored, liked the class, and did well.",
    "Highly recommend this class. The material is very relevant for students interested in medicine and public health. It greatly expands your medical vocabulary. The workload is very manageable and Professor Carreras is great. It's a very relaxed and fun course.",
    "I would recommend the class to a student seeking to learn more about medicine. The course is more cursory but is practical to know if you are looking to going into the medical field.",
    "Spanish 225 is a relatively easy class for students who are at L5. The workload is pretty light and the material is very interesting. I would definitely recommend this class to any student that is interested in pursuing a career in medicine in the United States.",
    "Medical Spanish is a great course. Take it if you are interested in medical topics or want to work in a medical field in the future.",
    "This is a great low-stress but interesting class if you're a premed student looking to fulfill language requirements. The material is interesting, some of it might be review from previous health\/biology classes, but you get to learn how to talk about the material in Spanish, and how to apply Spanish vocabulary to contexts you may already know--this is very useful for students who plan to study\/research abroad in Spanish-speaking countries, especially in healthcare-related endeavors.",
    "Yes. This class helps your Spanish vocabulary and speaking abilities, but is never an overwhelming amount of work.",
    "I would definitely recommend it for anyone looking to learn more about medicine and learn Spanish medical vocabulary as well. It's more writing\/reading intensive than speaking, so it wasn't at all difficult. We had homework for every class that didn't take very long and only a midterm, a presentation, and a final essay.",
    "Its an ok class. Its very easy, so you get out as much as you put in.The actual classes were very repetitive. We literally did the same thing every day: she would ask us questions about the material, and then we would watch a short TV segment about a health issue.The material is pretty interesting, but it could be presented in a better way."
