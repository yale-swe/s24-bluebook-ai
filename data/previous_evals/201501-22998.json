    "This class holds auditions in the fall, and starts musical preparation for an early opera in the fall. The official classes starts in the spring and the show goes on near the end of the spring semester. The major purpose of the class is to analyze and perform early opera through hands-on experiences. Grant is awesome. We also had Sara Kohane and Prof. Ellen Rosand as coaches\/consultants. The production team is professional and amazing to work with. The resources available to us were simply incredible, from the staging director to the designers, from the beautiful set to the custom-made costumes and wigs. The cast were all wonderful. It was such a pleasure and joy working with them. The only minor issue is that staging rehearsals start after spring break, daily or every other day, followed by tech week and performances. Depending on your schedule, it could get a bit busy, but if you are well prepared, it's definitely worth it!",
    "The Yale Baroque Opera Project is a gem of a class, a true treasure for the students at Yale. You have the opportunity to work on a professional level opera production with industry professionals. It is beautiful, and you will be astounded at how much you learn!",
    "Absolutely. If you can get in, do it. When else will you be able to perform in an opera, be accompanied by period instruments, and receive professional hair\/make-up\/costume treatment? This was my first time performing in an opera and it was an incredibly memorable, exciting experience.",
    "DO IT. DO YBOP. Seriously, they put on an incredible production, it's so much fun and I learned a lot.",
    "YBOP is a one-of-a-kind experience - you get to work with really talented and committed directors, designers, and producers, all of whom are professionals and total experts. The rehearsal process is rapid - you spend the first half of the semester learning music and don't start staging until after spring break - so be prepared to spend quite a lot of time on this class after break. That said, before spring break it's basically no work - just some weekly vocal coachings, learning music, and one short paper. It will take over your life during tech week, which comes during the last week of classes. However, it really is a special experience and totally worth it if you enjoy performing and learning about baroque opera! Definitely do it if you think you can make it work schedule-wise."
