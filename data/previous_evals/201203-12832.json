    "I would recommend the course if you are to get this particular teacher. She is fantastic and made the course for me. The one downside of the course is that fact that you have homework just about every night, which is sometimes kind of annoying. However, if you get past that, then this just does a great job.",
    "take it with Barbara. She made a mandatory class much more enjoyable",
    "The spanish program as a whole has been very rigorous and a good experience, this course in particular.",
    "Spanish 130 is a good way to solidify the grammar you have been taught in 110 and 120.",
    "If you have to take it, try and get Safille.",
    "Yes. Get Barbara Safille, she is amazing.",
    "I would recommend spanish 130 because it is nicely paced.We learn basic tenses like present, past and future but we also learn present and imperfect subjunctive, conditional sentences and other crucial grammatical elements.",
    "I would. It's actually a great way to learn more Spanish and the workload is more manageable than L2.",
    "Spanish 130 is the natural progression in the Spanish program. It basically covers more grammar and you learn more about the culture. I recommend it to anyone who enjoys learning another language because it definitely throws you into the water and tells you to swim.",
    "L3 is just a typical language class, need to get through it to complete the language requirement but it's a good class and pretty easy.",
    "I would recommend it for a student who wants to do a language"
