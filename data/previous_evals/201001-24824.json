    "Definitely take this class. The workload is the best of any class at Yale. There is a 3 page paper, and that's basically it. You do have to commit a lot of time near the end of the semester to rehearsals, but it is very fun. You will not find another class like this at Yale. Prof. Georgeo is fantastic and a lot of fun. You will have a great time putting this play together. It is a very relaxing experience, especiallyin comparison to other Yale courses.",
    "It's a good class. The organization and emphasis on the play could be better, but it's a very fun experience. When else will you get the chance to act in a play in Italian?",
    "Great class! Be prepared for a large workload at the end of the semester, but it's super fun to put on the play as the final exam. A good balance of writing\/reading\/acting. It's a great credit to balance \"normal\" classes, even though it can be a fair amount of work.",
    "Yes! Take it! It's really fun, especially if you enjoy Italian in and of itself. It takes a while to feel comfortable with the play but once you do it's really a blast. Monica and Carol are absolutely wonderful, they really make the final performance a special experience. I would definitely recommend it."
