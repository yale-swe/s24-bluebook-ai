    "I liked the pace and I really appreciated the quizzes. I think that they hold everyone accountable to preparing the text for class and give good opportunities for assessment throughout the semester. The commentary assignments were helpful as well, although I think I would have liked to go over the components of a quality commentary in class. In addition to our typical translation classes, I was pleased that we were able to make it to the Beinecke to see a manuscript of the Historia. I think if I could make a suggestion or two it would be that we have a bit more review for the exam (since it is cumulative) and, if possible, a test date after the reading period has ended to make sure there is time to study for the exam. This is made more difficult by the differences between the Divinity and GSAS schedules, I think. Finally, if I can make one more comment (based entirely on personal preference), I would prefer to have a final project rather than an exam or, perhaps, an exam that is worth a slightly smaller percentage of the total grade."

    "Yes, I would. The subject was entertaining and the class environment was lovely.",
    "Absolutely. The class was very useful as an introduction to Medieval Latin for students coming in at different levels. The time commitment for the class pays off in the improvement to Latin reading and comprehension. It is especially useful in pointing out the differences between Medieval and Classical Latin."
