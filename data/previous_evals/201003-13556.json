    "YES. Whether you are interested in the environment, politics, or business...this is an amazing class.",
    "Take it if you are at all interested in climate change, energy, the environment, or management. You will get a lot out of this course, tailored to your specific interests as well.",
    "Especially for a undergrad this class is great to take. There's no final and no paper, just a presentation, which is a nice change of pace. Prof. Brewer really likes his students and makes time to help them with whatever they need.",
    "An overview of major environmental issues. Not too stressful and Prof. Brewer is really caring and helpful.",
    "Management& Environment gives a broad survey of many topical environmental issues from a practical, business-minded perspective. The content is very interesting, and you'll get to really dig into a topic of your choosing for the main project. Nearly all of the work is group-work, so you must be prepared to work with others and coordinate amongst Yale college students, SOM students, and FES students. If you're interested in the topic and don't mind group work, then I definitely recommend this course."
