   "comments": [
    "If you can get into Movie Physics, you're a fool not to take it. Professor Robinson is super cool and you'll learn a ton. I took it just to fulfill a distributional requirement, but it was still one of the most fun classes I've taken at Yale.",
    "If you can get in, take the course! It's a good SC and QR credit, and you'll actually enjoy yourself. The PSets are totally doable, and the exams are fair, although I would recommend working\/studying with a group or partner from the class. I had never studied physics in any way before, and this class was really fun and interesting for me.",
    "If you're in need of a QR or science credit it's a great way to get one with out killing yourself",
    "NOT A GUT DO NOT TAKE IF YOU THINK THIS IS A GUT",
    "Simplified physics course. Well structured. Good for students who aren't great with math but want to learn physics.",
    "Science credit for non science major who is comfortable with math-- you should take a bio class if you think you'll struggle with the physics and math parts of this course they are not that easy.",
    "It is more difficult than it would appear to be. However it is easier than most other science classes and the work load isn't too bad",
    "Difficult physics class different than basic physics course.",
    "Movie Physics has a reputation as an easy QR or Science credit, but as someone who had never taken physics before, some of it was pretty difficult. Overall, though, it's still a good class for humanities people and is very doable. Some of it is interesting; some not so much, but Professor Robinson is great and it's a pretty low-key class.",
    "Only if you need a QR.",
    "I would definitely recommend PHYS 101 to students who will not be pursuing math and science careers, or to students who need to meet a requirement, or to students who need visuals to understand physics.",
    "Not as it is now. I think the course itself was cool, and Professor Robinson did well, but there needs to be a change in the course. I found it much more difficult than it should have been - not because of the material but because of its delivery.",
    "An intro physics course. I would highly recommend the class if you haven't taken physics before.",
    "It's a fun and interesting way to get a science credit, engaging, and somewhat practically applicable. I would probably recommend it to another student, though I would make sure to tell them not to buy the book.",
    "This class was definitely more challenging than I thought it would be, but office hours are very helpful.",
    "This class is for those with little math\/physics background. It's not a gut, its like any other basic intro level course, but instead of hypothetical questions, we use movie clips. It's meant to teach you how to guesstimate things instead of having to do laborious equations. It's very helpful in the real world. Mr. Robinson is truly one of the most passionate, knowledgeable professors at Yale and his willingness to go out of his way to help is unparalleled. Highly recommended for non-science\/math majors.",
    "good for someone who needs a QR (but definitely not a gut)",
    "Yes, if they think they are okay at dealing with abstract concepts and can argue through theories"
