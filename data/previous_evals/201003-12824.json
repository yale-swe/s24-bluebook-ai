    "It's the senior essay...? Not much to say. Obviously, how you feel about it depends largely on your topic, your advisor, and your interests.",
    "Take it if you are interested in applying your econ skills to a research topic.",
    "Absolutely. It is a great chance to do something different and research what you want. It has been an incredible experience thus far.",
    "A senior essay isn't for everyone, but if you have an idea for something you'd like to study, it's a great experience.",
    "In this course, you choose an economics-related topic and write an essay about it. You must also choose an advisor, and meet with him or her as often as he or she and you would like to meet. I would absolutely recommend this to another student. I don't like writing, but getting two credits for an essay of moderate length is an excellent deal.",
    "sure, do it",
    "It's the Economics Senior Essay. If you really want to write a senior essay, take it.",
    "Your mileage may vary. Do not underestimate the importance of a great advisor, and do not underestimate the time commitment, especially for a single-semester essay. Overall, if these preconditions are there, then the senior essay is a great introduction to the world of real research that will prove invaluable regardless of whether you decide to enter academia or not.",
    "If you can find a topic that really interests you a lot, then go ahead. However, sometime data collection is very tedious and time consuming. The workload really depends on each individual projects.",
    "I recommend this class for economics majors.",
    "The Senior Essay is great practice for students that want to develop hands-on their economic analysis skills. I highly recommend it.",
    "I recommend writing a senior essay. It was a good experience, just start early and don't let yourself get behind.",
    "Well... take it if you want to write a senior essay in Econ :)",
    "I recommend writing a senior thesis because you gain skills that you most likely will never get (or to this magnitude) in a class. Just being able to think through a model and come up with an empirical approach and do actual analyses is empowering and makes you feel like an actual economics major. Seems odd that the vast majority of Yale students getting econ degrees don't know how to do these things, yet they still are economics majors. I think about all that I've learned through this process, and I am surprised that so many people choose not to do the essay. It seems like the students who choose to not do an econ senior essay are really missing out on getting the full economics-major experience.",
    "Only do this if you are thoroughly interested in the topic you are going to write on. It is only as fun and rewarding as you make it. It is a gratifying experience though.",
    "Definitely take the course if you are really interested in economics",
    "It is what it is",
    "Writing a thesis is optional, and if you're not committed to it, it becomes difficult to motivate yourself. But if you want to do it, I wholeheartedly recommend it.",
    "Sure. it's great to have the chance to focus solely on my senior thesis for an entire year.",
    "Do it! you won't regret it; you will regret not doing it. trust me."
