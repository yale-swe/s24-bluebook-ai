   "comments": [
    "Although lectures are interesting, tests are very tough, and there is a TON of reading that you have to do!",
    "If you think war and\/or theory suck, DONT TAKE THIS. you talk about them way too much",
    "Great class, if he ever teaches it again jump on it",
    "Definitely consider taking this regardless of your intention to further study IR and political science. Your understanding of the world and critical thinking will improve immensely. Rational choice theory is drawn upon throughout the course without delving into the math. Yes, the readings are extensive. But also, you can get away with reading the major half of them. Some of the readings are very interesting; focus on two or three a week and you should be fine. Take it for your SO- it's a great option. Monteiro is an awesome lecturer.",
    "The class was very interesting and would be a great one to audit but I was forced to leave it credit\/d due to the severely screwed up way they graded the midterm. They graded to a rubric which means that if you didn't put down the exact points they have on their answer sheet they can't give you any points -- all sorts of messed up. Interesting class; pity about the grading system.",
    "This is a class on international politics. It is interesting if you have an interest in theory and history. If not, don't take the course. It definitely examines very relevant theory to current foreign affairs and offers an interesting outlook on grand strategy. Definitely a good class for anyone interested in politics or international relations. Monteiro also makes this class. I don't know if it would be nearly as good without him.",
    "Good class with not too heavy a workload",
    "Awesome class, you'll understand the wars and their implications much better.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone who's interested in international relations and IR scholars' view on recent history. Unfortunately Monteiro won't be giving this lecture anymore, but regardless it should remain a very interesting and engaging class. The workload with Monteiro was substantial but manageable if taken care of regularly. Prepare well for the midterm, because there is only one and it is harder than the usual political science lecture midterm.",
    "Awesome IR class for anyone who does not want just a basic Intro to IR kind of class but wants to go more in depth into a certain aspect\/theory of IR! Definitely encouraged for anyone who is considering political science or global affairs, and even for those who are not, it gives you a new perspective of how the world has interacted and will be interacting in the future. It is not an easy class however, but if you put in effort for the readings and take notes during lectures, you should be fine! Professor Nuno is an amazing lecturer as well so you will enjoy sitting and listening even if you are taking it Credit D\/Fail.",
    "PLSC 126 is a historical and theoretical approach to international relations through balance of power realism. You will go from 19th c. Europe through Modern American polarity and a plethora of theories about the balance of power. The topics are stellar if you're at all interested in international relations. There's a lot of reading, though, so consider starting it Credit\/D and seeing how you do. Definitely take it if you can, though.",
    "Worth taking with Nuno if possible. A lot of reading, but it is all very interesting and relevant. Most of the readings are covered in the lecture, though. the exams are very fair, but the IDs are graded harshly.",
    "Prof Monteiro is a good lecturer, but make sure the topics interest you before you commit to taking the class. The material is a mix of military history, political history and IR theory in the 20th. I enjoyed of the history portion, but found the theory really dry and uninteresting.",
    "Interesting course if you are into international relations and international security. Very focused on military force so just keep that in mind. Can get a little too into the details of individual military conflicts but usually salvages this flaw by putting it in the context of a larger theory.",
    "I was intimidated by the workload of this class, especially as a STEM major, so I took the class Cr\/D. It was one of the most rewarding courses I have taken at Yale. The reading was heavy, but the Cr\/D option allowed me to skim the readings while getting this most out of lecture. I would recommend this class to anyone who wants to have a deeper understanding of global affairs, nuclear proliferation, or just enough knowledge to deeply engage in discourse about current events.",
    "Absolutely take this class when it is offered again (not for another 4-5 years...), or at the very least audit it. Professor Monteiro is a phenomenal lecturer. I never once felt sleepy while listening to him (which is actually a huge accomplishment -- I fall asleep in a lot of classes, even seminars and sections). He is funny as hell, and loves what he teaches. He knows his stuff. As for the reading, I didn't really do much of it. That made me not appreciate the section as much as I might have, but that's why I think auditing is a good option for this class if you can bring yourself to do it. Section sucked, readings were too long, lecture was so good it tips the balance (of power?!) in favor of this class. Take it cr\/d\/f?",
    "It's a lot of reading, but the lectures cover a lot of it. Definitely a class you should take.",
    "It is a course which covers theories about the balance of power from pre-WW1 to the modern day nuclear world. I was not that interested in history but taking Monteiro's class and listening to his lecture on WW1 and WW2 really made me appreciate it more. The concepts he discusses are applicable to international relations concepts we deal with today. You don't have to be a humanities major to appreciate the course, and it is not so difficult that you can't do well if you don't have that much experience in history. I would recommend it.",
    "It's a great class to take! But be ready for the insane amount of assigned readings each week.",
    "BOP is a part history, part poll sci course that begins with a more historical perspective on WWI and WWII, and then shifts towards more current day issues like Ukraine and Iran. It definitely gives you a better sense of the world around you, and uses just the right amount of theory that you're able to tolerate it. Although there is a lot of reading that is assigned, you don't really have to do most of it if you pay attention in section and lecture. The readings are important to cite on the exams, but as long as you site a few of them, you'll probably be fine. Overall, I would definitely recommend this class to someone, but it is WAY harder than Intro IR. It is a legit Yale political science class.",
    "I would definitely recommend it. Super interesting lectures and subject matter. Incredibly relevant to what is happening today.",
    "PLSC 126 is a course which covers the major conflicts of the last 100 years while explaining the political science theory constructed to explain those events. I would recommend this class to anyone with even a passing interest in political science.",
    "BEST. CLASS. EVER.",
    "Very interesting and engaging as a course, with a great set of material. I would absolutely recommend it.",
    "Anyone with little to no experience in IR theory who wants to change that should take this class.",
    "Brilliant course. Take the class if you're at all interested in history. Perhaps the best course I've taken at Yale. I'd recommend this to anyone even if you Cr\/D the class.",
    "This class provides a mix of history as well as IR theory. There are readings every week ranging from 200-400 pages. There are only three response papers, each only two pages long. There is a midterm and a final. Overall it is a good class.",
    "If you really need to take it, do so. Otherwise, its extremely technical and boring at times.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. You will get a lot out of it.",
    "Good class",
    "It's a fun intro course, although I think you need a little background in the history.",
    "I'd recommend the class if you're looking for an introduction to very general political theory and history of the 20th century.",
    "Amazing class! Take it. It will change your outlook.",
    "I'd definitely recommend Balance of Power as an intro IR course to a fellow student -- The professor is great, the material is interesting and pertinent, and it's a great Cr\/D\/Fail class for those not super into IR. The finals and midterm are hard and harshly graded though, so beware. Lectures are great and enlightening -- some of the best at Yale. It was a little too realist focused for me at times, but a great class!",
    "Great course and approach to ir theory and applications. Nuno is an amazing lecturer and I highly recommend this class as a good 4th or 5th class.",
    "Originally, I had not intended to take Balance of Power, but after shopping the first lecture, I was lured in by Monteiro's fabulous lecturing style. He brought great passion and knowledge to the class. I found the first half of the course to be especially persuasive as political science theory was melded with historical thought. It was especially interesting to analyze the world wars based on balance of power laws. But I found that the second half of the course lacked focus. Not enough time was devoted to specific examples of historical wars, and therefore the theory became abstract and therefore less persuasive. I found a reading in the second to last week that discussed the definition of the term balance of power especially elucidation. The author claimed that the term has been used in so many different ways that it lacks a concrete definition. I felt as though I completed the course with a less clear image of the definition of balance of power than when I began it. Monteiro assigned several articles per class, many of which argued contrasting analyses of war patterns. Although I appreciated his attempt to provide students with a range of perspectives, I found the prolific number of arguments covered over the course to be overwhelming. Unfortunately, the lectures did not succeed for me, in the end, of synthesizing these perspectives into a cohesive theory of the balance of power.",
    "Professor Monteiro is an excellent lecturer, and I was roped in to taking BoP because his first lecture was so good. And while I though most lectures and readings were interesting, the course as a whole was somewhat disappointing. The first half of the course was basically a history class, and the second was game theory combined with some oddly specific military history of the postwar era. All this was fine and was supposed to lead up to some conclusions about American strategy now and going forward, but that part of the course was anticlimactic. We didn't seem to draw any conclusions or develop any really new ways of thinking about international crises. Rather, we read long articles making relatively common-sense points about why the U.S. should pursue one policy over another. The amount reading was also deceptive. The syllabus said there would be 50-100 pages of reading a lecture, which was quite an understatement, especially given how dense some of the readings were. In general, it's a fine course that covers some cool ideas, but it's nothing life-changing, and the amount of work involved might not be justified.",
    "The lectures are amazing, but there's a ridiculous amount of reading and the grading is pretty hard. Definitely recommend you take it credit\/d if you're interesting in the material but not a history buff already.",
    "Yes, it is arguably the best use of a cred d option",
    "Balance of Power is an awesome class and an introduction to Balance of Power Theory and IR realism that provides you with a framework for evaluating modern day international politics. Monteiro is an awesome teacher and you should definitely take this class!",
    "One of my favorite political science classes I've taken. If you're into IR, military history, power politics, etc. it's a must take. Not a bad workload at all. Only pitfall is the grading is kinda tough but no one I know did poorly.",
    "I really recommend taking Balance of Power with Professor Monteiro. It is an amazing course that broadens your understanding of world politics, both historically and currently. The things we learned are very applicable to current events, and professor Monteiro made sure to incorporate those events into lecture. Professor Monteiro is an amazing lecturer, very passionate, engaging, and fair. However, I would advise taking the course on a light schedule, and taking it credit\/D\/Fail.",
    "I'd recommend it highly",
    "This is a fantastic course in that you will look at the world around you in a slightly different way. Professor Monteiro forces you to take international relations theory very seriously, and it was so worth it. There is a lot of reading (some superfluous it seemed, but all interesting) but the lectures and sections make up for any gaps. Overall, a great class that I would recommend to anyone.",
    "Balance of Power was a fantastic class. You'll come away from the year having learned a lot of history, especially recent history, as well as balance of power theory and you will have gained a new context through which to look at current events having to do with international relations. Professor Monteiro is an awesome professor who is tremendously competent and will keep you engaged and entertained while throwing a ton of information at you. It's a lot of reading, but all of the important reading is covered in lecture and in section, and it ends up not being overly demanding.",
    "If you like International Relations and are occupied with other classes, take it Credit\/D. If Professor Monteiro is teaching it, it will probably be the most interesting class you take this semester. The readings are sizeable and there is a decent workload, but it's the perfect Credit\/D class.",
    "very interesting course! prof monteiro is an excellent lecturer and the material is delivered in a very systematic and manageable way. I took it credit\/d but probably didn't need to\u2014tests were manageable and there was no essay.",
    "Pretty interesting course if you like political science. Take it because Nuno doesn't teach it often.",
    "I would recommend it. It is very interesting, applicable material, and might change your views on international relations.",
    "This is a really great class to take for anyone who has no clue about international balance of power or why nations behave the way they do (and why we have wars and international conflicts). It truly opened my eyes. I also feel more educated when reading international news.",
    "This was an amazing class and Monteiro is an amazing lecturer!"
