    "Great class! Stever sensei and Maruyama sensei know how to promote a friendly and fun learning environment. You don't know how much you've learned until the end of the course when you realize that, \"yeah, I did learn a lot!\". Much more fun than the beginner and intermediate levels of Japanese; worth taking after the first 2 years in order to experience a more relaxed and fun learning environment.",
    "I would recommend the class to anyone hoping to continue studying Japanese.",
    "This is the second level of L5 at Yale. The reading material is really very interesting, and with your completion of this class, you will have a pretty darn good grasp on conversational Japanese. Advice: do your work! Though there are a lot of little assignments that add up to a pretty small part of your grade, most of the homework will actually improve your ability and keep Japanese fresh in your mind. Otherwise, pretty much straightforward! God, I love the Japanese program here.",
    "Take it! You'll learn a lot and have fun.",
    "The class itself is very well-taught and quite interesting. Furthermore, if you want to keep up with your language study, I have found that the only way is to continue taking higher and higher levels. If you have taken a Japanese class at Yale, you already know how much homework you should expect (even if it is slightly less than that of L1).",
    "A lot more independent than the first two years of Japanese, but of course, that's expected. It's also every other day, so you should really be disciplined about spreading the workload over two days instead of cramming in three hours of homework the night before. At first, I didn't think I was getting too much out of the class because I was losing so much speaking ability from doing Light in Japan over the summer, but you will definitely improve - they're just more subtle. I realized just how much I had improved my ability to read articles, write coherent essays, and retain kanji only when I took the final.",
    "Great continuation of the Japanese language sequence at Yale."
