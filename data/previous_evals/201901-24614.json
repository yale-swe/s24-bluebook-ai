    "Really phenomenal course.",

We started with thinkers such as Liddell Hart, Clausewitz, and Kennedy, and moved onto numerous case studies of grand strategy: the British and Germans in both world wars, and the US from the Cold War through today. Attention to how the US's unique characteristics as a country influence its approaches to foreign policy.",

    "Very good course",
    "The strengths are that the readings are very interesting along with the discussions during class especially when the rest of the class participates and brings in different points of view. The weaknesses are such that the professor schedules in reading weeks, which are helpful, but we lack the in class discussion aspect of the course",
    "The material of this course was very interesting, and Professor Wilson was engaging in seminar. I would, however, have enjoyed more time in seminar to discuss the multitude of readings we were assigned.",
    "Strengths: strong and interesting class debates and discussion, interesting readings, thorough treatment of material, questioning of assumptions Weaknesses: too many readings and not all of them were relevant"

    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone has interest in grand strategy, and learning more about it. I understand that we hear the term grand strategy every day, but may not be familiar with what it is. This course takes us onto a historical dive into grand strategy and how the United States has formed is grand strategy throughout history",
    "Yes, but I hear that Professor Wilson will not be coming back, unfortunately.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in learning more about the history of U.S. grand strategy and foreign policy-making. The class provides an understanding of the classic theories of grand strategy and helps you understand the U.S. situation today."
