   "comments": [
    "It's a two days of lecture a week and one of section. It's required for Theatre Studies majors, so if that's your goal, you'll need to take this class sooner or later. You can take it for just a semester, but if you want to be a Theatre Studies major, you have to take it for two semesters.Professor Roach is an excellent lecturer and knows an incredible amount about theatre of all eras and cultures. His sense of humor is excellent, ahelpful trait when sitting in lecture.",
    "THST 110 is an okay course if you are interested in the history of theater. It covers an unmanageable span of time, and so the content of the class gets compromised so as to cover all the time periods. Professor Roach can be very entertaining, but he tends to get lost in the performance of the lecture and so fails to mention crucial facts.",
    "Theater Studies 110 O1 is a study of the philosophy of theatre. I would only recommend it to another student if they LOVED theater because it is very difficult. However, if they love theater and are planning to be a theatre studies major and possibly go into the field then they should take it.",
    "Review of theater history and techniques from ancient Greece to Elizabethan\/Renaissance stage. There are final performances during the last fourth of the class, which are really fun to be a part of and witness. The plays are pretty fun to read, the theory was horrible, in my opinion, although some people liked it. Professor Roach is GREAT! I'm not going to say all the lectures were \"exciting\" all the time, but his enthusiasm and stories definitely made them interesting. I would recommend it - it was my most interesting class this semester, and you learn so much. Warning though: sections are not very fun until the end of the year.",
    "It's a prereq for the theater studies major, so youre going to have to take it if you want to take acting classes. the first half of the semester is way harder than the second. the material is more dense and frustrating. the lecture has absolutely nothing to do with the reading. theres honestly no point in going to lecture except that attendance is taken.",
    "Do not take this class unless you need to fulfill the prerequisite for the Theatre major. Seriously. It is just not worth it. Oh, and you will not develop as an actor or anything; it is a completely cerebral course which is an absolute shame. I mean, this is THEATRE. THEATRE is not intended to be an intellectual study!",
    "Theater 110 was far from the best class that I took this semester. The readings are interesting and all things that an educated actor, director, etc should have read. However, I found the lecture far from engaging and section to be not particularly beneficial. That said, if you want to continue in theater, you have to get through this class, so just do it. You'll meet great people and you'll read great plays.",
    "Take this class--it is lots of fun and not that much work. Joe Roach is wonderful.",
    "I would definitely recommend Brian Valencia as a TA. If you are a theater major you have no choice but to take the class. If you are not a theater major I would not particularly recommend the class because there is too much work for 1 semester. We reviewed approximately 1000 years of theater in one semester....that's too much in my opinion.",
    "YOU HAVE TO TAKE THIS CLASS. No, I'm not joking. Joe Roach is amazing, charismatic, and if he were a few years younger I would have the biggest crush on him (I think I do anyway). He's the kind of person who has so much knowledge that you just want to sit there and absorb everything he says.",
    "THST 110a is a comprehensive overview of theatre history from the origins of theatre until the Renaissance. It also introduces students to key theories about theatre and effective ways of thinking about theatre. The course allows students to put the concepts they have learned into action and teach each other with final studio performances.I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It teaches students how to experience and create theatre from a completely altered perspective. It enriches the artistic experience in a way that I think it valuable to students in many disciplines.",
    "This is a tough class to get through, but I hear that the higher level courses are more fu. The best part of the class are the studio performances; they are the reason I'm not dropping next semester.",
    "I would recommend it to anyone interested in theater. The atmosphere in class is great and the reading also.",
    "Yes, I'd recommend it to anyone interesting in creating a solid foundation of theater based knowledge and obviously to anyone interested in pursuing it in school or in life.",
    "Theater Studies 110 is a course based primarily in reading many plays and critical essays from the earliest to today's works and understanding their place in the History of Theater. Honestly, if you don't mind reading a few plays a week and enjoy discussing theater from its production to its social and political significance, you'll like this class. It is a more than decent amount of work but you should have a basic outline of the entire history of western theater by the end of it.",
    "It's a smattering of different ancient theatrical styles. I'd recommend it to anyone interested in pursuing theater, as it provides a good fundamental understanding of the subject.",
    "Although it is one of those humdrum, necessary introductory courses, it's by no means the worst one out there. Classes were generally enjoyable and work in section made the class one of my favorites.",
    "I would summarize the course as an introduction to the history of theater. I would recommend it to another student if they knew nothing about theater and wanted to become aware of it, or if they were interested in pursuing the major.",
    "I LOVED this class. The workload is demanding (especially studio) but you get to read tons of awesome plays, listen to the wonderfully insightful and intelligent Professor Roach lecture, and put on your own studio performance! This class was the highlight of my semester.",
    "I would recommend this class to students who are very interested in all aspects of theater, especially the evolution of the physical stage and the culture around different genres of theater. This class is a lot of work, but very rewarding in the end. The section performance was a highlight of the class and made the hard work worth it."
