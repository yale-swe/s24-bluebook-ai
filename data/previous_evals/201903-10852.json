    "You learn a ton in this class. You cover a quick overview of micro theory, \"general equilibrium,\" and then some additional applications.",
    "Microeconomic theory at a graduate level (slides and text were the same as those used in the graduate equivalent course) How to prove economic concepts and formulas",
    "- General equilibrium with application in finance",
    "Learned a great deal about microeconomic theory throughout the first half of the course, and then we honed in on general equilibrium theory in particular for the latter half. Developed mathematical maturity (especially through some exposure to proofs) developed economic-reasoning skills. Got a taste of what going to graduate school for economics might feel like.",
    "I learnt about notions of equilibrium, welfare and different topics in financial economies. This course was a good introduction to grad level economics. I was particularly grateful at the opportunity of completing a research paper in mathematical economics.",
    "general equilibrium theory mainly, random financial topics\/applications like asset pricing\/no arbitrage",
    "This class definitely went over general equilibrium (think hyped up version of intermediate micro) for the first half of the semester and then went off the rails in the second half. We covered a wide range of topics from finance (asset pricing, CAPM, binomial trees, arbitrage), uncertainty, incomplete markets, and many other scenarios for equilibrium, but at way too quickly and with not enough time to fully understand any of the topics.",
    "GET, some micro theory review, applications to finance, some math, time management.",
    "I learned about the foundations of finance.",
    "Rigorous introduction to mathematical economics in the context of general equilibrium theory. We made good use of set notation and higher dimensional calculus to understand classical demand and production theory, positive and normative concepts in general equilibrium, asset pricing theory, and complete\/incomplete market theory.",
    "This course builds on Micro Theory (not a prereq), starting from the foundations of General Equilibrium and looking at positive and normative results. We covered Arrow-Debreu and Radner equilibria, and ended with some models of incomplete markets.",
    "GE theory, extending to applications and incomplete markets",
    "Foremost, I appreciated exercising economic intuition. I did not expect so many topics in finance, but perhaps that's my naivete.",
    "This course was a challenging and rigorous treatment of General Equilibrium Theory and related topics. The first half of the course delved deeply into the positive and normative results such as existence and conditions for efficiency. The second half of the course really took off, and we discussed challenging topics like n-replica economies, equilibrium under uncertainty with and without trading (Arrow-Debreu or Radner), the theory of asset pricing and no-arbitrage conditions, and constrained borrowing with bankruptcy and secured credit frameworks.",
    "Learned a wide variety of general eq concepts including topics that are currently at the forefront of GE research",
    "Why economy can be interpreted as an equilibrium product of interdependent agents; how to price assets; value of financial markets"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strength: the material is interesting and the Professor is very approachable. Weakness: the homework take 20 hours roughly and is weighted a very small amount in the overall grade. Given the amount of time we spent on the homework, it should be weighted more.",
    "The challenge of this course was really rewarding, but at the same time, some concepts were presented in a way that made it hard to actually understand them. While it's cool that this course used a lot of materials that are designed for PhD students, we are still undergraduates taking a 300-level course, and some topics and asides could have been left out so it was clear what we were actually expected to know and understand. There was a gap in difficulty between the way topics were explained in class (very clearly), the slides (a lot less clear; there was hard to see what the link between different ideas was), the PSETs (brutal), and the final exam (hell). Maybe redesigning the slides so that the flow of the lecture is more clear and giving a final closer in difficulty to the midterm (which was very fair and still had a good distribution) would help us internalize the concepts and insights of the course better.",
    "- Large coverage - Good problem sets",
    "Strengths: The subject matter's fascinating. We covered A LOT of material in this class, as we started from the foundations of microeconomic theory (much like ECON125) and ended up getting to topics at the forefront of research in general equilibrium theory today. I got a great deal of exposure to high-level economics, which will most definitely end up informing my future decisions regarding graduate school in economics. The teaching materials (slides, handouts, readings) that Professor Dvila were very thorough and accessible. Professor Dvila was stellar (especially considering the fact that it was his first time teaching this course in particular). In the moment, problem sets (we had five total, each of which took 10+ hours) felt strenuous, but I've realized that they were actually pretty well written and intellectually stimulating. Weaknesses: At times, the class can feel like it's moving too fast, or that the material's a little too advanced for an undergraduate class. But this concern of mine was mitigated by the fact that the professor really downplayed the importance of grades and emphasized the importance of learning for the sake of learning.",
    "Dr Davila is an astounding professor who was clearly dedicated teaching and had a passion for GE. He and the TA Antzelos were the absolute highlights of the class. I wish however that it was clearer in the beginning that were going to cover topics in financial economics, since some might not have a basic understanding of how financial markets work or an interest in it. I wish we had a preliminary class dedicated to key ideas in financial economics that we were expected to know. We could have covered topics like externalities a bit more in depth. Also, the amount of material and detail we had to cover was a bit overwhelming and tests were extremely tasking.",
    "strengths: interesting topics are covered, professor while crazy sometimes is always super energetic weaknesses: super long psets, difficult to understand lectures\/lecture slides, extremely long exams",
    "Way too much work. Problem sets each took about 30-40 hours and were extensively long, with tedious amounts of calculations and often without comparable examples in class or TA sections to guide us. The lectures were very fast-paced and assumed that we understood or had previously learned things we had not covered. We'd barely digested one topic before moving onto the next one. Long proofs were presented in a matter of minutes.",
    "Strengths -- analytical rigor interesting material, engaged lecturing. Weaknesses -- some of the material might just be difficult for the sake of difficult, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but the balance could probably be tilted a bit away from that.",
    "Strengths: Very challenging, good introduction to grad school economics classes. Weaknesses: - I think the course tries to cover too much disparate topics. - Too few psets; I like having more so that I can practice regularly",
    "Course is good at giving you a taste of what a first-year PhD course in economics looks like. There is plenty of class and section material to get around the difficult textbook descriptions for certain topics. When I took it there were 5 homework assignments, with each being quite long. Maybe it would be better to have more homework assignments that are shorter so that everything is not dumped all at once.",
    "Strengths: very well organized and structured, big picture of the course ties together really nicely, good balance between theory and some applications\/examples Weaknesses: confusing at times",
    "Professor is very knowledgeable and helpful but lacks interaction with the class",
    "Strengths - first half of the course covered pretty fundamental economic theory. Problem sets were insightful. Paper assignment was fun. Weaknesses - the course unfortunately prioritized quantity of topics and sacrificed depth of understanding. Since lecture slides were used, many theorems and expressions were declared and not carefully proved or derived. There were no official office hours. Problem sets were sometimes too algebraic.",
    "The course was generally good and intellectually-stimulating. The second-half of the course, however, was presented very fast. Much of the time, the students had to figure out the topics together on problem sets, which were bi- to tri-weekly and had solutions over 10 pages on average. This workload is hard, but allowed us to learn together. The exams were also very challenging and especially the final.",
    "Strengths: This class was challenging. The concepts near the end of the course were technical and not very intuitive. The class was fairly well structured. Everything we learned was contained on slides and you could tell the professor was thoughtful about what he was teaching. Prof Davila was really approachable and very passionate about the material. He constantly asked us for feedback on the course and actually implemented it. Our TA Angelo was solid. He didn't really help us at all on the homework, but he worked really hard to make sections useful and responded to emails efficiently. The midterm was really fair. It was hard, but wasn't absurdly so. Weaknesses: PSETs were WAY TOO HARD and LONG. Like I'm talking they each took me like 30 hours to do (although there were only 5 total the entire semester). We found out at the end of the semester that he gave the exact same psets to his phd course. There needs to be more help available for those PSETs. It was like getting thrown into a fire pit with your classmates -- spending an entire week just thinking about how to do like two problems (out of 11). Material near the end was hard to the point where none of us understood what the general ideas we were discussing were. The final was really difficult and long but this is fairly typical of courses like GE.",
    "ECON 350 is not an easy course and not for the faint hearted. Even if you are an econ and math major, you have the choice of not taking this class, and I think that's a decision worth considering. However, if you are seriously considering economics graduate school and looking to get exposure to grad school material, this is the perfect course. This year, it actually ended up being that the content for the undergrad level was the same as the first-year grad school course, so you more or less got the \"true\" grad school experience. While definitely challenging, the course was well taught, and looking back on the semester, I can definitely say I learned more in this economics class than any other I've taken at Yale.",
    "Strengths: Prof. is very dedicates; classmates are very engaged; clear slides; psets deepen understanding. Weakness: may need to wait a long time to see how everything is connected in the course"

   "comments": [
    "You will probably hate this class when you're up at 5 am doing the homework for the second or third night in a row, feeling really stupid. You'll also probably love this class when you derive some major financial models as corollaries to general equilibrium and when you finally understand. It will greatly improve your understanding of economics, so just for that reason you should take it. However, most people are pre-PhD and\/or Econ-math majors, and it does take a lot of time, effort, and attention to keep up with the material.",
    "Yes; if they're considering a PhD in Economics, this course is a great sneak-peak of the first-year coursework.",
    "Recommend to students interested in theoretical economics",
    "Absolutely. If you're thinking about studying economics in graduate school, this course will probably give you a good idea of what first-year PhDs learn and think about. But even if you're not thinking about an advanced degree, I feel like this course forced me to develop some mathematical maturity and critical thinking skills, and I'm grateful for that. Also, to my knowledge Yale is the only university that offers general equilibrium theory at the undergraduate level (and many of the academics who shaped the field over the past few decades have taught this course). Last, if Professor Dvila's teaching, take it! He's full of energy and enthusiasm and has a great sense of humor (and conveys information well).",
    "Yes, if youre in Econ and math you have to. I would recommend this class to anyone interested in ideas related to welfare and free markets who was the math skills to handle it.",
    "only if they have to for the math-econ major or want to attend grad school for Econ. otherwise, there are much better, less-stressful, easier, more engaging classes.",
    "I would not recommend this class unless if you are a Math\/Econ major who needs this for the degree. The workload is incredibly unmanageable and the lecturing is very dry, although it is an interesting topic.",
    "Yes",
    "Probably not unless they really have to.",
    "If you are considering a PhD in economics, definitely take this class. It gives a valuable introduction to the kind of rigor that will be expected of you if you go down that road. Aside from that, I'm not sure if this is the kind of class you \"take for fun\"",
    "Yes, especially if you've taken micro theory. This course was taught much better than micro theory and really helped me understand the implications of GE. The content is really interesting and challenging, but seeing the prevalence and applicability of economic theory is great.",
    "Only if you are interested in graduate study in economics",
    "I would recommend this course to a student who is interested in the foundations of macroeconomics and finance, and who does not mind self-studying many of these topics. If a student is shopping this course, I would suggest asking how the course is different from this iteration, since Professor Davila is receptive to feedback.",
    "Yes, I would generally recommend this course to a student with mathematical maturity and how is planning to perhaps study Economics on a higher level because General Equilibrium is the framework for most theoretical economics today. If you are an Econ-Math joint major, take it. Leave sufficient time to engage with the course.",
    "I would recommend this to other Econ\/Math majors. This class was quite hard and a lot fo work but I think it was solid preparation for grad school in economics. Beware that the psets are monstrous and will consume and frustrate you. The final was also quite hard. The material gets harder throughout the course, and I think very few people were entirely following by the end. However, Prof Davila cares about his students and tries to improve the course all the time. This class won't really be fun, but if you want a rigorous introduction to GE this course provides that. Also a community of suffering forms in this course. It's kinda comforting.",
    "I'm not sure if I would recommend this course to a student who isn't strongly considering economics graduate school. However, if you even have the slightest interest in a Ph.D., take the course. Even if you end up hating it and really struggle with the material, it will give you the closest experience to first-year graduate study that you can get at the undergraduate level, and my thought is that it's better to realize you don't want to pursue graduate school while an undergrad rather than as a first-year graduate student. And for those passionate about an econ Ph.D., if you put in the time and effort into this course, you will truly get so much out of it -- the material is interesting and forms the foundation of a significant amount of economics as a field.",
    "Take it! You may have heard rumors about how GE is a dead field in economics, and may be considering taking other (easier) classes to replace it for the Econ\/Math major. Don't do it! This class exemplifies the beauty of economic theory. GE helps you better understand demand and supply in the economy, and GE is a bedrock of other booming areas of economics like finance."
