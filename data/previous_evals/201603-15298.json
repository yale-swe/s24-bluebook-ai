    "I definitely would. The theme of the papers that we discuss changes every semester but it is always insightful to attend the discussions. While working on our PhDs it is hard to gather knowledge about other Geosciences fields. This seminar gives all grad students a chance to update themselves in areas outside of their research focus. Moreover, we get a chance to learn new concepts, and through our discussions, which involves faculty as well, we learn how to differentiate between a comprehensive research study and a poorly conducted one. I think this course is a must for all grad students.",
