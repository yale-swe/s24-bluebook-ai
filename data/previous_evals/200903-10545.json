    "I would definitely recommend this course, I think it will be very useful for work in the social sciences down the line. The professor does a great job of making the courses interesting even when the material can be dry some of the time.",
    "Good course for econometrics, second half may be hard for people without background.",
    "For students outside of the IDE program I would recommend the class only with the warning that if they haven't much of a technical background, or have little econometrics, it will seem a very challenging course and is focused more on the theoretical aspects than the practical aspects that might be desirable if a general 'working knowledge' of econometrics is sought.",
    "Summary: a crash-course in econometrics. Personally, I would be hesitant in recommending the course to others, without knowing their prior background in the related field."

    "Much harder than undergraduate course.",
