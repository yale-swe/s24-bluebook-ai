    "This was an incredibly difficult course and requires extensive dedication to course material.",
    "Overview of the case system and basic verb tenses, beginning basic conversational skills",
    "I learned how to construct sentences using the case system. In addition, I learned more about English grammar and sentence composition such as the parts of speech. I also learned about Russian culture."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Daily work is great and essential.",
    "Really excellent introductory language course. The program is very methodical and the nightly homeworks really help in applying the material. I wish that the class had been a little smaller though - it would have been nice to have had the chance to talk more.",
    "This class takes a lot of work. A lot of work. And it is very easy to fall behind. Julia Titus seems scary at first, but she is not really at all.",
    "One weakness of this course I felt was the amount of speaking students were asked to do. I felt like we could have benefited from more speaking opportunities, such as in small groups, etc. One of the strengths of the course was being exposed to Russian culture, I felt that did a good job helping the students connect to and appreciate the Russian people and country.",
    "The course is taught at a very good pace, quick but successful if one wants to jump into learning a new language. This said, the material never seemed to stagnate, and so I never got bored. To help with keeping up with the pace, though, more online tools and references would be nice.",
    "The strengths of this course are that teachers and TAs really go out of their way to ensure that you improve; however, I believe that too much material is covered in too short a period. I felt rushed and overloaded with information that I could not feasibly digest in one semester.",
    "I learned a lot quickly but when I did not understand a concept there wasn't time in class to review it",
    "The course is excellent at putting the emphasis on learning material and we get lots of practice. However, the material tested on is sometimes not what we spend classtime working on. Therefore, I do not always perform the best - especially when the concepts are difficult and should be presented in a formal class setting."

    "If you want to learn Russian, of course, Very hard though.",
    "I would highly recommend taking introductory Russian. The first part of the semester is pretty easy, but the concepts ramp up towards the end and it gets pretty complicated. Only take it if you're willing to really put in the work to study, review, and understand the vocab and grammar. Julia is an amazing professor who really is committed to her students learning the language and always has great asides about culture, literature, and the world.",
    "For a language credit, there are wayyyy easier languages. Take this class if you really want to spend a lot of your day practicing Russian.",
    "Yes I would recommend this course. Russian is a great language and the faculty are excited to help students learn it! It was a positive language learning experience.",
    "If you want to learn Russian, you can't go wrong by taking this course (not like there is another course to choose from, anyway). The professors are understanding, patient, and insightful, and are ready to answer any questions that one might have about the course material, and about the language and culture outside of the course material. The course material itself is engaging and useful, as each unit allows one to build upon a basic conversation introduced in the first unit. Overall, this was a great introduction into learning Russian.",
    "Russian is really cool and rewarding, but absolutely do not take it if you aren't prepared to teach yourself a lot of the material at home. Class will sometimes give you a grammatical overview, but it's often just practicing speaking, meaning that you're supposed to get the grammatical concepts out of the textbook. A LOT of material is never covered in class, so be prepared for that. Julia is also really intimidating. Her insults can be pretty funny when they're aimed at someone else, and it definitely keeps class lively, but it makes her a bit scary to approach and can make class really stressful. It definitely reached a point where I was scared to be called on to speak, and that's just not enjoyable. If Ana is your TA though, she's an absolute angel. She's great at explaining and really goes above and beyond to answer questions\/make sure everyone understands. Overall I would recommend. It's a really cool language, and Julia is overall a great teacher, just don't expect her to hold your hand through the class.",
    "I would caution other students about this course because it is so challenging and is way too much information for one semester. It seems as though the teachers don't realize that we have many other courses outside of Russian.",
    "Yes, you learn a lot quickly! You have to really want to learn it though and be willing to put in a lot of extra time.",
    "I would recommend this course to students who have a strong understanding of grammar."
