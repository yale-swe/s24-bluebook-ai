    "All around a very good class. Note that this assessment is very professor dependent. Make sure to shop all of the sections. I will just say that there are some sections for which it would be better to wait a semester and get a better teacher. I personally recommend M. Sherak with all possible fervor. Wonderful to talk to during office hours (even if you might accidently get sucked into a million side conversations about life and philosophy). She loves the power of literature to explore social tensions and will talk at length about interpretation. Less excited about the grammar, still very knowledgeable. You will not be disappointed if you want to know some of the pickier grammar rules. On that note, all the sections are the same in terms of the tests. Fairly frequent testing with fast-paced review of concepts and a good summation of French as a language. Test are generally easier than the material and there are clear practice test so you always know what to expect. I loved the literature read during this class and tolerated the movies (though there were a couple that I appreciated). Coming in having taken 5 years of French in high school with a moderate to strong French program and scoring a 5 on the AP test, I found this to be an appropriate class for me. I liked getting a good review and small extension of grammar to finally understand it as a cohesive unit and pick up A LOT of useful vocabulary along the way. My french writing has improved so much. Do not worry about the two orale tests-at least M Sherak grades them easily (along with everything else). Side note, do not let her scare you away on the first day or when you get your first grade. I will say there is a lot of work though. To keep up with this class and do it right, you have to just do the readings, grammar practice, and writing assignments. Grading: nice; Workload: moderate to be done well (can be easily BSed); Knowledge: good breadth. -He who shall not be named",
    "FREN 150 is an excellent course to prepare any prospective French majors for upper-level courses. It solidifies the intricate grammatical concepts of the language as you explore a sample of literature. The readings are not long, and most of them are contemporary short stories. The discussions will be as entertaining as you make them. Mme Sherak was a fantastic professor; definitely try to get in her section.",
    "Well run course. Sometimes the work load was a bit heavy\/not distributed right, but Mme Sherak did a really good job of balancing everything. Class was always well run and Mme Sherak was very accessible and a great teacher. Tests are fair and you have opportunities to fix your essays. I much preferred this class to 130\/140. Take 150 with Mme Sherak!",
    "French 150 is a good continuation of L4. We learn how to put all of the complicated grammar we learn into practice as well as utilize the vocabulary in writing and speaking.",
    "Take it only if strictly necessary, if you're planning on taking more advanced French courses in the future. And if you do end up taking it, take it with a native speaker."
