    "As a math major you probably shouldn't take this course. If you are at all interested in math, particularly foundational math, but are not a major and are not familiar with proofs then this is probably a fine class for you to take. It is quite slow paced and you can almost teach yourself right from the textbook without attending lecture. The material is however interesting and although you won't cover a lot it should be a simple introduction.",
    "I would totally recommend Set Theory to anyone who needs a math elective. It's a great break from classic math (calc, linear, diff EQ, etc.). It's pretty theoretical, but much less intense than any of the other proof-based courses I've taken. Two midterms and a final. Homework was pretty manageable, the exams got harder but were do-able if you go to class and his review sessions!",
    "Set theory is definitely a different way of looking at math. I personally very much enjoyed it, but I also know people for whom it was a little too weird. If you're into the philosophy of math, then this is a good course for you. However, if you're more of an applications kind of person then I would advise against taking it.",
    "don't take this unless you have to or really don't ever want to have to go to class",
    "Set theory is a cool subject, and it is interesting to get to take a math class where you learn axiomatically. You get to learn how to build concepts like the natural numbers form a handful of basic axioms. However, the class moves very slowly, so if you are good at math it can be very boring. It can also be difficult in a frustrating way, because the subject matter we cover isn't very difficult, and the class moves at a very slow pace, but the homework is graded very rigorously, and the tests will sometimes have really hard questions that aren't like anything from the class or homework. The problem with the hard questions on the tests is that you tend to just get them or not get them at all, and in exams with only 5 questions, if you just don't get the hard ones, your grades can really suffer.",
    "The course may seem to go slow, though I appreciated its pacing. Many math courses leave you struggling to keep up in lecture, but Professor Zuckerman teaches at a comfortable pace that allows you to keep up, stay engaged, and ask questions. The subject matter might appeal more to non-math majors who may appreciate seeing math \"rigorized\" for a first time."
