    "Yeah, its a lot of work but it was pretty good if you want to continue with french.",
    "French 150 is a high level French class that focusses mainly on reading and writing. I would recommend it if you have placed into it but not into 160 because while it is a lot of work, it only meets three times a week and the readings are interesting for the most part.",
    "Tests and reading material easy, but the graded writing evaluations really brought down my grade. Overall the class is excellent for sharpening grammar skills and reading abilities, as well as expanding vocabulary and knowledge of french literature and drama.",
    "Great class with a fair amount of work but very enjoyable movies and books. Not hard if you took AP French in high school but a great way to brush up on grammar and speaking\/writing skills before taking upper-level classes or to fulfill the language requirement. Take it with Colvin if she's teaching it!",
    "It's an intensive class that reviews grammar and improves conversational French by studying literature and films; it's basically an English class in French. I would recommend it, but let them know that it's hard and a lot of work!"
