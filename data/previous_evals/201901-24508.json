    "I learned so much from this course. I learned about the way history is written, the ways authors can challenge historicism, the continuous thread between the past and present that must be honored, and the conditions of slavery. What I loved is the emphasis on both slaverys Legacy AND the way we write about slaverys legacy. How can we write about slavery without mimicking the violence of the archive, in which slave deaths are just a statistic and only the perspectives of outside observers are valued?",
    "From this course I gained a better understanding of how various authors and scholars have imagined the afterlife of slavery in the U.S.",
    "Learn a lot about the difference in slave narratives through a diverse group of works.",
    "The class made me think in new ways about Atlantic slavery as a distinct subject of critical theory and especially about the role of the archive as a force that polices and produces knowledge in historically determined ways.",
    "I learned a great deal not only about the history of slavery and its afterlife, but also how to deal with such a narrow archive. In other words, I developed the skill of carefully drawing upon limited histories to paint a full picture.",
    "I think this was more of an artistic course and I have rarely approached slavery studies through this lens. I appreciated it.",
    "Little to known. I feel like everything has been addressed before."

   "comments": [
    "Strengths: the courses inclusion of both fiction and nonfiction, writings on the archive and the writing of history itself as well as writings that describe slavery. Weaknesses: I felt that while class discussion was extremely engaging and we learned a lot from Professor Carico and our peers, it felt like we were often not sure of how many assignments were due or the nature of those assignments. It would have been helpful if at the beginning of the course Professor Carico described thoroughly his expectations for the reading responses and midterm\/final papers. His feedback on the midterm papers for some students may not have been necessary had those students had a better idea of the professors expectations. I also felt like he could have had a more consistent time for office hours (and a longer stretch of time) and maybe could send out an office hours sign up sheet every week to maximize efficiency. He seemed to enjoy teaching the class but not necessarily want a close relationship with individual students.",
    "The strengths of this course were Aaron and the syllabus.",
    "Incredible syllabus, fair assignments, great discussions and Aaron is just the best!",
    "This course was as close to perfect as any I have taken. I wish there was some more room for suggested course materials, but even that would be above and beyond what would make a great class.",
    "I think that this course lacked really prominent structure which was nice\/refreshing but as a result I was less inclined to take it very seriously. woops.",
    "It didnt seem to go deep enough."

    "I would recommend this course to another student, especially because of its unique subject matter. I learned so much about the discipline of history, the archive, and the telling of stories of slavery than I thought I would. Keep in mind, the workload is significant and it should not be taken as a gut.",
    "THE MOST AMAZING CLASS!! EVERYONE SHOULD TAKE THIS IF THEYRE VAGUELY INTERESTED IN THE AFTERLIVES OF SLAVERY",
    "There are a lot of courses that focus on various aspects of American slavery and its afterlives, this one wasn't necessarily the most in depth on any particular area but it provided a good overview of theory, literature, film, and art in the field.",
    "Certainly. Not only is the subject fascinating and crucial in understanding global history, but there could not be a more fitting teacher to deal with the complex themes in the class.",
    "I liked this course. It wasn't my favorite of the semester and sometimes our discussions were a little frustrating. Ill get to that more below.",
    "Not really especially if youre an AFAM major or familiar with Black history and literature."
