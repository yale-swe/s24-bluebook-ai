    "Covers constructions of measures, sigma-algebras, etc. Our course just touched on Lp spaces and slighted it for discussion of radon measures (Riesz representation theorem) and the Wiener process. If you're planning for graduate school in math (or econ or stats or anything somewhat technical), you basically have to take this course at some point to be taken seriously. For math, you really should take it as an undergrad.",
    "A bad class. Until recently I never felt compelled to assign a rating of \"poor\" to any class I've taken, but despite being extremely easy this class is the worst I've taken at Yale. Prof. Garland's teaching style appears to be attempting to go through theorems and proofs in a methodical step-by-step manner, but at this he fails; any structure his class could have is undermined by his frequent mistakes and convoluted descriptions of frequently simple facts. Homework, which could independently emphasize points he considers important, consists of one or two trivial problems each, and is worth epsilon percent of our grade (epsilon small), thereby ensuring that important concepts are forgotten if ever learned. I did learn things by studying for the final exam; I read the book and within a manner of a couple days learned a supposed semester's worth of material. This class serves no functional purpose outside of being a supposedly graduate level analysis course and should not be taken. Take 325 instead, perhaps, or wait until someone else can revamp this class."
