    "Great introduction to water quality issues and methodology of analysis. Would prefer more time spent on current issues in water quality in public health during the course rather than through mainly student presentations",
    "I think that this is a very good course that has a lot of room for improvement. The professor did a thorough job explaining key topics, however, some of the topics could have been skipped. Additionally, the course could benefit from case studies and examples to help students understand the material better.",
    "Strengths: really the only water class offered at the public health school. topics are important!Weaknesses: course could have focused more on epidemiology and the application of course concepts in the real-world. For example, learn the basics of analytical techniques then read studies and evaluate the methodology. Or, learn about surface\/groundwater exposures, then design a study to address a real-life problem.",
    "The course covers a wide range of interesting topics. I think a visit to a laboratory to see the analytical instruments discussed in class would be helpful. Also, I wonder if there are more up-to-date graphs and papers? Much of the data we looked at was over a decade old. Increased student participation would be great--perhaps a discussion component to the class led by students?"

    "Instructor: Jan Dunn \u00a0Excellent teacher who was sensitive to students backgrounds lab analysis and biology. Very kind hearted and amiable and enjoyed teaching style",
    "Instructor: Jan Dunn \u00a0The professor could make the course a little more interactive to allow for students to participate more. Although it is a lecture course and there was a lot of information to cover, portions of class could be open discussion.",
    "Instructor: Jan Dunn \u00a0Professor Dunn has a great enthusiasm for the subject. He was creates a nice dialogue with the students which stimulates further interests and thoughts for the class material. He is an asset to YSPH and I would hope that he can teach more classes.",
    "Instructor: Jan Dunn \u00a0Very enthusiastic, knowledgeable, and receptive. Easy to speak with and open to suggestions.In retrospect, the course could have covered more material. We spent a lot of time on each slide. Professor can have higher expectations of students, and hold students to higher standards.",
    "Instructor: Jan Dunn \u00a0Dr. Dunn is highly knowledgeable in the area of instruction, and he was able to answer questions very well. His teaching could be improved by engaging the students more, maybe challenging us to ask questions or through a discussion section during classtime."

    "Interesting topics, innascent stage. Professor is wonderful.",
    "Depending on the student's interest, I would recommend the course. It has more of an analytical focus, so students interested in a broader look at water quality issues globally may be better served by other courses."
