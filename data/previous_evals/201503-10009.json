   "comments": [
    "Strengths: *Ability to create an environment of inclusion, acceptance, and gentle stretching *Flexibility *Interest in\/passion for the topics and materials of the course *Willingness to look at things from a variety of perspectives *Sense of humor *Concern for the demands placed on students in life outside of the classroom *Experienced in both the topics and materials and in teaching the course (including ministry inside and outside of the church) *Care for group process *Focused on engagement of the group *Setting time limits for activities and discussions as needed Challenges: *The biggest challenge with this group is dealing with deep questions in a very short period of time each week. We tend to share our individual challenges as unique, individual challenges, and this results in one or two individuals sharing deeply each week and the rest of the group responding briefly but not being able to go to the same level of depth with the issues raised due to time constraints. Mr. Pederson might be able to assist the group in moving through this challenge by helping the group to hear individual concerns and identify ways the same concerns resonate with other group members. Then, perhaps we could speak about what is shared at some depth, rather than staying singularly focused on the original person's sharing.",
    "Shepard does a quite masterful job of facilitating discussion. He is flexible and kind, while at the same time is very willing to challenge us to go deeper.",
    "Katie facilitated a safe environment for discussion and support",
    "Kyle is warm, engaging, kind and well-organized. He has created an environment where we can learn from and support one another. It is a time a look forward to each week, and much of that has to do with Kyle's easy manner and gentle demeanor.",
    "Herb did an awesome job, and he has a ton of experience, which is super useful.",
    "Alison is an amazing practicum instructor!",
    "Alison is a fantastic instructor. She is incredibly intuitive, insightful -- she shares her wisdom and experience with the class, and facilitates difficult conversations in the group.",
    "Alison is a fantastic instructor deeply involved in the internship lives of each of her students.",
    "Pastor Shepherd is a kind, and organized person. He came to class prepared to lead the group. I benefited from the insights he gave us on various questions we had.",
    "Alison is actively listens to group discussions and encourages good group dynamics. She incorporates current events into discussions and genuinely wants to know what is happening in students' lives.",
    "Shepard is incredibly easy going and able to create a \"safe space\" in short order. He is a deep and gifted listener, exceptionally gentle and wise. A wonderful role model for pastoral ministry and presence.",
    "Facilitating conversations",
    "Very supportive, encouraging. Good listener. Appreciated his leadership.",
    "Kate is a terrific pastor and teacher: wise, compassionate, down-to-earth, challenging in all the right ways. I'm lucky to be in her section!",
    "Kyle did a great job balancing classroom time between structured work and discussing individual challenges and situations in a way that encouraged mutual support. No significant weaknesses, other than we spent very little time on the assigned reading. He is particularly good at eliciting honest feedback on the challenges we each faced, and encouraging us to workshop solutions together.",
    "Shepard Parsons's kind and considerable personality helped the group had open-minded meetings. His wisdom and love helped the intern students get advice for their ministry field and their lives.",
    "She is great at fostering conversation and helping talk through various situations.",
    "Kyle is remarkably gifted at creating safe spaces for discussion and mutual support. It is hard to imagine an instructor more conscientious. Kyle was extremely thoughtful in just about every way I can think of--regarding the emotional rigors of an internship, issues of diversity and difference, etc. He is a tremendous gift to the supervised ministries program. It's hard to imagine someone in the greater New Haven area being better equipped to fulfill this role.",
    "Rev. Brown is an excellent practicum instructor. He has a wealth of knowledge related to the UCC and encouraged my reflections.",
    "I have greatly appreciated the ways our group has become close and is there to support one another. Shepard played an important role in creating this space. That being said, I wish that we could talk about specific topics or case studies more often. For the most part I have felt that the course has been a great place of support. I am hopeful that next semester we can maintain that level of support or care but also can talk through particular case studies or issues (relating to race, sexuality, gender in the workplace, keeping healthy boundaries [and how to do that], talking about the prayer life and practices (and self care) of professionals, etc.)"
