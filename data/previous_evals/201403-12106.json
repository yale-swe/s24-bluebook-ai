   "comments": [
    "This is a tough lab, but it has redeeming qualities. The experiments themselves are pretty interesting, and they really help to clarify the lessons of the Chemistry course. However, it would be unfair to mention how tough the lab is at times. Be prepared to spend every minute of every lab; the experiments are always pushing the time limit. Lab reports are manageable, if started early, but can sometimes be a large time investment. If you're taking chemistry, this lab will be interesting and educational, but be wary of the workload.",
    "This class was very frustrating because the grading system for the lab reports was very convoluted and unfairly strict in some cases; for instance, if a piece of lab equipment malfunctioned during the lab through no fault of your own and your results were therefore affected, you would still lose points on your report. I guess its strength would be that it definitely teaches you how to use lab equipment and perform techniques properly, and it also teaches you how to work quickly because the time limits were very strict. A weakness would be the disproportionate amount of work that it required, because it is only worth a half credit. Because of this, I would not recommend it to another student, but it is a prerequisite for many classes.",
    "I would only take this class if it is required for your major. It is not a bad class, but there are much more engaging and fun classes you could take.",
    "At times, this lab was difficult (due to time constraints and lab reports). However, it provided good exposure to lab techniques.",
    "If you don't need to take the course, then absolutely do not take it. However, if you must take this course, it really isn't too bad if you approach it correctly. Come prepared to each lab with a good idea of what you will do, and try to prepare as much of the procedure in your lab manual as possible beforehand to save time. Try to stay positive, and do not procrastinate on the lab reports.",
    "Make sure you are working consistently on labs throughout the week! Don't leave it till the last night. Also, definiteyl do the practice problems to prepare for quizzes.",
    "Pretty fun, except the lab reports are a little nuts. And the TAs (at least my semester) weren't all that great.",
    "Don't take it unless it's a requirement. If you can skip ahead to more challenging chem labs you should.",
    "It is a good first chem lab, but it is impossible to get an A because your first lab reports and quizzes will hurt you! But overall, a good learning experience. It definitely feels more than a half-credit! There is a lot of work involved.",
    "Too much work, confusing guidelines, avoid if possible. Doesn't enhance your learning. Unnecessary course.",
    "Overall, Chem 117L is the lab course that accompanies the lecture Chem 115. The course, in general, has been challenging but rewarding. Although there were some labs that were difficult to finish in time, the experience allowed us to become more efficient with our lab techniques and hone our skills. Some lab reports took more time than others, but they all added to our understanding of chemistry and complemented the work we did in the lecture course. For a student who feels that they have had an adequate introduction to laboratory experiments, I would recommend this course. Students who prefer a slightly more rigorous lecture experience but a slightly more gentle introduction to the lab might want to explore the option of Chem 118 and its accompanying lab.",
    "This is a painful lab, but a necessary one. It's a lot of grunt labor, that I think most students will be able to do without difficulty.",
    "wouldn't recommend unless you need to take it for a major\/are pre med",
    "If you have to take it do it and get through it. Otherwise no.",
    "Never take it if it's not required. If it is, you'll get through it but it's not fun.",
    "A class you should only take if you need to. Really demanding for a half credit",
    "This course is very challenging and unenjoyable. I would only recommend taking it if it is absolutely necessary for your major.",
    "A basic chemistry lab course. The lab grading rubric is strict, so make sure you obey all guidelines mentioned by your TA or Professor Ganapathi.",
    "I made the mistake of taking this class - please do not make the same mistake as me. This class easily took up half my time. The lab reports are tedious, and the grading is very picky. I definitely lost way more points on formatting and small issues than chemistry. I easily spent more than twice the time on lab than the class (CHEM 115), even though chem 115 was a full credit - and I earned a higher grade in chem115.",
    "CHEM 117L is a good course in learning basic laboratory skills. However, it is a lot of work and a lot of pre-lab preparations outside the classroom are needed. Students should take CHEM 117L if they need it for their major, but it isn't really a class students should take just for the distributional credit.",
    "The course is a regular lab course. Do not take it if you don't have to; you will regret it.",
    "It's a lot of work. The four-hour time slot allotted for each lab class seems extraordinarily long until you start performing experiments. Then, it seems too short because each lab takes the full four hours to complete. The lab reports must be started early because each one takes a long time to finish.",
    "Chem 117 solidifies understanding of concepts taught in general chemistry, but the grading does not reflect your understanding - it reflects your lab skills, technique, and extreme attention to detail. I would recommend it but with caution. The class is only half a credit, but it requires a lot of work and the grading can be very frustrating.",
    "Good lab, worth it for the skills gained, have to be well prepped for every lab though.",
    "A fairly challenging class...especially if, like me, you've had little\/no prior lab experience. The lab reports are difficult and time consuming, and, since lab reports are not handed back until a week after you turn them in, you will have to complete 2 reports without *any* feedback as to how you're doing. I would highly advise *against* this class unless you've taken CHEM 116L, or you feel extremely confident in your high school preparation. However, that being said, this course *will* teach you a lot, and I feel 100% prepared and ready for organic chemistry lab.",
    "CHEM 117L is an enormous amount of work for the half credit that it is. You have a lab quiz every week, which isn't particularly hard, but requires you to know what is going to go on in the upcoming experiment. For almost all of the experiments, you will use the entire four hours in the lab. It takes a long time to get the hang of writing lab reports that will receive high grades, and even then, you lose points for very minor details that don't really matter. If you can avoid taking this lab, I would recommend you do so; however, it does teach you the basic lab techniques you will need in future labs, so in that respect, it is necessary.",
    "Don't take this class unless you plan on using it for the major.",
    "I would not have taken it if I hadn't had too. It was very tedious, dull, and quite stressful. If you really enjoy chemistry lab, though, you might have a fine time. Be very careful with reports.",
    "This course was definitely one of the most tedious, stressful courses I'd taken this semester. The lab reports are usually not something you want to start the night before they're due (unless you want to stay up until 3 AM). Definitely glad for this course to be over. As is the case with any course, getting a good TF can make it or break it for you, and I lucked out and had an amazing TF. The grading scale is a little bit different for this course. You need at least a 95% in the class in order to get an A (anything below a 95% is an A-).",
    "I would recommend only taking it if you have to, and meeting with your TA every week to make sure you understand what you are doing in the lab write up.",
    "Looking back on it it really was not that bad. People will make it out to be but it isn't."
