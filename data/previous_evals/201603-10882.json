    "I learned a great deal of French vocabulary, idioms, and grammatical constructions. Of course, I also gained a sort cultural fluency - I truly learned how to speak intelligently and appropriately about a great deal of important, contemporary issues. In the end, this all translated to real progress in my speaking skills, which I feel improved dramatically.",
    "I got a comprehensive understanding of the French language, a broad exposure to French culture and the opportunity to improve my oral French skills to a level that would have been difficult to achieve anywhere else.",
    "I greatly improved my French reading and writing.",
    "My conversation skills and writing improved tremendously during this course.",
    "I built my comfort with speaking, reading and writing in French and broadened my knowledge of French culture.",
    "In French 160 I improved my French reading, conversation, and writing skills while gaining a lot of vocabulary and learning a lot about French culture. We read articles and watched films related to French culture (topics included history, education, the environment, women's rights, work, and language) then wrote 300-600 word reflections on them and discussed those topics in class.",
    "I gained knowledge about how countries interact with each other, and I gained knowledge on many facets of life in France. I developed insights about politics and how countries other than the USA deal with common issues.",
    "I learned a lot about the French culture and way of life.",
    "The fundamental confidence needed to speak French! I truly learned so much about French culture, grammar, and vocabulary."

   "comments": [
    "I think this course does an amazing job engaging its students with fascinating readings about real issues, as well as with the extraordinary amount of time it dedicates to in-class discussions. This truly proved to be the best way to learn. I have no real weaknesses I noticed in the course at all.",
    "Overall, this was a brilliant course. The continuous engagement of students with the language over the course of the semester in interesting and effective ways allowed us to improve our French remarkably. During a few weeks, I felt the workload was a bit too much but other than that I have no improvements to suggest.",
    "I thought that this course was great. The in-class discussions were very good and I have no recommendations for improvements.",
    "I did not really find any weaknesses in this course. I loved that the class was run like an ongoing discussion. Our discussions in class kept students engaged and practicing their French and helped students to deepen their understanding of the material that was studied for homework.",
    "I liked that the course, despite being called Advanced Culture & Conversation, actually incorporated skills of reading and writing and vocabulary as well as listening, talking, and culture. It might have been cool to discuss cultures of francophone countries other than France, but then there would have been more breadth and less depth which might not have worked as well.",
    "The strengths of this course are that a lot of material is covered in ways that give students fairly solid understanding. Weaknesses are that the course itself is solely discussion based and could benefit from some media exposure in class itself, such as watching video clips or listening to audio files.",
    "This course is discussion based, which is a huge advantage. It really involves the students and teaches us very well. The professors are great, and all the topics discussed are very relevant to current events.",
    "The strengths are primarily with the environment Madame encouraged where all of us felt comfortable enough to speak in complete French. The only weakness is the written assessment where we had to use a lot of memorized vocab words instead of truly understanding their meaning."

    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. I learned a lot, I really improved my French, and I think the course is extremely well-planned and well-paced. Of course, Mme. Schneider is also just the best professor - one who really cares for her students and is not afraid to push them to reach their full potentials.",
    "Absolutely. It's an incredible course that will really help you improve your French, so if you get a chance to take it you should.",
    "Lots of work and although during the class I thought I learned a lot, now I am not so sure. Take it for French practice, but beware of the work!",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. It is a great way of learning French and the setup of reading about a subject for homework and discussing it in class was very good.",
    "I would recommend this course to students who wish to improve their conversation skills and writing. I took it to keep up my french, and it certainly did the trick, but it does involve a lot of work and is not always the most engaging class.",
    "I would because it is very effective in deepening ones knowledge of the French language and culture.",
    "I would recommend French 160 to anyone. Honestly. It was fantastic, and definitely the kind of course where you get out of it what you put into it, so you can have varying levels of commitment and still have fun and do well (though you will learn the most if you are willing to actually put in the time and effort). The structure was that we read articles or chapters or watched a news clip or a film for homework, then about 2\/3 of the time wrote 300-600 words on it, then discussed or debated the cultural topics in class the next day. The readings could be extensive but even when I had to cut corners I still learned a ton about French culture. Other than the writing assignments we had quizzes (600 words on a topic we had covered, using at least 30 vocab words), an expos (a 20 minute presentation with a partner), and two oral exams (with a memorized and spontaneous portion). I felt like my speaking, reading, and writing skills improved immensely and I actually learned a lot about the culture of France. Also, Mme Schneider was an amazing professor-- she was so thoughtful and nice and also super energetic and funny. She made class time really enjoyable and fun.",
    "I would recommend this course to other students with a solid understanding of French language who seek to learn more about French culture. The course is well organized and covers a wide array of pertinent issues such as family planning, environmental conservation, immigration, race relations, and more.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to any student seeking to take their French language to a higher level.",
    "Definitely!"
