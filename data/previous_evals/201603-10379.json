    "A survey of trends in a architectural and urban history in America How to read the cultural landscape",
    "This is a really interesting introduction to the evolving landscapes of architecture and urbanism from pre-Columbian to present times. As a non-major, I was completely new to architecture but Prof. Rubin really made it accessible and exciting for everyone. I learned a lot about how cities developed into what they are now, as well as the underlying causes for the transition between different architectural periods. I appreciated that much of what we learned was not necessarily building specific. I feel like I can walk around an American city now and identify styles, infer about the city's history with planning, and engage with the built environment. If you're at all interested in the built environment I highly recommend this class, with the caveat that if you're looking for a detailed discussion of infrastructure, you're unlikely to find that here.",
    "I learned so much about building construction and architecture! I learned so much about the world around me and patterns within the built environment\/landscape that it blew my mind. A great survey course that taught me so much. 10\/10 recommend.",
    "It is a survey from pre-columbian times to present day about architecture and urbanism in the united states.",
    "This course totally changed the way I view my built environment. I really adored Professor Rubin's lectures and gained so much knowledge about Yale's place in New Haven and the history of America's buildings.",
    "I gained an understanding of American architectural history and trends, and the ways it tied into broader American history. Very useful and worthwhile.",
    "I learned not only about the history of urbanism, but about the intersection of social issues and architecture. I learned how the built environment shapes our social world, ie in the context of public housing and gentrification. I also learned to look at the buildings around me differently and critically analyze the structures, locations, and signage of the buildings.",
    "This course has given me an understanding of how America's architecture and infrastructure developed. With the knowledge from this course, I can identify historically salient features in the buildings I see every day, and I can connect architectural details to the ideological and historical logic that inspired them. The course has helped me appreciate the power of architectural design. I have seen how architecture and infrastructure not only reflect society, but shape its development.",
    "Before this class, I knew nothing about architecture, and now I know about different architects and styles and I can walk around my city (San Francisco) and compare buildings to other buildings I've studied and it's so fun!",
    "As my first art history OR architecture course, this course gave me a fantastic new vocabulary with which to discuss and describe buildings and urban landscapes. Both in terms of naming specific architects, styles, periods, or buildings and in grasping a larger historical narrative of architectural\/urbanist shifts over the course of American history, this course effortlessly and effectively blended together the fields of history, art history, and architecture.",
    "Memorization.",
    "Gave me my first insight into Architecture and also helped interest me more about the subject. I am now more knowledgable about styles of architecture and the wording used when describing certain aspects of a word.",
    "This course taught me how to analyze built environments within their broader socio-economic and political contexts. Although we paid some attention to purely aesthetic features of buildings, such features were not the emphasis of our discussion; instead, we talked about the patrons behind the buildings, the policies they exploited or precipitated, and the various images the attempted to project. I leave the course as a much more informed urban traveler, and I have already enjoyed noticing new features of my home city since returning home from school for break. I also learned, through the wonderful assignments, to engage with various relevant architecture databases and resources, such as Sanborn maps, the Manuscript collections at Sterling, and the archives at the New Haven Museum and New Haven Public Library.",
    "I learned about the evolution of American architecture since pre-colonial times, and developed comparisons\/identified trends between different time periods, different architects.",
    "This made me look at architecture and the history of architecture in a whole new way. I really gained a lot of insight into a discipline that I knew nothing about previously.",
    "I learned how to evaluate the built environment formally, how to contextualize it historically, and how to think about its legacy and relationship to social, political, and economic factors.",
    "The course has changed the way I see the world. Every building, every house, and every plaza now has so much historical meaning and motifs, and I now love to walk around neighborhoods trained to look for certain cultural cues that I've learned in this class. It's not the world that changed, it's me.",
    "My understanding of the history of the American architectural landscape is so much better! I honestly feel like I understand the physical world around me in a new light.",
    "Learned a lot about various architectural styles, which proved to be very helpful in studio and my overall understanding of architecture.",
    "I learned how to analyze building structures and details, urban patterns in cities, and the social\/historical\/political elements that influence architecture and building in cities.",
    "A survey course, but really informative esp if you're interested in architecture.",
    "I gained an appreciation for American architectural landscapes that I previously found inaccessible, and got to explore a few of my own interests in depth--recording studios and the city of Philadelphia--with the two assignments.",
    "This was an incredible course which taught me how to have a observant and critical eye towards my urban surroundings. By learning about building and urban styles and influences theoughout centuries, and what the ideas of the era that inspired architects and urban planners, I developed an understanding of our urban history. This course didn't only teach architectural history, but also how to approach and learn from the builldings, structures and environment that surrounds us.",
    "An ability to read buildings and understand their context. Additionally, an understanding of urban history in the US, major architects, and building types.",
    "reading buildings",
    "This class was a phenomenal introduction to American architecture and urbanism; and I learned most importantly how to look at buildings on their own and in the context of broader architectural trends.",
    "I learned how to think about the relationship between a building and the city",
    "Allows you to look at the built environment with a critical eye- you will never look at a park, airport, building, or bridge the same ever again.",
    "I learned an incredible amount about the history of the American cities, suburbs and corporate landscapes. It was insightful in terms of looking at my surroundings and knowing what forces causes the buildings and the urban landscapes that I am seeing.",
    "Developed an insight into how American architecture has influenced and been influenced by the changing culture of the US.",
    "As someone who came in with little knowledge, I learned so much about American architecture and urban development as a whole!"

   "comments": [
    "This class has the potential to become a cult class like US Lesbian and Gay History (and of course its namesake when it was taught by Vincent Scully). Prof Rubin is a highly engaging lecturer and the material is very pertinent. Having said that I wished he could have been more structured at points -- sometimes he just waxed lyrical and it was hard to take notes. Don't get me wrong: it was an absolute delight to hear him wax lyrical -- it was like going to Carnegie Hall to watch a performance. Alas, final exams beckon. Readings were decent, not always cohesive; assignments were interesting enough.",
    "Personally I enjoyed the second half of the course a lot more than the first. I understand that it's important to cover early American architecture and urbanism, but I noticed even in my discussion section that people were a lot more willing to speak about modern architecture rather than small scale buildings from hundreds of years ago. I would suggest speeding up the front end of the course and allowing more time to be spent on modern urbanism, such as combatting sprawl, implementing public transportation, strategies for controlling growth, etc.",
    "Elihu Rubin is a great lecturer! The course though could be clearer about its final exam expectations. I would have liked to see an example slide comparison response. While taking the class was a great experience, the assignments were overall just looser. This could be a good or bad thing depending on the motivation of the student.",
    "This was a good course. The workload was low- a building research project (essay) that you receive lots of help and instruction with, a 4-6 page paper on whatever you want that relates to architecture, and a final- but the material was very interesting. It's a great class to just listen and tune in and out of, but I must say that I learned a lot, even subconsciously. I love how low stress it was, and the two papers and final exam was a great format that distributed the work well. The TFs were helpful and chill, and although the final was a little rough, it was doable if you studied. The final exam could be improved. Please provide a detailed study guide that is tailored to the test well ahead of time. Also, please explain the format sooner.",
    "It covers too much material. The readings are too dense and long. They are mainly texts by and for architects (scully, venturi etc) or they try too combine too many disciplines at once (wright). the course needs to be edited either a smaller window of time or to focus on particular seminal buildings. for the final we were given a list of over 250 buildings, as someone who took the time to go over the cases and memorize the details i was really frustrated with the final that was largely thematic and only required knowledge of 30 of buildings. either the themes need to be more emphasized during lecture and section or the case list should be reduced. the strength is the material which is interesting and professor rubin is a good teacher but needs to put some more thought into the structure of the course and the evaluations.",
    "Strength: Really strong lectures, excited professor, interesting assignments Weakness: My discussion section was quite dead as far as engagement.",
    "I think there was a little too much reading to get through all of it, and the lectures eventually fell behind the readings because Professor Rubin had a habit of going over time. However, lectures were incredibly interesting, and I've learned so much.",
    "Professor Rubin's course was a fantastic and, in my opinion, nearly flawless overview of American Architecture and Urbanism. His tireless engagement, kindness, and disciplined explorations kept me constantly yearning for me. It is a shame the class was only taught twice a week - it could be improved with more lecture time! Additionally, my TA was very kind and brilliant but a horrible instructor.",
    "The lectures in this class are amazing, and I would recommend going to them even if you don't want to take the whole class. I also loved the historical building project, which taught me a lot about historical and archival research. The readings were more mixed; some were eye-opening and others were boring and\/or impenetrable.",
    "This lecture is pretty small and Professor Rubin is extremely engaging, so you want to go to class everyday. The review session was well done and my section was great. There weren't any weaknesses in my opinion!",
    "The lectures for this course are truly captivating and are some of the best I've seen at Yale. Moving easily between apt comparisons, historical narratives, and stylistic notes, Prof. Rubin has done a truly fantastic job crafting a sweeping story at once broad and specific. I particularly appreciated that the course is not afraid to use New Haven as a case study and resource in our broader study of American architecture and urbanism. I hope that as time goes on the lectures won't get behind early on (which made it hard to keep notes but otherwise caused no complaints from me!) and the sections will figure out a little better what the best approach is.",
    "Elihu's lectures were among the most engaging I've had during my time at Yale. He did a wonderful job weaving a socio-historical narrative that illuminated the \"meaning\" of buildings (as he put it) beyond their evident aesthetic features. His ability to weave this narrative made the course accessible and appealing to those like me who were not architecture majors and had never taken a class in the department before. Another strength of the class were the assignments, both of which introduced us to valuable resources that I hope to use in other (non-architecture) classes as well. The course had three glaring weaknesses. First, though each lecture was engaging in itself, each did not always \"line up\" with the readings assigned on the given day. Elihu could have done more to tailor the syllabus to the arc of his lectures. Second, expectations for the assignments and the exam were not communicated far enough ahead of time. On our first assignment, for example, my TF did not tell us how she wanted us to do citations until a day or two before the due date. For the exam, not only was the complete \"case list\" we had to memorize not uploaded until the beginning of reading period, but the final format of the exam was not revealed until a day or two before the exam. The case list should have been updated as the semester progressed, and the format should have been settled on well ahead of time. My third problem with the class was section. I cannot speak for those in other sections, but in mine, people seemed to too often get away without doing the readings; only a couple people each week was required to prepare questions or a reading response. Everyone should have to submit some sort of response each week in order to ensure good faith participation on everyone's part.",
    "The material covered in this class was extremely interesting, and the lectures and sections were very engaging. I particularly enjoyed learning about New Haven architecture. The professor and TAs were great, very knowledgeable and passionate about the material. Readings were useful and relevant to the course material. Some of them were too long or too dense to really follow, but I particularly enjoyed the Scully readings.",
    "Strengths: One of the most engaging lectures I've ever had, the most enjoyable assignments, and the most encouraged I've ever been to read and learn and focus in a lecture course. TAs were knowledgeable, readings were well curated, and the material was incredibly relevant and fun to follow. Weaknesses: Student weren't exactly held accountable for digesting the reading to a point that section discussions really developed our understanding of architecture. Section was always helpful for reviewing concepts and being provoked for deeper ones, but we arrived at so many \"no wrong answer\" situations that it could sometimes leave me wishing for more.",
    "Assignment details are a bit vague and there was a lot of crunching at the last minute as more specific details came out.",
    "There is just so much material to cover. Professor Rubin does an incredible job, but frankly he doesn't have to time to cover the things he attempts to. Perhaps extending to two 1:15 classes rather than the two 50 min that there currently is could help.",
    "This class was great. I thought the information was extremely interesting and we covered a lot of material for an overview class. Professor Rubin is a great lecturer and kept everyone very engaged. The one weakness of this course was a result of it being the first time Professor Rubin has taught this course and that was that we often ran out of time in lecture to cover everything that had been planned. I think we still, in the end, covered all the material we needed to, but that is the one thing that needs to get ironed out. The one other thing is that all of the section times for this class were horrible, but we made it work. Nonetheless, would be good to get some normal section times.",
    "The lectures are very engaging, which made this class special and enjoyable as well as productive.",
    "I thought the material and the lectures were really fascinating, and I enjoyed the freedom given on both assignments. I think that the class organization could be improved (we were told there would be ~100 objects in the final, but the list had almost 200).",
    "Amazing class. Professor Rubin is the best professor I have ever had.",
    "The strengths of this course include how compelling the lectures are, how complementary the readings are to the course material and how the section time allows for students to internalize what they've learned in class. It could be improved by going at a more structured pace -there is a lot of course material and the students would appreciate the opportunity to take a pause at some points and review and bring together all of the work that has been introduced. Furthermore, we would love it if the course could sometimes go on tangents and introduce works from non-US parts of the world that are relevant to US architecture. Overall, the course was fascinating and very compelling.",
    "Strengths - fascinating material, well-organized lectures, engaging professor Weaknesses - sections seemed poorly organized, perhaps not equal across different sections, too much rote memorization going into the exam (we could've been preparing for these types of comparisons all semester in section)",
    "This course was fantastic. Professor Rubin is very engaging and welcoming. The readings were at times a bit dense, and sometimes the lectures were a little rushed. Access to the lectures slides earlier on would be helpful.",
    "great course. no improvements to suggest",
    "I loved the lectures in this class, but I felt that they lacked organization. Especially in preparing for the final, the lack of organization of the TFs and professor was apparent, as we didn't receive timely feedback and the list of IDs for the final was much too extensive and not edited. This was my major issue with the class; I enjoyed the assignments, but the expectations for them were entirely unclear.",
    "The course was a lot to handle as someone who had never had experience discussing architecture or the other themes in the course. It was very ambitious and should perhaps be simplified or broken up into multiple classes. However, it was intellectually stimulating and fun to understand the world through the built environment.",
    "AMAZING CLASS",
    "A strength are the incredible lectures, that are very inspiring and the ability of the course to inspire a greater interest in the subject matter. A weakness is that the assignments are somewhat confusing, and that there are so few of them.",
    "Most of the course was amazing and the assessments were fair and relevant, except for the final. The final involved a ton of memorizing buildings by name, year and architect, which wasn't something that had been done throughout the class.",
    "I really highly recommend this course to anyone with an interest in the subject! I came in knowing next to nothing, and felt the material was totally accessible to me. Lectures were fantastic! Very interesting, for the most part, and Prof Rubin is an excellent professor--super engaged, very happy to answer questions, and clearly enthusiastic about this course. The essays were short and honestly very fun to write. The final exam is a bit tricky, but overall the workload for this course is super manageable and you will learn so much even if you just attend lecture!",
    "Strengths: - Fascinating and intentional projects. I thought the building survey was such an engaging and unexpected way of applying what we had learned about building styles and just how nebulous those categories could be. And I LOVED the freedom and flexibility of the single essay we wrote. - Rubin's lectures. Clear, epic, and chock full of brilliant images"

    "Absolutely. Consider it as part of a course sequence in cultural literary alongside intro to art history, music etc.",
    "Definitely take this class if you're interested in any way in architecture or urban planning. Prof. Rubin incredibly engaging and beyond thrilled to be teaching this material to you. There are two short papers and a very fair final, so the workload is fairly light. I found most of the material to be fascinating, though the readings were a bit long and dry. I would have liked a larger focus on modern issues in urbanism, but the class is fairly evenly distributed from about 1700-1990. I loved this course and had absolutely no prior experience, so I highly recommend it to anyone interested.",
    "Yes! The lecture is amazing the the content is interesting. Workload is also as much as you probably want to make it since the readings are so floral and Rubin basically repeats Scully\/Wright in class.",
    "This was a good course. The workload was low- a building research project (essay) that you receive lots of help and instruction with, a 4-6 page paper on whatever you want that relates to architecture, and a final- but the material was very interesting. It's a great class to just listen and tune in and out of, but I must say that I learned a lot, even subconsciously. The TFs were helpful and chill, and although the final was a little rough, it was doable if you studied. I would recommend this for a fifth class.",
    "Yes because I enjoyed learning the material even though I was frustrated with some of the aspects of the course.",
    "This was a pretty decent class. The highlight was probably Professor Rubin's engaging lecturing style and his enthusiasm for American architecture in general. It was interesting learning about how different architectural styles fit into the fabric of American history (which we've all learned about in high school and\/or college). The assignments were pretty interesting and not too difficult - one building study and one short essay (4-6 pages).",
    "This was a great course. I looked forward to the lectures, sections were pretty relaxed, and the workload was not too high.",
    "Yes, absolutely. I took this course to gain a deeper understanding of urban policy, and while I did not get a super in-depth understanding of this, I still learned a ton about architectural history and the relationship between public\/private spaces.",
    "I would recommend it. The workload is not huge. The first project was so fascinating and I really appreciated that we had to go out into New Haven to visit the site, and to visit the New Haven Museum to do research. It was great to apply what we were learning rather than just writing another paper. The second assignment, the paper, was also great to do because we could choose the topic that most interested us. Overall, besides there being a bit too much reading, the course is great.",
    "YES YES YES!",
    "Yes! Very interesting course with low workload.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. Anyone who is interested in history, building design, infrastructure, or politics will profit greatly from it.",
    "Definitely. Most of us don't know a lot about architecture and this is a great foundation to how American cities came to be, not just the architecture behind them but also themes and identities. The teaching is great and you will be involved the whole time. You will be able to talk about any building after this and analyze it in some way and impress your friends and family!",
    "100% absolutely. The course material is eminently interesting, especially to those not totally familiar with the field. The lectures are fantastically organized and engaging and cover an extraordinary amount of ground quite effectively. This course is not to miss.",
    "No, this class does not specify its expectations and requires a lot of memorization.",
    "This is an excellent course, especially for those who might otherwise feel intimidated about taking a course in the Architecture department. Elihu does a phenomenal job situating each and every building he discusses in its social, economic, and political context; hand-wavey discussion of aesthetic features is kept to a minimum. The workload is not too heavy, and the two research assignments are wonderful opportunities to explore the staggering resources that Yale and New Haven have to offer (many of which I wish I had known about earlier in my Yale career). One of my few reservations about the course is that the topic of the reading did not always exactly align with those of the lecture on any given day. I think that this problem, as well as any others that may have cropped up during the first eating of this course, will be ironed out the next time around.",
    "Yes! This course is fabulous and you learn so much about the built environment and the things you interact with every day but had never thought about before. Professor Rubin is so knowledgeable and enthused and really makes learning the material a pleasure.",
    "I would definitely recommend that everyone take this course, whether or not you're an architecture major. I'm a STEM major and this was my favorite class I've taken at Yale. The material is really interesting, and since a lot of it involves New Haven, you can really engage with the architecture that you are studying. (I particularly loved the first assignment, where you study a building in New Haven). It really changes the way you look at the architecture around you.",
    "YES! Professor Rubin is amazing! You'll learn a lot from lectures and from doing the readings! I really really enjoyed this class...MUST TAKE!",
    "Absolutely take this class. Professor Rubin is one of the best professors I've had at Yale and definitely the best lecturer. His passion for architecture literally pours out in the way that he organizes and presents the material, and it'll get you invested as well. The assignments are really open ended and they're amazing opportunities to follow your own interests, and I actually enjoyed preparing for the final exam. The whole experience is low-stress and an incredible way to round out your studies even if you've never taken an architecture course.",
    "Yes. This course is fun, and actually gives knowledge that can be applied to your everyday life.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class. Super engaging, highly interesting material whether you think you care about architecture or not, and great professor. Two papers, one final, and section requirements. I thought the New Haven building project was actually very fun and worthwhile. The other paper is 4-6 pages on a subject of your choice. The final was very fair, but I definitely had to study a lot for it because you have to have about 150 terms memorized with all the key details about each term, but I ended up feeling very prepared for the test. This class will give you an understanding of the built world around you in a way that I found to be very valuable. Would highly recommend this course.",
    "Really great class, Professor Rubin is a talented lecturer who is admirably passionate and knowledgeable about the subject.",
    "Yes, I learned to look at buildings differently and think about cities in a different way. The workload is light and the readings were interesting. Would recommend to someone who is interested in cities\/architecture as well as to someone interested in social history and politics. The professor is really passionate which made the class enjoyable.",
    "absolutely",
    "I would recommend this course, but keeping in mind that the course treats architecture less as a study of design and more as an indicator of cultural trends.",
    "This is an incredible course that teaches you how to have a critical mind and eye towards our buil environment. By drawing examples from New Haven, Boston, Detroit and all over the US, it gives a fascinating introduction to American Architecture and the big influences of the eras thtoughout history. The course taught me how to look at and analyze a building or urban form, and I love the observant perspective that it has challenged us to build. Professor Rubin is an amazing and compelling lecturer, so I highly recommend this course.",
    "YES YES YES! Exciting and interesting course about the American built environment taught by a professor who so clearly loves what he does. Lecture is fun and engaging and course material is relevant to everyone, not just architecture students. Workload is manageable and makes the course that much more enjoyable.",
    "Absolutely. If you have any interest in architecture, art history, urban environments, or just want to see images from all over United States fly by in lecture definitely take this course. Professor Rubin is an incredible lecturer.",
    "absolutely. it was fantastic",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone who is interested in architecture. It has completely changed the way I think about cities and buildings. The focus on New Haven buildings particularly relevant.",
    "YES IT IS AMAZING",
