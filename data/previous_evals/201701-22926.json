    "I learned about electromagnetism. Also, I finally understood how Gaussian units and ponderable media work, so that was good.",
    "Electrodynamics theory",
    "Jackson problems and meticulousness are not helpful for learning. I went a whole semester learning a very small number of concepts and applying them on impossibly tough and mind numbingly complicated problems, but not because of clever concepts, just tedium. This class should be removed or reworked.",
    "I learned a lot about how to solve general electromagnetism problems (Greens functions, boundary condition problems, etc.). My vector-calculus skills and general ability to manipulate complicated equations improved significantly. However, most importantly, I feel I finally developed an understanding for the project of electromagnetism and field theories in general. Professor Appelquist very well motivated EM from a few experimental facts and laid the foundations for our future coursework in quantum field theory next semester."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The course was well organized and well planned, and Professor Appelquist did a very good job of staying on schedule throughout the semester. The most annoying thing was the inconsistent use of SI and Gaussian units in the textbook. There may not be much that can be done there, though.",
    "grading is fair. however it seems a little far from research, so might not be very useful for many students.",
    "The breakdown of material could be better. I (and many of my classmates) were disappointed by the instructor's choice not to cover ch8 of Jackson. Microwave cavities and waveguides are very important many of our research. It was the main thing that I was hoping to get out of this class. Also, I wish that we had spent more time on classical field theory. Having a solid basis before QFT next semester would have been good. It felt rushed at the end of the semester.",
    "While Jackson is the standard text for E and M at the graduate level, it is an extremely poor textbook with problems that are unenlightening. It skips the details that would be useful and spends time on algebra and other topics that are unnecessary. The problems are about 2-3 lines of physics and a page to 3 pages of algebra which is not useful for actually learning physics.",
    "It is very hard to get a good feel for the subject, as most of the time, any big picture seems to get lost in the math.",
    "Strengths: Great conceptual understanding of the project of electromagnetism and an overview of the interworking of the theory. Weaknesses: Homework was inordinately hard and prevented us from doing enough problems to feel comfortable with any one topic.The course also is only a brief sampling of EM, skipping many essential topics and applications. I also feel as if there was not enough support for this class. Professor Appelquist was often in a seminar during his office hours and the TF was not really present.",
    "Weakness- jackson",
    "Some of the material in the course could be changed to focus more on practicality than formalism. It's certainly not possible to cover everything in Jackson, but there are some chapters in Jackson that would be more relevant to future research applications than others, and I would have liked to have seen more of the material from these."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "It's a required course. The problem sets are infrequent, but pretty challenging, so it works out to about the same workload as a course with shorter problem sets once a week. That said, I learned interesting material despite having already taken an advanced E&M course in undergrad, so I'd still recommend it as a useful experience.",
    "If you encounter a lot of electromagnetism\/special relativity in research, then you should take it.",
    "It could be a very good course but it emphasizes the wrong subjects.",
    "The course covers too much material in too little time to do the topic justice.",
    "Yes. I think the depth of understanding of EM as a theory was worth the great difficulty of the algebra and the homework. Professor Appelquist is a competent lecturer and the material is very important.",
    "No"
