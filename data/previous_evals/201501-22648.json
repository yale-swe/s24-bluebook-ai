    "Sure.",
    "Portuguese at Yale is great. It's a pretty chill department, so the classes tend to be fun and they don't require a lot of work. All the professors are good, and you learn a lot without feeling very stressed out. You especially learn a lot without very much work if you are a native Spanish speaker.",
