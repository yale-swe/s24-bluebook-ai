    "I would recommend the class, a bit dry, yes, but totally interesting and Katerina is super helpful.",
    "ECON 111 is a small seminar teaching Intro Macro that I would recommend over the lecture if this is your desired major. Katerina can be dry at times and could be more engaging, but overall the content is fair and clear. The curve isn't bad if you're willing to study, and it's always clear what will be tested.",
    "If you are interested in economics, then take ECON 111. The seminar atmosphere gives you a tremendous opportunity to talk with the professor in class about pressing issues and actually have meaningful discussion. Furthermore, a good portion of the syllabus covers pertinent topics like unemployment, inflation, and the financial crisis. If you don't really care about the economy and its intellectual features, then don't take this course, but otherwise it was pretty fascinating.",
    "I recommend it for anyone who really wants to learn economics; I haven't experienced the lecture, but I hear it's not nearly as rigorous."
