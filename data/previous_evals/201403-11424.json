    "This course is extremely demanding, but it is an excellent synthesis of all of the material learned in Stands, Sampling, Silviculture. Dr. Mark Ashton is a great mentor and guides you through the material, but he is \"hands off\" enough to really push you to learn and apply the material yourself.",
    "The field trips could be cut a little shorter. The exercises were extremely valuable (namely the site classification and soils), but we could talk more in a classroom and spend less time standing around in the woods before the exercises begin.",
    "This course is essential for anyone interested in land management, field work, or becoming a naturalist. Hands down, this was the best course I've ever taken. It synthesized much of what I've learned at F&ES and gave me the opportunity to incorporate and understand much of what I'd learned before returning to graduate school. Mark is also one of the few teachers who gives substantial feedback throughout the course. Though it was a lot of work, I benefited immensely from this course and Mark's teaching."

    "Course provides a lot of applicable skills and holistic knowledge",
    "It was a practical, synthesis of many concepts and activities that are necessary for individuals going into forestry. Participating in a consulting project from design to implementation and finally to synthesis through a published document is indispensable.",
    "The best aspects of the course were the field work and the plan writing. In the course, you develop your own sampling design for the property, which forces you to really think about what data you need to collect, and how you can collect it in the most efficient way possible. Writing the plan was also a great exercise in explaining complex material to a lay audience.",
    "Experience using publishing software, practicing tree ID, working with real landowners, presenting in a professional way to a landowner, and writing management recommendations.",
    "The synthesis of field work, observation, and analysis. The deep look into a piece of land (which can really represent many places in Southern New England). I gained several hard skills (Excel, GIS, soil and plant taxonomy) relevant to future career interests. The feeling of connection and satisfaction from getting to know a piece of land better than any I've ever known. Making a final document that I'm actually proud of - a product to show employers and others. Mark is an excellent teacher and mentor. This course is essential for MF candidates - it ties together everything else we've studied into a single application\/use."

   "comments": [
    "Sometimes assignments, expectations of the course were unclear",
    "It would be beneficial to incorporate a workshop on the Adobe suite programs and possibly a workshop on forest inventory software such as FVS and NED. Though this would require more time for the class which is already lengthy.",
    "The only thing that really would have been helpful would be better communication between the professor and the students, especially regarding when materials were due. Often, we would receive emails just a day or two in advance (or sometimes even the day of) telling us when assignments were due. It is good to have flexibility in terms of due dates, based on the pace of the class, but it is also important to set clear expectations at least a week in advance so that students have time to adequately prepare. Likewise, it would be better if the readings were posted further in advance of class time, so we had more than one or two nights to read 100+ pages of material.",
    "I would give students a heads up that they will need to have a publishing software on their laptop or be prepared to use school computers. A tutorial on inDesign or some simpler publishing software could be helpful. I probably would have used a different software if I had known how difficult it would be to print the plan using its file type. Some computer expertise probably could have prevented that hassle.",
    "It seems like this course is pretty much figured out - given that Mark has taught it for a long time, I think most of the kinks are worked out. One thing that I'm not actually sure if I'd change is that I felt like the constant due dates for rough drafts meant that we ended up doing things multiple times. Sometimes the initial expectations weren't entirely clear, so we ended up redoing the work in a completely different way. I hesitate to say this needs to change: I understand that the frequent due dates for specific parts of the management plan are probably necessary to keep us on track and on time. Also, it isn't the worst thing to have to redo an assignment - usually the second attempt is far better."

It provides excellent experience working with a client and applying all that you've learned in the first half of the MF program. It did not disappoint.",

Also, I ended up doing almost all of the quantitative analyses and mapping for my group, so I was able to really develop some proficiency in GIS and Excel.

   "comments": [
    "The advantages of working in a group are that we could not have gotten as much work done without working in a group.",
    "Class work was very heavy on groupwork, but had a very positive group experience, making it a good part of the course. Would have been very challenging if group was not a good fit.",
    "Group work was essential for this project. Being able to sample with a partner was crucial. On the other hand, my partner was not a very good writer, so I shouldered the entire written portion of the management plan, which was very difficult and time consuming. But that comes with the territory of group work, and I was happy that, in the end, we developed a decent product. Another advantage of the group work was that it helped me to realize where my strengths and weaknesses are as an aspiring forester. I was able to help with plant identification, the development of management recommendations, and plan writing, but I was weak when it came to using GIS and classifying soils. My partner was stronger in these areas, so it was really fortunate to be able to play off of each others strengths while realizing the areas that we each need to develop during the rest of our time here.",
    "Overall it was a great experience. It taught me to divide work based on our relative strengths and weaknesses and how to be accountable to another person. The only disadvantage was proofreading sections of the plan that were written in broken English--it was very time consuming, and some help editing would be nice for those working with international students.",
    "Advantages: the sampling load for this project was too high for one person. Also, in theory, having other interpretations of what you're experiencing is critical. Disadvantages: In practice, as with most group projects I've had at F&ES, the more motivated student (in this case, I believe this is myself) does more of the work. I felt like I was constantly trying to motivate my group to take things to a higher level and to do the work on-time so we could get the appropriate feedback. My group was not particularly interested in the mapping or the interpretation of the landscape, so I felt like I was making almost all of the critical decisions with the management plan. As the course went on, this problem grew, as I had made so many of the early decisions that the final recommendations were based off of my analyses and interpretations. It seems like one of the primary reasons for group projects is to share in the analyses and decision-making process. Part of the problem is that they were always behind me - I didn't want to procrastinate, so I was always thinking about this class when they seemed to prioritize their other courses or research. I had done other substantial group projects at F&ES and they had been put off until the final weeks, with disastrous results. It also seemed like my group deferred all judgement to myself, I think because they knew I had high expectations and it would get done even if they didn't take charge. A little bit of a \"tragedy of the commons, perhaps? I don't have any useful advice on how to solve this problem - it seems like a perennial issue with group projects. In any case, my group was good to work with in most ways (great at field work), and maintained a positive attitude, which were greatly appreciated. The document looks amazing - due to their effort. I'm very happy with the final result we came up with."

It is a great course for learning the process of assessing a piece of land, assessing the needs and values of different stakeholders, and developing a plan to manage the land in a socially and ecologically sound manner.",
    "Do not graduate from the Master of Forestry program without taking this class! Even if you don't work in the field or even in America later on, it teaches valuable skills like time management, working with clients, producing a professional-grade product, and teamwork.",

Do not get behind - make sure you pay attention during the lectures and labs so you can get the assignments in on-time to take full advantage of Mark and Meredith's feedback (a level of feedback which is rare at F&ES).
