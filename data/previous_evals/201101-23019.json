    "Take it if you're looking for an L5 without an emphasis on grammar, vocab or speaking. It's an interesting course, but after hearing more or less the same linguistic features about a dozen different countries in a dozen similar PowerPoints it starts to get repetitive. The reading is helpful but can definitely be skimmed. The quizzes aren't particularly fair and require more rote memorization than understanding of the concepts.",
    "This class is the perfect combination of Spanish and sociolinguistics, if those are things that pique your interest."
