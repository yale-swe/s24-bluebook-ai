    "Yes, only if you are willing to invest a lot of time!",
    "A little bit more work than L2, but also a lot more fun. The readings are pretty good, especially \"L'Etranger\".",
    "Yes, I would recommend it.",
    "Yes, I would recommend it. It's a fair amount of work, especially at the beginning when you're figuring out how to organize the work and plan your time, although it does get better. Tests can be challenging, but the course really will improve your French. It is far superior to L1 and L2, and from my experience the professors all seem very strong, especially Madame Burton.",
    "I recommend it because it helps improve grammar and reading skills.",
    "If you are at all interested in the French language and want to improve your speaking, listening and reading comprehension skills then you should take this course. It was intensive, but the workload was not extremely heavy. The films and novels studied are entertaining, thought-provoking and funny in their ownrights and they may just change your perspective on the world. In high school, my French classes were solely conducted through reading and writing, but French 130 demands that you be able to speak what you can write. The professors recognize the importance of being able to communicate orally and they will help you to gain the confidence to do so.",
    "French 130 seems to be the standard language class at Yale: lots of work in the course packet that intersects with whatever text you're reading at the time, compositions, and exams that combine oral sections with written ones. However, the readings for French 130 (we begin the semester with Le Petit Nicolas before moving on to L'Etranger and other more serious things) are interesting. I would definitely recommend this course. If possible, sign up for Madame Burton's section."
