   "comments": [
    "Yes, take it, it forces you to write. But only if you have a real serious background in theater and playwriting. I would strongly suggest starting with another playwriting professor here at Yale, and then taking a Margulies class.",
    "Awesome. If you want to write plays there's no better class, except maybe the fall semester. I recommend you take both.",
    "Great class. You write a full length play. Donald is only helpful if you're proactive about meeting him though. Not really different from intro playwriting... Quality of people aren't even much better. Great class though!",
    "Absolutely take this course if you can. Professor Margulies is great, and you will learn a ton about playwriting in the process. Be prepared to do the work though, because there is a ton of writing and it requires a lot of focus and dedication.",
    "I would wholeheartedly recommend this class - perhaps especially in conjunction with one of Deb Margolin's playwrighting classes, which approach the process from an entirely different direction. The attention to structure and detail gained in this class is invaluable.",
    "A great class with a great professor for learning about plays while workshopping your own. Take it if you can get in, though have some ideas ahead of time about what you might want to write about. The semester gets off to quick start, so it helps to have the specifics figured out early.",
    "Yes. An amazing class for any aspiring writer. And you'll get a good play out of it (hopefully)."
