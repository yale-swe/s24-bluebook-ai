    "This course demands very little but is a highlight of the week. It provides examples of current work in economics across a variety of fields, and helps improve vocabulary and awareness of various methodologies.",
    "You should take this course if you want exposure to different ways that environmental economics is being applied. Each week's seminar was an interesting presentation on current environmental or natural resource economics research."
