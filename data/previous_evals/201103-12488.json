   "comments": [
    "Mathematics 120 is a grueling course on Multivariable Calculus and quite frankly a fairly effective method of the math department of turning just about anyone away from further pursuit of mathematics. If it weren't necessary for SO many other classes\/pre-professional studies, I would not at all recommend the course.",
    "Lower-level mathematics courses at Yale tend to have a poor reputation; I came to find out that was completely justified. Consensus says the only good teacher for Math 120 is Professor Frame (a legend at Yale). The lectures on the whole are not very engaging and mainly consist of problems on the book solved for you on the blackboard; much less concepts-oriented than one would hope. Prepare to consult your book frequently.",
    "It's a crucial math class for those who wish to pursue science or engineering. I would recommend it solely based on a student's interests\/intended major.",
    "Math 120 is definitely a manageable class, but I feel that most of the learning was done on my own reading the book or looking over notes. Kushnir is not that engaging as a professor. It's hard making math interesting, but I would recommend shopping around. Even having a teacher who speaks loudly can make a big difference.",
    "If you want to learn multivariable calculus techniques to find integrals in higher dimensions, take this course....",
    "This standard multivariable calculus class will fulfill your math requirement for most physical science majors, and if you particularly liked single variable calculus, you'll probably enjoy this class as well.",
    "Math 120 is a great class for students who wish to further their mathematical education, but should not be taken by those who are just looking for a basic continuation of calculus. It requires much more thought than basic calculus classes, and a thorough capability of visualizing objects in 3D. Kushnir is a great instructor though, take it with him!",
    "There's only one 10-problem homework set per week, but they take a while and are only worth 10% of the grade. It definitely takes a lot of studying outside of lecture and it's not exciting material. I would not recommend this course unless it's necessary.",
    "Take it. You won't enjoy it, but you should take it.",
    "After taking BC Calc senior year, this was the right class to place into. It was not easy - it's pretty fast-paced - but it's the kind of class that if you put in enough effort you should do well. Dan Kushnir went a little too fast in my opinion; often in class I was so focused on keeping up with my note-taking that I wouldn't actually process anything he said. That being said, the textbook is great and I had no trouble going home and learning on my own as I did the problem sets. I would consider Joe Lauer or Subhojoy Gupta as teachers; I went to Joe's review sessions and Gupta subbed for us one week. Both of them were great and went the split second slower for me to understand and be able to ask questions in class.",
    "It's a standard intro class; take it if you need to.",
    "Don't take it unless you must.",
    "Take the class if you need it for a major. Otherwise, look elsewhere for a QR credit. In the end, I liked the subject matter, but I felt like I was putting in to much time teaching myself the material."
