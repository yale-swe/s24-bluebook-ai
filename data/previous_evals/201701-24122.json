   "comments": [
    "I learned so much through working on a yearlong thesis. I learned how to work on a large project, to organize myself. I also learned how to write clearly and effectively, and how to do independent archival research.",
    "I think the yearlong senior project is a really good way to understand how to deeply investigate a historical topic. I often feel that I do not have the adequate time during normal classes to learn all I want to about a topic, or the page limit is too small to really dive deep into a topic. But, the yearlong senior project allows you to pick a topic you really like and learn as much about it as you can and really discover new and exciting things about your subject.",
    "Lengthy history paper, learned about how to pace myself\/my research.",
    "I learned how to effectively right an original, historical piece in a way that culminated all of the skills I learned in HSHM seminars.",
    "I had to use all the skills I had gained from other HSHM and general Yale courses to plan, research, and write what would be the culmination of my time as a student here. It was very rewarding to see the final product and know that I drew on everything that I had learned over the past four years.",
    "I learned how to write a longer research paper.",
    "This course was both personally and academically fulfilling. I learned a lot about how to engage in extended, comprehensive scholarly work, and also about what sorts of topics and questions I find most engaging. Writing a senior essay was definitely challenging, but I learned about how to manage my time, how to think more like a historian, and how to write a longer piece of academic work.",
    "Long term research in a current a important topic. Paper writing and planning skills.",
    "Through the year-long thesis in History of Science, Medicine and Public Health, I was able to learn how to formulate an original argument (based upon historical research), and then draft an extended essay on the topic. I was able to consider how to blend coherent storytelling with historical research and original analysis.",
    "I learned how to work on a year long project and research a topic throughly.",
    "I became better at finding historical sources, reading and analyzing them, and crafting or modifying my thesis in light of new evidence. This was the first time that I had undertaken an independent, long-term project. I learned to organize my project into more manageable steps, reach out to my adviser when I needed help, and also (somehow) acquired the self-discipline to push myself to finish! The HSHM senior thesis was my most rewarding academic experience at Yale. I grew enormously, both intellectually and emotionally. Finally, after writing the thesis I discovered that I am not suited for graduate studies in the humanities - a lesson that I am now so grateful to have picked up relatively early in life!"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I think that this course itself could be improved with more meetings as a whole group. I think the meetings with our advisors were helpful, but they could have been supplemented by meetings with the full major to discuss strategies and to talk about each other's work.",
    "It would be benificial to have regular meetings hosted by the department to either workshop essays in a group or have an opportunity to ask questions with other students. Overall, my advisor (Jenna Healey) provided tremendous support and guidance for this project.",
    "It is difficult to not have a pre-set time to work on it every week. With normal classes, you are checking in with your class and the teacher about the material weekly, but with the senior project you have to do it all on your own. I think it is nice to have flexibility and your own direction with it. It is just something that I had to learn to set time aside specifically for when I didn't have to prepare for a class every week. I do think a strength though is that you do have so much freedom in choosing and investigating your own topic.",
    "It was very helpful for me to have the steady deadlines in the fall semester for proposal, outline, bibliography etc. Helped keep me on track",
    "HSHM organized our essays well.",
    "I wish I had a bit more structured advising. I felt that I was on my own for a lot of the process, and while it was nice to have to not meet strict deadlines, it also would have forced me to start writing earlier in the year, which I think could have benefited my final project. At the same time, the freedom and flexibility of the course is definitely helpful for making it your own.",
    "Lots of guidance but could do with more set deadlines to keep you on track.",
    "On the one hand, I could have benefitted from some more early deadlines to assure that I was working on pace. On the other hand, I appreciated the freedom to explore the topic on my own time and in my own way. Ultimately, I think it's critical for students in this department to write a complete draft before spring break in order to have enough time to revise it.",
    "The strength of my thesis was my amazing advisor Melissa Grafe. She was extremely helpful in working with me to organize my topic into a cohesive argument.",
    "I wish HSHM had a more formal advisor choosing process at the same time as History. By the time I started searching for an advisor, all the history professors were already booked.",
    "Strengths - opportunity to establish a strong working relationship with an HSHM faculty mentor, independence to craft an original thesis with Yale's incredible resources at my disposal, having the chance to \"test out\" what graduate studies in history might be like Weaknesses\/areas for improvement - my biggest complaint of the HSHM major is that there was very little sense of community or collegiality among my classmates and myself. Part of this is the nature of history studies (seminars once a week, with lots of independent reading, thinking, and writing). I would have loved to participate in more departmental events for undergraduates - for instance, monthly senior essay lunches (even organized in a residential college dining hall) for students to catch up and talk about their writing, or a senior essay symposium."

   "comments": [
    "The second half of a yearlong senior essay. Definitely do the yearlong version, you'll be so proud when it's over.",
    "I do recommend this course, I think it is very useful to be able to pick your own topic and really get to know it. It feels like a big accomplishment to be able to start with very little knowledge about your topic and learn so much about it over the year.",
    "Definitely--it's hard work slogging through but ultimately incredibly rewarding.",
    "Everyone should write a senior essay.you learn so much about yourself and your topic.",
    "Obviously writing a senior essay is not an option if you are an HSHM major, but I do think that the yearlong course offers students an opportunity to really engage with their topic and develop their thinking in a more complete way than a single semester project. I would recommend, if you have the time, to enroll in the yearlong project. It is definitely one of the most challenging parts of Yale, but also one of the most rewarding.",
    "Yes it was very interesting!",
    "I would recommend other students who major in History of Science, Medicine and Public Health commit to a year-long senior thesis project. The level of discipline, organization and critical thinking that goes into the work is valuable to students who want to pursue a career in any field that requires writing\/researching.",
    "You have to take a senior thesis project. I would recommend doing the one semester project over the year long one.",
    "Yes! I strongly recommend doing a non-traditional project. The full year is not that much harder.",
    "The senior thesis was the most rewarding (and most challenging) academic project I've undertaken at Yale. As in first semester, your experience will largely depend on your adviser and your motivation to keep up with deadlines. There isn't a lot of support from the department (beyond reminder emails from the HSHM administrative assistant about upcoming deadlines). Some words of advice - maintain an honest, communicative relationship with your adviser (they will often have lots of good advice, especially if you are falling behind. my advisor gave excellent pep talks!), try to meet with your adviser on a regular basis, don't be afraid to open up to others if you are feeling down or overwhelmed!"
