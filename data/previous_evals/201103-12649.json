    "YES- a fun way to learn some interesting stuff",
    "Do not take Music 110 as your \"easy class\" because you'll be setting yourself up for failure. This class requires a lot of energy, effort, and time, so take it seriously in order to do well.",
    "Take the class if you have any interest in music, especially if you play an instrument or sing and have little idea of the background ideas, concepts and reasons. It is very well taught and was a great course.",
    "A solid music theory course. Can be slightly tedious at times with the homework assignments and certain dry lectures, but you do get to do fun things like sing chorales in class and listen to\/analyze contemporary music.",
    "Music theory starting from the very basics (like learning notes),all the way to scales, chords, and harmonizing.",
    "Yes, it's good. But the student should keep in mind that while we do a few fun things like performances and listening, the class is mostly theory.",
    "Music 110 is a great foundation for music theory. I've taken guitar lessons since middle school (and played saxophone before that), but never had the chance to take a theory course. I found 110 was the perfect level (despite misleading descriptions of 205). If you can read music, the first couple weeks will be review - but after that, everything was new (at least for me). And if you have the chance, take it with James. He's a great teacher, loves what he does, and is always more than fair. He made what could have been a dry course very enjoyable.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class for a fellow student! Especially if the class is taught with James Park. He sang Bieber, shared brownies, and played music just about every class. It was definitely a stress-down class and I enjoyed it!",
    "If you're looking for an engaging Hu credit, take this class (I highly recommend James Park as a professor if he's teaching). Music theory is interesting and applicable even if you're not a music major, and being able to read sheet music is always a plus. I really enjoyed the way this class was structured; small sections allowed for fun and interesting discussion. The professor made a real effort to make the class more than \"this is a treble clef and this is bass.\"",
    "Take it!"
