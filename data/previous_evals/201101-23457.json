   "comments": [
    "Overall useful course. Especially found the guest speakers and individual consultation sessions useful.",
    "Pushed us to lift the veil on the mystery of the grant process. I am much less intimidated. Great to see others' proposals as well - extremely instructive.",
    "strengths- valuable skill to learn for future projects and fundingWeaknesses- very little direction and helpful feedback. Unorganized",
    "This course has the potential to be beneficial to the student, but the instructor does not give adequate feedback on assignments. She is also only available one day a week for questions outside of class.",
    "Excellent courseStepwise approach to learning, which makes to easier to learn",
    "Excellent course, well structured",
    "This course is supposed to teach us to write an R01 grant. However, the class sessions could have been much more effective. We should have written the grant step by step with instructor feedback each week. Instead, we had a few assignments in the very beginning and then just turned in a draft for peer review over a month later. Peer review is not nearly as helpful as the instructors comments would have been as the other students in the class had never written a grant before either so they didn't necessarily know what they were reviewing. There was also a significant issue with students not understanding study design in their proposals.",
    "The best part was the mock panel at the end. Very valuable experience - don't change a think.",
    "I learned a lot about the process.",
    "Strengths: Group Grant Review provided invaluable feedback and provided real-world experience. It gave insight to all levels of student (Phd, MD, AP, MPH, etc.) and improved each other's work considerably. The review created a spirit of collegial collaboration for which all classes should strive to achieve.Weaknesses: The Groupd Grant Review could have taken place earlier in the course..alternatively, Grant Review could have been a part of each class, and culminate with a review of classmate's work.Strengths: great use of publicly avaialable materials (NIH, gov websites and Video**)Weaknesses: Example Grants and Scoring should have been available sooner.Strengts: one paper. This really gives the student a chance to walk away with something meaningful and tangible without burdening them with a lot of extra busy work.",
    "A very useful course where you learn skills that would be really important in the future if you plan to go into research.The lecture with Hoffmann in scientific writing was very good.The budget section could have been improved."

    "Instructor: Adrienne Ettinger \u00a0Knowledgeable in the field. Didn't always appear too interested in teaching course at times.",
    "Instructor: Adrienne Ettinger \u00a0Good variety of topics. I liked the way each assignment completed a section of the grant write-up.",
    "Instructor: Adrienne Ettinger \u00a0The instructor was friendly helpful during office hours however the instructor was rarely on campus and only came to a few classes. It was never clear what we were supposed to do for assignments and guest speakers contradicted what was taught in class.",
    "Instructor: Adrienne Ettinger \u00a0She did not give adequate feedback on assignments, I have no idea what grade I have going into the final assignment. She should have been more available to the students.",
    "Instructor: Adrienne Ettinger \u00a0Instructor was always very approachableAlways ready to helpgave us ideas relevant to our project so that we can take this project at another level",
    "Instructor: Adrienne Ettinger \u00a0She is a wonderful teacher, and very kind.",
    "Instructor: Adrienne Ettinger \u00a0Dr. Ettinger was away much of the semester and therefore did not put as much work into the course as other instructors in EPH do. She also cancelled a few lectures - and this was only a once a week course. She could have added to the \"value\" of the course by preparing more lectures and being more accessible for timely feedback.",
    "Instructor: Adrienne Ettinger \u00a0The instructor was a little distracted, but overall the course was set up well and the concept behind it was great. Very valuable experience.",
    "Instructor: Adrienne Ettinger \u00a0She got good speakers for some the sessions.",
    "Instructor: Adrienne Ettinger \u00a0Adrienne was always available by email but I would have liked to see her in class more often. We missed her for almost a month, and during that time I considered dropping the course entirely because I didn't feel like I was getting my monies worth. That said, she is the only professor that scheduled 1:1 meetings with her students. this impressed me enought, that I remained committed to the assignment.The IRB presentation I have seen before and this presentation needs to be more streamlined with a check list, and less dependent on the phrase \"come to the office to find more\", because this confuses people who may or may not need IRB.",
    "Instructor: Adrienne Ettinger \u00a0Ettinger knows a lot about this subject and it was very interesting to learn about these procedures. She was also very welcoming and seemed trult interested in our proposals.I would have liked more feedback in the assignments. It expected the development of the research protocol to involve more feedback, instead I felt like I was working totally independent."

   "comments": [
    "The basic goal of this course is to learn how to write a NIH grant.",
    "Well worth it. I wish I either had two years in the program or came in with a definite project in mind.",

    "No",
    "Excellent course for learning how to develop a research protocolI would definitely suggest everyone to take this course who is interested in doing lot of research",
    "I would certainly recommend to other students to take this course. This really gives good insightof research grant application process.",
    "This course is a semi-supervised grant writing course. If you need to write a grant proposal, take the course in order to keep yourself on schedule with the timeline and each section of the grant. Do not expect extensive instructor feedback or valuable peer reviews.",
    "Take the course - great intro to grant writing. Useful and timely.",
    "Good intro to the NIH grant application process.",
    "I would recommend it to students looking to work at a Foundation or NGO that recieves grants\/call for proposals. It would even help professional academics or students looking to continue their education, as they will need to submit similar research proposals.I told my advisor I wanted data managment skills because I would like to be in corporate insurance, or hospital administrative environments, and he recommended this class. I would not, given those interests. This class provides interesting exposure to peer-reviewed proposals, but this will not help me in my career towards people\/data\/project management outside academia\/ngo\/non-profit\/foundation work."
