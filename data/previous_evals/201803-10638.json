   "comments": [
    "This course helps you learn how to read a modern paper with a critical lens. Dr. Parr is very good at encouraging discussion that leads to a holistic view of the papers we read, not just focusing solely on the science being reported.",
    "This course is a great way to get a broad survey of the current cutting-edge of chemistry research by leveraging the broad connections and talks the chemistry department offers. I felt it not only improved my sense of the current field, but also helped strengthen my critical thinking when analyzing these talks as well as my written ability to articulate that thinking.",
    "This course taught me how to better and more efficiently read scientific papers. I also have a better understanding of the current trends in chemical research. Finally, I learned how to write a long form research paper on a scientific topic"

  {
   "question_id": "YC403",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "For me, the greatest weakness of this course was that everyone seemed to have drastically different backgrounds and comfort with research. As someone with no research background at all, I sometimes found myself intimidated by those who seemed really comfortable discussing these topics, and conversation was more heavily commandeered by those students. I'm not sure how this could be improved, otherwise it's a nice way to engage with modern papers.",
    "Great course format.",
    "The strengths of this course are the freedom of the topics, the structure (reading papers before watching the lectures), and Dr. Parrs guidance during the discussions.",
    "The major weakness of the course is that most students who take it don't take it seriously at all. This is a huge issue because it's a discussion based coursed, so you rely have to rely on everyone participating and coming prepared."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Yes. Would highly recommend. The course provides a good survey of different fields within chemistry and keeps you engaged with interesting discussions throughout. Your assignments consist of researching and listening to really interesting and groundbreaking research being done around the country. Pretty cool stuff.",
    "I would recommend this course to a chemistry major who isn't very well-versed in research, or doesn't necessarily participate in research (this was my situation). I enjoyed watching the talks and really appreciated Dr. Parr's discussions which gave a holistic view of the papers, beyond just the science discussed. I'm sure this course is also rewarding for those with more experience in research. The response papers are non-trivial, but they do help you sum up the in-class discussion of each talk, so they're a good way to actually think about what was discussed. A great way to engage in chemistry more analytically, as opposed to the quantitative\/hard-science-y way lectures typically go.",
    "Yes! Great way to learn about current chemistry research that could be otherwise intimidating in a friendly and open environment.",
    "This course is great. Theres a lot of freedom involved, and Dr. Parr is a very good discussion leader. I learned something new every week."
