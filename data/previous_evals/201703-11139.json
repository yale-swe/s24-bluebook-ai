   "comments": [
    "I like the methods of integrating and learning. More one on one learning of how to speak and answer questions that are not related to the coursework would be great-- I doubt I have to talk about the characters of Jules et Jim to someone from Paris. Also the work sometimes felt like busywork and took much longer than necessary.",
    "I think the course material could sometimes be a bit boring and I did not always feel engaged by what we were learning. At times, it also felt a bit basic. I liked the texts that we looked at and found it interesting how all of these materials were woven together throughout the course.",
    "The course did not have a lot of weaknesses in my opinion. It was very well organized and facilitated learning.",
    "I feel like those who studied abroad before this class or placed into it as freshman were way ahead of those who took 120, and it just wasnt great to see that large of a difference everyday in class",
    "Strengths: extremely well organized, great books and movies, and I greatly benefited from the nightly homework assignments that included written, spoken, and listening practice. Weaknesses: none that I can think of! Definitely requires quite a bit of work, but absolutely worth it.",
    "I thought this course was great, but some of the movies we watched weren't very engaging for me such as Jules et Jim."

    "Yes I would recommend the course because it helped me learn more french while cementing the foundational knowledge.",
    "Unless youre already pretty good at French, switch into another language",
    "Yes! This course is the absolute best way to go if you'd like to continue your study of French and advance as a French listener, speaker, reader, and writer. 100% worth it.",
    "Yes! This was a great course and I felt like I learned a lot."
