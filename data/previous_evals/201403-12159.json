   "comments": [
    "SLaM was my favorite class of the semester! For anyone with an interest in how sign languages work, this is the perfect class to take. Class time felt like much more of a friendly discussion than an actual class I was always surprised after class how much I learned that day without even noticing it! The required readings were generally very interesting and always on point. The instructor's expectations of the students were both clear and reasonable. Kate Zaremba is extremely nice and a very engaging instructor!",
    "!!!TAKE THIS COURSE!!! Please. If you can get in, take it. Kate is an amazing (and really nice) professor, the content is fascinating, and there's nothing like it (subject wise) offered at Yale at this point. The discussions and teaching are focused on what students are interested in. There is just the right amount of reading. The expectations are very clear and very doable. This is my favorite course I've taken at Yale. It might be hard to get into, but please try to get in. Really, take any class that Kate is teaching. Do it.",
    "SLaM was an awesome class to take. The weekly reading and comments were difficult, but never a pain to do. Class each week was always interesting and never felt like it dragged on. There's a break in the middle which I found very helpful, and Kate is a great professor. She's very understanding and so enjoyably passionate about her subject. Definitely recommend.",
    "This was by far my favorite class at Yale. The amount of reading is reasonable and are interesting so it never feels like work. The in class discussions are always interesting and the 2 hour class period always flew by. I would highly recommend this class to anyone even if they have no experience with sign language.",
    "Yes, do take this class! It's such an interesting and narrow focus, but it yields so much information you wouldn't have ever wondered about before. Professor Davidson is also the brightest and sweetest person. She does her lectures Prezi-style, which is rather refreshing. The reading comments are also cool because they make you read the literature that is currently relevant, though some of them can be technical and hard to understand.",
    "Yes, definitely recommend if you are interested in linguistics, neuroscience, and especially sign languages.",
    "A really great class if you're interested in sign languages. Some knowledge of linguistics definitely would've been helpful, but Kate's great and most of the paper's aren't too rough. It's not a class about Deaf culture, so don't expect a ton of that.",
    "ABSOLUTELY take this course. This is the kind of course that makes you question whatever you thought you knew you wanted to do with your life and do this instead. The professor is amazing, the workload manageable, and the material fascinating. Don't take it if you're only interested in cogsci OR linguistics, rather than both. But then again, this class will probably revolutionize the way you view both subjects.",
    "I would recommend SLaM, even to a student without a linguistics background (Kate is really good about explaining these concepts to those who have never taken linguistics). I enjoyed learning about sign language from a psycholinguistics perspective and how that ties into Deaf culture.",
    "Definitely take this class! Professor Davidson (Kate) is incredible and she brings in several incredible guest speakers as well as her own work, experience and enthusiasm about the fields. A very enjoyable class!",
    "The best class! Not many classes at Yale are interdisciplinary, let alone above the introductory level. This class melds cognitive science and linguistics in a totally manageable and interesting way. Sign language is awesome - you will learn so much! No need to stress over grades at all.",
    "Kate is a great professor! If you have a lot of experience with linguistics or cognitive science, just know that each week is an overview of a different field of linguistic\/cognitive science study, so there is a level of review each class."
