   "comments": [
    "A very helpful part of Chemistry 112 that just basically goes over everything you learned in class but with more examples and in a simplified manner.",
    "i would recommend it to another student because it was interesting and one was able to learn and understand the material.",
    "It is mandatory, but helpful. So I would encourage a fellow student to try and take advantage of their resource of knowledge.",
    "Chemistry is one of those classes most people take to fulfill a requirement. Considering this, I really enjoyed this class, and Professor Parr even had me considering chemistry as a major.",
    "While at times it was helpful, it mostly went over topics that are easily grasped.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student who has little or no background in chemistry.",
    "I would recommend this course.I feel like its the same as 114 except that we receive more explanation and people in 114 do more problem solving than we do. I would definately recommend the course for people who need to fulfill any pre-med requirements and cannot take any higher chemistry courses. For those who just need to fulfill a science credit, you should be prepared for hard work. However, the material is very interesting but requires constant revision.",
    "This section is the difference between Chem 114 and 112. Chem 112 takes things slower and provides extra forms of aid to better grasp Chemistry. This section is one of those ways. I would definitely recommend this section. I never missed one because it is where I learned and understood most of Chemistry.",
    "Overall this section was helpful in supporting what was taught in class. While it does meet late at night once a week, I found it very useful. Also, the TA was able to answer any of my questions.",
    "If you are a premed student go for it, if not then you shouldn't take it.",
    "This section is actually very helpful. At first it may seem a bit of ap in to have to attend lecture as well as section, but it is definitely worth it if it helps you do better in the course."
