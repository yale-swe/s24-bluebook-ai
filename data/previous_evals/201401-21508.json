    "It was one of my favorite at Yale. If you are interested in Iraq, definitely try to take this class! I thought the format was excellent--Professor Howorth had each person do an assigned outside reading and ten minute presentation at some point in the term, so I felt like I was learning a lot, while being able to do a manageable amount of class reading each week. Professor Howorth is great at leading class discussions and keeping people on point. The workload was a bit on the heavy side, but it's worth it. The format of the class was weekly readings with: 4 reading responses over the term, a presentation and midterm paper, and a 25 page final paper.",
    "yes, recommended",
    "The Iraq Crisis is a great class - the Iraq war is a key event that both was shaped and has shaped by how U.S. policy makers view the world and thus is very important to understand. This class also is a great lens with which to understand US -european relations on international interventions. And if you pick a presentation date without to much other work, the class is very manageable.",
    "Definitely. An interesting course with a great professor, and it's a topic Americans (or anyone) should know more about.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. It is a high quality, higher intensity poli sci seminar for people looking to really get into the academic side of the major. I loved the class. You definitely get much more out of it if you participate and do all of the readings, but it is also possible to get by while doing the bare minimum",
    "Take it. The work is worth it.",
    "An incredible class that analyzes one of the most interesting and crucial countries to International Relations. Wonderful professor who makes the class both interesting and fun. HIGHLY recommend it, but would advise sending an email ahead of the seminar if you want a chance at getting in.",
    "Definitely take this class!! It is so important to know about the Iraq War and the roles that the United States as well as other countries played in the conflict. It provides a great introduction to different perspectives and documents on the war. Before taking this class, I only had a general understanding of the conflict and now have a much better understanding of the decision-making process about going to war and the consequences that arose because of the conflict."
