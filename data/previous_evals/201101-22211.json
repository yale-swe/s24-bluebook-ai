   "comments": [
    "yes, the history is really interesting, and it doesn't focus on WW2\/Holocaust\/etc. like so many German history classes...",
    "This course has interesting material, and you read and write a lot. Good for improving German vocabulary",
    "Take this class! You'll learn a lot about German history. There will be plenty of vocab and writing exercises too! A very good class to take to maintain your German skills.",
    "German 160 was a really good course. Professor Gehlker is incredibly nice and the workload is very reasonable. There were about 6 300-400 word essays, and one final 600 word essay in addition to about 3 in-class presentations to the class on either a novel or some part of German history. The two novels read were very interesting and challenging, at least for me, having skipped 150 and gone straight from 140 to 160. I would definitely recommend this course.",
    "If you've reached this level of language in any language, classes are really what you make out of them. The more you invest into the reading and learning vocabulary and improving your writing the better your German will be. You can also take this class passively and just kind of maintain your German. It's what you want - the demands of the class are not rigorous. For me, it was a good 5th class.",
    "If you want to keep up your German and learn about German history in a casual way, this is a good class.",
    "I would definitely recommend German 160 to another student! This course does a good job sharpening one's German skills - particularly writing - while simultaneously teaching one a lot about 20th c. German history and its presentation in various cultural forms."
