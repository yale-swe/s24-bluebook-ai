    "A good statistics class for people in political science and global affairs.",
    "The light and spark of this class is Professor Justin Thomas. He is fair, receptive to students' plights, and an incredible statistics teacher. Attending his office hours and\/or attending section, during which Stata is gradually taught, are keys to becoming data-proficient and is all that is necessary to succeed in his class. There is no need to attend class each session, but with Justin's surprise story at the start of every class, you may actually want to.",
    "Introductory applied statistics course. Very useful for global affairs majors, or anyone that wants to participate in social science research in the future. Overall, solid course.",
    "GLBL 121 is a good statistics class for Global Affairs majors and anyone looking for a not-useleses QR credit. It helps you understand how to interpret statistic in any research paper you'll read. The course is challenging, particularly in the second half, but Professor Thomas is really funny and approachable. The work is mostly problem sets, which can at times be quite long.",
    "Most people who take this would be for the global affairs major requirement but it helps to know that this class is now a great class under Professor Justin!",
    "I recommend this class even if you are not a Global Affairs major. It is much better than Intro Statistics, introduces students to a very useful data program (Stata), and gives students an excellent framework for understanding the quantitative aspects of social science papers.",
    "Not a hard QR, interesting class to take, good professor.",
    "You have to take it for global affairs, but it isn't a bad class. I actually learned a lot about stats and Professor Thomas is an excellent teacher.",
    "Professor Thomas is phenomenal. Long and exhausting problem sets and weekly panic attacks. Useful knowledge and comprehensive theoretical understanding of statistics in social sciences. I would recommend this course.",
    "I would certainly recommend the class to other students. It is a nice introduction to statistics that keeps its foundation in the application of the material to how people use the approaches of research and evaluating data in careers.",
    "For anyone remotely interested in policy applications of statistics and ways to evaluate actual studies, take glbl 121 especially if Justin continues to teach it. A chill QR, though psets are frequently painful.",
    "Useful material to learn for any area of study, just wish more time had been spent on the practical analysis.",
    "GLBL 121 is a good introduction to statistics and provided me with the knowledge to read through research papers that utilize statistics.",
    "I took this course because I'm a Global Affairs major. It's a great course, but I'm not sure why you would take it for any other reason. I guess in general, if you're interested in social science applications of statistics, and you're new to statistics, you should take this class for sure.",
    "The course material itself is not super interesting since it's an introduction to statistics, but Professor Thomas is extremely dynamic and makes the experience a lot better. Workload is manageable - one problem set per week, and a midterm and a final which are equally weighted.",
    "No. Honestly, take econometrics instead. At least you'll have some marketable skills.",
    "I gained a basic foundational introduction to statistical analysis in this course, but it had many issues. I am thankful that I can now understand relatively well the statistical graphs in the political science articles I read (although we didn't get to regression analysis until the very end). The class was not enjoyable, though, which is unfortunate, because I had heard such wonderful things about it from previous years when Lloyd was teaching it. I'm not sure if the shift in general attitude towards the class comes more from differences in Lloyd and Justin's teaching style or the content changes made to the class this year. Whatever the reason, this class has changed from very well regarded and liked, to generally disliked. Justin was a great guy who obviously cares a lot about his students and wants to do the best job possible. There were a few things I could have done better though. 1. His slides were full of way too much text and fluff. This material is complex enough for non math majors. He needed to cut down the extraneous information and focus on highlighting the necessary formulas to use, when to use them and what order to use them in. 2. He should have walked us through more examples in class, writing out all the steps on the board for us to see and internalize. These questions should resemble more closely the questions we were asked on the problems sets. 3. He should not open up pivotal questions to the entire lecture class and assume that we all understood it when one person answered it correctly. He should give us the important material directly in a clear and well explained manner. 4. His problem sets were exaggeratedly long. My peers who had taken this class last year spent an average of 2-3 hours on psets they told me, which is a reasonable amount of time for this class. There were two weeks in a row this semester, however, in which my peers and I spent a total of 15-20 hours on a weekly pset. We are all involved students. It was indulgent of him to think we could spend that amount of time per week on his class. 5. He should make his examples more relevant to pressing issues in the security and development realms of international affairs. It would make our problem sets more interesting to complete. 6. He needs to chose a new textbook that isn't as dense. There was a joke I had heard someone say that they had bought a $180 table A. It was because reading the text was so useless, we only used it for the table A in the appendix. Lastly, my TA was not qualified in the least to be teaching this material. She knew it less than some students did. She actually stopped section to google a question because she got herself confused on how to answer it. She proceeded to show it on the board, changing her methods 3 times because she forgot how to do it. The times I tried to go to her office hours made me more confused on the material. Although my TA was not very excited to teach this class in the first place, I do not fault her completely. Jackson should NOT have assigned her to this class that she was unqualified to teach. The fact that the Institute did reflects poorly upon a major that should aim to offer the highest quality educational experience to its select students.",
    "Not unless you really want a QR that's not a gut or you're doing GA, of course.",
    "I would summarize AQA as what I assume a general stats class would be like, but with an emphasis on solving real problems. However, unless a student needs the credit for the Global Affairs major or just really likes stats and math, I would not recommend the class as a QR credit. Answers to problem sets and exams were just not explained well enough for a student without a big stats\/math background to really understand.",
    "I would definitely recommend Applied Quantitative Analysis to another student! Even if you are not a Global Affairs major or required to take statistics, you should take GLBL 121 because it will give you a solid background in statistics and is definitely applicable to any career after Yale. Also the Professor is really great and is willing to take the time to work with you if you are having difficulty with any of the concepts!",
    "Even for non-Global Affairs majors, this course is a good introduction the the fundamentals of statistics for social sciences. It is less rigorous that Intro Stats and more applied, which may be better for those simply looking to have the tools to conduct social science analysis and studies. It is not too rigorous and the course moves quite slowly to ensure students learn the relevant skills. Would definitely recommend if you are not looking for all the math\/theoretical explanations (though this may be annoying to those who simply ask 'why' down to the very core.)",
    "This course is a basic introduction of statistics and regression analysis. The course gives an introduction to using Stata software but doesn't go in depth. Overall, it is a manageable course-load, however, some of the problem sets are time consuming. It is helpful to read through the book and lecture slides before starting the problem sets. The exams are very fair. Take it with Professor Thomas, he is great and very engaging.",
    "A useful class that will teach you to better appreciate polls and statistical modeling in the real world. Also a necessity for the Global Affairs major.",
    "Take it!",
    "If you are considering taking a stats class, TAKE THIS ONE. Seriously, as a person who is not the most quantitatively inclined, this class was really manageable and the prof was awesome. He is able to really clearly explain concepts and was just a really fun professor to have in general. I think there were a handful of people who would regularly just not come to lecture, but if you do take to the course, I think you would be screwing yourself over by not coming to class. Prof Thomas will regularly hint at what could be on the midterm or final, and you really don't want to miss his stories. (Keep your ears out for the Frozen movie theater experience one). In terms of course work, you will normally have weekly problem sets that, for us, were initially due Wednesdays, but then were pushed midway to the semester to Fridays, a midterm exam and a final exam. What were great about the exams were that you always felt you had a really good idea of what exactly would be on each test. Like Prof Thomas says in class, he doesn't pull any surprises come exam day. As a piece of advice, definitely go to office hours!!!!!!! Especially in the beginning weeks if the topics seems to just not click or seem a little confusing. All of the \"interpretation\" questions you'll be asked to answer throughout the second half of the semester basically build upon what you learn in the first couple weeks, so you'll definitely want a good handle of what's going on early on.",
    "An absolutely amazing class!! It's very QRy, so you need to go to lecture and work to understand it. But, if you do, you'll learn a lot of very applicable things that I'm already using. Professor Thomas is PHENOMENAL. He works very hard to make the material applicable and relatable. He's very high energy and works hard to get to know everyone. I would 100% recommend this class. The Psets take time, so you have to be committed, but the tests are very fair, and you really do learn a lot throughout the semester. I'd recommend over STAT 101, and I think the material is pretty similar.",
    "I took this class as a non-global affairs major looking for a QR credit that felt important and relevant without being too difficult. I was not disappointed in that regard. This is a solid course about practical information, and I think I am a better scholar for having taken it. However, I don't think the course lived up to past reviews, probably because this is the first semester it has been taught by a new professor. All in all, this course is solid, but not stellar. Good information and engaging lectures, but watch out for the TAs and the grading; both are disappointing.",
    "Not bad for a QR course, and if you're a GLBL major you'll end up taking it whether or not you want to. Professor Thomas is pretty laid-back, but don't go in expecting a gut QR. You learn some useful information about stats, which will (I hope) prove useful in future courses.",
    "Take it if you need to. The material is not that interesting - even though the professor's great.",
    "I would highly, highly recommend this class for anybody in the social sciences (or otherwise actually). It has a heavy focus on practical application and is designed in a way that really helps you learn.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone who wants to do research in the social sciences and anyone who reads a lot as this class is helpful in deciphering what statistics in articles really mean.",
    "I would definitely recommend GLBL 121 to any fellow student, whether a stats or global affairs major or not. You learn so much real-world, applicable knowledge. JT is a funny, caring, and interactive professor who will make the material very digestible. The psets are not too bad and neither are the midterm or final, if you keep up and review the concepts. Plus you get a QR credit.",
    "Professor Thomas is a great teacher, and tries to keep lectures engaging with funny anecdotes. He's very approachable, and tries to get to know his class.",
    "GLBL 121 was the perfect quantitative credit for a non-math\/social science student! Professor Thomas is so great ad personable. He makes an effort to really get to know students and is wiling to do anything to help. He's also a great lecturer. This class was a good overview of social science stats. The workload wasn't too bad. We had a midterm, a final, and a problem set every week. However, the midterm and the final tended to be a lot harder than any problem set we worked on, so it was a bit misleading. Overall, it was a great class ad I highly recommend it to other social science students. I felt that this class offered very valuablel lessons in reviewing academic research.",
    "Take it. I'm not a math person, but this was a really good course. Justin is a wonderful teacher: his lectures are clear and engaging, and he makes himself very accessible.",
    "Good class. If you are interested in knowing how social science studies are computed, Professor Thomas will provide a great overview. The class is a bit technical, but I am partly a mathematics major, so this was a bonus for me. I'd greatly recommend this course to a student who doesn't mind learning a bit of programming (Stata).",
    "A basic stats class. Professor Thomas is genuinely a very nice guy, cares very much about the class, and is very engaging, but he also made this class way more complicated than it should have been. He made it participatory, but only 5 people really talked, and they just complicated the material for the rest of the class. It is very simple material in reality. Overall, Professor Thomas is a great guy and I'm sure the class will improve (this was his first semester).",
    "If GLBL 121 ia not required, exploring other options might not be a bad idea. If you have to take it, be prepared for a hectic semester ahead.",
    "This is a good introduction to statistics that is geared towards Global Affairs majors. The problem sets were fairly straightforward, and the course ensures that you have a good grasp of statistical theories.",
    "No. A lot of work and not easy",
    "If you don't have to take this class, I would recommend that you look elsewhere for a QR\/introduction to statistics. It was pretty difficult, and some of the problem sets took obscenely long. That said, if you do have to take the course, it's not that bad.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend if you're looking for a QR.",
    "Take this class with Prof. Thomas! He makes even dry material seem interesting (even for a humanities major!), and his lectures are extremely engaging and helpful. He makes an effort to get to know all his students, and the class is taught in a question-and-answer format that makes the large lecture much less intimidating (also, there is almost no need at all to read the textbook if you simply attend lecture). The workload is manageable and the exams are very fair (I highly recommend going to his review sessions, they are extremely helpful). Though I was taking this class to fulfill a QR, I truly ended up enjoying it and am considering taking more stats-related courses in the future."
