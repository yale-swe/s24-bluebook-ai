   "comments": [
    "I come away from this course with a much more nuanced, historicized understanding of how race is constructed, negotiated, and manifested over time, even how race factors into the way historians attempt to write histories that necessarily involve a negotiation with the ways racialization influences the archive or the sound and reach of voices. I also come away with a more uswful understanding of the early Americas as that history is related to and conditions my American experience as a woman of color.",
    "I learned how to engage with specific historical moments on their own terms, how to trace ideas through time and between places, how to interpret and utilize historiography, and how to talk about history productively as neither inevitable nor entirely in the past - and how to bring historical understandings into conversation with present day ideas and events so that neither one elides the other's specificities.",
    "This was an excellent course that developed my ability to analyze and synthesize large amounts of reading. It gave a historical context to something that many of us take for granted: the existence of race in America and its impact on all of our lives.",
    "*Greater understanding of the complex and nuanced history of racial thinking in the US * Developed my critical reading skills, especially in terms of understanding complex and dense thesis from subsections of texts (for example, understanding an author's larger argument by reading their introduction and an additional chapter rather than their entire work) * Learned how to do individual archival research",
    "A new way of approaching history reading.",
    "As this course was, for me, an introduction to race theory, I learned how race is theorized and constructed. I also gained an understanding of the intellectual history of race theory, or how conceptions of race have developed and changed overtime."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Greta Lafleur is definitely a strength as a highly informed and responsive professor in class who communicates personability, reciprocity, and a special, rigorous enthusiasm for the material. The classroom dynamic was open, friendly and accomodating of all questions. A weakness may be the magnitude of the readings, which perhaps can be distilled better so that students see more clearly the tone and discursive productivity of the historical arguments on the history of race we discussed.",
    "The focus on history as really really really specific was a great - I think about past events differently now, everything is much blurrier - but we were also given tools in this course for dealing with that blurriness. For once I found student presentations helpful, mostly when they gave historical context for the readings, and explained details of the readings\/offered up broad themes pulled from the readings. Normally I think they're sort of dumb but it worked here, maybe because my classmates were invested. The class generated really intricate and thoughtful discussion, a testament to Greta's ability as an instructor to facilitate conversation, but also I think to the engagement level of the students. One weakness is the amount of reading - I always got so much more out of class when I had read all of the readings, but that was not always feasible. I found it frustrating because normally I don't want to do readings for class, but with History of Race, the will was there and just sometimes not the time. Another thing I would have liked to see more is a thematic overlying arc, so that the separate case studies we looked at could link up a bit more. Also, it was SUPER interesting when contemporary subjects were discussed alongside the material we were studying - more of that would be awesome.",
    "Strengths * A very knowledgable professor * A well formulated syllabus organized regionally * A wide breadth of readings that all help add to central questions of the course through unique lens * Writing assignments that ask us to critically engage with the readings and then use that knowledge in tandem with our own research to further our understanding of the topic Possible Improvements * integrate the work we do in writing assignments into class discussion * break up class discussion into different activities to help facilitate discussion and keep students more engaged * more guidelines when it comes to weekly presentations, particularly given that each week's topics are so different, presentations also have to vary in length and scope * only assign one of the Kazanjian readings",
    "Great engaging class sessions and fascinating readings.",
    "I think the strength of this course lies in its professor Greta LeFleur, who has an incredible breadth of knowledge on this subject and comes to each seminar prepared to both answer any question and offer her own analyses of the readings. She leads an optimal seminar because she both allows students to express their opinions but also frequently offers mini-lectures, in which she gives historical context for the readings that would be otherwise inaccessible. The only weakness is the fact that the syllabus is not chronological and the course is, rather, rooted in overarching themes, so its occasionally difficult to grasp the purpose of the course or what you learned as a whole."

   "comments": [
    "Yes. It will kick your butt but it's worth it. I learned more in this class than I think any other class I've taken at Yale, and I was constantly talking about it to all my friends and not friends basically everyone. Particularly given the America we live in right now, as well as current campus attitudes towards race and political involvement, knowing the history is SO important. I feel like I can talk and listen much more effectively than before taking this course.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to other students interested in the topic. It's a challenging course in that there is a lot of material to cover, but Professor LaFleur was an excellent seminar leader and really developed my writing and critical thinking skills.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone who wishes to gain a better understanding of how ideas of racial difference came to be throughout the Americas. This course takes an interdisciplinary approach that considers not just modern day US but also Mexico and Mexico City. The readings were substantial (about 100-150 pages of scholarly reading) but fascinating and important. The final paper gave me the opportunity to investigate a topic I found interesting more in depth. Also, Greta is a fantastic professor!",
    "Yes! A great approach to thinking about history with important applications.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student, particularly American studies students, interested in learning about race theory. I think it offers a good survey of the history of racial understanding and one will leave the class with stronger skills and a framework necessary to analyze racial relations. However, if someone already has taken multiple race theory classes, they might find this class somewhat introductory."
