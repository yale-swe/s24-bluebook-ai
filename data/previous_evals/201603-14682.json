    "Very comprehensive overview to different frameworks of monetary policy and other advanced topics in macro. Worked with macro models, as well as historical approaches to looking at monetary policy. Very good course -- English clearly knows what he's talking about and goes out of his way to be accessible to students. The TFs are also very helpful, but I'd recommend changing section to a different time than Friday morning if this course is taught again.",

    "Richer content that draws more attention - some lectures felt dry and hard to pay attention to but mostly they were interesting!"

    "Yes. Great class to learn important and applicable economic principles.",
    "Rather intense elective. Sometimes I wondered why I signed up for a class with problem sets, three papers, lots of readings, AND a cumulative final over a ton of information when I didnt need it to fill any specific requirement. Bill English is quite knowledgable and covers the ins and outs of monetary policy from the ground up. Youll get a lot out of it and leave knowing your way around Fed minutes\/press conferences if youre willing to put in the work. Considering the papers took a considerable amount of time and effort, I only wish they had counted for more than 40% of the grade. They were actually fun to write. Second half of the lectures are far more interesting if you can get through the tedious review\/extension on intermediate macro in the first half.",
    "Professor English knows his stuff and I would recommend taking it to better understand how monetary policy actually works in the US. The tough part is understanding how to write the policy papers otherwise workload is very manageable.",
    "Yes because professor English is awesome but I think the course structure would be altered in terms of topics and assignments Three papers and a rewrite, 4 psets and a final Hard to take the final because we had nothing to really base off of to prepare for it so it felt kind of out of the blue",
    "It was a fine course. It seems like an easy WR credit, not true. They are pretty harsh critiquing essays which is good for helping you develop as a writer. It was mostly an intro course to Monetary Policy matters, was not super advanced it did not assume any background knowledge so was a bit boring if you already know a lot about monetary policy."
