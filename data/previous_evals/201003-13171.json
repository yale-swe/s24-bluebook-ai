   "comments": [
    "Prof. Hawkins is most kind, captivating, and all around enjoyable as a seminar leader. His comments on papers are superb. Though a Dante expert and not a Classicist, he will lead you on a very enjoyable tour of Greek, Latin, and some Judeo-Christian literature.",
    "If you want to read a lot of great pieces of literature in only a few weeks, then Directed Studies is the right course for you. If you're looking to spend a greater amount of time on a particular work, however, I would not recommend this course to you; sometimes we spent less than a full class on a play or shorter text because we had to cover multiple items in one session.",
    "I've had an incredible experience in DS, and my first instinct would be to enthusiastically recommend it. But it's such a personal decision, and the widely varied reactions I've seen among fellow DSers really emphasizes that. You've got to be the type of person who's ok with a fast-paced course in which you don't get time to really reflect on the works you're reading. You have to be comfortable with possibly not getting all the reading done some in some weeks, or possibly not writing the best essay you can in some weeks.",
    "Absolutely\u0097on the condition that the student is interested in reading these texts. The class is certainly a great deal of work, but if you enjoy the reading, it's a blast!",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. Professor Hawkins is brilliant and conducts the class wisely and efficiently. He is approachable as well and receptive to any ideas you may have. You definitely gain a greater appreciation for the works once you discuss them in class!",
    "I would recommend DS Lit to someone who loves analyzing texts. It's a lot of work (plenty of reading a week, plus 3 papers a semester--in DS, you will have a paper a week, with topics assigned, on average, a week in advance). It will only be worth it if you have a great professor\/section.",
    "Yeah, do it. If you like books its an awesome way to be forced to read one a week with other people who care about them as well.",
    "I would definitely recommend DS Literature. I have gained invaluable understanding of texts and how to read them.",
    "If you get DS Literature with Professor Hawkins, you are lucky! He makes class fun, and makes sure everyone feels like participating. He is a fair grader, and gives thoughtful feedback on papers.",
    "DS introduces you to the great books, but it does so at a very intense pace. Consequently, it is difficult to study any of them in any kind of depth. While I enjoyed this class, and thought Prof Hawkins was a great teacher, I think that I could have gotten more out of the books if I had spent more than a week (occasionally less) on each one."
