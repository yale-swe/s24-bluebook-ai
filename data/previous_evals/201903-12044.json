    "None. These seminars were a waste of time. A professor didn't even show up to give a 5 minute talk as part of a 15 minute session. Maybe if these seminars appeared at the beginning of the semester before we've all figured out what our rotations will be, they would be useful. As it is, this class is a useless inconvenience.",
    "It did help me pick my next rotations however it would be better to do these before rotations start when we have 20+ hours of free time during the week this way it doesn't interfere with time working in lab since we already have to juggle that around classes.",
    "I learned about research of different faculty members.",
    "know what faculties are doing and suggestions for rotations",
    "In this course, I learned about the research of a large number of Yale faculty.",
    "I learned about the different research projects available and found a rotation.",
    "I learned about the different research areas of various professors in and outside of MB&B.",
    "I learned more about the research being done at Yale in the MB&B department and beyond. It even was the sole reason I rotated in the lab I did for my second rotation, which was a very positive experience.",
    "Helped to pick out rotations."

   "comments": [
    "Instead of in the middle of the semester do it at the beginning. The sessions ran on time which was good.",
    "This was great in helping us find out about different research going on in different departments. It could be improved if the sessions were earlier on in the semester, in the 2 weeks of class before we started rotations, so that we knew about the different opportunities before rotations started.",
    "This rotation introduction can be finished during orientation time.",
    "This course allows first-year students to learn about faculty they may have been unfamiliar with, which is very beneficial to students who are deciding on rotation choices. The series, however, featured so many faculty members that it was difficult to focus at times during flash talks and some flash talks were reiterations of longer presentations from department retreats.",
    "I liked how new professors were encouraged to speak.",
    "Strengths: Well moderated, diverse research topics discussed, short but informative Weaknesses: Mostly limited to wet labs without many research opportunities in theory\/computation-centric labs Improvements: Get more people with computational and\/or theoretical research interests to present",
    "The fourth session was not necessary."

    "Yes. It gives direct interaction with PIs and projects.",
    "Yes, it's a great way to find out what research is being done in the departments to which we have the most immediate access",
    "Yes."
