    "I enjoyed the class because I love Italian very much. If you engage in the course, you have the opportunity to learn a lot. If you slack off, it will be obvious.",
    "L4 Italian (140) is a great class that deals with a lot of the culture and history of Italy. It is a nice refresher coming from previous classes which is so vocab and grammar driven. Would definitely recommend.",
    "If you have gone through to the required L3 and can fit this one into your schedule, I would definitely suggest it. Only meeting 3 times a week sometimes means that the department believes you can use the alternate days to do homework and thus piles it on. But honestly the course isn't too bad. Though be advised it is only 1 credit, so you may still have that lonely .5 credit from L3 on your transcript.",
    "If you enjoy Italian, you should continue with L4. It will be worth your while and isn't too stressful"
