    "Hitt is a great guy, and I'd love to stay in touch with him after the course is done. He's clearly been around as a writer, etc. etc. He knows a lot about many things, and he cooks well. On the other hand, he's disorganized and changes his mind a lot about deadlines, etc, he did not make a clear syllabus, and he gradually slowed down on us as the semester went on...This class had ups and downs. Ups:Jack Hitt is a charismatic guy.He tells good stories, and you learn about what being a freelancer is like.He gives you lots of help with your pieces.Downs:Class sessions are mostly wasted, because he doesn't really want to teach in the ordinary way, he wants to edit.Deadlines, expectations, goals, etc. are never clearly set out.The final essay has a much smaller process associated with it, despitebeing longer.",
    "A really enjoyable class. A great way to spend Monday mornings, and an amazing group of people to get to know.My writing definitely improved, and Jack brought in a lot of his buds as guest speakers, who happen to be editors and writers at top-notch publications.",
    "This class is amazing. If it is ever taught again and you get in you would be absolutely crazy not to take it.",
    "This is a magazine writing class that has a focus on writing pieces for the real world market--an op ed, a short \"ideas\" piece, and a longer feature. The insight into the world of magazines from Jack Hitt is useful, as is his editing. However, the class is super loose and would benefit from much more structure.",
    "A journalism course in which you write three or four pieces of different genres and edit them again and again and AGAIN. It's cool because you are encouraged to write stuff for publication outside of Yale and to submit your pieces to various magazines and newspapers (and to feel the sting of rejection). I learned so much about writing from Jack Hitt, and at the end of the year he had us all to his house in East Rock for dinner. It was an all around amazing experience.",
    "you learn about how narrative journalism works from an insider.",
    "Great class. Write an op-ed, short idea piece, and longer magazine length piece. Jack Hitt is an awesome professor, really helpful. Only take if you can put in the time to work on your pieces and revise a lot."
