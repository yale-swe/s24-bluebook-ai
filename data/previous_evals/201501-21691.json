    "HA!",
    "Too hard.",
    "Shit ton of time. Like seriously, start early, spread the work out over the weak. The problem sets took min. 5 hours on a good week, up to 25 hours more than once. Really try to understand and not just write the answer, if you put in the work you will LEARN A SHIT TON.",
    "This is a very difficult class. The lectures move at a whirlwind pace which makes it difficult to engage with the material, there are 6-8 problem sets that take between 10 and 20 hours, and the exams really force you to understand \/ memorize details about what is going on in the class (no formula sheets). That said, the material is relatively interesting and Osuji is a pretty good professor. Osuji takes time to ask questions and let students ask questions and he knows his material well. I would recommend taking this class if you are interested in the material and are committed to a hefty workload.",
    "This class is tough, and Prof. Osuji goes fast. I think he's quite good, and I enjoyed the material (which is essentially an extension of fluid mechanics for heat and mass transfer), but it's not a class to be treated lightly. Problem sets are long, and test questions range from straightforward to completely bewildering.",
    "A. Very difficult. B. Very challenging. C. Very time consuming. Take it if you have to, and by god create a study group. At least you can then commiserate with the other people in this class. You can at least learn a ton of applicable material.",
    "It doesn't really matter if I recommend this class or not, because you're only gonna be taking it if it's required for your major. Interesting class, but really tough. Be prepared to put in significant work if you want to do really well.",
    "This class covers heat, momentum, and mass transfer within and between materials. It is similar to fluids (MENG 361) in many respects and uses a lot of differential equations. Either take this class after both of those or recognize that it will be more difficult for you than it was intended to be. Material is covered quickly and a lot gets skipped, so definitely read the textbook as the material is covered in lecture. As long as you keep up with it, the material is not nearly as hard as it seems."
