   "comments": [
    "Chill science class. pretty boring in my opinion as someone not interested in primate evolution but also meets once a week with no real homework or an exam so I would take it",
    "Absolutely take it! A great course on an interesting topic, especially for Anthro majors.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to a friend because it was a lot of fun and you learn a lot of information. It's an interactive class with a relaxed feel that is a ton of fun.",
    "I really enjoyed reading the papers for this class and handling the specimens. Sometimes however it felt a bit disorganized due to the large number of students in the class. I think it should be capped next year. Take it if you are interested in primate evolution and looking at fossils\/skulls of primates.",
    "I might recommend it if the class were smaller (our discussions were lackluster and the labs were crowded because there were over 20 of us in the class). Note that the material is pretty much 100% focused on primate evolution; we hardly talked about living primates at all. If you're interested in fossils, though, great! And Professor Sargis is awesome. Workload-wise, it's a very manageable class: fairly short weekly readings, a lab quiz early in the semester (be warned: this is harder than expected!), and a 5-page final paper on any topic.",
    "This class is much more primate evolution than primate diversity, so be aware of that. Readings are scientific articles without much background, so it can be a bit difficult and time-consuming to understand what the readings are about. The class is about half discussing the articles and half lab. Our class was so big that both discussion and lab were difficult.",
    "I definitely recommend this class. We got to write a fun 5-10 page paper at the end, which I enjoyed. We only had one lab practical quiz, and we had many labs, which helped me understand the information from the section portion. Definitely take it!",
    "If you are really interested in primates from the geologic past, take it. If not, take a more modern biological anthropology class!",
    "Yes I loved the class",
    "Professor Sargis is engaging and accessible to everyone in the class. The class was always interesting and exciting!",
    "ANTH 335 is a good course to take. The lab component was awesome- you get to look at fossils or casts and really experience modern debates in bio anthro. The workload is not bad at all- one quiz and a end of the term paper. Check it out!",
    "Primate Diversity and Evolution was a thoroughly enjoyable course. However, the dominating sentiment now that it's over is how much it could have been improved by being a seminar. The material was quite fascinating, and the \"zooming in\" approach (starting from larger clades and moving in to just primates) was a nice layout. However, the proposed paper discussion of primary literature was hampered by the fact that there was not only an excess of students in the course, but so many of the students were non-majors who did not seem to want to engage in the course. This lead to some stilted discussions. However, Eric Sargis is one of (if not the) best professors I have had at Yale, and he made the course worthwhile. He realized that the setup would need to adapt on the fly, and he modified the class format to fit the student dynamic. He has a masterful knowledge of all things primates, phylogenetics, and paleontology. What's more, he is able to seamlessly relate this knowledge to students coming from all backgrounds. He thoroughly and clearly explains a wide variety of topics during lecture, and provides excellent hands on mentoring during lab. In the future, this course should absolutely be capped and restricted to those actually interested in learning about the material, not just those looking for a science credit. If you're interested in the topics and the class will be in seminar style, I would enroll without hesitation.",
    "This is an easy and fun science credit to take. Take it if you can!",
    "Take it! This class was really awesome. I am an American Studies major who shopped it on a whim because I needed a science credit and it was interesting and engaging week to week. I came back after every class excited about what we had learned. The workload was totally manageable and the final paper was open ended enough as to not feel scary as a non-science major. Professor Sargis is helpful and always willing to answer questions. Can not recommend it highly enough.",
    "Not exactly what I expected -- a good course, but more on paleontology than modern primates. Expect a lot of scientific paper-reading; if that's what you're into this course is great! Just make sure you know what you're in for.",
    "This is a survey course on primate species excluding humans. Its material is very detailed, but the class is very flexible so that students of all backgrounds can pick up on the material. The workload is relatively light, and Prof Sargis is amazing!",
    "I took this class on a whim of last-minute shopping period panic, and ended up really liking it. It was pretty easy; on a week-to-week basis I wasn't really doing any work outside of class. It's really easy to skip out on the reading, but the papers are super interesting and worth perusing. Prof. Sargis is great; he knows an impressive amount about primates and is super friendly and helpful. I might be biased because my strategy for choosing classes is to copy the course list from the EEB website, but I'd definitely recommend this class."
