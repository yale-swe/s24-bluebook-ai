   "comments": [
    "Absolutely. This was an excellent course. The professor's ability to marry both economic theory and historical lessons made it probably one of the most useful introductions to financial stability economics that one can take.",
    "I would summarize it as a reading intensive course that requires a starting interest in financial stability, but is very engaging as it builds through the semester. I would definitely recommend this course to a fellow student, as the teaching style and course structure enabled us to learn effectively.",
    "if you are interested in financial economics (and to a minor extent international economics) this is a great course to take. You will learn about major issues in global financial economics and the precipitating condition leading to instability and eventual crisis. A number of crises, their nature and their causes are explored throughout history within context. The lecturer is also well informed on current market institutions and occurrences."

    "Financial stability is core to any policy related or developmental focused career. Highly recommended!",
    "I had a background in a few different aspects of the course material, but a large amount of the material was new and bringing it all together was really interesting. I think it deepened my knowledge of financial stability and my ability to analyze and speak about financial stability in future career situations. Additionally, it helped me develop skills to further my financial stability knowledge with its focus on analyzing research papers.",
