   "comments": [
    "Race and Capitalism is probably not the course you expected. Instead of a structural approach to how capitalism operates along lines of race, you get a patchwork of historical and philosophical works that deal at various points with gender roles, slavery, globalization, and the \"archive.\" If you wanted to learn about the prison-industrial complex, this course is not for you. If you wanted a coherent sense of the economic conditions of Black communities throughout American history, this course is not for you. If you were interested in how race operates outside the Black\/white dichotomy, this course is not for you. The main flaws of the class are: 1) it's unclear how the readings engage with each other, 2) the reading can be EXTREMELY inaccessible, and 3) discussion isn't usually lively and when it is, it often veers off track into pointless tangents. (But sometimes the tangents are really timely and interesting.) All that said, Aaron is chill and super woke. Shop anything he teaches on the off chance that the structure of the course is better than this one.",
    "This class is not going to be easy by an means. The readings can be pretty difficult and often dense, but the material is still very interesting. If you aren't taking the class with a strong interest in matters of race or even the relationship between american capitalism, don't take the class because it will be a drag. The readings definitely take a bit of time to get through but they are definitely very interesting, yet still dense.",
    "Yes. This class was very relevant to the social movements happening on campus, but also relevant to American cultural, economic, and racial history. Extremely important topics discussed in a way that was simultaneously traditionally academic and radically different from other classes I've been in at Yale. Great professor, would take other classes with him if possible.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class. It's an enormously important topic that everyone should be thinking about. The readings on their own are reason enough to take the class--they're incredibly interesting and are brought together in the syllabus in thought-provoking ways. Class discussions are left largely up to the class, so you'll get out of them what you and your classmates put in. The workload is reasonable--three 2pg response papers, an 8pg midterm essay, and a 10pg final paper. The paper topics, like the class discussions, are very open ended. Definitely take advantage of meeting with Aaron to talk about the midterm and final papers.",
    "This class teaches you how from its foundations, capitalism has been tied to racialization and inequality in America. The class does have a heavy focus on the slavery era but we do move to discuss more contemporary issues later on.",
    "Would definitely recommend. The class does a great job of giving the tools to analyze power structures that are usually invisible or unobserved by the general public.",
    "Race and Capitalism is great! A somewhat challenging Junior\/Senior seminar, but I took it as a sophomore and felt able to keep up. Fascinating readings, focusing mostly on this history of slavery in the US. Class gives you an essential and eye-opening framework for understanding the economy and US racism.",
    "Race and Capitalism is kind of indescribable. But if you want to have very important discussions about the history of race and capitalism, the role of gender, and the formation of America TAKE THIS CLASS. Just be prepared for a lot to think about and some challenging readings.",
    "I would absolutely recommend it. Take this course and anything like it. Take the events of this past semester (Fall 2015) as the reason to take it if nothing else.",
    "A very insightful seminar. It tackles huge issues and leaves you wrestling with your thoughts both during and after class, but is definitely worth the struggle. The discussion is free-flowing and will allow you to intensely explore your every thought on the readings and opinions presented in class. Do be prepared for a very Leftist point of view, but otherwise, I would definitely recommend."
