   "comments": [
    "I would recommend AOF to any student who can get in, although I'm not sure it was worth waking up at 9am.",
    "I would recommend RLST 014 if you want a fairly easy writing credit. I was usually quite bored during discussion because what was discussed was usually redundant. I enjoyed the philosophy we read and the ideas we worked through, but the class discussions really didn't fulfill my expectations for a seminar. Overall, I felt as though I should have taken a different class.",
    "I would recommend this course for a fellow student because it teaches a way of thought which benefits any interest and improves any thought process. I would describe this course as a course on authorship, originality, and forgery with a focus on becoming aware of the role of history and influences in our own generative work.",
    "HIGHLY recommend this course, for students of all majors (humanities, STEM, etc..) Prof Najman is always engaging in her discussions, and has a mastery of the subject that is only matched by her enthusiasm for the course and the content. The class is very freeflowing, but organized and focused. We had four 3-4pg writing assignments and a group project, and each of those assignments were given a wide creative range.",
    "This class did a great job teaching me how to view the connections between new works an old. Even though I am not a religious studies major, the ideas of authorship, originality, and forgery discussed in this class were extremely compelling.",
    "I've already tried many times to explain this course to my friends outside the class. It seems that each time my description changes. This is not due to the course being unguided, but rather a testament to how much we manage to cover. In the end I'd say the course is a look into the creative process, a study of creation and inspiration that also examines the author and its function in a piece of literature. Heavily discussion based the class also involves a lot of reading. I would definitely recommend this class to another student because many of the themes studied and discussed are universal and I feel as if many people would get a positive experience from the class.",
    "AOF had great course material and a fascinating subject. The New York trip was excellent. Professor Najman worked really hard to engage students and give then feedback on papers. My only complaint is that professor Najman tended to ask confusing and long questions in class discussion that made response and participation difficult. Overall, the perfect freshman seminar experience!",
    "Absolutely, YES TAKE IT. AOF is an incredible, incredible course. Truly a gem for students of any major or any background. Strengths are too many to list...Professor Najman is brilliant and opened my mind to an entirely new way of looking at the world...just the right hint of skepticism, a bit of added curiosity, and the belief that truly nothing is irrelevant and everything we do seems to be interconnected. The lives and passions of the students themselves are what fill much of the curriculum and basis for discussion, so you'd be hard pressed to be bored for even a second in class. My sleep schedule often gravitates toward the 4am-1pm range and I was EXCITED to get out of bed every morning for this 9am. The students have formed a little community of \"AOFers\"...we especially bonded during our exciting class trip to NYC and during our group projects late in the semester that basically placed no limit on creativity and allowed for us to discover new means of collective authorship. I will never look at the world the same way again after this course, and I can already see Professor Najman's influence permeating through my ideas in other humanities courses. Overall, even as a first semester freshman I can see that this course will be one of the best I ever take at Yale and I know it will influence my life down the road in potentially a significant way.",
    "Absolutely. It was a great opportunity to form a relationship with prof. Najman and think in a really interesting way.",
    "I would recommend it to any freshman who wants to take a low-stress seminar and is interested in the subject. However, personally speaking I would have preferred to take another class whose subject matter I was more interested in even if it would have been a lot of work.",
    "This class is very interesting and prompts you to look at innovation, originality, and plagiarism in a completely different light. This course was incredible! I recommend it to anyone and everyone, even students who do not think they have any interest in religious studies. Heavily discussion based, it was important to have done the readings and watched the films, but the time commitment was worth it for the intellectual and thoughtful conversations that followed."
