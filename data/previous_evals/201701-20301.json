    "This was a great class, and taught at such a crucial time. It certainly helped me gain some new language for the socio-political rifts that seem to characterize our collective consciousness. We went really deep with the material, exploring questions of death and language and culture. I'm convinced after taking this class that exposure to apocalyptic readings can really help readers of every genre to discern the urgency, the high stakes, behind each cultural question posed in literature.",
    "This class was more of a \"for fun\" class than anything. It certainly made me question the state of the world in ways that I hadn't done before, but I'm not sure how much I actually got out of it. Some interesting reading assignments though.",
    "Taking this course allowed me to develop a greater appreciation for and better understanding of the degree to which humans have found themselves drawn towards apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic style narratives over millennia. By the end of the course, I was able to draw helpful comparisons between various texts in such a way so as to understand better what it was an author was alluding to or trying to get across to us as the readers."

   "comments": [
    "I think we had some really great reading material assigned during the course, but oftentimes we were assigned too much at once. I think the course could be incredibly enriched by eliminating a number of readings so that class discussions could become more focused an engaging.",
    "It was a really fascinating rumination on how humanity works through various works about the end of the world. Whenever my friends learn that I'm taking this class, or hear of the title, they are often like \"omg that sounds like such a weird class!\", but it was one of the most thought provoking classes I've taken. Readings that would have been provided could be posted earlier, though that's not really that big of a problem.",
    "Professor Berger is one of the most no-BS professors I've ever had. Especially with subject material like this, it is easy to get caught up in vague abstractions (either ones that exist in the text or ones that we project onto it) that serve to distract more than provide insight. Professor Berger always cuts through these with a machete so that we continue forward on our discussion path unhindered, eventually allowing us to get to places of greater insight. In addition to its instructor, the course is also very strong for its syllabus. The texts, films, and shows that we cover are diverse but also have great dialogue with one another. There were definitely many threads that tied the course together over many different weeks in a way that was really satisfying and grounding for us as the students."

   "comments": [
    "Would recommend. First off, the texts we read and the films we watched were quite enjoyable and thought-provoking. Also, discussions of apocalyptic texts what happens when a society is at the breaking point? What does a shattered, failing society do to preserve itself? are relevant to people of all disciplines.",
    "I recommend this course to students interested in science fiction, but other than that I think there are more engaging courses in the English department.",
    "Yes do it!",
    "I would highly recommend this class to anyone. If you have felt that other humanities classes at Yale have been liable to devolving into fluff, take this course. Professor Berger will not do any wrong by you in that department."
