    "I wish we had started with grammar not history. And that Jimmy would slow down sometimes. I literally cannot keep up with her when she's reconstructing a text. I come in prepared and heavily researched with color coded notes transliterations and translations and half or more of the time I cannot effectively follow her such that I leave class with a more jumbled product than I showed up with. However meeting with Jimmy one on one was incredibly productive, and while I was embarrassed to let her know how much I was struggling and how hard I was having to work for objectively little payoff in terms of skill and facility with the language, in her office, she paced herself for me and she was kind and helpful and explained her pedagogy and it was like working with a totally different professor. Class was difficult for me for a number of reasons, but meeting with Jimmy in her office was incredibly helpful and hands down the best part of being her student.",
    "I appreciated the focus on historical context of the inscriptions and of the language itself. Jimmy is a personable and approachable teacher. The actual instruction felt a little scattered. I didn't feel we were given enough time or information to effectively learn the language before we were translating tablets. I didn't mind much at the time, because it was fun and exciting to be working with the actual texts, but now we're at the end of a semester and I feel like I didn't much learn the language. If I didn't already have a background in Hebrew, I feel I wouldn't have had what I needed to be successful in the course.",
    "The course is a little disorganized but thats kind of the nature of a language course featuring epigraphy",
    "Great selection of inscriptions. Really enjoyed each of the ones we did, especially the Tel Dan one. All of the grammar basics were covered in clear and concise fashion. It might be better to start the grammar one week earlier though, and spend one extra week on it than we did (i.e. go at a slightly slower pace).",
    "The class is not well structure and kinda scattered."

    "No. As I said the course was incredibly difficult for me to follow, and if conversations I've had with students of past courses and my colleagues in this particular course are representative, this is just the style of these courses. As a student with moderate\/severe ADHD and a severe auditory processing disorder, this classroom environment was kind of a nightmare for me, and I doubt I would recommend it to friends or cohorts.",
    "If you're specifically interested in the epigraphic nature of the course, yes. As a way to learn the language, maybe not.",
    "Absolutely, if the student was interested in Semitic languages! This would not be a good place to start learning NWS languages, but it is a good one to add to the toolkit.",
    "Yes, Aramaic is a very important language for anyone studying the ancient Near East. Professor Daccache's wide knowledge of the language and her clear, engaging teaching of it was extremely beneficial for my overall learning and training as a scholar."
