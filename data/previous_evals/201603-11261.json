    "The workload was quite reasonable, though made easier because the material should be very familiar. Professor Gekhtman is very nice and helpful to talk to, particularly during office hours. I do wish we had gotten grades back more frequently, and some times, just at all. The course should use a better textbook, like Folland.",

    "I would recommend this course if you want a strong background in analysis. The course isn't great, but at the end of the problem sets you will have a very strong background in analysis.",
    "I'd definitely recommend it if you want to get a better grip on measure theory coming out of 305; it probably is quite easy to self-study, though. It's got some interesting material. The book is pretty mediocre though; read Folland alongside it to actually learn.",
    "I would definitely recommend to another student wishing to progress in the analysis track of mathematics course from 305. It builds on that material and progresses into the prerequisites of MATH 320 Intro to Functional Analysis.",
    "Not with Ilia.",
    "I would recommend this course to those looking for a solid grounding in measure theory."
