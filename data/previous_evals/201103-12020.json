    "Take this class! Professor Magaziner is great. The workload is hard, but it's worth it, and you will learn so much. I would recommend this class, or any class that Magaziner teaches, because he will inspire you and keep you engaged with every lecture. The material is fascinating, and you cover a large period so come out of the class feeling like you learnt a lot. Do the reading, as it will leave you feeling that much more satisfied. And you won't want to miss class!",
    "This is an amazing class. You have to take it. The readings are long, but the lectures are AMAZING. The small lecture format is perfect-all the benefits of a seminar without the constant pressure. Magaziner is the best professor ever and you will learn so much.",
    "History of South Africa since the landing of Jan van Riebeeck in 1652. I would absolutely recommend it. Its one-country focus allows for greater understanding than the African history, government, and politics survey courses.",
    "Take it. Great class",
    "This class was incredible. Prof. Magaziner is a new addition to Yale, but is an incredible lecturer. The lectures pack in tons of information while still being fascinating. The class isn't easy, but if you're interested in Africa, Colonialism, or AIDS it is a must take.",
    "definitely do this. so worth it. not that tough and so fulfilling.",
    "definitely would recommend it, particularly to history majors. great broad review of south africa's history. really helps one understand the problems they face today and sheds light on how and why those problems came about and how they may be combatted in the future.",
    "Totally if you are interested at all in south Africa or just want a general history credit this is a great class.",
    "This course is a history of South Africa from about 1000 AD until today. It interlaces the development of white and black cultures to culminate in the Apartheid and post-Apartheid experience. There are 2 short response papers, a take home midterm, and a take home final."
