   "comments": [
    "Be prepared to learn a lot. Since the course this year didn't teach much about programming per se but requires programming experience to finish the computational problem sets, it's better to have some sort of programming experience to work on Matlab programming homework for the course. There's quite a bit of work but it's a very rewarding course.",
    "Definitely would recommend.",
    "This course is a really good way to learn mathematical techniques in research. I started with absolutely no background in biophysics or Matlab, and I struggled a lot in the beginning with the Matlab assignments. However, the TAs were really helpful and patient, and by the end I could write my own code! Take this course! It is really rewarding, and some of the mathematical methods (like PCA and x-ray crystallography fourier transforms) are so amazing they seem magical!",
    "This is a class on statistics, basic linear algebra, and MATLAB PROGRAMING. If you do not like (or think that you will like) Matlab programming, you should not take this class. This class was poorly taught and poorly organized, and while I feel stimulated by my exposure to a number of interesting applications of math and biology, I still do not have a strong grasp of what I learned. Some of the greatest knowledge generation comes from looking things up on the internet and asking TA\u0092s for assistance. I would not recommend this course. Any number of alternatives in biological physics, mathematics, biology, or computer science would likely be better.",
    "I would not recommend this course. It is a great idea, but is disorganized and the coursework was more challenging than it should have been. I found this course to be a source of frustration throughout the semester.",
    "This course is a whirlwind introduction to a large range of maths relevant to biophysics. The problem sets were occasionally difficult to manage but not impossible. This is definitely not a course for people who need significant reinforcement via practice in order to learn. A basic understanding of computer programming is useful for many of the problem sets and the final project."
