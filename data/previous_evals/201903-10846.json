We learned about basic probability theory, discrete and continuous distributions (probability mass\/density functions and cumulative distribution functions), bivariate distributions, functions of random variables, estimation, confidence intervals, hypothesis testing, and the basics behind regression (not multiple regression, which I think may be in Econ 136). This is not a proof-based course and it covers a lot of material because it's fit into one semester, so though Prof. Armstrong sometimes presented proofs of the theorems or outlines of proofs in class, on problem sets and exams we just applied theorems and methods for solving problems without having to prove anything ourselves. A few of our problem sets used R, so this class also helped me gain some more practice using it. I had played around with R a little bit the summer before taking this class in the fall, but I think that students who have never used it before may need to spend a little more time on those problem sets than on the ones that didn't use R. R isn't the focus of this class, so it doesn't provide a thorough or comprehensive introduction to it by any means.",

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: The syllabus is logically structured, and the problem set questions adequately reinforce the concepts discussed in the lectures. Weaknesses: The lectures could be more engaging.",
    "I would have preferred if the professor could have let us know the readings before each class, so that I could have prepared in advance.",
    "I came away from this course with a comprehensive understanding of statistics and how to use proofs to derive different formulas and relationships. TF sections were well-structured and informative. However, lectures were very dry and sometimes hard to follow. This issue improved toward the end of the semester.",
    "Lectures were very dry and uninteresting. Incorporating more engagement with students would significantly improve lectures. A lot of the later problem sets were not helpful in understanding the course material.",
    "Although Dr. Armstrong is a really sweet and super approachable person, he is not a very good lecturer. This class was very boring. Engagement was low even relative to other lectures. Most people didn't show up, and when you were there, it was almost impossible to stay engaged. Dr. Armstrong lectures without pause for the entire class, his handwritting is hard to read and he covers what he's writing 100% of the time. He also sort of rush talks when he lectures or you ask a question, and he'll end up giving two minutes of a really quickly spoken, high level explanation that doesn't really help. The material in this class also wasn't that interesting, and because we flew through during lectures (without pause), it was really hard to retain anything. The psets were quite fair. They were striaghtforward and not too time consuming. The exams were poorly written -- our midterm had 5 ridiculously easy questions that everyone got right and one impossible one. As a result, literally 60% of the class got an 85 on the exam. Having everyone with the same grade means the curve will be determined by like a point off on a pset. The book was really good in this class and I think a lot of people favored it over going to lecture. Also the TA was really solid. He was very thorough in his explanations and put SO MUCH work into the class.",
    "Strengths: Textbook is very good Weaknesses: Professor is not great at explaining. He says \"um\" every 5-10 seconds and just teaches from the textbook. He's really nice though",
    "The material is really dry and boring. Since it's a year-long sequence, I assume during the second semester you learn how to actually work with real data, but in this class it's all theory and it can be painfully boring. We did a lot of derivations in class, and then the problem set and exams were pretty much just plugging into formulas.",
    "Personally, I really liked this course. Low workload, but you still learn a decent amount. Professor Armstrong is a good instructor. I think he could continue to improve his delivery by practicing his engagement with the class, such as asking us questions during his exposition.",
    "Strength: Lots of practice materials Weakness: boring content, not enough R",
    "Prof. Armstrong was very well-organized and his problem sets reflected what we discussed in class pretty well. I also liked that he was clear about which parts of the book each lecture matched up with, because the book for this course was pretty helpful. Prof. Armstrong also gave us practice tests for the midterm and final, which I really appreciated when studying, and he and made himself available to answer questions through a lot of office hours. I think that the amount of practice material we had was helpful in preparing for the exams (practice tests, answer keys to the problem sets, book problems), but I think a weakness of the course was how heavily weighted towards exams the grading was. I thought that this made the exams feel pretty high-stakes, and I think it would have helped us focus on learning the material if the problem sets could have counted for more, especially since they were graded on accuracy. Another weakness was that the lectures often were very dry and it became difficult to concentrate during class. I think that if Prof. Armstrong asked for input from the class more often as he lectured that could help with engagement.",
    "Traditional intro. Probability and Statistics course without any particular strengths or weaknesses, like AP Stats.",
    "The resources you have are the lectures (no slides), the homework (very useful for review), the past practice exams (also very helpful), section wasn't bad (but honestly not a must), and the textbook (which I liked), so that was all fine. I guess if you find this kind of stuff boring, then that is a weakness. But then why would you be taking this class?",
    "A little bit of context first. I came to this class with minimal knowledge of probability and statistics theory, but with solid mathematical foundation required for the course. From the second week, lectures began to be increasingly difficult to follow, which caused a lot of internal anger; I would try to follow the professor but he was talking really fast; his speech was somehow quite difficult to follow, make sense of. Then I panicked and strated reading the textbook in advance, solving additional problems, asking our amazing TA to help. And it all became clear. Once I read the textbook ahead, the lectures made more sense (even with prior knowledge it was sometimes hard to follow) and the class became easier. Weaknesses: - the main weakness I guess is how the class is organized as an intro class. It aims to cover a lot of material, and it is done largely by very rapidly introducing absolutely new terms only through matematical language and then trying to present us with the proofs of the theorems surrounding these concepts. Very dry so to say. The problem is that these concepts are absolutely new and if you dont explain some basic intuition \/ reasoning behind these concepts (how they came to be? how can one without any mathematical notation think of these problems\/concepts?), it is more difficult to follow the mathematical aspect of proving as well as simply understanding why we do what we do. Yes, I could understand the chain of summations in some random example, but why we did that in the first place? this course poorly explained the underlying reasoning behind all this new material, its use. To be frank, the textbook presents very well all the proofs we did in class (and we have more time to go over tedious Math when we are alone with the textbook rather than in class). So I don't understand what is the point of having the professor repeat exactly the proofs from the textbook. It would be much better if classes focused more on this underlying logic behind the concepts, how to approach different tasks, more examples, and then some fundamental proofs. We could easily self-learn what was done in the class by, for instance, intorducing that in hws or like weekly quizes or cover that in sections. That is technical and smth everyone can do alone. - I think if the above-mentioned aspects gets improved, it would make the course 80% better. Another thing I would like to mention is that it seems that the Professor does not fully understand how to explain things in a very clear and understandable way for someone who has little to no background in the area. Again, the confusion comes from a) not addressing the underlying big questions of why we are doing things and how and b) Tim being very hasty in writing down the proofs and talking",
    "The class was on a strict curve when everyone was quite competent and the exams made this curve very tight. As a result, it made the in-class environment one which didn't foster collaborative learning because nobody wanted to help their peers. This was my first time experiencing such an environment and I found it very sad. The class was quite small and most of us started out friends but it quickly became an environment where nobody wanted to give their peers an upper hand.",
    "The strength of this course was that I feel it left me prepared for Econometrics (Econ 136) in the Spring. Lectures were quite boring and unhelpful, however, and I learned most just by reading the textbook.",
    "Lectures are very boring and mostly go over textbook material. There is some R in class but it is pretty useless. Concepts not in the textbook were difficult to grasp. Its a pretty solid overview, though, and you dont have to sit through 241 and 242.",
    "The course is taught directly from the textbook, and at many points, I felt as if it was easier to simply read the book than attend lecture."

    "This class is required for economics & math majors, but I've heard that it is better taught than other econometrics classes at Yale.",
    "Required for the Econ math major.",
    "No, unless required for the major.",
    "Honestly, not unless you have to take it. You will learn probability theory and statistics concepts but most of the learning will be done on your own. This class was very boring. Dr. Armstrong is very nice but not a good lecturer. He lectures without pause for the entire class (like never asks for questions or anything), his handwritting is hard to read and he covers what he's writing 100% of the time. Also, because of the volume of material we needed to learn it was sometimes hard to see how things connected and we didn't go too deep into a lot of concepts. The curve in this class is particularly bad because the exams are poorly written. Our midterm had 5 ridiculously easy questions and 1 impossible one. As a result, like 60% of the class got an 85\/100. This means that grade cutoffs will be determined by singular points on psets which isn't great.",
    "Not really, but you probably don't have a better choice. I'm not an econ\/math major, but I hadn't heard great things about Econ 117 so I chose this class and I don't regret it. The material is actually pretty interesting if you like statistics\/math. Also, I didn't go to a single class after shopping period and just used the textbook to teach myself, so I would recommend that.",
    "If you are a math\/econ major, you have to take the class. If you just want to learn about statistics and\/or probability I think there's better classes.",
    "Yes I would. I quite appreciated that the course didn't overcomplicate the topic.",
    "I would likely only recommend the course if it's required for your major or you're looking to cover the content of S&DS 241 and 242 in one semester (though it likely will not qualify to substitute the two courses for majors other than econ and math).",
    "Only if you need it",
    "I'm not sure whether I'd recommend this course or not. I think most of the people who take this class are Econ\/Math majors who are required to take it, but there were also a few people who took it to get a broad introduction to probability and statistics. I think that if you're looking for that broad exposure, this class gets the job done by conveying a lot of information in one semester and with a pretty good textbook for following along as you do the problem sets. Because it covers a fairly large amount of material, it doesn't go super fair into depth on each topic and the proofs behind the theorems, so that may be what you're looking for if you're less interested in proofs and just want to learn how to apply the concepts. However, I haven't taken any other stats classes at Yale, so I don't know how this compares to classes like MATH\/STAT 241 & 242. I do think that the fact that the grading is very heavily weighted towards exams (30% midterm and 50% final for us) can be very stressful for students who don't feel like they test well, so I would keep that in mind if that's the case for you and you're comparing stats classes. I also didn't always find the lectures very engaging, but I think that was often just because a broad intro like this with this material can be kind of dry, and so I'm not sure how similar classes might compare.",
    "Take it for the major; I was not particularily enlightened by the content having seen it in AP Stats before.",
    "Yes I would, if you need it for your major or if you are considering graduate study in economics.",
    "If the things I mentioned get addressed. Otherwise, I would recommend 241\/242 sequence since it gives you more time to think through what you are learning.",
    "Probably not. We brushed over many things. I wish I would have had more opportunities to dive into subjects. Covering so much material without giving any one subject very much time made it feel more like memorization that learning the material. I would likely take s&ds 241 instead because I don't feel I gave the subjects enough justice",
    "Only if you have to take it for Econ Math. If you're not Econ Math, don't bother.",
    "Its required and if you put the time in, I think you can do well."
