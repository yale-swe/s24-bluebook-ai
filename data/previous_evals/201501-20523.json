    "I would recommend this course especially to students in the humanities who are interested in an introduction to social science methods and concepts. Ethnography seems like an ideal transition point between these two areas of study, and the material is generally accessible even to those without strong background knowledge."

   "comments": [
    "I was pleasantly surprised by how this course helped shape my thinking. I am not an ethnographer or social scientist, and took this course primarily to meet a departmental requirement. But the discussions of the politics of representation, in particular, were consistently helpful and thought-provoking, and I ended up finding much it more applicable to my own work than I had anticipated. Professor Anderson also did a great job of creating a welcoming and warm environment. Thank you!"
