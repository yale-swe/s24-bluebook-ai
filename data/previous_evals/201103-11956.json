    "Absolutely amazing class. Professor Tomlinson is incredibly engaging. Instead of showing us recordings of some passages, he'd just sing and play them himself. Best course I've taken in a long time. Good WR credit, but know that even though the workload is light (3 papers), Professor Tomlinson is a very hard grader. Liken the grading to English 120.",
    "The history of opera for the past 400 years. I found that I knew most of what we covered in the first half of the semester from a Music History course I took in 10th grade, but I still enjoyed the focus on opera. The only problem with this course is Gary Tomlinson. He is an engaging lecturer, and nothing more. He never replied to my emails, and was always very vague with his answers to questions in office hours (when he showed upto them). As this is a writing credit, I would have expected even a small portion of the class devoted to writing, but there wasn't. After the first paper was returned, he gave off a laundry list of grammatical errors he found, and from that point on, did not talk about writing again. I, and several others, eventually realized that he wasn't looking for original thought in our papers, but just a rehashing of his narrow view on the topic. It was really frustrating playing games figuring out what he wanted to hear, rather than being able to think through the paper topic on your own.In conclusion, take this class. As long as Tomlinson isn't teaching it.",
    "Really low work level writing credit. Even though you don't have to write much, Professor Tomlinson is a really harsh grader, so work hard on the few pages you do write.",
    "This was probably my favorite course so far at Yale, and I would definitely recommend it to anyone, even if you don't already like opera (you will by the end of the semester). Prof. Tomlinson is a great lecturer- he's extremely intelligent and engaging. The course is a good balance between a broad overview of the history of opera, and a specific analysis of scenes from operas that he chose to focus on. It is not specifically for music majors, and he discourages actual musical analysis, which may be a bit frustrating for some musicians. But I thought of it as a history course in which you get to talk about and listen to beautiful music every week, and found it completely satisfying. Also, there are only 3 short papers, so definitely take this course if you want a writing credit without much writing.",
    "BRILLIANT! The professor is so incredibly knowledgeable, talented, and witty, it'll be one of the best classes you ever take at Yale! It was such a pleasure to learn under him. This class will soon be known as one of the must-take classes at Yale.",
    "Yes - Take this class if you have any interest in learning about opera. He does a great job of mixing music terminology for those with a musical background, and making the class understandable for those with no musical experience, so practically anyone can take this class.",
    "Take it! But if you aren't accustomed to closely proofreading your papers, make sure that you do -- or have a friend review your work for you. Professor Tomlinson is a stickler for grammar.",
    "This class was a very interesting overview of the history of opera - if this is your area of concentration, however, I wouldn't exactly recommend it (there is much more emphasis on writing skills than musical analysis, in general). That said, as someone who really enjoyed opera but knew very little about it, I found the class very informative and enriching of my enjoyment of opera. There is a fair amount of reading, and frequent papers , but they are much shorter in length than most papers I've ever written at Yale (3 pgs., 5 pgs., 5 pgs.). Be prepared to devote a good chunk of your time to this class, though, if you want to get the most out of it - we might study one or two acts of two different operas or one full opera per week, and going to the library to watch\/listen to them means putting in a lot of hours. Bring a sweater - the music library's a cold place!",
    "I really don't think I would recommend it unless you have music theory. And if you are already a good writer, the formulaic essays and listening to him whine about how bad everyone is at grammar will just be frustrating.",
    "This course is great. I took it credit\/D and without very much work got B+ range grades on the papers and 100% on the listening quizes. So if you're interested in taking a fairly easy, incredibly interesting class that will help you cultivate a long lasting love for opera then take this course. Tomlinson is a fun, animated lecturer who will occasionally burst into song during class. At least shop the course, because it really is just phenomenal and you will open yourself up to an entire world of music you may have missed out on before. This is coming from a non-music major by the way, and don't worry you DONT need to know music theory to take this class.",
    "Oh boy. Don't let other people fool you, Opera is neither an easy nor a terribly enjoyable class. I honestly don't know how the last batch of reviews on OCI were able to paint Professor Tomlinson as a super-friendly helpful guy, because that is simply not the case. Of course, he is definitely a pro when it comes to opera - no one can challenge him on that. But perhaps the grandeur of his acumen skewed his expectations a bit. Be forewarned, the man is a grammar Nazi (he will invariably remind you that HUMS 215 is a writing class!). Moreover, he refused to furnish us with a simple announcement on Classes_v2 outlining the pieces featured on listening quizzes, opting rather to announce \"once and for all\" in class the pieces in a rather off-hand manner. Participate early on so that he knows you're interested - otherwise (and especially if you join the class late in shopping period), he will assume you just don't care. Okay, admittedly I did learn quite a bit about opera...I learned to love Verdi and to hate Wagner (who, incidentally, is one of Tomlison's favorites). You will get something out of this class if you love opera, but if you are not invested deeply in the music you will wonder why you joined such a harshly-graded writing course. Take HUMS 215 to learn more about opera, NOT to fulfill a writing credit.",
    "I took this course on a whim after developing a nascent interest in opera over the summer and am very glad that I did. As a non-music student, opera homework provided a welcome break from more usual forms of studying. You are *required* to sit in the music library watching a lovely opera, and it is absolutely lovely. Professor Tomlinson is distinguished in his field and the lectures he gives are comprehensive and well-informed, touching both on social conditions and trends within the intellectual tradition that gave rise to these operas as well as some of their musical features (though this class involved very little rigor in terms of analysis of music since it is accessible to non-music majors).Also, if one needed an easy writing credit, this would be it...",
    "A great course to learn all about opera--as an art form and its history. Also a unusual way to earn a writing credit.",
    "One of the best classes I have taken at Yale. An excellent introduction to opera history -- general enough that people unfamiliar with the subject could appreciate the material, and thoughtful enough for people to delve deeper if they so chose. Professor Tomlinson has a generous mind and a talent for creating broad narratives that help students comprehend the material without oversimplifying. No complaints.",
    "Absolutely! Professor Tomlinson's lectures are enrapturing, and anyone can get a lot out of the class, regardless of musical background. Even if you have no interest in opera, TAKE IT. Professor Tomlinson's enthusiasm for the subject is completely infectious, and it will open an interest for you that will probably follow you for the rest of your life. This class will probably wind up being one of the most memorable classes I take at Yale. As a writing credit, it's probably one of the easiest out there - two 3-page papers, and one 5-page paper. The grading can be a little harsh, though. Completely worth it.",
    "Yes, It was a great class. You learn a lot, and you come out appreciating opera. Earlier parts of the class seemed a little dry but it's worth the wait when you get into the later works.",
    "This is a truly interesting class, but I was surprised how many students in the class already knew the operas we studied in depth. Professor Tomlinson doesn't expect that from each of his students though, so it won't affect your grade. As for those grades, I had a little trouble figuring out what he expected from the papers at first. Just be mindful if you have minimal paper writing experience that he is pretty strict about prose. The listening quizzes weren't too bad if you kept up on listening, since it's not something for which you can cram.Otherwise, if you want to learn a lot about opera, he is the man! Overall, a great course that makes youwalk out feeling like a much more educated and well rounded person.",
    "Yes I will recommend it.",
    "This is a good fifth CR\/D\/F class. While there isn't much work, Tomlinson is kind of a hardass with grading, so if you don't feel confident with your abilities to write papers about opera, don't take it for a grade. Interesting class, though."
