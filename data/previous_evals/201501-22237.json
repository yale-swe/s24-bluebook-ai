   "comments": [
    "This was quite different than I had expected- but I had also not taken a history class before. It was extremely interesting, but this is definitely a class you should do the reading for. Take it if you can- you learn a lot from it.",
    "A great way to learn about reproduction related topics through the ages without needing a hardcore background in women's studies.",
    "Take this class for sure. It is not a lot of work, and most of the readings and activities are very interesting. My only qualm was that we were allowed to use computers (and most of the readings were on the computer) so a lot of people just tuned out and online shopped and were really not participating which took away from the class. The class itself is great though.",
    "Great class, lots of readings but really enjoyable and should totally do to get the most out of the discussions",
    "You will gain an in depth understanding of sex, life and generation",
    "Take it! I found myself talking a lot about the class to my peers. If you are HSHM or vaguely interested in sexuality studies, I would highly recommend.",
    "This was probably one of the classes that I enjoyed the most this semester. I would definitely recommend it to a fellow student because you get to talk about such a wide breadth of things--from women's rights, abortion, infanticide, scientific racism, hermaphroditism, and artificial life. It really made me think critically and engage in conversation with the other people in my seminar.",
    "I would say the course is a good way to learn about how sex and generation has been approached throughout history. I would recommend it to another student because this is a topic that people generally shy away from but it makes you think about your personal views and where they come from.",
    "Sex, Life, and Generation was not what I was expecting it to be, but it ended up being a fairly interesting class. I probably wouldn't recommend this to be your first history of science class because the material can be strange and difficult to grapple with at times. It's really cool in conjunction if you're taking\/have taken Bioethics and Law because you learn the historical perspective on the controversial issues of today. Weekly discussions can be really interesting and relevant at times and at other times sort of weird, but I guess that's the nature of the subject. Workload isn't bad, 6 reading responses, a presentation, and a term paper. Just make sure to plan your paper ahead of time."
