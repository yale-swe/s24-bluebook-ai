    "I would summarize it as a course that will provide an introduction to the neurological basis of reading and that makes a nice connection with related topics, such as bilingualism or speech processing. It is not, however, a course for somebody who has never taken a course on Neurolinguistics, it requires a certain familiarity with the brain anatomy and main models of speech processing."

    "It is very important to have a good understanding of the neural basis of reading if one is doing research in pyscholinguistics because much of the experimental work is based on reading tasks. Therefore, it contributed directly to my own research."
