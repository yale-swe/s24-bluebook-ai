    "The instructors presented a few topics in the beginning and towards the end of the course. Each student had to present on one topic chosen from \"Networks, Crowds and Markets\" of David Easley and Jon Kleinberg.",
    "I gained an overview of how graph theory is applied to economics and the open areas of research which are being investigated. In addition, I was able to see what student presentations of papers are like, and how I could possibly improve my own.",
    "I learned about network theory, game theory and its application in various fields. The materials, overall, was interesting.",
    "In my section, we went through an interesting book called \"Networks, Crowds, and Markets\" by Easley and Kleinberg. It covered many different applications of graph theory.",

   "comments": [
    "This was a good course.",
    "The course covered interesting material and did so in a way that was flexible and accessible to all levels. However, it might've been nice to have a clearer sense of expectations -- compared to many other classes in the Math and Econ \/ Math major, it felt a bit strange to have a grade that was just a presentation and comments on other people's presentations.",
    "In each class a student presents. I think it could be made more engaging by making it mandatory to read a few pages on that topic each week for every student.",
    "Strengths: The class felt like a mini-conference, which was a great capstone for the major. Weaknesses: There was absolutely zero feedback provided at any point in the course. It's a shame because many of us (particularly those going into academia or finance) will be giving talks throughout our lives, and it'd be great to learn how to do so effectively from experienced professors.",
    "It gives a good way to do a mathematical presentation, which is actually a very important skill to have.",
    "The seminar was nice and low key, which was great for people also writing theses, but it felt like a bit of a waste---certainly not like a capstone of the major. For instance, it might have been nice if the textbook we were supposed to present presupposed any college level math at all.",
    "Very entertaining math class. The pace is very good."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this to senior students.",
    "It's certainly a nice way to finish off the major, and we absolutely loved the enthusiasm of Professor Liu and his desire to drive both mathematical formalism and intuition into the results.",
    "Yes, if you have to.",
    "Yes, if you want to sharpen your presentational skills.",
    "Well, it was better than the other option for the math senior seminar. In no way was any of the material relevant to what I had actually studied as a math major, but at least it wasn't very hard.",
    "If you're taking it, you have to.",
    "This class is very entertaining. You learn math cooperatively without the stress of weekly psets."
