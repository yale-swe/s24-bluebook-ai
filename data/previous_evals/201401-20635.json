    "Music 210 was a very good introductory music theory class. I would definitely recommend it to another student.",
    "This class is excellent. As someone who had never taken music theory before, I felt slightly behind the rest of the class at the beginning. However, Jonathan is an excellent teacher and I felt caught up by the end of the term. Class is always interesting, and there is lots of opportunity for participation.",
    "I would definitely take this class with Jonathan Guez because he puts in a ridiculous amount of time to meet up with students individually outside class and he's just an awesome teacher. The course itself is less composition and more drilling of techniques and analysis. A LOT of analysis but it's cool because afterwards you just have so much I say about a musical piece and your understanding of music goes to a new level. I would definitely recommend this class because it has les work load (everything you learn is cumulative so in the final you hardly have to review anything as you've been practicing the same techniques of voice leading etc. the whole semester.) and what other class can you take that allows you to listen to such beautiful music?",
    "I would definitely recommend it. It lays a great foundation in music theory, laying the groundwork for future study.",
    "Take it with Jonathan. You won't regret it.",
    "It was a pretty intensive theory class, with many topics introduced in rapid succession. I'd recommend it as I learned a lot, but only if you enjoy theory. The majority of the course is introducing concepts in a vacuum, with the interesting part - looking at real music - only coming at the very end with analysis of binary form.",
    "Music 210 changed a lot this semester. This section involved virtually no composition; our grades were based on workbook-based homework exercises, exams and quizzes, rather than on composition projects. We actually covered less material than we did in my section of 205 from 2 years ago, ending with binary form. Jonathan is a fantastic teacher and the class was a fine experience, but he teaches very much to the bottom of the class, so if you\u2019re a more experienced student who really wants to learn new things and dive into composition and serious theory, you might find this class frustratingly slow.",
    "Jonathan is a wonderful teacher. His passion for the material (especially the composers\/compositions introduced in class) and his sincere desire to get his students excited about music is evident in all he does. His class never failed to interest and inspire, even though it was at 9 am. I also very much appreciated his availability and willingness to help students outside of class. Take this with Jonathan if you possibly can! In general, the course has a well-structured curriculum. Starting the class with voice leading, followed by chord progressions and larger-scale musical devices, makes very good sense. The balance of theory with examples in context and composition\/completion exercises suited me very well. It might have been nice to go just a bit farther and learn about sonata form, but we covered a chapter of the textbook each week as it was, so I suppose that might be too much material to get through in one semester.",
    "MUSI 210 is definitely a worthwhile class to take if you're a prospective music major or a non-major interested in theory and\/or (as is often the case with students in 200-level theory) taking lessons for credit. I enjoyed it as a non-music major. It is an introductory overview of concepts in tonal harmony and some form. It's really great for people who also want to learn more about composition."
