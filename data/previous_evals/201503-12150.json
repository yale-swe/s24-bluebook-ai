   "comments": [
    "The course is very divisive. If you're taking it as an intro to global health, you will come out of it definitely knowing whether the field is for you or not. Unfortunately, I came out of it knowing that it definitely wasn't for me. While I feel much more informed about global health concepts, the class was a harsh environment. I did not get the impression that the global health community would be very welcoming if this class was to be taken as a caricature of it. Cold calls, harsh late penalties, tons of work, etc. I started off loving this course, but I definitely breathed a sigh of relief on the last day.",
    "Do yourself a favor and find a better global health class. All of the material can be learned in one hour of reading any global health textbook, and all time in class is spent hearing about how great Prof Skolnik thinks he is.",
    "It's an introduction to health issues in the world, from broad thematic issues, to different diseases. I'd recommend it as an introduction to the topic, or as an interesting 5th course to someone interested but unfamiliar with the area.",
    "This was a great class that I would most certainly recommend. I learned such great important concepts and strong applications of them. The class was engaging and interesting. The instructor and the teaching fellows genuinely cared about students' learning.",
    "Solid introduction to global health. Great professor, really knows what he's talking about. Prof. Skolnik can be pretty full of himself, but in a kind of endearing way. Take it if you're interested in diseases, risk factors, etc around the world.",
    "This class teaches the fundamentals of global health. Students are expected to watch some videos and read certain sections in the textbook before each class. Professor Skolnik then expands upon the ideas presented in the book. I would recommend this class if you are interested in the challenges of health. It really changed my perspective on what occurs across the globe.",
    "Great introduction to Global Health! If you're interested in public health or want to be a physician, I think it's a necessary class to understand the issues of health in the world today. At times very intuitive, but overall a more technical course than I imagined. Professor Skolnik's a great professor who invests a lot in his students, though don't be intimidated by his cold calling!",
    "Absolutely worth taking, but only if you engage in the course fully; you lose a lot if you don'e go to lecture or section or skip the readings.",
    "NO. You basically just learn basic facts during the course. Maybe buy the book and read it because it's great, but the class itself is a pretty big waste of a Yale credit.",
    "AAAH! Beware! Do not believe the wonderful things the pre-meds are saying about this course. Global Health was a ridiculous waste of time. I could have skipped class all semester, read the textbook the night before the final exam, and gotten the same grade. The WORST part of this course was definitely the instructor, Richard Skolnik, who believed himself to be the greatest man alive and made us address him as we would the Prime Minister of India. He would cold-call his least favorite students and give easy questions to his favorite students, all of whom were international students. To these international students, he pretended to know everything about their \"cultures back home\" and it made him sound racist. The other students in this class were mainly cutthroat pre-meds who were only taking this course to suck up to Skolnik for his connections in the global health field. They were sickeningly oblivious to his arrogance and even fed into it by addressing him as \"prime minister\" and lining up after class to tell him how great it was (the classes were never great). Skolnik prides himself on his absurdly arbitrary multiple choice exams which don't actually reflect what the student knows or is capable of. The final grade on this class, too, is absurdly arbitrary. There are also three policy briefs for this class which take an INSANE amount of time for a good grade - but they're not worth quite enough to be worth the work. Definitely not recommended; there are so many better global health courses offered.",
    "I would recommend this course to a friend. It's a great class to learn about the fundamentals of global health.",
    "Good course but there is a discrepancy between the general knowledge that you are taught in class and the precision of the questions on tests.",
    "The course was very informative and Professor Skolnik is an engaging and knowledgeable teacher. HLTH 230 offers a broad overview of global health. The policy briefs are an extremely useful skill to learn if you are considering entering any policy or related professional field. The grading on the policy briefs, like in this class, is not too harsh. To succeed, however, you will need to follow the professor's directions and writing formula precisely. The breadth of this course is valuable because it raises more questions than answers, and I think that Professor Skolnik also gives students the opportunity to see where they could fit in, professionally, in the field of global health. You will not really gain specific, in depth knowledge of issues unless you choose to write a policy brief on that issue. Most importantly you learn a mindset for approaching\/solving health issues in low and middle income countries. The only drawback to this course is that the discussion sections (in which students break into groups and then give bad speeches) are rather dry. Despite the dryness, the TAs are wonderful, very knowledgeable, and very helpful on policy briefs and any other questions you have.",
    "This course is an introduction to global health seen through five questions: what is the problem, who gets it, why do they get it, what are the social\/economic consequences, and what can be done. It really isn't a policy class--even though we do write policy briefs--in so much as a class that looks at overall trends in global health. It can be a bit frustrating at times because a lot that we do study seems pretty self explanatory\/obvious. I think my biggest problem with the class was that halfway through I felt that we were just reiterating the same trends again and again. I don't see it as a bad thing necessarily, but if you want something that goes more in depth know that this class probably won't be it. I would recommend this class to someone who is totally brand new to the field of global health, but if you're someone who already has some background knowledge I would suggest a higher level course.",
    "Please do yourself a favor and do not take this class. Professor Skolnik is not only one of the most arrogant, full of himself people you will ever encounter, but he also loves to present global health from a white savior point of view, make frequent microaggressions, and implicitly denigrate (or at the very least, believe himself the savior and\/or leader of) people living in \"developing countries.\" As a person of color, I was often made incredibly uncomfortable by Professor Skolnik's flippant remarks. Even if you think that you can put up with Professor Skolnik and take this class for the sake of interest in global health, I strongly dissuade you from taking this course. Many people I talked to agreed that not only was Professor Skolnik arrogant and at times insufferable, but also that they essentially learned nothing from this class by the end of the semester. The material Professor Skolnik presents is not nuanced in any way, and you will come away from this class likely not knowing much more about global health than you did at the beginning of the semester (and the little that you may learn could easily, and in much less time and expense, be learned from researching maternal health or HIV\/AIDS or the politics of developmental assistance of whatever topics in global health interest you on the internet)."
