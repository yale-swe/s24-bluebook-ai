    "Yes! If you want to expand your intellectual vocabulary, take this course. It will make you see the world in terms of design and aesthetic intentionality. It is lovely and Julian is wonderful. it is certainly an introductory course (i.e., you do a lot of floundering\/experimenting and seeing if things are hits or misses) and there isn't a whole lot of theory taught, so you're basically allowed to develop a style independent of what other people have been doing\/trends\/what is \"right,\" etc. It made me want to take more graphic design classes, if that's any indication of whether or not I'd recommend it (I would).",
    "This class is useful for learning the value of that saying \"give me strength to recognize to change the things I can, recognize those I can''t and know the difference\"; it was also great for taking criticism and learning what to do with it, if anything at all.",
    "If you are at all interested in graphic design as an academic or professional pursuit, you need to take this class. I realized by the end of the semester that I am not nearly nit-picky and anal enough to be a graphic designer - it's not that I didn't enjoy the class, but I realized that I was not as suited for the field as I thought I might be. It is a good course for anyone, though, if you're interested in becoming a much more critical viewer. I can't help but notice the design of everything from the typography of this course evaluation to the design of street signs; that is definitely a positive.",
    "You won't learn solid Skillz but you will grow more attuned to the language of graphic design, and become more considered in your visual choices. If that interests you, it's definitely a good choice.",
    "I would recommend Art 132 to any student looking for an introduction to the field of graphic design. You'll complete an art project every week, and sometimes they take a long time. Also, this is NOT a Photoshop class, most of the course is conducted with an X-acto knife and a photocopier. Professor Bittiner is not too harsh, but his critiques are long and often boring, despite his endearing personality.",
    "YES! This was a fun course that will teach you the basics of graphic design. Don't expect to produce anything miraculous, but expect to leave the course with a better understanding of how ideas can be transmitted visually. Additionally, Julian was a wonderful teacher.",
    "We work on a variety of projects using mostly paper, glue, and xacto knives and critique the work in class. Eventually, we use the computer design programs for our final project. I would recommend the class to others. I learned a lot about being concise but making sure my message got across.",
    "YES! take it only if you are actually interested in the subject and are willing to invest some time and energy into the assignments. if you do though, you will find it very rewarding.",
    "Unless you enjoy talking in circles twice a week for two hours at a time, I do not recommend taking this course.Class time is solely used to critique work. Instead of learning specific principles and tools of design, students are left with vague feedback (which often feels frustratingly arbitrary) and very little practical design instruction. At best, this course succeeds in exposing students to design vocabulary. But if you're looking for much more than that, I sincerely suggest that you look elsewhere."
