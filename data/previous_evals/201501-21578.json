    "It's a great course, I think if you're a history major or even thinking about being one you should DEFINITELY take the course. You learn about all the different ways that history has been thought about, like the purpose of writing history, how one should write history, the difficulty in writing the history of oppressed groups who's systematically erased from history, etc. And it's also obviously a lot about knowledge production and power and all that good stuff. Even if you're not interested in history, the readings will be super interesting and you'll learn a lot from them. Prof. LaFleur is also AWESOME and she makes the class really fun and informative and she cares a lot about you as a student and it's pretty chill and like why wouldn't you take this course, come on.",
    "I would recommend this to anyone interested in philosophy and history."
