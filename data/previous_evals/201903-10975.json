    "Overview of some literature on translations during the Middle Ages, introduction to some \"translated\" works of medieval literature",
    "As a new medievalist with a steep learning curve to climb, I found this courses wide ranging selection of canonical\/integral texts to be an incredibly useful foundation. We not only studied some of the most famous literary texts of the medieval period(s), but also the theory, both medieval and contemporary, to help contextualize the readings for our academic purposes."

   "comments": [
    "Sometimes the conceptual undergirding of the class was muddled or repetitive. Wasn't sure we outlined our theory of translation thoroughly enough. Often the readings pointed me clearly in one direction, and I would get to class and the discussion would be entirely different. I did find most of the readings interesting though",
    "I think this course is a very useful survey of many of the biggest hits of medieval literature (Jerome & Boethius, for example), but is primarily a Chaucer course, and thus speaks to a very specific notion of translation-- one man in the linguistic milieu of 14th century England-- which is a fortuitously closer study than one might expect from the title \"Medieval Translation,\" but also, I think, somewhat detached from the wider culture of translation even in the European Middle Ages. So the depth of the course is on one hand a strength and on the other a weakness-- but that's the problem with anything medieval, really; it's a millennium."

   "comments": [
    "I think if you go into this class as more of a class about Chaucer\/medieval literature in general, with some thematic influences, it would be satisfying",
    "It entirely depends on their interests! I would certainly recommend this course to anyone in search of a Chaucer course, or anyone who needed to fulfill their medieval requirement.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student eager to establish or bolster her foundation in medieval literary and translation studies."
