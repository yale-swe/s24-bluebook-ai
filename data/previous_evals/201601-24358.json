    "If you have studied statistics before, this class will seem to move slowly but it is still a fascinating course. The workload was very manageable, with 4 problem sets spaced out over the semester and a final project where you propose a public health intervention in an assigned issue. Overall, a great introduction to the field of public health.",
    "It is a great class and even though no distributional requirements are given, I would recommend it if you are interested in health at all! The SPSS you learn is great, and the atmosphere is also great.",
    "I highly recommend it to any student interested in any health profession.",
    "The case studies are fun but lectures can get very dry",
    "Good class for anyone looking for an intro to epidemiology and public health. You'll leave feeling like you have a good grasp of epi and PH concepts. You'll be able to understand current research.",
    "Would definitely recommend this course, I think it is super useful and important information for anyone going into any health profession.",
    "If youre at all interested in public health, you will learn a lot in this class. And you'll have fun doing it!",
    "Awesome class! Great instructor and really interesting material. Would recommend for any pre-med!",
    "This is a great introductory course to epidemiology for those that are interest in global\/public health. While there is quite a bit of reading to do in the class, they are all relevant and follow along with the class lectures (a very good preparation tool for midterms). The problem sets given in the class (4 in total) were very manageable. The greatest strength of this course is the in-class cases every Thursday, where instead of having a traditional PowerPoint lecture, students are given papers and work in groups to discuss relevant topics affecting global\/public health.",
    "A great class! Prof. White is hilarious and the class is super low-stress. It alternates between lectures one day of the week and group-work another day of the week, which keeps things lively. The exams were super fair and not even worth that much of the grade. I learned a lot and enjoyed the class overall!",
    "If you are looking for a very basic yet comprehensive introduction to epidemiology, this is the course to take. You'll learn all of the general concepts in public health surveillance and also learn how to apply them to cases you might find in the future.",
    "This is an amazing course! The amount you learn about epidemiology, specifically public health research design and data analysis, is incredible. Professor White is an engaging lecturer and makes the course very hands on with many case studies.",
    "The class is structured with lectures where the professor teaches the material and then case study days where students spend the class period learning to apply the material. There are a couple PSETs, 2 midterms, a take-home final, and a final case study presentation. The class is awesome. I learned a LOT of useful information, and the workload was so fair. Great for anyone interested in public health and how public health data is collected and analyzed.",
    "HLTH 240 is an enjoyable class that provides a great introduction to epidemiology. I would recommend this course to anyone interested in medicine and\/or public health. The course load is very manageable and I never felt that I was doing busywork - all assignments helped in my learning. The classroom environment is very pleasant and the material is very interesting and useful for someone who plans to enter any field related to health or healthcare delivery.",
    "A lecture that also has a lot of group\/class work. An overview of epidemiology\/public health, very useful and well taught. If this class fits into your interests I definitely recommend that you take it!",
    "HLTH 240 was a wonderful class. It was such a great combination of lecture-style learning and application of that learning through case studies. I greatly appreciated learning SPSS and applying it to the material we were learning in class. At times, the material could be a little dry, the lectures were a little disorganized, and the definitions of terms we were learning were a bit confusing. I think the organization of the material and lectures are a main area that could use improvement, but I suspect that these details will get ironed out as the course is taught more and more frequently. Overall, though this was a highlight of my semester. Amazing teaching staff and an incredible professor greatly contributed to the positive experience I had. If you're at all interested in learning the tools you need to complete a successful research\/capstone project in global health, this will definitely equip you with the basics to get you started. Prof. White is a wonderful resourcedefinitely get to know her well, she cares so much about her students! Also this class isn't too workload heavy, so for those who are concerned about that I wouldn't worry. the assignments are super fair and well spaced out.",
    "I took this course as a requirement for Global Health Fellows. By the end, I had a pretty comprehensive understanding of epidemiological principles and statistical application in case studies. The workload is manageable, tests are fair, and Prof. White is hilarious! Would recommend this course to anyone honestly. A fun time!"
