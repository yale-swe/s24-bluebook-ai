    "Yes, I'd totally recommend this class! Talya is an awesome instructor, and I loved all the readings. HOWEVER to really understand them, you need to have prior knowledge of U.S. foreign relations and\/or theoretical frameworks as used in American Studies. I would urge anyone *without* a solid background in this stuff to think very critically before signing up for this class - you most likely won't be able to keep up, and may end up dragging down the discussion for everyone else.",
    "I really enjoyed this course. That said, you're really only going to be satisfied if you hold yourself to doing the readings thoroughly (particularly the books), otherwise the conversations and material can feel somewhat surface level."
