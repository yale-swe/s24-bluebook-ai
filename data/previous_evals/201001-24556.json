    "He could have assigned lots more work than he did.",
    "Being in class every day is just like intro, but don't expect to have the structure that you had in intro. The film studies department changed the directive of the course a couple weeks in, so we never had a clear assignment from the beginning. That being said, the scene work you do will make your screenwriting better.",
    "This class, like any Lapadula class, is great. As always, you get out of it what you put into it, but if you're determined to learn more about screenwriting, you will.",
    "A great course for someone serious about writing screenplays. You can only rely on yourself to get anything significant out of the class. Lapadula will challenge you, but ultimately, you have to motivate yourself to write outside of class. Almost on the level of an independent study class.",
    "I would summarize it as a good way to learn formatting, but Intermediate doesn't really help you grow as a screenwriter, except in getting more practice, just because it doesn't have much structure, and what's expected of you is often unclear.",
    "A class that urges you to write, without forcing it on you. A forum in which to motivate yourself to practice screenwriting."
