    "Learned some cool case studies of language endangerment and revitalization and how to think about language endangerment in it's social context",
    "I gained a broad insight into the sociological factors that impact and are impacted by language change. I learned what anthropological research looks like and how to apply theories of language change to specific case studies. The course is a very good look at the social aspect of language change, moreso than the linguistic aspect. Most of the readings will deal with the anthropological and societal factors that surround language identity and what happens when language changes, and the course analyzed what happens when a people attempt to forestall the death of their language. The material is very insightful, and I certainly learned a lot from it.",
    "I learned about a variety of different language endangerment case studies. I learned what types of pressures facilitate language shift in different cultural, political, and social contexts. An important takeaway was that the answer to language endangerment is not always to try and save the language. Linguists must be sensitive and listen to the desires of native speakers and community members, whether or not they want to save the language, and if so what kind pf external support they need.",
    "Learned about several interesting case studies of language endangerment and some theoretical frameworks for thinking about it."

    "It's a great class in terms of its readings and potential, but discussion was sometimes unstructured and awkward. Also kind of strange not having any grade in the course all semester besides the final paper....",
    "Strengths: Errington is a very good and knowledgeable lecturers. The material is interesting and is covered at a reasonable pace. The course is small and flexible to meet the scheduling and location needs of students, and we got a bit of input into what we wanted to cover towards the end of the year. Weaknesses: It was easy to not give 100% to the class, and I know some people did slack off in the seminar. Also, it is a bit nerve wracking to have your entire (maybe?) grade based off of a single paper that is turned in at the end of term. Im still not certain what the grading system is but I would imagine its something like 50% paper and 50% participation and attendance, and there is no visible metric for how you are doing in the class grade-wise. Perhaps this is by design, as I certainly wasnt focused on my grades for this class throughout the term, but it is rather stressful at the end.",
    "The course involved some interesting case studies and reading material that stimulated conversation. I appreciated that the content was also driven by student interests and commitment. I think more regular assessments and\/or requirements regarding the final paper such as turning in an annotated bibliography and outline, would have increased student engagement.",
    "Most people in the class had interesting particular points of view or areas of interest and it was always interesting to hear and compare them. The discussions might have benefitted from a little more structure."

    "Yeah why not! Errington is very enthusiastic about the subject, knows a lot of fascinating case studies that he will teach you about, and wants to help you find something you're interested in researching. yoU have to be a trooper for the awkward discussions but I got a lot out of my final research project and the ideas we discussed throughout the semester.",
    "Absolutely. I am a Mathematics and Computer Science Major, so this class was a foray off the beaten path so to speak. I really enjoyed it. For 95% of the class, it is extremely relaxed and has no stress. The workload is minimal up until the paper, and if you dont procastimate you can easily write a 15 page term paper in a month. I would recommend that you take LING 112 (Historical Linguistics) in conjunction with or prior to this course as they approach the same topic (pretty much) from complementary angles.",
    "yes, but only if they already have a specific interest in an endangered language.",
    "Yes, it offers an interesting and important perspective for anyone who studies language."
