    "The strengths of this seminar lie in the great selection of films screened in the class and how they engaged with questions of interiority and architectural space, as well as the vibrant discussions after student presentations on the course material. Corey is a great teacher with a wealth of knowledge in film and art, and is great at provoking intriguing conversations and thoughts amongst the students. I wish there was more time reserved for discussion for each of the films that we watched during class. Having more discussion and presentation in general would help the class be even better."
