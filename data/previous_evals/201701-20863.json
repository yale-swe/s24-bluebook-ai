    "I learned about how to solve differential equations. But I would have leaner exactly the same just reading the book. I went to lecture and didn't learn anything from it.",
    "In MATH 246, we focused on first-order linear equations, second-order linear equations, some numerical methods (Euler and Runge-Kutta) and some linear algebra concepts for solving systems of first-order linear differential equations. In second order linear differential equations we covered cases with constant coefficients (characteristic equation) and two solution methods for the particular solution of nonhomogeneous equations: undetermined coefficients and variation of parameters and in the case of variable coefficients, we did series solutions. In this last case, we also looked at solutions around an ordinary and a regular singular point. There are weekly homeworks and only 2 midterms, no final.",

    "None because the course was very poorly taught and structured.",
    "Just a general note, I was not in class very often and I have taken a lot of other harder courses. I think this class was fine, but I really didn't spend enough time in it or working on it to know for sure.",
    "ODEs was a nice refresher of calculus, which I really enjoyed. I also learned differential equations much more thoroughly, and their applications. It was news to me that differential equations are so applicable.",

    "I learned how to solve some ordinary differential equations, and I learned a little bit about the theory\/proofs that underlie ordinary differential equations and methods of finding solutions.",
    "The class was a solid overview of basic diff eq; I'm a physics major so a lot of the forms were familiar and useful.",
    "In this course I gained a practical knowledge of how to handle first order and second order linear differential equations. I also now have a cursory understanding of methods for solving systems of first order equations!",
    "The course is a good introduction to first- and second-order differential equations and methods for solving them. The last part of the course focusing on series solutions is useful.",
    "I definitely gained the ability to solve certain differential equations as well as an appreciation for their applications in fields such as physics. This course also integrates a lot of techniques from past courses, such as linear systems and power series. In that way, it feels like a logical next step in gradually increasing my ability to solve different problems.",
    "A lot of what I learned from this course was a set of techniques or procedures for solving first and second order differential equations, rather than universal problem solving skills. Also touched on some analysis, but not too many proofs.",

   "comments": [
    "The teaching was poor. The professor was not engaged with students. I find the material interesting but I can see how other students can find it very boring. A good thing is that is was structured (we followed the book very closely), so I did not feel lost at any point during the semester.",
    "I learnt most of the material by myself by reading the book (Boyce-DiPrima), which I liked. In class, sometimes we would go very quickly and I always felt the need to read the book to understand what we had discussed in class. Prof. Moncrief is not a bad professor, but I don't think I learned a lot from his lectures in class. A few times, when students would ask two or more clarification questions about something, he would recommend them to read the book. There are many people who do not come to lecture and I would not recommend that. I did find some of Prof. Moncrief's lectures helpful and he was particularly good and understanding students' questions, but not generally very clear when transmitting the information to the class.",
    "One major strength is that the professor is very helpful, patient, understanding and instructive. However, the exams were too long for most students to finish in the time allotted, especially the last one. It would be helpful if the grades for problem sets were posted online. I think the solutions to the problem sets really, really should be posted after each set is complete. Most classes I know with problem sets do this, and that would be very helpful to study with. Otherwise you really don't know what you're doing wrong.",
    "Strengths - homework was helpful as practice. Weaknesses - could spend less time reviewing linear algebra.",
    "The course could be taught so much better with a more engaging professor.",
    "A new professor. It is clear that Moncrief has no interest in teaching basic differential equations to undergrads. Lectures were EXTREMELY unorganized and hard to follow. Homework became unreasonable and tedious toward the end of the course. Also, the final was ridiculously long and the fact that most people barely got to 2\/4 questions is unfair because we are unable to prove what we've learned.",
    "Because the lectures were taught straight from the book more or less, and were sometimes disorganized, it was occasionally hard to pay attention in lecture. HOWEVER, I still found lectures very helpful and the problem sets were tailored to help us.",
    "Pretty dry material. Lecture seemed disconnected from the textbook.",
    "Strengths: gives you a solid foundation of ODEs Weakness: the exams are too long, not allowing you to show everything that you know on the test",
    "This course was taught straight out of the textbook and I would have preferred (since it is a course in the math department) for the professor to focus more on the proofs for us to better understand the methodology.",
    "Better if classes were recorded and we solved more questions in class",
    "IfS pretty boring",
    "Having a TA with regular section, office hours, and\/or problems solving sessions would improve the course. Math courses should be made more accessible!",
    "Moncrief is really nice but the teaching was rather unstructured and sometimes difficult to follow.",
    "This course was a very good introduction to ODEs. Exams were both open note and open book, given the sheer volume of solution techniques we learned this semester. I would have liked to see more proofs on problem sets, but overall I think the course was structured very well!",
    "The course was strong in that it kept moving through material and the homework sets gave a good sense of the type of problems we might encounter. The teaching, however, was quite lackluster. Lessons were presented without enthusiasm or real student engagement and often did not pause to connect to previous insights or provide motivation for next steps. The second midterm was also very poorly written in the sense that it was way too long for the time allotted. This could be easily fixed by having fewer sub-parts for each question.",
    "I found lectures to be very poorly organized. Professor Moncrief definitely knew what he was talking about, and if you asked questions you would be able to extract that knowledge. But if you were just passively listening to lectures, you could get pretty confused.",
    "This course is very clearly taught and corresponds pretty well with a good textbook. The problems on the homework assignments and the exams are usually fair, although they sometimes take a very long time to complete. I think this course would benefit from a greater focus on applied methods for efficiently solving problems rather than proof-based methods that are not useful in practice.",
    "I think the course could be more intellectually stimulating if we spent more time on derivations\/proofs -- depth rather than breadth? It is a well-organized course and the procedures are pretty straight forward, but it is not as fulfilling as other math courses to just learn to apply a set of steps, rather than figure out how to solve the problems. This might just be the nature of the material, however.",
    "The course is, for the most part, dry and does not offer much no insight, but this is just an artifact of the course topic. That being said, Professor Moncrief is, for the most part, excellent at being clear and direct in the presentation of material. The homework is fair, and the midterms are a fair representation of the homework. My biggest qualm, however, is the second midterm. It was nearly impossible to finish for me, as it had 2 long problems with power series solutions, which are pain in and of themselves. This could have been rectified, as I do not feel that my performance on the second midterm was representative of my knowledge of the course material. If we were given 30-45 minutes more time on the test, I would have felt a lot more comfortable.",
    "The professor is nice, but a pretty confusing lecturer. His lectures don't feel very organized, and he just follows these notes he took from a version of the textbook a long time ago. Often his writing on the board gets very disorganized and confusing. Most of what I learned, I learned from reading the textbook. The textbook is also pretty mediocre, but clearer than lectures. The homework also isn't challenging enough to really drive home some of the important points we learn in class. The class could be improved with a better textbook, clearer lectures, and homework that is slightly more challenging.",
    "the in-class notes need to be clearer! i stopped going to lecture because my in-class notes were not understandable outside of the context of the lecture. Moncrief just writes calculations\/equations on the board while talking about how to do the problem, leaving little context\/explanation in writing. the professor needs to be more communicative over email about when midterms are and when assignment due dates have been changed. the final exam was ridiculous. it was a nearly full-length exam, and we were given one hour and fifteen minutes to complete it. every other class i've taken would have given us a minimum of two hours for an exam of that length. as far as i could tell, no one in the class finished the exam. i was working as quickly as i possibly could, and i hardly made past the halfway point. we were not told how these final exams are to be graded, so i have no clue what my final grade will be."

   "comments": [
    "I would not recommend this course to another student if everything stays the same. While Prof. Moncrief was not too bad, I did not get much out of his lectures. Many things were covered fast and the book helped me very much understand the material. The peer tutor was also not the best at explaining conceptual questions, although she was dedicated, never refused to answer our questions and set 4 office hours per week. I would have liked a professor who focuses more on details and who cares about students understanding the material. I also think that an experienced TA is needed for the class, because this is important material for many people going into math and engineering.",
    "I would recommend this course to students majoring in physics, astrophysics, or another subject where differential equations might be useful. Math majors may find this less rigorous than higher level courses. I don't have a particularly strong math background and found this course to be manageable and helpful for physical applications. Towards the end (series solutions\/regular singular point problems, especially the proof-based problems on the homework), it became much more challenging. There are two midterms (non-cumulative) for the class and no final. Tests are open-note, which is very helpful for peace of mind in case you forget a formula, but you still really have to understand what you're doing as they are long and if you don't prepare thoroughly, you will most likely not finish. I think a positive aspect of this course is the professor (Vincent Moncrief) is wonderful. He's fair, patient, understanding, and willing to helpful outside of class. He wants you to do well. He understands that students who elect to take this course come from a myriad of backgrounds and tries to take this into account. I hope to take a course with him again in the future.",
    "Fairly good introduction to diffrential equations. Lecture were mostly clear, but became a bit confusing when discussion series solutions at regular singular points. Course follows the textbook more or less. Also covered system solutions to linear differential equations but did not get to Laplace transforms. Test were fair but a bit long, especially the second midterm. No final during finals week which is definitely a plus.",
    "No.",
    "I would recommend to students pursuing math-related majors. Otherwise, it is not a particularly fulfilling course.",
    "Prof. Moncrief is a good guy. He had an open-book, in-class midterm and final. Midterm was manageable, the final rocked everyone so we'll see how that shakes out. Overall, this is a course you're probably going to take for your major anyway. Would recommend it with Prof. Moncrief.",
    "If you need it for your major or just enjoy learning math, take it.",
    "Maybe, perhaps consider trying ENAS196 as well.",
    "Pretty chill but informative introduction to differential equations. Moncrief uses a good amount of physics examples if you're into that kind of thing too.",
    "Yes",
    "Definitely. Especially as a math elective, it is straightforward and easily comprehendable.",
    "Notnreally",
    "A good course to take if you want to learn some methods of solving ordinary differential equations. A little light on proofs\/theory. The textbook is very clear and helpful.",
    "I would not. It's a relatively easy class, but I never felt engaged in it, either in lecture or in material. Take it if you have to, but try not to.",
    "In hindsight I think the engineering version (194) might be more structured -- if more computationally based. However, there's relatively little proof or theory to be done with diff eq it seems, so it's probably not a bad trade-off.",
    "I would recommend this course to STEM students who want a thorough understanding of ordinary differential equations (that they might not received taking the ENAS version of the same class).",
    "The class did provide a decent introduction to Differential Equations, but I would not describe it as a \"fun\" math course. I often came away from the lectures feeling frustrated that the material did not really make sense and wouldn't get understanding until I read the textbook and did the homework.",
    "Definitely a good course to take just to get down those basic methods for differential equations. Have to take for any sort of math or applied math major.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. Despite any intimidation that may be invoked by the term differential equations, this class is very fair. Some homework assignments may take a while, but they are typically much harder than what will actually appear on the exams, of which there are only two. This course does not require a huge amount of work, and you will likely succeed as long as you put in a little bit of time.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student only if solving differential equations will at some point be of use to you in your career (which is likely the case for lots of STEM folks). Although the techniques are clever, it is not especially interesting because they are simply being presented to you. Not too much work though, so if it's definitely required and you're taking a lot of hard classes already, this is not a bad one to tack on.",
    "I would not recommend this class unless it's required for your major. You will learn a lot more just by reading a textbook. Everything I learned in the class was from reading the textbook (lectures were not particularly clear and the homework was extremely simple), and there are also better differential equations textbooks out there. You're much better off just finding one of those textbooks and teaching yourself the material.",
    "it's not very good. the psets are straightforward and the book tells you pretty much everything you need to know, but lectures are mediocre and the professor seems to have no idea how long a test should take."
