   "comments": [
    "I would not recommend this course unless it is required of you, but I would say that it is far better than 205.",
    "You probably need to take this class. My group had no lab reports in Phys 205L, but had 7-9 page lab reports for this class, which will probably color this review. I spent a lot of time every week trying to make sense of all the data we (lab partner+I) took. The reports probably took between 8 and 14 hours a week, depending on the quality of work I handed in. I wish that the reports were allowed to be shorter, because explaining all the background felt a little superfluous for a class that isn't a writing credit.",
    "Why would you take this if you didn't have to?",
    "If you can avoid taking this course at Yale I would try to do that. Its a lot of work with not very much pay off. The labs are super cool so its not a total bust, but I'm pretty sure you can find similar intro second semester physics classes with interesting labs and not nearly as much required effort.",
    "You choose your own experiments from a list of pretty good ones. Then you actually do them, and some of them are fun. And some are not. And when they're not. You write lab reports. Anyway. Some people can take this class really seriously and get very good at taking measurements and handling data. I was not one of them.",
    "This course is wonderful, especially in comparison to PHYS 205L. Most days, you can get out early if you set up the apparatus quickly and collect data promptly. The structure is different from PHYS 205L, but I think that permanent groups, separate experiment timetables, and at-home lab writeups are to the advantage of this course.",
    "This lab is a lot of writing, and the quality of the lab and writeup vary depending of the lab itself, so do your research before choosing your labs (which you do right after your lab tour). On that note, I did C1 E3 H4 H1 D4 F1 J3 and J2. I enjoyed all of them except for D4. DO NOT do D4. I also heard that it's painfully difficult to get good data on the Millikan experiment (H6), but sometimes groups get lucky. Good labs are fun (especially if you do them correctly- make sure to read the protocol ahead of time), but try to work on the write ups, calculations, and error propagation stuff ahead of time.",
    "Actually a really interesting and fun lab, but it is very work intensive when you do the reports. Pick things you find interesting, and avoid labs that have long writeups (you can get an idea of this looking through the lab manuals on classesv2 before you choose your labs for the semester. J3 is awesome, although the first part write up is long, the second part is easy. Definitely do superconductivity. Digital logic was fun, interesting, with an easy writeup. Millikan oil drop was very aggravating. It is worth two reports, so maybe it's worth doing if you get it right the first day which we did not. If it doesn't work right away, ask Prof. Irons for help. He has a magic touch with all of the equipment. I didn't enjoy the transistor lab, but I also don't like circuits.",
    "Yes, but be prepared for the work.",
    "A very time consuming class that is nonetheless interesting. Fascinating experiments that often took up to 10 hours to write a lab report for. Although this class took up much more time than many of my 1 credit classes (and had the same in-class time of 3 hours a week), for some reason it is only worth half a credit. If you are taking this class, you're probably doing it for a major requirement, but I still recommend doing it, as long as you keep in account how much time it takes up.",
    "It's a pretty interesting class, but the lab reports will cause you to lose some sleep.",
    "This is a good course, better than P205L b\/c of the variety of experiments to choose from and a set partner for the semester. I would recommend it only if you are a physics\/mechanical engineering major or are up for the challenge of 10-15 hour weekly lab reports. I knew this coming in, but I did not expect to get burnt out so quickly by the lab reports (too many 4am lab report writing ordeals). A lot depends on your TA too, it can make or break your lab experience.",
    "Take it if you have to, This course is at least a credit's worth of work and the lab handout's are poorly written with little in the way of good language and clear questions.",
    "I found PHYS 206 to be a solid lab course with interesting\/good experiments and good educational value, but be aware that analyzing the data and writing up the reports outside of class was tedious and extremely time-consuming. As youve probably heard, the experiments are a lot better and more interesting than 205L (best was nuclear scattering, hands down), and I think you also learn a lot more by taking the time outside of class to analyze the data so much more carefully and write up your findings in scientific reports, which of course better simulates a real scientific research experience. Try to pick labs based on what seems most interesting to you because that makes the experience most fun and rewarding, and also if you can try to find a friend you trust you can work well with to be your lab partner, and arrange to be in the same lab section (as in the same day of the week) so that you have your partner secured (youll be working together for every lab the whole semester). Overall, a good learning experience and at times even fun, but be aware of the time commitment which cannot be overstated (definitely the equivalent of a full credit of work in a work-intensive class despite that its only a half credit), and get it out of the way in a semester when you can afford to spend at least an entire night each week working on the reports.",
    "If you are choosing between PHYS 166L or 206L, I'd advise you to take 166L if you just want to get a requirement out of the way with some work, and to take 206L if you really want cool experiments with more challenging lab reports. Even as an engineering major, I really came to appreciate a lot of the labs that we ended up doing, especially Nuclear Scattering, Electric Field Plotting, and X-Ray Diffraction. That being said, the lab reports can get quite lengthy, e.g. 5 - 8 hours per lab report.",
    "I would definitely recommend Physics 206L to anyone with an interest in Physics on an intellectual level. I took it as a bio major, mostly because I was interested in the topics and wanted to learn more. The lab is somewhat work-intensive, and the reports can be frustrating, but you'll get to cover a number of interesting topics. The particle accelerator experiment is particularly interesting, as is the superconductivity lab and the Fourier series lab. In general, the labs aren't as stressful as they are in 205L because they are better timed, but if you don't solve some problems that you have you can dig yourself a deep hole. But overall I'd really recommend it as an intellectually interesting lab that doesn't snow you under in work."
