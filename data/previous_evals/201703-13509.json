   "comments": [
    "I was able to learn how to analyze environmental problems from an anthropological viewpoint. The course provided a foundation for these concepts and real-life examples of their application.",
    "I developed knowledge of some the foundational theories for studying society and environment, and skills for critically engaging with these theories and applying to my own work through short writing assignments and weekly discussion. The final research paper was especially valuable in putting the course content to work in developing research and writing skills around my own academic interests.",
    "I expanded my knowledge and understanding of political ecology and environmental anthropology. The opportunity to write part of my thesis and receive feedback from Michael and Wen (the TF) was extremely valuable.",
    "Critical reading, thoughtful class participation, careful word choice",
    "Became more familiar with the concepts and concerns with anthropological and conservation work on a global scale using case studies and historical anecdotes from the Professor's own work and colleagues. Highly informative regrading questioning common perceptions and misconceptions of the field.",
    "how to read a lot and synthesize ideas. how to read critically about development ideas.",
    "The way to understand people, world and the society in different aspects.",
    "This course helped me to change the way I think about the world and about environmental problems. I gained the understanding that environmental problems are inherently social problems. We discussed the limitations of science as a discourse. We also learned about the biases in social science research and the difficulties involved in undertaking such research."

   "comments": [
    "I expected to learn the foundational concepts regarding environmental anthropology during this course and that is what happened. Professor Dove provided not just a theoretical framework for this concepts but also examples of their application in order to gain more practical experience as well.",
    "The course was very aligned with my expectations, providing an excellent and challenging introduction to society and environment studies.",
    "This class fulfilled my expectations.",
    "I took the course largely because Prof. Dove teaches it and was not disappointed. He cares deeply about students' success and will meet you where you're at regarding subject matter and academic history.",
    "I simply wanted to learn about the subject, as such it was highly rewarding to be presented with more depth.",
    "I really didnt know what to expect",
    "It surpassed my expectations. I learned a great deal.",
    "ExcellentThis class really help me to build my understand logic of life.",
    "I expected an introduction to thinking about environment and society in a different way and this is what the course provided."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of the course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I believe the course provided a great base for necessary anthropological concepts for future real-world application. It was a great introduction to these concepts for people who have never had any experience with them. I cannot think of any real weaknesses regarding the course.",
    "Lectures for this course are finely tuned, interesting, and excellent resources for learning the course content. Readings are well selected and discussions are always engaging. The only thing I would change to improve the course is to include more peer to peer time for workshopping and discussing our final research papers.",
    "Strengths: Michael is an excellent lecturer. I looked forward to his lessons and to attending class each week. The final paper provided me the opportunities to develop my thesis and apply the concepts covered by the course. Wen (the course TF) was excellent. She was always available to answer questions and her insights added a lot to the class and to office hours. Karl Zimmerer was an excellent guest speaker. Weaknesses: The group discussions, which are led by students in the class, were frequently poorly led and not engaging. Frequently, the discussions felt like an opportunity for students to make statements about their own thoughts; disconnected from previous statements. I wished the discussions proceeded more like conversations. I would have liked more feedback on the three memos I submitted throughout the semester.",
    "I'd recommend bringing coffee and donuts to everything, but that's just me.",
    "Weakness Readings could be from a more diverse set of writers. We read a lot of stuff by middle aged white guys. Readings from guests lecturers were hit or miss. Discussions sometimes seemed rambling, or unfocused Strengths Relaxed environment, open intellectual inquiry was encouraged Great readings. good lectures. thoughtful selection of materials.",
    "It was well-organized.",
    "Very great!",
    "The readings in this course are excellent, as are the lectures. I would have liked to have notes from the lectures - it was difficult to get all of the fascinating ideas down on the page."

   "question_text": "What advice would you give to a student considering taking this class?",
   "comments": [
    "My advice to prospective students would be that they should take this course if they wish to have a more broad foundational base for future environmental management. It will definitely be intellectually challenging, but worth the new knowledge gained.",
    "This is one of the best classes I have ever taken, and has already been hugely influential in how I approach the rest of my studies and research at FES . If you are at all interested in the social sciences and critiquing conventional environmental discourses, do not miss out on it!",
    "This course is a big time commitment. Be prepared to do a lot of reading, and start working on your final paper early. Don't be turned off by Michael's approach of reading his lectures--he is really interesting, and not at all boring. Overall, I would definitely recommend this course.",
    "Take advantage of Prof. Dove's interest in students and learn from him.",
    "It's an astounding amount of depth provided at a rapid pace, as such it is best suited for those with experience and background in the field. From an outside perspective it's incredibly beneficial for the immersive quality of it, but can quickly leave one feeling submerged at points.",
    "It should be \"required\" to everyone.",
    "I would thoroughly recommend this course - it will change the way you think. The lecture style is quite dry but the content makes it worthwhile! Start early on the final paper. And Professor Dove really does allow you to write in any style that you want to."
