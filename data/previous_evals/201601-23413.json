   "comments": [
    "Our project was not focused, and changed throughout. We did not get to address a community need; rather, we were taught the way an academic systematic review and project should look, without considering our community partner.",
    "The projects are unique and quite interesting. However, I found myself frequently frustrated with the readings as I did not feel that they applied to my project. It became difficult to balance the needs of the final product versus what felt like random reading and assignments.",
    "Heard great things about the course so decided to take it. Strengths include practice-based research work and being able to work with a preceptor outside of YSPH to work on a project that provides another entity something real and worthwhile, being able to link academic tools with needs of organizations. Lots of work, a busy semester, but worthwhile course overall.",
    "I didn't really enjoy being in class though I did love working on my project. I don't know any way to mediate this though as you need to have class sessions. I guess it is just difficult with so many different projects happening.",
    "This class was very frustrating for me. Each week my group members and I felt that we were never making project. Deadlines were clearly laid out in the beginning of class however as the class continued those deadlines seemed to maneuver and more deadlines were added that we were unaware of. It was also frustrating because there was a lack of consistency between what our professor wanted each week. Each week it seemed as if the requirements of the assignment grew more and more and it became very difficult for our group to keep up.",
    "This is a well-conceived course that's great if you have the right group. It's a very difficult experience if you have the wrong group.",
    "Strengths- working with an actual community program and going through the process of practice-based research was super valuable and much more useful to my future career than any other class. Lots of guidance and support along the way. Areas of improvement: super theory-based at times, which can be frustrating when you want to get your hands dirty and actually start working with the program! Also a bit infantile at times, especially with the \"rapid assessments\" and requirement to submit a weekly report on the progress.",
    "This course gives me hands-on experience in conducting community health research.",
    "Great course, definitely my favorite at YSPH so far and the most useful course for applying skills learned in other courses in a real-world project. Only weaknesses stem from the need to fit easily a year's worth of work into one term, which is not an issue that would be feasible to change.",
    "Overall, I feel like I got a lot out of the course. It was very heavy on readings and assignments in the beginning, allowing us to focus on our projects for the second half of the semester. The readings were all from journals and tended to be very dry, but I think they're a better alternative to textbook readings that were used in previous years. The deadlines that Dr. Humphries gave allowed us to remain organized and get the project done little by little."

   "comments": [
    "Instructor: Debbie Lee Humphries \u00a0Didn't seem to understand or appreciate the massive amount of work we were doing each week.",
    "Instructor: Debbie Lee Humphries \u00a0Dr. Humphries is wonderful and can provide fantastic advice to guide the projects.",
    "Instructor: Debbie Lee Humphries \u00a0I really appreciate Debbie's mind. She is somewhat of a rare unicorn at YSPH - she thinks with a different conceptual framework from other faculty despite all of the work she is involved with at many different levels. Sometimes, it takes a little bit of conversation to find the same medium of communicating, but her thoughts are always insightful and meta. I appreciate that in a professor, because I think this strong sense of place and purpose is lost on some in academia. Debbie is very intentional as an instructor, in choosing topics and creating a full experience out of this course for students and project groups. Sometimes she can go off on tangents, or discussions in the course are common knowledge - however it is good to revisit these topics. I would love to see Debbie lead a larger, YSPH- wide discussion around some of the topics we discuss in class. I also really appreciate that in our last class, she took the time to gain critical and real feedback from students on ways to improve the course for the next year - I think this shows how intentional and caring she is with this course she teaches.",
    "Instructor: Debbie Lee Humphries \u00a0Debbie is a thoughtful, skilled teacher. I appreciated the way she engaged students not only in the class material but in the design of the course itself, giving students a sense of ownership. She was also extremely generous with her time outside of class when it was needed. She's one of the best professors I've encountered here.",
    "Instructor: Debbie Lee Humphries \u00a0Strengths- clearly very qualified and cares deeply about her students. Areas for improvement: I'd recommend a laptop-free class, except during worktime, to ensure that everybody is fully engaged. Would also recommend getting rid of rapid assessments.",
    "Instructor: Debbie Lee Humphries \u00a0Very good.",
    "Instructor: Debbie Lee Humphries \u00a0Very inspiring instructor. Always provides us with excellent feedback and suggestions for project progress. Introduced a ton of new and interesting material to the class.",
    "Instructor: Debbie Lee Humphries \u00a0Best professor at YSPH so far. Very engaged and responsive to issues or emails at all hours of the day. Supportive, but also committed to allowing students to work out issues on their own to truly learn the process and realities of community research projects.",
    "Instructor: Debbie Lee Humphries \u00a0Debbie was great! Always available to provide feedback and had great relationships with all of the groups."

   "comments": [
    "Be careful - I thought I was getting one thing and I got something completely different. Was not the community-engaged or focused experience I had hoped for.",
    "Take this course if want to learn more about practice-based learning. It can be a lot of work, but can be great if you are working with a strong working group. Depends on the project, preceptor, and who is in your group. I personally had wonderful experiences in my group. A ton of work especially towards the end of the semester, so be prepared for a heavy work load, but is a good balance to traditional methods courses.",
    "This class is a lot of learning on your own time and not in class. If you have a busy workload, you may want to refrain as in class time does not actually help with your assignments or final project.",
    "For the average MPH student, I would recommend this course with enthusiasm. My group was troubled and thus my experience was often frustrating and draining--but that is not at all representative of the experience for most of the class. For most MPH students, this is an extremely valuable experience. I would hesitate to recommend this class to a non-traditional student or PhD student. The course is designed for and rightfully belongs to more typical MPH students with less experience. That's not to say it isn't still a good experience, but I think a non-traditional student will feel out of place and may have trouble navigating group work without unintentionally dominating the team.",
    "A super intensive class that requires a ton of work, but results in a huge product that actually makes a difference. Take it if you're looking for a research-based project to put in your \"portfolio\"",
    "Community health research is an integral part of public health. I enjoyed the cooperation with a health organization and working in a team.",
    "Highly recommend.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to future students. This course requires intensive time commitment and a true interest in the assigned project, so I would recommend students take a realistic look at other time commitments prior to enrolling in this course. Definitely a course that all students should take before leaving YSPH.",
    "This course was very rewarding, and different from any other course I've taken in the past. We were able to work with a health district and produce a pretty valuable piece of work for them. I liked that the course had parts both in the classroom and outside of the classroom in a workplace."
