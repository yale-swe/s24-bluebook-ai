   "comments": [
    "This class is great in that there are no exams or quizzes or essays, only problem sets and class participation. Some of the problem sets were extremely difficult and required seeking help from the TA -- but both the TA and the professor were always very willing to help, so it was not too much of a problem. The lectures were often boring and did not include much cognitive science material (mostly just computational modeling material), but hopefully this willchange in future years. Take this class if you are interested in computational modeling, but if your interest is purely cognitive science related, be warned that you will probably be extremely bored.",
    "do not take unless you've played with programming somewhere at some point or have a programming buddy willing to help you out.grading was weekly pset only which might or might not be your cup of tea.great surveyinto various comp models. if you're into compsci, you won't get detail about implementing similar models to those discussed in class, its kind of cookie cutter. If you're into the linguistics (yes class is cogsci but domain is mostly linguistics, and that's fair since that's what the Professor is focused on.) you won't get too much about the specific mental faculty being mentioned, beyond its connection to the model being studied.Awesome course for a psych\/ling\/cogsci interested computer science person.",
    "I would not recommend this class. I LOVE cog sci and comp sci applications, but this class ended up being boring and I didn't learn as much programming as I had hoped. Other classes like Intelligent Robotics or Language and Computation covered the same material in a more interesting way. One good thing is all you do are problem sets (no exams), so your grade is highly dependent on your programming skills (which you will need!! Beginners, don't take this class).",
    "No. This class is completely disorganized. (The syllabus is muddled and hard to read. The deadlines are random and not regular.) The problem sets get tough, but luckily are the only source of work in the class. Attending class is not particularly helpful for getting through the problem sets, so there is a complete dissociation between what students are accountable for and what is presented in class. I felt that there was no expectation that you master any material (which at times I appreciated, since this class was quite easy at most times). But, when difficult, problem sets were very frustrating. All that said, Professor Frank is a really nice, sincere, accessible and enthusiastic guy. I would recommend him as a professor, but not this class in particular.",
    "So, hopefully this class will get a little better by the time you take it, but it's getting there. The class is in 3 parts-1 part prolog, 2 parts matlab (probability and learning). There are 8 problem sets and that's it. The problem sets are really really hard if you've never used matlab before, and there's no good way to get around that except to work really really hard on the problem sets until you figure out how to use matlab. Frustrating at times. But, the problem sets are fun, actually, and the material in them is interesting. There's no programming for the sake of programming--everything does something that teaches you about cog sci or modeling.The lectures are not so great. Bob Frank is wonderful, but this is just not his best. Lectures are kind of bland and you know in the back of your head that you're just going to have to tackle the problem set anyway (btw the wording in psets is unnecessarily complicated), so there's not a lot of motivation to listen. However, he is great at office hours, so go to class so you can at least take advantage of that with a clear conscience.So, hard but good problem sets. No midterm or final. Eh lectures. Great prof. Oh, and it gets better when you're done with prolog.Recommendation? Don't take this alone! make sure you know people and help get each other through. but it's worth a shot.",
    "The course is highly technical, with a strong linguistic programming course. It was difficult this term, so it may be worth taking credit-d. However, if you want to study cognitive modeling, it really gives you good hands on training with the programs used in the field, and the professor is very willing to talk with students. The syllabus coverage is also fairly broad, so most hot topics appear covered in some way.",
    "If you are a programmer, you will find the assignments reasonable. Otherwise they may kill you.I took this class having taken CPSC 201, 223, and 432 and found it to be an extremely interesting new angle on programming. If you're interested in linguistics, it's a great way to hone in on some serious research.",
    "This class was not how I had expected. There was a lot of fairly complex programming involved, but essentially none of the class time was devoted to teaching programming skills, so you basically had to figure out how to program and use new programming languages on your own. I would have also liked more of a connection to cognitive science concepts, as there was a lot of focus on equations where it was difficult to see how they related to the actual workings of the mind.",
    "Although the course did not have a programming prerequisite, it is HIGHLY recommended. If you go into this course without a well-established programming experience, the problem sets will be incredibly difficult, painful, and time-consuming. I think this class could be very rewarding if you have a good background in matlab and are familiar with programming strategies. However, I personally regret taking this class--I didn't have the background in it, and the psets regularly took up sometimes 20hrs a week."
