    "I really learned to write a history paper, which as a science student, I haven't had the opportunity to do before. I also learned both the facts of French history and Prof Merriman's perspective on everything, which really lent insight into each of the events.",
    "I learned so much in this class and absolutely loved it. Professor Merriman was amazing and provided so many new ways of looking at French history.",
    "Aside from the huge amount of knowledge I gained about French history, I developed skills in analyzing historical sources, and writing a true history paper.",
    "This course taught me a great deal about (gasp) the history of France since 1871. It did a nice job of filing in lots of common gaps in history.",
    "I learned a great deal about France. The research paper was the first I did, and was very exciting.",
    "A deeper understanding of France and its recent history.",
    "-Cultural History -Analysis of socio-political trends in relation to broader contexts",
    "I learned to explore French-language primary sources and about forces of resistance and collaboration in France.",
    "The oral exam at the end of the course is a good way to practice speaking skills and being able to talk about what you have learned.",
    "History research for paper writing. Excellent."

   "comments": [
    "Weaknesses are that Merriman goes off on many tangents. The tangents can be interesting but it makes hard to follow. There isn't a clear cut indication of what is being learned until the second half of the class.",
    "More structure, course taught chronologically instead of thematically",
    "Sometimes lectures were a little unclear and confusing because he often went off on tangents but other than that I thought the course was great and I liked that the final could be taken orally. I also liked the readings.",
    "Honestly I'm not sure what to say about this course. Professor Merriman is fantastic, but he generally is pretty disorganized and is not clear in lecture.",
    "Great course- a little more concrete facts in lecture would improve the course. Sometimes it feels like you only gain concrete facts from the reading.",
    "Great class. Merriman can ramble at times, but he is an interesting lecturer and a great guy. If you are looking to take the class, some of his lectures are online, so check them out if you are curious!",
    "Great course and very interesting! The only problem is that the lectures can get a bit confusing and out of topic.",
    "Professor Merriman is an incredible professor. He knows every detail about the subject and does a wonderful job of conveying his knowledge to the students. Can't think of any weaknesses!",
    "-Great diversity of learning methods -Lectures are lively, engaging, and fun",
    "The course was very detailed on material from 1871-1914, but not as much from 1945-the present.",
    "Prof. Merriman knows a lot about the subject material and is a generally brilliant historian but can be a difficult lecturer to follow. The TFs do an excellent job of clarifying any misunderstandings!",
    "I enjoyed lectures and the reading helped further my knowledge.",
    "No weaknesses. Excellent for enteral historical analysis.",
    "Great lecturer with an interesting subject matter. Prof Merriman is terrific in class and very approachable."

   "comments": [
    "I would 100% recommend this course to another student. You learn a lot, and it can be pretty entertaining sometimes, which in my opinion is the best way to learn about a dense subject.",
    "Absolutely! The material was fascinating, the TFs were great, and Professor Merriman had so much information to share.",
    "This is a great, engaging class. Professor Merriman is hilarious, and very passionate. I would definitely recommend it, and its not too overwhelming so it's great for non-history majors as well!",
    "This is a fine course. It is one of those history courses with both a final paper and a final exam, so be warned. Also the course is extremely backloaded, with novels almost every week after the midterm on top of the already heavy textbook reading. There are also mandatory film screenings, which require independent viewing if missed, and an additional 1-2 page reading response.",
    "Of course I would siggest this class to another student. It provides an excellent and insightful survey into French history. It became clear over the course of the class how relevant French history and thought is to our experience today.",
    "Fantastic class. Highly recommend.",
    "Great course! Information and lecture were very interesting but sometimes lecture felt a little all over the place. Would recommend for a chill course.",
    "Absolutely. I learned so much, and grew as a student.",
    "Definitely! Professor Merriman is a lot of fun and knows a lot about the subjet. However, I would also advice to take the first part of the course first.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. The subject is interesting, and learning about it from an expert like Professor Merriman is an opportunity that should not be passed up. The films we watched were interesting and entertaining, and the readings (although long at times) were actually enjoyable.",
    "The course is a good introduction to post-1871 French history, and the readings are interesting, but the lectures can seem haphazard.",
    "Yes",
    "A good fifth class, but be careful because the work piles up at the end of the semester with reading, movies, and the paper. Professor Merriman is entertaining, but his lectures are often disorganized.",
    "Yes I would recommend this course to another student who wants to learn more about French history.",
    "Yes!",
    "Take as many courses with professor Merriman as you can.",
    "I would recommend this course."
