   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this readings course to other students, as a helpful overview of the current historiography of American religious history.",
    "Yes. Good selection of readings",
    "RLST 705 is a great base-reading seminar for those interested in becoming future historians. Many of the readings offered in the course are seminal readings in the field, which forever impacted it (Perry Miller's New England Mind, for instance). I would most certainly recommend the course because it offers a unique chance to truly take part in a graduate level READING seminar, where one will most certainly hone his or her reading and comprehension abilities with 200-400 pages per week.",
    "Very useful class that struck a great balance between historical inquiry and religious analysis. Particularly useful for other historians who often may not think to integrate religious history into their overall picture of American history.",
    "Would definitely reccommend: a small, congenial seminar exploring different historical concerns in some of the best scholarship in American religious history."

   "comments": [
    "I was hoping the course would have had more engagement in the 19th century. However, the historical methods utilized in the chosen text offered valuable tools for my own research, and so I was grateful for the increase in knowledge.",
    "The readings provided valuable context for my research project.",
    "This course introduced me to many writers who I had referenced previously but never read entirely. Harry Stout's interventions on each text based off of his notes and his memory serve as proper critical evaluations of text.",
    "Provided a solid overview of American religious history for a student new to the topic. Too early to say whether or not the course will impact my personal research but it introduced me to several crucial questions and texts that will be useful moving forward."
