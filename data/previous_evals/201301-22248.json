    "You'll discuss business ethics in a number of different fields.",
    "YES! The guests are AMAZING. The format of the course is great. And you discuss some really interesting questions. One of my favorite classes at Yale.",
    "if you get a thrill from hearing successful businessmen discuss how they got their then this class is for you. however, this class will probably be different than when i took it since vikram mansharamani will be teaching instead of charley ellis. with charley as professor, discussions were inconsistent from class to class: sometimes they were intellectually stimulating and fun, other times discussion was non-existent; sometimes specifics of business operations were paramount with little discussion of ethics, sometimes ethics was paramount with so little discussion of the practical business background that discussion faltered. vikram will most likely promote more active discussion on a regular basis, based on my experience taking another of his classes.workload is moderate: 1-page reading responses, moderate reading, 1 long final paper (20pgs+)",
    "Yes, for meeting really cool speakers and going to lots and lots of Mory's dinners!",
    "Yes, very engaging course which anyone considering a career in business should take. Will teach you things that no other Yale course can."
