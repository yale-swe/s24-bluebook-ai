    "It gives an overview of cultural anthropology",
    "I would highly recommend taking Intro Cultural Anthropology, even if you aren't interested in anthropology as a major. We cover a wide range of material that really forces you to look at the world in a different way. The assignment are actually really fun and allow you to interact with your friends and the Yale community. Most of the reading is very interesting and very manageable. You'll have several anthropologists from varying backgrounds who have done very interesting things in their careers talk to you. The professor is great and it's an overall fun and interesting class! Not too much stress, but you'll still get a lot out of it!",
    "1) Great overview of cultural anthropology, with a bigger history component than I anticipated, but one that really adds to the class. 2) With a couple exceptions, the readings are fascinating. The class would be worth if for the reading list alone. 3) You definitely need to go to lecture to understand the distinctions between the theories and concepts and how they relate to your readings. 4) Prof. Lombard is great at tying the readings to the real world, and many of the assignments encourage you to look at Yale culture in particular in new and exciting ways. 5) You learn the foundational methodologies of ethnographic study and research, and get to try them out yourself. 6) The format of the lectures via Prezi was actually really awkward, but has a lot of potential. Could be great if more thought is placed into thinking about how to navigate the Prezi format. What does Prezi add that PowerPoint can't do? 7) The periodic inclusion of working anthropologists was an exciting way to see how these methodologies and ways of thinking are applicable outside of academia.",
    "ANTH 110 01 is a good introductory course that lays a foundation in anthropological concepts and leaders in the field. I would definitely recommend the course to another student even if they were not pursuing a degree in anthropology.",
    "This class allowed me to \"visit\" different regions of the world by simply reading about and learning about groups of people in such regions. The one thing I would change about this course is the length of the midterm and final exams. Given that we had 50 minutes for each exam, I always found myself always rushing through the exam (which may not have allowed me to put forth the best quality work because I was more concerned with answering every question).",
    "Cultural anthropology is one of the best introductory courses that I've taken at Yale. Even though it spans from the beginnings of anthropology to the present, I felt that I really learned a lot about the field of anthropology in general. The ethnographic assignments, of which there are 5, are easy to do well on but really interesting and even fun! They get you out of the library talking to your peers about culture at Yale, helping you to understand the \"Yale Worldview.\" A fairly easy, but very rewarding class!",
    "Not a very hard class, but you don't feel like you aren't learning, because you are learning a lot!",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. It is interesting and not too difficult for an intro course. Louisa is an excellent lecturer with interesting TAs who are very involved in the class. It is an interesting course especially for students considering social science majors, as it goes well with those topics.",
    "Anth 110 is like a history class about Sociocultural Anthropology. You learn what it is about and then you learn how it has changed through the lectures and the readings. You have ethnographic assignments that try to get you to think more about the theories you learn.",
    "Great intro anthropology class.",
    "I do not think I would urge another student to take this class. The painfully strong focus on associating individual anthropologists with their particular ideas detracted from the study of anthropology a field. I learned far more about the history of the science than I did about the subject it ostensibly studies.",
    "Interesting introduction to cultural anthropology. Not too demanding, and all of the readings will keep you engaged."
