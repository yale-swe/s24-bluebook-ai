   "comments": [
    "Take it if you have an honest interest in reading Ancient Near Eastern texts.",
    "I would recommend this class... if you don't need to get your papers back... ever. But it's a great class, and totally worthwhile if you don't mind being left in the dark! I would definitely take a different class with Professor Slanski, and highly recommend any class that she might teach.",
    "Take this class for Professor Slanski. The readings are also incredible, but she is the perfect balance of brilliant and reasonable. Her class is relaxed, but stimulating, and you really get to take advantage of Yale's incredible Babylonian collection and learn far more than what you read from the syllabus. One complaint: She was not the best at getting our essays back to us - i.e. one's that we wrote in October - but I honestly think that is largely because she puts so much time and thought into her comments, and if you ever need to meet with her, she's available. Take!",
    "This is my favorite class at Yale. Highly recommend.",
    "Interesting readings and discussions! Professor Slanski made the sessions very enjoyable and rewarding.",
    "Take this class if you want to learn about Mesopotamia! Great readings, great professor - totally approachable and flexible if you have a lot of work.",
    "An incredible course and hidden gem that I am so glad I was able to experience. Professor Slanski and my fellow students offered insight that made discussions thrilling. We were able to visit the West Campus Conservatory to examine a Roman shield from Dura Europos, as well as made a trip to the MET! The readings drew not simply from Mesopotamian and Ancient Near Eastern Literature, but from the Bible and Classical works as well.",
    "Awesome way to branch out and learn about the Near East.",
    "ABSOLUTELY TAKE IT. If you have any love for Mesopotamia, classics, or literature, this is an amazing class to take-- fun discussion and a super reasonable workload."
