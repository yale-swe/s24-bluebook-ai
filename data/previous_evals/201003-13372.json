   "comments": [
    "This was an exceedingly challenging course for me as I've never taken a similar class. However, it was very well taught and interesting. I can see the utility of the methods taught for basically everyone as they move on with their careers.",
    "Great class - one of the few where I actually feel like I learned something that I can definitely use. Dr. Paltiel was great and very entertaining. The only recommendation that I have for the tests would be to provide a choice of questions (choose 3 out of 4 or something). Sometimes it is easy to get stuck on a problem, especially when they are complicated.",
    "Very applicable information. Great classes",
    "Great! Very helpful and useful, brings a different aspect. Combining epi and business management well. Good introductory course if you haven't had any cost-effective analysis classes before.",
    "strength: great introduction to the topic. you feel like you are learning a lot even though it is only held once a week.no weaknesses!",
    "Finally a course where I learned a practical skill!!! At least I got my money's worth in 1 YSPH class in 2 years...I liked that the weekly homeworks were not due for credit.",
    "This course is great. I wishthere were more classes in the department like this one.No suggestions for improvement. The only suggestion I would have for the department would be to offer more classes in this particular subject.",
    "Strength:clear show of the methodology;Relavant cases were used;Cases are focus on key problems happened in practice.Weeknesses:Class hour is no enough for show more methodology in detail",
    "Strengths: Good use of classesv2 to upload all necessary course materials, helpful to have a note taker so you aren't worried about copying everything in lectures. I enjoyed the flexibility of a take home midterm and final.Weaknesses: Textbook did not seem too helpful, perhaps far beyond the scope of this course. Assigned pdf readings were more helpful and much easier to read\/learn from.",
    "The course was good and learning quality definitely improved when the professor began providing course materials before class.",
    "Great course. the professor will warn you that this primarily a teach yourself course and he's not kidding around. You will do a lot of the learning on your own. He's a fun prof, though and the material is interesting.The book SUCKS. Sucks. Even if you read it word for word, it's not a helpful teacher. Find a new one or don't recommend a book in general. Just not a helpful resource.",
    "I thought the course was valuable in that it taught a set of skills that were directly applicable in the health care setting. I actually think that graded, group cases would be preferable to the no-graded status of the cases. It would allow\/force students to learn from each other and would force students to prepare before coming to class as to avoid some sidetracking in class to address concerns of students who had not prepared. I would havebeen happier if the course moved faster and we got more in depth into the applications of cost effectiveness analysis.",
    "It is an interesting course, the optional homeworks are very useful and completing them before class and then going over them in class is the ideal set-up. The book was not very useful. I really appreciated all the healthcare-related examples and thought that the tests were very fair. The only con was that there were several occasions where we did not go over the cases in class. Even 5-10 minutes going over the strategy would have been helpful.",
    "The class is very good and frankly I feel like Prof. Paltiel is very aware of the quality of his course and the student feedback. Overall, tIt's a great course.PROS------ Material is extremely interesting and the problem sets are fun.- Very easy to understand what material you are reponsible for.- Prof. Paltiel is fun and engaging.- Posted slides, notes, and Excel spreadsheets were very helpful.CONs------- I admit I didn't use the textbook that much, but when I did (early on) it was not helpful at all.- While it was great to get some of the basic down, it would have been nice to have more opportunities to get more in-depth. It'd be fun to have more \"challenges\" in addition to the Cases (e.g. How much would you pay to see a 3rd coin flip? or Do a PSA analysis of the 3 drug strategies. They could be optional but the material is just so fun and interesting I would have liked to do more than just the basic decision trees and incremental CEA (and to prempt the Professor's response, I would have loved to but was unable to take Policy Modeling.- I know he's gone back and forth but I think the Cases should be graded Pass\/Fail based on effort (which essentially means automatic pass if you at least look at it). It would have created an incentive for me to do them the couple of weeks where I didn't look at the cases beforehand.",
    "The description of the class did not prepare students for what was ahead. should include in description that class is probability based and not based on real life events. Also, should inform students that a good understanding of EXCEL is required for the course. Need more practice problems and more feedback throughout the course. Guest speaker was the best part of the class. Pace of class was too fast.",
    "Very useful information, lectures were interesting and had obvious real-world implications, homework assignments were good preparation for the lecture",
    "Strengths: All materials are posted on ClassesV2, which is wonderful. Lectures are good. Cases are great.Weaknesses: none really... didn't like that class was held in the evening",
    "Great course - perhaps include more of a business application.",
    "The course was wonderful; I only wish there were more formalized interaction possibilities between instructor and student: either through graded assignments or structured office hours.",
    "I found the second half of the class much more useful than the first.The text really sucked. I used to have to read paragraphs multiple times to understand what they were saying. Did not have nearly enough worked examples in the text or in class. I would suggest creating a packet with steps or a recipe on how to perform various functions. This would be really helpful for those less mathematically inclined.",
    "This was a very interesting course and very practical.",
    "Great course. Dr. Paltiel is an amazing lecturer and explains material very clearly. The pace of the class is kind of slow (depending on your schedule is a good or bad thing), but I got a lot out of it.",
    "As I have been interested in cost-effectiveness and decision making since before I come to Yale, I decided to take the course. Fortunately, it turned out my choice was perfect as now I am satisfied with the course. The course was intriguing itself. I am sure that the knowledge I learned through the course would be quite useful when I am working. The take-home examinations properly tested students' ability to apply what they learned at the class, too.",
    "The course is useful. I'm interested in it.",
    "I really loved this class. I'm not one who usually likes statistics or quantitative-type classes, but this class was really interesting and David makes it really fun. My only suggestion for improvement would be to post past years' midterms and finals to give students an idea of what to expect.",
    "Great overviewVery helpful for current career in medicineEnjoy learning about cost effectiveness -- now not just a \"black box\" and \"buzz word\"",
    "Great course! I came out with a definite skill set and I now feel confident in performing cost effective analysis and decision-making.Biggest weakness was that our grade was 50% midterm and 50% final. I think that homework should count as part of a grade, using a \"check\" system and giving credit if students made an effort on the assignment.",
    "Should have had mandatory assignments to turn in",
    "Awesome professor, awesome class",
    "Fabulous, very useful",
    "better organization of the course is needed",
    "Great course",
    "This was a great course. It was nice to actually learn something practical instead of the same inane policy debates we suffer through in other classes. We developed skills!The course was entertaining and worthwhile. However, it seemed a bit slow, especially during the second half."

He was also very open to suggestions from students on ways to improve the course along the way (e.g. he included more lectures on the practical applications of the course material, and started posting lecture slides before lectures as requested by some of the students). Very good course.",

    "Instructor: A David Paltiel \u00a0Terrific. David's passion for the subject and love of seeing us put the pieces together over the semester is so much fun. He's a fantastic professor.",
    "Instructor: A David Paltiel \u00a0Professor Paltiel was a very personable and enthusiastic instructor. Although he stresses that his course involves a lot of self-teaching, I felt that I learned a lot from his lectures. He definitely did not have any weaknesses. It is obvious he has taught this course many times, since there does not appear to be any kinks to work out.",
    "Instructor: A David Paltiel \u00a0rich experiences in teaching and research",
    "Instructor: A David Paltiel \u00a0Overall an excellent and engaging professor. Did a good job of keeping our interest at a night class and took care to walk students through case studies. Tried his best to ensure no student left the lecture feeling confused.",
    "Instructor: A David Paltiel \u00a0Very engaging. He makes a complex topic very interesting and easy to follow.",
    "Instructor: A David Paltiel \u00a0Not a bad thing to say. He is funny, smart, gives a shit about students and eager to get students involved in various types of his work. Was of the best professors I've had here at Yale.",
    "Instructor: A David Paltiel \u00a0Paltiel is great. He knows the material well, but could probably prepare a bit more for classes, addresses student questions when necessary and tells students to hold questions when he thinks they slow up class. I think that this course was easily the best in terms of time management that I've had at YSPH.",
    "Instructor: A David Paltiel \u00a0It is enjoyable to go to class, he tries to address mid-semester feedback - which is nice, and he also presents some of his own research which was generally interesting, especially to see the practical applications of what we were learning in class. He is also a pretty entertaining instructor.",
    "Instructor: A David Paltiel \u00a0Great, fun guy. He made class very laid-back and informal. High-energy and engaging which was great.",
    "Instructor: A David Paltiel \u00a0funny, but sometimes rude.",
    "Instructor: A David Paltiel \u00a0Dr. Paltiel is one of the best teachers in public health. He's very energetic, knowledgeable, he's published and gets interviewed by newspapers for the work he does. It's a pleasure to be in his class because he obviously takes pride in his teaching.",
    "Instructor: A David Paltiel \u00a0Prof Paltiel is great - he really listens to students and wants to make the course useful and enjoyable. He also has organized the course well. It's awesome to hear about his work in cost-effectiveness\/decision analysis. I like the cases he assigned. Exams were fair. He also is NEVER boring during lecture.",

    "Instructor: A David Paltiel \u00a0Excellent professor.",
    "Instructor: A David Paltiel \u00a0Above all, he was such an amuzing instructor during the class. And he also knew how to make the class, which at first might sound hard and difficult, more interesting and easy to understand. As a result, I even felt that I was playing with him and other students for two hours per week with absorbing, relevant examples throughout the semester. Furthermore, he was also concerned about the feedback on his class, and after getting it from the students, readily changed the way he was used to. Throughout the final exam period, he took some time to clearly explain what I didn't get duringthe course via email, even though he was quite busy right after coming back from Paris. I appreciate that.",
    "Instructor: A David Paltiel \u00a0He is full of energy and lively. This course only has mid-term and final-term exams. The professor said if you could understand the material and answered the case questions, you can skip the class. I like that. I study hard. I got a score more than 90 at mid-term exam.He tries to provide us real cases. He wins my respect.",

    "Instructor: A David Paltiel \u00a0Very good instructor.",
    "Instructor: A David Paltiel \u00a0FANTASTIC professor. He is entertaining and engaging and somehow managed to promote psychological safety in the classroom so nobody felt stupid speaking up or asking questions. Also, he had a survey mid-class, which was great. He is constantly on the lookout for feedback. I can't say that about all my professors."

He pulled out his homework from the following year (the first time he had looked at the material in a year) and still had no idea what was going on. Another student who had also come for help was able to remind him what was going on but then he proceeded to give multiple incorrect answers to questions on how to perform various techniques and had to be continually corrected by the other student who again was himself seeking help. I never went back to a TA session.",

I struggled in the first half of the semester but believe that I finished on a strong note. I would highly recommend that anyone who is feeling slightly strained by the material to see the TA early as the midterm is killer.

Work load wasn't too bad, it was decently analytical but nothing mindblowing. Overall it was a good course because it was pretty distinct from most courses I have taken at YSPH.",
