    "Honestly if you're interested in learning Chinese, this is the best way to do it. The teachers are great, and while it's a lot of work, you will definitely come out of it with a much better understanding of a very difficult and confusing language.",
    "I RECOMMEND THIS CLASS!! If you've taken CHNS 110, it's basically exactly the same thing, but the second semester. The same amazing teachers, the same considerable workload, the same tangible results. I feel like I've become sooo much better at Chinese from this class, and if you want to do the Light Fellowship you absolutely must take this class as an intro Chinese speaker. The teachers are so good I just can't articulate this enough - there's five and they switch off on a schedule, but it never feels disjointed in the least. I also love that the class size is very small; with only 6 kids in my section, we got the individual attention that we really needed. At this point, after L1 Chinese, I honestly stopped thinking about Chinese as something with an intense workload because it's so thoroughly embedded in my schedule and my college experience. You'll probably get there, too. I don't complain or talk about how hard Chinese is anymore because it's just a part of my life.",
    "A good challenge, well worth it",
    "Definitely continue with L2 Chinese - it's well worth your time and pays off hugely. The Chinese department here moves at breakneck speed, but you learn so much!",
    "Efficient and well taught course that excels at imparting a comprehensive understanding of the language. I highly recommend it.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class! It is very well taught and grading is very fair and transparent. All the laoshi are amazing and they will keep you on your toes at all times. This class is very intense and you will have to devote a lot of time to it, but it is ultimately very rewarding. One tip about learning Chinese is to take advantage of Chinese table where you'll get to practice Chinese with teachers and classmates in a relaxing setting as well as get to know other Chinese teachers."
