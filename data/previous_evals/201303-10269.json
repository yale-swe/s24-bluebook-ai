   "comments": [
    "This course begins fairly reasonably-paced, but the work really picks up as the semester goes on, and the topics become increasingly difficult to understand. The fact that Lie Groups is a graduate level topic (that Howe admirably makes accessible to undergrads) increases the difficulty, because it is hard to look for other undergraduate-level resources to help one's understanding. The topic is very interesting, however, with many applications to physics and other areas of math.",
    "Yes I would recommend it to anyone who's interested in algebra and groups."
