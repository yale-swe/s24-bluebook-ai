    "Preparing and working with fossil and museum collections.",
    "I gained a deep and profound understanding of the process of fossil and specimen preparation. The class covered casting, lab and field preparation, removal of matrix, cataloging, tracking, adhesives, and destructive sampling. This class led me to develop a comprehensive understanding of vertebrate paleontology.",
    "I learned so many practical skills about how to manage collections in general and how to work with paleontology specimens specifically. While these skills were directly applicable to museum work, I also found the critical thinking skills we practiced applicable to other disciplines as well."

    "This is the best class I've taken. Labs are spent doing hands-on work with actual fossils and learning how to mold and treat fossils. Virtually no workload outside of class and one short final assignment. Great teacher who is enthusiastic, knowledgeable and great to work with.",
    "Practical Paleontology is the single best lab I've taken at Yale. This course is the epitome of a good lab course. This course covers the material comprehensively and clearly. We performed carefully planned and exquisitely prepared exercises. The course covers everything about the preparation of fossils. Anyone who is mildly interested in fossils or geologic preparation will enjoy this class taught in the world-class Yale Peabody Museum.",
    "As someone who wants to work in natural history museums, this course was an excellent, hands-on way to learn a lot of valuable skills relevant to collection management. Class was always fun and engaging, and Marilyn is very knowledgable and happy to answer all kinds of questions."
