   "comments": [
    "A must take.",
    "A survey of political economy that offers approaches that can be used in any of the other subfields. I would recommend this class to anybody who has an interest in the approach of economics.",
    "This course has a heavy reading load but light writing load. We read the core literature for a variety of political economy topics, from more general to more specific as the course went on. I would recommend to another student.",
    "Hell yeah I would. If they wanna learn about the world around them and become a smarter person then yeah, they should take this course.",
    "Though the core subject matter is somewhat narrower, I would describe CPE as an overview of political science insofar as the gamut of methods, theories, and substantive emphases core to the discipline are touched upon. With the possible exception of theorists, I would absolutely recommend CPE to any student interested in empirical social science.",
    "The readings were often heavy and dry. That said, they felt like eating your vegetables for anyone who wants to study political economy--the content was worthwhile, and class discussions really helped pull out the main points, so that even if I had felt confused while reading a text, I felt like I had gotten something out of it by the end. Overall, the course is very enjoyable and useful. I would recommend it to anyone with an interest in political economy, without regard for economics or methods training.",
    "I would whole-heartedly recommend CPE to any student interested in political economy. It covers the whole range of political economy topics, and does a great job linking the literature to current events.",
    "A fast paced and comprehensive survey of the main topics in comparative political economy and political economy more broadly. Frances is magnificent as a teacher and as a researcher. Take it."

   "comments": [
    "Indispensable.",
    "I think this course pointed me to a few puzzles that span the subfields.",
    "This was my first political science course, and I learned a lot about how these types of courses operate and what the CPE literature is. This course gave me a lot of ideas about my research question and how to frame that question.",
    "I now am confident in my ability to link my substantive interests into the canon of political economy, and to feel firmly situated in existing literature. I read a few papers in this class that will greatly shape how I approach problems in my own field. Delving into PE helps demystify what seems like an opaque and obscure subfield."
