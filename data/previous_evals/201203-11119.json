    "This was a great course in a slow reading of Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics. Do not expect to be exposed to any interpretations of Aristotle, as the course focuses solely on the primary source material.Keep in mind, also, that since this course is taught from the law school, there isn't necessarily a high level of prior exposure to philosophy or classical philosophy more specifically amongst the student group.",
    "I would recommend it to a certain kind of student, but I don't think it was the ideal course for a student wanting to do critical academic work on Aristotle's ethics. It felt at times more like a course in happy living, which is tremendously valuable, but is not what many people would expect upon entering the course.",

    "It definitely deepened my knowledge of Aristotle. I do think it will contribute to my future research, but mostly as an important introduction to the text."
