    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student, but you really should have some background in studying Christianity if you're going to take it.",
    "Gnostic Religion and Literature is a fascinating, if niche, course. Prof. Layton is perhaps the leading American scholar in this field, and a sharp teacher and discussion leader. Seeming givens of literature courses, like \"coming out with a greater understanding of the texts studied\" to \"having a better sense of the artistry involved in great world literature,\" are by no means givens here, though: Gnostic literature is (intentionally!) riddlesome, and papers felt just as much like attempts at decoding as endeavors in analytical thinking. Overall, a fine course.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone interested in religion as it is a particular branch of Christianity that is not often explored.",
    "Really interesting class that makes you think about Christianity in a new way. The course uses only primary texts translated by the professor himself.",
    "Excellent course for gaining familiarity with an oft-misrepresented and poorly defined group of texts.",
    "If you're at all interested in gnosticism and want to spend a semester reading wacky, fragmented, and beautiful texts from nearly two thousand years ago, then this is the course for you. The workload is perfectly reasonable, the class discussions for the most part are fascinating, and it's a golden opportunity to learn from someone who knows as much about the subject as anyone else in the world (plus he translated all the texts you read, so you can ask him anything you want about the originals). I really love Professor Layton. He's brilliant but incredibly humble - I've heard of dozens of famous professors who try to foist their views upon you, but Prof Layton's main goal is to get you to think original thoughts. He continually tells you to ignore his own footnotes and offers his opinions merely as suggestions.Cons: the readings and discussions can get repetitive; if you want factual information and clear answers, then you may get frustrated - there's a great deal of bewilderment and scratching of heads; I found the papers very difficult to write, but they worked out in the end; if your interest is only of the \"that sounds kind of cool\" variety, then at some point in the term you'll probably start asking yourself why you're devoting so much time to this."
