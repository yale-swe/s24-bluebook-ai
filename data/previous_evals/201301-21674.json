    "A great class for a formal introduction to music theory. Easier if you'd had some musical experience (playing an instrument, singing), but still manageable if not. A fun, different class. If you're interested in the topic, definitely take this class. Not too much work--homework can be tedious at times, but not to strenuous.",
    "Absolutely recommend this class. Had a great time learning about basic music theory. This class has a different tone than other classes at Yale. It was extremely interesting and we got the chance to compose our own songs.",
    "If you have any interest at all in learning the explanations behind what you hear in music, take this class! It's a wonderful introductory course: not insanely difficult, even for beginners, but certainly not simple, especially towards the end of the class, with Roman numeral analysis and chord progressions. There are also a few simple compositions, but no one will judge--I'd never composed before, but enjoyed the process, and even wasn't reluctant about performing it in class, because Kamala and my fellow students werevery supportive. Speaking of which: if you do take this course, take it with Kamala! Her explanations are wonderful, her side notes are very interesting, and she's overall one of the friendliest and most accessible teachers I've had this year.",
    "This is an introductory music theory class, so if you know music theory already, think about taking 205 or 210! That being said, I really enjoyed this class. There were times that the material got a little dull (because it's beginner music theory), but I was never overwhelmed by the work or difficulty of the class. If you are looking for a way to be introduced to music theory, whether you play an instrument or not, this is the class for you!",
    "It might be a little easy for anyone who already has some background in music, but for beginners, it's a really great course to take.",
    "Yes! If you want to learn more about music or are just looking for a fun, easy class, take this one! You learn a lot and you have a blast doing it.",
    "This course is an introduction to music theory. I'd recommend that other students take it!",
    "Yes, it's great but a little challenging for novices."
