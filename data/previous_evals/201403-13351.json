    "Yes, yes, yes. This is one of the best classes I've taken at Yale, a true hidden gem. It will change not only your knowledge of world events, but also how you think about them moving forward. The readings are novels, which on the whole I found really captivating and thought-provoking (and dare I say fun?). Of course you're not going to love every single book, but you get to choose which ones to write about. 3 short papers and a take-home final essay, no formal exams or memorization of names\/dates. I am a science major and it was really manageable, the TF's were great and very helpful if history is not your usual thing. Seriously, everyone needs to take this course.",
    "I would wholeheartedly recommend this course! It was difficult and quirky in approach (examining novels as historical sources), but by far the most interesting and thought provoking I took this semester! I also recommend taking Matt's section! Any class with Magaziner seems like it would incredibly enriching and worthwhile - he really puts a lot of time into lectures and meetings with students.",
    "This class was incredible. Professor Magaziner is definitely one of the best lecturers at yale. He really cares about his students. Given the material, the class is organized well. The only issue was the final take home exam, which was a pretty ridiculous amount of work. Definitely take the class but maybe consider taking it credit\/d. One of the top three classes that I've taken in my time here.",
    "I WOULD SUMMARIZE THIS CLASS AS A MUST TAKE CLASS THAT GIVES YOU AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE ON AFRICA, COLONIALISM, AND GLOBALISM. Thus far, it is the best class I have taken at Yale. I genuinely looked forward to going to lecture every day, and I would have been devastated to miss even a single lecture.",
    "HIST 332 is a great class. I would definitely recommend it if you have the time and energy to devote to it! It really is a lot of work, but worth it if you work hard. If you do end up taking it, a few tips: use the lecture outlines when taking notes! Paste them into a word document and fill in relevant information under each section. Also, not everything that Professor Magaziner says needs to be in your notes! So listen and chose what to include, otherwise your fingers won't be able to keep up. Lastly, the take home final is a lot of work, so make sure you have time in your finals schedule to do it!",
    "This is a really interesting and wide-scoping class, and I would highly recommend. It's pretty reading intensive, but very edifying to pull the material together in writing the papers.",
    "This is the best course I have taken in Yale College. This is the result of a lot of factors, including one of the most eloquent lecture professors I've ever experienced, knowledgeable teaching fellows, a wealth of paradigm-shifting material that was new to me, and a syllabus full of intense, beautiful African literature. I hope more students choose to take this course, as it will open their eyes to new ways of understanding our world - especially parts of our world forever altered by colonialism - but even more basically because taking a class that is so self-critical of the historiographical, academic, economic, and sociopolitical structures within which we exist should be a requisite for any serious student, and really any serious human being.",
    "This class is a LOAD of work. Too much. DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS CREDIT D. It is a great course if you want to learn about Afica\/ Colonialism but there is so much work that you better be committed.",
    "This class is an introduction to colonialism in Africa. The interesting twist about the class is that we read novels written by African writers and try to parse out some historical significance from them. I would definitely recommend this class but be warned that it is A LOT of reading. There are only 3 short papers but the take-home final was absurdly long (two 7-page papers and six paragraph-long short answers). Overall though, the workload is not overwhelming and the lectures were great! Professor Magaziner was a really engaging and enthusiastic lecturer.",
    "This course is a History of Africa's colonization and independence struggles. Africa is a massive continent with countries that have distinct histories, and it is very much apart of major world events (WWI, WWI, the Cold War, Women's Rights Movements, Civil Rights Movement) despite the America-centric history of the continent we always get (which, to be clear, is practically none besides the slave trade). You will learn how Africa interacted with the World from the late 18th Century through to Modern Day, and how many European powers had a significant hand in subverting and destroying culture for economic purposes (thereby causing the social unrest and perceptions of barbarism that many people know Africa to be). You will also learn about the key individuals who fought to bring their respective nations back under African control, and the various struggles of nation building resultant from a legacies of colonialism.",
    "Absolutely take it! Great course, great readings, great professor. Take!",
    "Great course and great professor. Reading the novels was fun. Lectures are great. Take this.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class! Professor Magaziner is a great lecturer and very cool person in general, and the use of novels instead of history textbooks is a unique, different way to approach history. Also, novels are a lot easier and more entertaining to read than history textbooks, which I really appreciated. This class isn't a terrible amount of work, and it's a really engaging, relevant topic taught by a great professor, so I don't know what more you're looking for in a class. Take it!",
    "Definitely take African Encounters with Colonialism. The class is amazing and will help you think in different ways. It will hopefully change your perspective a bit in how you think about Africa, or at least give you more insight into its history (side note though women need to be more incorporated into lectures not just supplemental reading). The readings were great--the novels were at the least interesting, but the supplemental reading was terrible and you won't do it just accept it now. Although the class was great, the take home final was absolutely awful--it's essentially the length of a seminar paper. And the questions were not the best--one of them essentially asking you to summarize what happened in the past 200 years of African history. EXCUSE ME. If any history classed asked me that, not just one on Africa, I would have a serious issue answering. But that question was like a slap in the face at the end of the class because it felt like it undermined one of the large themes of the class which was that you can't really condense Africa's history into one narrative, and you can't just talk about Africa like there is one story because there are a bajillion conflicting threads. Perhaps that was the point because writing it was incredibly difficult. That being said, even though the final was rough, having come out on the other side, it's still worth it. It's a gem of a class and you will definitely enjoy it whether or not you are a history major.",
    "This class was amazing. I learned SO much about things I had never heard of before. Magaziner is an incredible lecturer (like a \"didn't-look-at-food-porn-once-even-though-it's-almost-lunch lecturer) and always comes to class very prepared. But, be warned, the class has a heavy workload. You read a novel a week (African literature, which is another really cool part of the course) but you also lowkey have a ton of \"supplemental\" (read: mandatory) reading to do. The \"take home final\" turned out to be two 7+ page essays and IDs that had to incorporate readings from all parts of the class as well as lectures, which was pretty hard to manage on top of other finals and papers. Don't let that deter you though, the class is totally worth it and is so awesome.",
    "Reasonable class with a great lecture and lots of disturbing images. Set up with super reasonable spread out expectations except the take home final which no one said would be 16 pages!",
    "Absolutely take this class. You will never be bored. And, the material will actually affect the ways that you think about many things. This is a very human centered class. And, I think that this will be one of the few classes I have taken at Yale where I'll remember the lessons after having taken the final.",
    "A very well-taught course that is different from many other history classes at Yale. You don't necessarily get a very in-depth history of every country, and many (understandably) are left off the syllabus, but you get an introduction to the colonial histories of many countries and leaders in Africa, as well as themes that tie them together. The use of novels in the class is also extremely interesting and rewarding. Magaziner is a story-teller in class, and it makes lectures very interesting. I would definitely recommend taking!",
    "No, honestly the lectures are the most worthwhile part of the class and everything else (readings, section, assignments) are poorly organized and you'll get nothing out of them. Consider auditing or credit\/d.",
    "African Encounters with Colonialisms is a fantastic history seminar. I think most of the class entered with very little knowledge of African history, and left with an enormous amount (and a newfound interest!). Lectures are very engaging and informative. Each week the class reads one novel, which is discussed in weekly section. The workload is manageable but reading heavy, and grading is fairly strict.",
    "I knew nothing about the African continent before taking this class, and now I feel like I have the knowledge and context to really start to understand what colonialism did to Africa, and where it is now. The work for the class was a novel a week, with one or two supplemental papers. We had two mid-term papers, four or five pages long. The final exam was take-home, six (long) paragraphs of ID-like work and two seven-page papers (yup, more work than the entire rest of the semester). If you're a non-major like me, but still want to get a handle on the issues that Africa has faced and continues to face, take this class! Magaziner is a fantastic lecturer, and you get a lot out of that and the readings.",
    "Great class! Please take it if you want a great overview of African colonialism. It doesn't matter what your major is, this is an accessible, but difficult, course that is totally worth the amount of effort it requires. It is a fair bit of work, with a novel a week plus hundreds of pages of historical supplementary readings, attendance taken at lectures, etc, but do NOT let this stop you. Magaziner is an excellent lecturer and I loved coming to class every week.",
    "Not worth it.",
    "It is a comprehensive, mostly thematic history and exploration of colonized Africa. While the course is African Encounters with Colonialism, it is not ALL about Africans, for several European voices are heard, too, in a helpful way. The lectures are mostly thematic and chronological. The outside reading comprises of ten books by African authors, accompanied with many scholarly articles. The literature could be disturbing, fun, and moving. I thought it was a great addition. SKIM the supplemental readings. Far too much to go majorly in depth, and when you are writing papers, return to the ones that could help your argument and study them in further depth. If you are willing to put time into it, and think thematically about African history, definitely take it. If you wanted to learn about governments, leaders, and individual chronologies of African countries, this class may not be your best bet.",
    "Absolutely would recommend this course.",
    "favorite class of the semester, if not my entire yale career. i think it is important to stress what the main take away of this course is. magaziner will say that its about learning to talk about africa, but i don't think that is quite accurate. its about learning how to think africa in a way that is not distorted by the western imperialist agenda that remains today. in this course, you are taught to think about africa and the way the continent responded to oppression in a way that highlights the nature of the incentives and emotions of africans during the colonialist period. this class is not about facts or details, its about assumptions and redressing those assumptions, i.e. learning to think about africa, and not necessarily about learning to talk about it.",
    "Lots of reading, so be warned. However, only three 5-7 page papers (and you only need to do 2, since lowest grade is dropped) and a take home final. Don't be fooled, the take home exam is super long. It consisted of two 7 page macro essays and a bunch of terms you needed to connect. Approximately 20 pages total! It's really a worthwhile course and you learn so, so much. At the very least, credit\/D the class. Professor Magaziner cares deeply for his student and is a great teacher. Highly recommended.",
    "The various parts of this class - the lectures, supplemental readings, and novels - never fully line up, but it's a great experience regardless, and I learned a lot about a topic that was entirely new to me. The lectures are fantastic. Take it!",
    "This course is a fascinating survey of African history in the colonial and post-colonial period. I (and, I think, most people in the class) came in knowing almost nothing about African history, so the class was really eye opening for me. I would recommend it to anyone mildly interested in African history during the colonial period.",
    "Engaging lecture class that is a worthy intro to African history, with a good novel to read every week.",
    "AFST 333 is a general overview of the history of Africa from late 1800s to date. The class alternates between general overviews of the lives of people in places in Africa and more personal accounts with indepth looks into specific events. I would recommend it to anyone who has any questions about colonization or the validity of African history.",
    "For history majors who need a non-western credit, I would probably recommend Professor Magaziner, but taking his \"History of South Africa\" course instead of this course. Studying one country in depth I think would be much more manageable and a better use of time than trying to comprehend the entire continent's experience with colonialism. Without a background in African history, I thought this course was pretty overwhelming. For students with more of a background in African events or African history, this course might be more manageable.",
    "YEP - definitely learned a lot about Africa!",
    "Maybe take this class. This would be a good class if you're willing to put a lot into it. There is so much reading (including long supplemental articles) and writing (2-3 five page essays and a ~20 page final). I am happy that I took it, though."
