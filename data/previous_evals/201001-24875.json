    "Great course, good range of topics with depth. Take it if you are interested in why languages change - but it's annoying to find out that there is no easy explanation. Hope that Icelandic volcanos don't erupt when the professor's away in Europe.",
    "This was the first year Ling 212 was offered--aka Historical II. It really transformed the way I look at linguistic change. SRA (Steve Anderson) feels strongly about this, and knows a lot, a lot about it. If it is offered in following years, and he is teaching it, you should definitely take it, no matter what your interests in linguistics are. The course hits a lot of key areas (phonological change, morphological change, syntactic change, language reconstruction, and so on) and challenges assumptions that we as linguistics majors (or majors in related fields) may have acquired in introductory classes. It is not an intro-level course, however, by any means. You really need to have taken Historical Linguistics, or at the very least be extremely well-read.",
    "This class is great way to develop a better understanding of historical linguistics. It requires personal effort to keep up with everything and get the most out of it.",
    "In general I took away from this course a good deal of helpful knowledge. The class definitely demystified some aspects of language change for me. Most of the time, I appreciated the lecture style in which class was conducted. Sometimes I wanted a little more discussion. There's a lot of reading assigned, but skimming it will suffice, since it's all explained in class.",
    "I took this class with Anderson (it's probably very different if someone else is teaching it). The material was interesting while class wasn't quite so interesting. Also, it's not quite a perfect sequential fit with HLing 1. But if you enjoy the subject and are fine with learning on your own with reading and assignments, go for it!"
