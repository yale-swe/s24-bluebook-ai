    "Greater depth of knowledge about eukaryotic molecular biology, specifically transcription, DNA replication, epigenetics, DNA repair, and RNA regulation.",
    "I learned a new level of detail about eukaryotic molecular biology that I didn't know before. I learned to think more critically about experiments.",
    "I learned a ton of skills from this class. As someone who did not have a strong true benchwork-oriented biochemistry background, many of the techniques that were discussed were \"new\", and I feel like I will better be able to understand how to perform certain techniques to get certain types of results. I also learned a lot more about the detailed steps that are undertaken from the storage and creation of the DNA to its translation into a protein.",
    "This was a very thorough class and I learned a lot about eukaryotic biology. I feel like I developed strong skills in critical thinking about experimental design and paper reading.",
    "Deeper understanding of the central dogma in eukaryotes with attention to techniques and historically important experiments in molecular biology.",
    "all the basics about molecular biology that I need to know to be a successful MBB grad student.",
    "A lof concepts in eukaryotic molecular biology from replication, DNA repair, transcription, and translation. Very in depth in various aspects of courses.",
    "This course provided an intense coverage of the course subjects. I learned a lot about eukaryotic biology. Given this was probably my second biology course, I felt a bit behind other students. I also enjoyed the discussion sections that challenged us to critically analyze the literature, those were super helpful!"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The professors were very engaged and excited about the material. Sometimes, the lectures were too fast, especially when the professors were explaining experiments from papers. Instead of receiving the papers where they did these experiments at the lecture, I thought it would be more helpful to receive them at the preceding lecture so we could get an introduction to these experiments before we hear about them in lecture. The midterm exam had way too much of a time restriction, and it kind of became a test of how fast you could write your answer down. I thought either they should make the exam shorter, or they should give the class more time to take this exam. The discussion sections were really helpful, and even though the papers were usually pretty dense and difficult for me to get through, I learned a lot from them and from the professors\/TAs during the discussion section. The TAs were also very helpful and responsive, and would respond basically immediately to any question I had.",
    "I enjoyed the content of this class, and the exams were challenging. The midterm exam had fair questions, but I felt very rushed and didn't feel like I could write down everything I wanted to.",
    "Strengths- lots of information. Definitely a good class that will provide a substantial background on many different important processes. The discussion sections really helped to understand the different concepts and techniques. Weaknesses- while the second half was very cohesive, the first half seemed kind of scattered. It was often difficult to distinguish between necessary and supporting information, making exams difficult.",
    "One complaint is the inadequate amount of time to complete the midterm. I don't know any humans that can write, let alone think, quickly enough to finish answering all questions in the appropriate amount of detail. Please shorten that exam for upcoming years. I also felt rushed on the final because we were given the exact same amount of time and the same amount of questions. I adjusted to answer questions out or order and in less detail in order to barely finish on time.",
    "I learned a lot from discussing the papers - that aspect was very helpful in putting some of the information from lecture into context. I had a hard time absorbing much info from lecture. I would have liked to have some discussion sections or short exercises to work on throughout the semester to make sure I am understanding things correctly.",
    "Karla's interactive lectures were absolutely the best at keeping everyone - of all levels, grad and undergrad - engaged. Mark's lectures were also pretty clear, although at times moved very fast. Disucssions were some of the best places to learn. I love paper discussions.",
    "The strengths of this course are the professors whose insight and experience in their field made the topics interesting and exciting, the variety of material covered, and the discussion sections. A weakness might be the speed of the course, but I think this is because of the limited background I had on the topics. It was really a fair pace."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course if the student has time to commit to it. It's definitely much more of a time commitment than every other course I have taken at Yale, and it's the only graduate course I have taken that has had exams. Additionally, it has weekly papers to read, which take a long time to get through, and a 8-10 page paper due near the end of the semester. I did learn a lot in this course about different experimental techniques and experimental design, so I am very happy that I took it, even though it was a lot of work. I definitely learned the most in this course compared to every other class I have taken here.",
    "I would, if they are planning on going into a biochemistry field. As someone more on the biophysics side, though definitely interesting and important to know, it almost went into too much detail that will not really be directly applicable to my area of study. I would have preferred a less intense type of course to gain this info, but just with less detail.",
    "Yes I would. It is probably the best advanced euk bio class I have encountered and though its not my strongest suit, I did still enjoy it.",
    "Highly recommend to MB&B majors, in fact it should probably be required as a follow-up to MB&B 301. Course material is dense and often lectures go over time. However, the teachings is generally excellent, as are the selected discussion papers. The midterm and final examine needs to be shortened in upcoming years but are otherwise fair and, actually, fun exams to work through. Feedback given on discussion paper summaries and the term paper is thorough and very useful for people interested in graduate school.",
    "Absolutely!",
    "Yes, it provides a lot of foundational background necessary for the future of any biochemist\/biologist."
