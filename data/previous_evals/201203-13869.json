   "question_text": "Looking back on this course, what is your overall assessment of the course:  What are its strengths and weaknesses, and in what ways might it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "strengths - both teachers love their work, both are supe rr open to meeting and helping youweakness - having an actual having a real project in community health evaluation and going it through together as a class seems like it be more useful than the varied array of projects",
    "This course was generally a good experience, but I think that it could have been more demanding or rigorous. I think that looking at more examples of evaluations and possibly having students present examples would be beneficial (like the critique that we did).",
    "I was really excited because this course is one of the \"hand on\" courses offered at Yale. I learned a lot creating the evaluation but I wished there would have been more case studies and opportunities to discuss evaluations.",
    "Overall i thought the course was very helpful in understanding how evaluations take place. For all the details they wanted in our final project, i think it may have been nice to have more examples and more thorough explanations on certain topics.",
    "The course is very structured and follows the syllabus as is. This is great in that a student can plan ahead his\/her work.",
    "Strengths: Very helpful for every individual at personal as well as organizational level.Weakness: None",
    "Great course. Learn how to write an evaluation for a program.",
    "A good skill set to have and you get to work with an organization of your choice. Also the instructors were very generous in their time to meet with you one to one.Weakness - the instructors were flexible with deadlines but provided very little feedback on your work unless directly approached.",
    "Strengths: the opportunity to work with a real organization of your choice on any project they may have available for you to evaluate; also provides the opportunity to continue to work with them after the course ends. Gives experience on a real-life application of an MPH degree and would be great training if you expect to want to do evaluations on programs as part of your career.Weaknesses: Lectures didn't have much active participation which made them a little difficult to listen to, especially if you didn't have an assignment due on the topic any time soon.Improvement: Creating lectures that are more interactive or separating the final project into a few mini-projects might help keep the pace of the class with the level of engagement. Also, the assigned\/optional readings were very long; some of them looked very useful but I gave up before I started because I knew I wouldn't be able to get through them. It would be helpful if you could point out one succinct article every few weeks that would be the most helpful for us.",
    "This course was a little bit of a disappointment. Structured where we were supposed to randomly reach out to the agency of our choice and offer to design an evaluation plan, this was inefficient and probably a little ineffective. Setting this class up in a manner more closely resembling the program planning class - where organizations are already selected and students work in pairs would probably offer a better learning opportunity.Other than that, the class was not particularly challenging --- and sadly, I'm not sure I learned much of anything above and beyond the program planning class I've already taken.",
    "The lectures seemed both scattered and redundant."

   "comments": [
    "Instructor: Denise Stevens \u00a0Super helpful, super patient, and a great person overall. I think she understands the sensitivities of facilitating the creativity process.",
    "Instructor: Denise Stevens \u00a0Generally good and approachable. Although I think I was assigned to get feedback from the TA, I approached the professor instead. I just wish that my assignments could also have been graded and that I had gotten written feedback from the professor.",
    "Instructor: Denise Stevens \u00a0Denise and Brenda are incredible! I really appreciate their dedication to us as students.",
    "Instructor: Denise Stevens \u00a0She was a great teacher, obviously is very skilled at what she does and knows this area very well. However, as she did say reaching her was best through email, there were a few emails i sent without any response and that was very frustrating as a student in this class.Brenda Fenton: She was great! Very receptive and helpful!",
    "Instructor: Denise Stevens \u00a0Strengths: Both the instructors, Denise and Brenda, are receptive to students' needs. They are quick to respond to emails and are always willing to set-up in-person meetings or meetings via Skype.",
    "Instructor: Denise Stevens \u00a0Strengths: Very good instructor and willing to accomodate all comments of students. High degree of patience and listening skill to the learners problems.Weakness: None",
    "Instructor: Denise Stevens \u00a0The instructors were great and added a lot to what they do in their professional life.I enjoyed both professors",
    "Instructor: Denise Stevens \u00a0Clearly enjoys her work, very knowledgable about the process of doing evaluations, very flexible on however you want your project to be done. Enthusiastic about teaching, responsive to e-mails, provides feedback.See Q6 for improvements",
    "Instructor: Denise Stevens \u00a0It's clear that Dr. Stevens is accomplished and well educated.She clearly spent a lot of time creating powerpoints but I'm not sure that there were actual lesson plans.Additionally, the relationship between Dr Stevens and her 'co-teacher' or TA was a little weird. Often, class was a sort of conversation between the two of them and less a lesson that engaged the classroom.",
    "Instructor: Denise Stevens \u00a0Dr. Stevens and Fenton were both very nice and responsive."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this only to those willing to take the project into their own hands. If you are here to get taught, it is a lecture format, but the material is dense and not applied consistently throughout the semester",
    "I think it is very practical. We do not get a chance at YSPH very much to apply our knowledge to real life situations.",
    "excellent oourse. new skill learned",
    "I would recommend this course to someone else. I think it is a valuable skill set to have.",
    "This course provides students with the knowledge and practical skills of devising a program evaluation for health-related programs. This course is helpful in introducing students to the steps and tools needed in creating a program evaluation. If a student is seeking to acquire public health practical skills, then this course would be useful.",
    "I will recommend this course for everyone. It is must that every individual should know Program Evaluation to their day to day work.",
    "Learning how to write an evaluation plan for a program.",
    "This is a skill-building course on how to plan an evaluation for a public health program. The course goes through each portion of creating an evaluation plan step by step, and you follow along by creating an evaluation plan for a project of your choosing. This project can be fictional, or (as most students do) you can contact an organization of your choosing (likely one that you are interested in working with) and create an evaluation plan based on their needs. You can offer to actually perform the evaluation after creating the plan to stay involved in the organization.I would recommend this course because it gives the opportunity to network with organizations while completing a course and gaining professional skills. Having this coursework could assist with attaining jobs in evaluation in the future.",
    "I'm not sure. This course was not what I expected."
