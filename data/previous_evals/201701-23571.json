Pete often started classes with a chance to summarize the purpose of the paper in one or two sentences (and each member of the group spoke). I found this helpful, because it encouraged everyone to speak. So, that could be standardized as common practice for class openings.",

Discussion of the statistical analysis specifically would've been really helpful. Sometimes I felt like even after a Monday class, I didn't really understood the paper any better.",
    "1. Would it be helpful to broaden the scope of materials we read, including technical reports by governmental agencies and major non-profit organizations, so that we can Skype in speakers from more diverse areas, e.g. practitioners and officials, and learn about on-the-ground projects in addition to research articles? 2. Given the limited time and number of classes we have as F&ES masters students, in the future would it be possible to merge this class with Gabe Benoit's Biogeochemistry and Pollution into a 4-credit course?"

Check the scheduled speakers and look at their CVs and see if their career paths interest you, because it's a really great way to get to know them, and feel more connected in that space. You don't need to have a lot of biogeochemical understanding to get a lot out of this course.",
