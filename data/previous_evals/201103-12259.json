    "ABSOLUTELY. Professor Kalyvas is a genius, and if you have any interest in civil wars, you should definitely take it. Don't be fooled by the fact that there is no reading involved, however. There is no set list of readings because you create your own. Every student selects a civil war to study, whether it has already ended or is still ongoing, and basically conducts research on it all throughout the semester. There are 2 page weekly memos (which actually pretty much resemble a full length paper because of all the margin and font changes...), a mid-term, and a final report. It really is a lot of work, but it is SO WORTH IT!!! This class equips you with a new perspective, and it is one of the courses you cannot possibly afford to miss.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class - it's a fair amount of writing, but it's totally worth it. It forces you to stay on top of your work, and since there's no set syllabus of readings, it forces you to take the initiative to find sources that will really help you. It's my favorite class this semester.",
    "A heads up, you have these weekly \"memos\" that seem to be easy assignments. I thought I'd be writing a couple of paragraphs, I was REALLY wrong. Instead, It's a two page (single spaced) research assignment that takes about 10 hours a week to write. They are also graded fairly toughly, which was sort of a bummer. The teacher was great, lecture was interesting, and the material is engaging. But it was NOT worth a weekly essay and a 20 PAGE FINAL PAPER. Just make sure you know what you're getting yourself into.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. It covers different factors that contribute to civil wars, and makes you really think about wars. You get to study your own case, so you really get to apply theory to reality.",
    "An interesting course but a lot of work: weekly 1-2 pages memos on your personal civil war, sometimes they are changed to 5 pages, a midterm and a 15 page paper as a \"take home final\". No readings, which is nice, but you are expected to be uptodate on the new York times and your civil war.",
    "I would say its a class where you learn the overall ideas of war and violence and then get to choose a war of interest to you and see how they apply. I would absolutely recommend it",
    "Yes, definitely if you're interested in civil conflict and international affairs. It's one of those classes that helps you appreciate the complexity of things. Because each student chooses a conflict to focus on for the whole semester, you become an expert on one civil war and it's a great feeling.",
    "This is the best political science class I have taken at Yale, and I HIGHLY recommend it to anyone considering going to grad school in poli sci, because you will learn how to research effectively and engage with theoretical material that you can apply to specific cases of civil war. Be mindful that the class is a lot of work and requires that you delve into one specific case study that you research throughout the semester and produce extensive weekly memos, so if you have no strong interest in learning about one region I would not recommend taking the class. Also Professor Kalyvas is BRILLIANT. I could just sit and listen to him lecture for hours--his lectures are both informative, interesting, and often hilarious. I always enjoyed going to lecture. He is a tough grader but you won't even care because you'll learn so much in the class that it's a satisfying experience regardless of the final grade. A must-take for poli sci majors. This is certainly one of those gem classes in which you put in a lot of work and reap huge benefits, making the work worthwhile.",
    "While the way it is set up is great and it allows you to gain a ton of depth on one civil war, I would advise doing this on your own time rather than taking the class because the requirements are outrageous.",
    "Be prepared to write.",
    "Yes but way too much work, especially the 5 page single space memos toward the end of the semester.",
    "I would definitely recommend the class. You'll learn about Civil Wars.",
    "Do not take the class, the memos are unclear and difficult to write each week.",
    "This is a really interesting class on civil wars-- their origins and their dynamics. You should take this class if you are interested in studying civil wars in any capacity, and also if you like doing research. It's really a great class, if challenging at times. Professor Kalyvas is great, too. It's very hard work and a lot of work, but I learned a ton.",
    "Violence and Civil Strife definitely has its problems, and you should prepare yourself for some frustration, as it is a new-ish class with plenty of kinks. Also, the grading system isn't all that clear. BUT I absolutely recommend this to anyone interested in civil wars who doesn't mind dealing with a few kinks. Kalyvas is really an incredible teacher. You'll spend the entire semester researching one particular civil war and are supposed to become an expert on your war. I feel it has helped me do exactly that. Lectures (which are sort of like seminars in that the entire class participates on occasion) focus on theory of war and draw on particular cases for support.",
    "A very good course on conflict, but a lot of work. A paper (which ends up being about 4 pages) every week, with a midterm and a final paper\/take home exam. Helps one gain a good general overview of civil strife, with better knowledge of one's own civil war. However, make sure to pick a more modern civil war which meets all of civil war's definitions: this would make it much simpler than picking a more obscure war without much for primary sources.",
    "This class is about the organization and psychology of civil wars in theory and practice."
