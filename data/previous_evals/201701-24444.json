   "comments": [
    "Instructor: Janna Kelly Gonwa \u00a0Jana gave a great section and clarified all the pieces I was confused on. The problem was that Jana took so long to get our papers back that I never felt I had time to talk to her about my paper before the next one way due.",
    "Instructor: Janna Kelly Gonwa \u00a0Very friendly, well-informed, approachable, and organized.",
    "Instructor: Janna Kelly Gonwa \u00a0Janna did a phenomenal job helping us digest the readings. She managed her time well in our 50 minute sections and she was always very accessible offline. I have nothing but good things to say about her. She was phenomenal.",
    "Instructor: Janna Kelly Gonwa \u00a0I thought Ms. Gonwa was an outstanding teaching fellow. Strengths - depth of knowledge; serious earnest commitment to helping us engage constructively with difficult material; nice touch in facilitating class discussion. Ms. Gonwa was extremely generous with her time - she held two optional sections, adding an extra class at our request to answer substantive conceptual questions as we prepared for our exam. Ms. Gonwa also gave thorough, detailed, truly helpful comments on our written assignments. She is a terrific, kind, generous, smart teaching fellow. Weaknesses - I'm sure she has some, but they were not apparent to me!",
    "Instructor: Janna Kelly Gonwa \u00a0Janna was highly relatable and available as a TF. Her feedback and written comments on graded assignments are easily some of the best I have ever recieved. One area of growth may be in being able to facilitate group discussions in sections with more intentionality and precision. This is Not to insenuate that she was terrible at this.",
    "Instructor: Janna Kelly Gonwa \u00a0Janna further broke down the material during section. She was extremely knowledgeable about the subject matter. She has been the best TF I had thus far.",
    "Instructor: Janna Kelly Gonwa \u00a0Janna was also a compassionate and knowledgeable TF. She dug deep to explain and ensure that the complexity of subject matter was unearthed and understood. I hope to have her in other subjects. I have no complaints.",
    "Instructor: Janna Kelly Gonwa \u00a0Janna was a great TF. She was friendly, courteous and very well-prepared for the sessions. She was knowledgeable of a good range of theologians and brought that knowledge to the discussion sections. She was readily available via email. Her comments on my written work were very thorough and helpful. She neither begrudged praise nor did she hesitate to point out weaknesses in my arguments. Janna did an excellent job as TF.",
    "Instructor: Janna Kelly Gonwa \u00a0She was always available to answer questions via in person or email. Knowledgable and evokes deeper thought in section. Great TF!",
    "Instructor: Janna Kelly Gonwa \u00a0Janna is the best TF I have ever had. The feedback that she provides on the student's work speaks for itself. Hers is a labor of care, thoughtfulness, and constructive criticism. Having taken Janna for two classes, I can track the immense improvement in my work from incorporating her advice. I also appreciate Janna's willingness to go above-and-beyond her TF duties by planning additional sessions with students. I found her to be smart, compassionate, thoughtful, and honest. Perhaps it would have been helpful if Janna could have graded slightly quicker, but at the same time, the quality of her feedback was worth the wait. Janna is a true gem.",
    "Instructor: Janna Kelly Gonwa \u00a0Janna was great at leading section, and she encouraged us to integrate the readings and lectures in a way that was really helpful.",
    "Instructor: Janna Kelly Gonwa \u00a0Janna was an excellent TF and led the best discussion section I have had thus far. She is a great teacher who explains complicated material well and never loses sight of the practical implications of theology. I appreciated her helpful feedback. I would be glad to have her again.",
    "Instructor: Ross McCullough \u00a0Ross is an exceptional TF. He is charismatic and very smart, but he is also willing to let the section discussion flow free of interference. He is able to communicate complicated ideas clearly, and seeks feedback often. He was particularly helpful in distilling some of Dr. Jennings' more complicated theories and ideas. I will try to be in Ross' section again in the future if he TFs for another one of my classes.",
    "Instructor: Ross McCullough \u00a0Ross was a good person but he didn't really teach anything substantial or objective related to both Jennings's lectures or the readings; he was not systematic in his approach of meaningful dialogue.",
    "Instructor: Ross McCullough \u00a0Mr. McCullough is a great teaching fellow. He is available and communicative.",
    "Instructor: Ross McCullough \u00a0very laid back (in a helpful way), made class seem much more relaxed, less like a cutthroat competition and more like a discussion in which we were trying to find Truth together did a great job at explicating Dr. Jennings' theology, helping us break down what was said at lecture",
    "Instructor: Ross McCullough \u00a0Strengths: Ross is an excellent listener. He allowed our sections to take their own shape but was attentive to the questions that came up through our conversations. He often helped to clarify\/categorize the theological issues we were addressing, and asked us questions to more fully articulate our thoughts when needed. Improvement: Perhaps at times, having a bit more of a structure to the sections might have been helpful. But. as noted above, this was also of the strengths of Ross' work.",
    "Instructor: Ross McCullough \u00a0Ross is one of my favorite TFs so far. He was phenomenal. Our section discussions were engaging and interesting. I always looked forward to going to section. He did an excellent job of moderating the discussions while still allowing plenty of room for disagreement and talk across ideological lines. I thought he handled student complaints and concerns with a lot of grace and diplomacy. He was friendly and approachable and garnered respect by means of his clear expertise and amiable nature. I thought his grades were fair and his feedback was detailed and very helpful. Although I didn't feel that the instructor was clear enough and I had some issues with assignments, I thought Ross did everything he could and was incredibly fair and helpful.",
    "Instructor: Ross McCullough \u00a0Ross did a good job of facilitating conversation and helping us work through the intricacies of theology. I also appreciated his feedback on my essays."
