    "I felt as if my research abilities dramatically improved over the past semester. I am so happy I was able to take an independent research class.",
    "Because I worked in an immunobiology lab, I learned technical skills such as PCR, gel electrophoresis, Gibson assembly of vectors, sequence analysis, etc. But more importantly I learned how to conduct and analyze independent research, and succinctly write a paper that reflects a semester of hard work on a project that matters to me.",
    "I gained so much from this course, both in terms of laboratory techniques in neurobiology, presenting research and understanding what working in a research lab is like. I learned to design and form my own hypotheses and think about the next steps of the project. Concretely, I developed skills in confocal microscopy, genetics (setting crosses, collecting virgins), mounting and dechorionating fly embryos and reading scientific papers."

    "Nothing to report! Thanks for pushing the final paper deadline back a few days.",
    "Strengths: I thought the required research proposal and final report were very useful in helping organize my thoughts and insights for my project",
    "I am very glad that such a course exists in the MCDB department to allow students to work in a real lab setting. I just wish that the grading were a letter grade instead of pass\/fail, since it was a fairly demanding course for me both in terms of time and intellectual effort."

   "comments": [
    "If you want to do research, especially if you want to start something and then build on it during the summer, do it!",
    "If you are eager to work in a lab that you admire, definitely take this course and get credit for doing something you love!",
    "You just work in a lab for 10-15 hours a week, pump out research, and write a final paper at the end. A great way to work on actual lab material, however DO NOT FORGET ABOUT THE FINAL PAPER. I did and it absolutely wrecked my finals period when I had to write 18-20 pages (mine was longer because I worked on two projects) in 4 days and as such pushed back all my other papers and studying.",
    "I would really recommend this course to any student interested in working in an MCDB lab and learning to design a research project. I gained so much from this course, both in terms of laboratory techniques in neurobiology, presenting research and understanding what working in a research lab is like. To get a lot out of the course you must be willing to allocate 8 hours or more a week to research and to be challenged."
