    "This course was both insightful and incredibly well-taught. Professor Rosenzweig gave engaging lectures and stimulated enlightening discussions. His willingness to engage with students and ability to make complex studies easily understandable was greatly appreciated.",
    "Strengths - a lot of knowledge learned by Professor Rosenzweig and interesting information you generally wouldnt know Weaknesses - no real weaknesses",
    "More structure in assignments as well as more discussion would be beneficial",
    "This class was a beauty.",
    "This course had so much potential, but ended up being fairly disappointing. I think the lectures could definitely be more engaging and the final exam should be replaced by a final paper.",
    "Unfortunately poorly organized which did not help my learning"

    "No. i was really disappointed by the applicability of the material and the structure of the class.",
    "I would recommend this course to any senior looking for an insightful development seminar with a manageable workload. Professor Rosenzweig is an exceptional lecturer and is a wealth of knowledge when it comes to the complexities of development research. The course material includes many interesting studies pertaining to schooling, health, and agricultural risk, and I found many of the study results to be both surprising and enlightening.",
    "Yes, take it if you want an Econ seminar with less work and if you still want to learn interesting things about developing countries in terms of school, health, and risk coping policies",
    "This is an interesting course if you want to learn about how development policy works and how to determine the impact of interventions",
    "No. He is not an effective teacher and lectures at you the whole semester.",
    "Yes. Like I said, this class was a beauty.",
    "Likely not.",
    "Chill seminar, basically like a lecture once a week and then there's an article presentation and a final. If you're looking for a gut senior seminar and they haven't changed this class too much, I highly recommend. Did not learn much though which was unfortunate. But chill workload, literally no assignments except the presentation and final exam! And rosenzweig really does just lecture every class, barely a seminar."
