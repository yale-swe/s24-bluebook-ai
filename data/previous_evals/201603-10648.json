   "comments": [
    "Learned several macroeconomic models for both closed, small open and large open economies, learned a lot about Fed policy",
    "Knowledge: Key differences between economies in the short-run and long-run; open vs. closed economies; the issue of the zero lower bound or liquidity trap; historical development of macro; the causes of and responses to financial crises. Skills: Familiarity with a variety of models that can be applied to real-life\/historical scenarios. Insights: Different models have different purposes (e.g. short-run vs. long-run), and it is important to be clear about the assumptions you are making before choosing one or another. Taking this class will help you figure out which are best to use in different situations. Also, this class is great for getting a better understanding of fiscal vs. monetary policy, and how govts and central banks make policy decisions.",
    "I was able to apply my skills of economics to the real world, outside of north America. Because it is macro econ, it offered a more extensive insight into how certain fluctuations in markets affect not only our country (US) but countries surrounding us and across the ocean.",
    "Learned the fundamentals of Macroeconomics at a deeper level, as well as some basic finance tools.",
    "None, except I understand the economy a little more",
    "Over the course of this class, I gained a basic understanding of the current theories in macroeconomics, both those that are widely agreed upon and more controversial ones. I also understood better than in intro macro the differences between different models, and how and when to decide which model is applicable to a given problem. Finally, I understood how different models correspond to the varying policies that the Fed and government have pursued over the years.",
    "In all honesty, not much. Sad as it is, the field of macroeconomics, at least at this level, is rife with hand-waving of the vigorous variety, substituting supposed \"intuition\" in the place of real math. This isn't really the fault of the professor though; I realize economics pedagogy suggests to do this. However, the course material is not substantively different than what is taught in Professor Tsyvinski's class, so I'm not really sure what extra knowledge is supposed to be conferred anyway.",
    "I learned so much in macro. It was great and gave me a clear understanding of the international economy.",
    "I developed some additional knowledge about macroeconomics over the course of taking this class, but I wouldn't call it \"insight\" by any stretch of the imagination. I am better at reading macroeconomic models and at answering the way overcomplicated p-set questions asked, but again. In terms of tangible skills i'm going to have to go with \"limited\" on this one.",
    "various macroeonomics concepts, the skill to synthesize and relate information. Understanding the economy and world news in general.",
    "Some more advanced macroeconomics concepts, but nothing earth shattering.",
    "I learned a little bit more than Intro Macro but this course isn't really that dense, you can learn all the material for the final in one day if you wanted to.",
    "Great way to reinforce the concepts taught in intro macro. I think Professor Nordhaus did a great job explaining Donald Trump's economic plans, which made the class very topical.",
    "Theoretical framework for evaluating macroeconomics issues.",
    "i learned many concepts about macroeconomics.",
    "I learned more about macroeconomics--built off of the introductory course.",
    "Learn about the overall ways that the economy works on a national and international level.",
    "I think I really gained a solid grip of the topics of Macroeconomics. I learned a bunch of interesting, helpful theories that I can apply to the real world.",
    "I got a pretty good base for Macro. I hadn't taken intro macro so I was perhaps spending more time trying to absorb all the information without really being able to process\/put it altogether.",
    "Nordhaus is very keen on teaching us modern and cutting edge economics, and is less interested in the outdated models in the textbook. This was actually really helpful for interviews but sometimes it was difficult to read more than what was on the slides without looking up current research papers and trying to figure it out from there.",
    "Learned the mathematical foundations behind macroeconomic trends and how they apply to real world policy.",
    "very complex and interesting macroeconomic models",
    "I felt like the intermediate level of macroeconomics allowed me to dive much deeper into the topics we studied than I could at the introductory level. By the end of the semester, I understood much better how the models and equations we studied applied to the real world.",
    "I gained a greater understanding of a combination of theoretical and real-world macroeconomic models, challenges, and policies that shape the economic growth and development of the USA and countries around the world. I improved my ability to understand a fiscal\/monetary policy\/policy shift and analyze the short run and long run effects of implementing such a policy.",
    "Very classic overview of the U.S. economy - various economic models, finance, consumption, money, investment, unemployment, inflation, inflation, panics, depressionS, etc. Some current and historic events as well.",
    "This class gave me a pretty comprehensive course in macro, and I really feel that I understand some fairly advanced concepts and models now.",
    "Macroeconomic theories",
    "!A: would still recommend the best sequence (sophomore fall intermediate micro, sophomore spring econometrics, junior fall intermediate macro). This was the MOST (real world) of the econ classes, probably the most enjoyable. Zack is the best TA. But annoying exams, probably worse than intermediate micro which is straightforward if you STUDY. For macro you get curveballs which is ANNOYING.THE PROFESSOR: I respected him a lot for keeping the material up to date with modern macro theory. Taylors rule, zero lower bound, liquidity trap, etc. But lectures and the Mankiw book became confusing to integrate. What about the liquidity theory of money and the MV=PY theory? The exams didnt focus at all on the textbook. THE FINAL: annoying that they were less problem based and more (look at this graph and tell me what it means with a model). I dont think we are at all prepared for that! Also having to derive the DAD DAS equations is so unnecessary and ridiculous. What were they thinking? The problem sets could have been better, with less of this excel modeling stuff and more drilling of the models and the ECONOMIC INTERPRETATION OF THE MOVEMENTS OF THE CURVES AND EQUILIBRIA. This should have been of been the key focus and not X-axis goes down, so quantity of y-axis goes up.",
    "Basic macroeconomic analysis",
    "MacroEconomics skills,",
    "Great macroeconomics course.",
    "I deepened my understanding of each component of GDP, including Consumption, Investment, Government Purchases, and trade balance. I also learned models and relationships between inflation and unemployment (Phillip's), IS-LM, bank run model, Romer debt model, life cycle model, and more.",
    "This course built off of my previous understanding of macroeconomics, and allowed for a deeper analysis into a variety of topics, especially those which are applicable to today's world. While the core work of this course was centered around problem sets (with an optional essay), the discussions within lectures and section allowed for greater understanding of the concepts and how they apply.",
    "This course provided a solid macroeconomic understanding that gives one the tools to evaluate macroeconomic policy in everyday life.",
    "Nothing. Aside from trade, virtually everything was already covered in Intermediate Macro.",
    "I learned a lot about macro and finally gained a good grasp of concepts such as interest rates, the role of the Fed, and exchange rates. This course really gave me the foundation in economics I needed to better understand events and forecasts I hear about in the news in everyday life.",
    "One of those intro\/intermediate econ classes that are taught pretty averagely, Decent class if you want to learn about macro and are interested in the material",
    "This course was very similar to the intro macro course taught at Yale but just much more confusing. I would not say I developed my knowledge in economics except in the very obscure areas.",
    "The course was a good overview of higher level macroeconomic models and served its purpose as a required course for the economics major well.",
    "Not only did ECON 122 make me understand macroeconomics in a wholistic and comprehensive way, it also taught me to follow economic models.",
    "This course provided me with significant knowledge of the important models and theories of macroeconomists. I gained a new perspective on how macroeconomists think about the economy, and the course provided me with a framework within which to analyze various policy issues. The course also provided me with insights into the history of the economy and the Fed's role within it."

   "comments": [
    "Lecture isn't engaging, there is a lot of information that isn't useful and it gets very hard to separate what's important from what isn't. I think i could have learned the same information in a 30 minute lecture rather than an hour and 15 minute lecture.",
    "Weaknesses: Its not really a weakness, but its something Id like to see included, which is a workshop or two on Excel. During the semester, there were a few optional review sessions for basic finance concepts and math. Given that a couple of psets require some simple tasks using Excel, I think it would be helpful to also have an optional review session for that. The concepts used are basic and can be looked up online, but I think a formal review would go a long way, especially in a class where the importance of data is emphasized, though not often tested as a skill.",
    "The class was very unhelpful in actually learning the concepts and information for the course.",
    "I felt that the problem sets were not always reflective of the lectures. I also was hoping to see more easy to follow lecture slides but the professor tended to go through them fairly quickly and kind of jumped around.",
    "Strengths: Textbook was an invaluable source Weakness: Textbook was the best source of information. Would have like Professor to be the main source, but lecture was dull at times.",
    "I really liked that this course incorporated current and historical events. I appreciated being able to analyze and understand the economic impacts of things such as the Great Depression, the 2008 Recession, and the Trump administration's policy plans, in both a historical context and through macroeconomic theory and models. I feel like this class was really important for helping me develop basic economic literacy. However, I felt that the class could have been much more organized. We received very little feedback on our graded problem sets, and there was almost no material provided to help us practice for exams (or even know what to expect on the midterm and final). A little more organization and clearer expectations could go a long way in making this class more enjoyable and engaging.",
    "This course does a good job of providing an overview of different models and theories, with occasional dives into the depth of some of them. However, until it came time to study for exams, I didn't have a clear understanding of how the different models actually fit together and whether they contradicted each other. Thus, I think that it would be helpful if the course had more overarching structure and each lecture made an effort to make it clear where it fit into this structure.",
    "Amazing TA's, interesting material, and a good professor. Exams can be challenging because it's not very clear what they're looking for, but after one exam you can definitely get a better feel for what you need to do.",
    "I think Professor Nordhaus did a good job of maintaining enthusiasm in teaching admittedly pretty dry material. That being said, I think the expectations of the course were arbitrary at best; for instance, grading was often pretty inconsistent, particularly on the midterm. The problem sets also sometimes were posted and revised fairly late in the week, which was a little annoying.",
    "It was great. I just wish we did international econ for large open economy, a topic that we skipped over.",
    "So the course does cover a lot of the material that the syllabus sets aside to cover, but it's not a very engaging class. It could be improved with more consistency between lectures and problem sets.",
    "The TAs were fantastic and they saved me in this course. I liked how Nordhaus aimed to incorporate current events and news into his lectures. It made things more relatable.",
    "Problem sets could be very annoying with how vague they are, and lecture was very long. The problem with lecture was that it felt like everything could've been condensed into like 45 minutes or 30 minutes, but the first 30 minutes and last 10 minutes were almost always just expository stuff that you didn't necessarily need to know.",
    "Strength : easy Weakness: boring",
    "The strength of this class is the quality of the TAs. I had Zack and he was phenomenal. Professor Nordhaus is also a funny guy which keeps lecture decently interesting. Sometimes I felt that the problem set questions were ambiguous and the course did not have a great arc. It felt like we jumped from topic to topic.",
    "If the exam questions could be more clear in what the answers should entail, that would be great.",
    "Some problem sets were excessively long and very frustrating. Also, it was very annoying that when revisions were made, they would be made only 2 days before a due date.",
    "The lectures are pretty dry. The problem sets are difficult and the TAs do not help you at all. I went to the first office hours and was told that the TAs could not help on the problem sets but were there for general questions. This obviously was not helpful and therefore the problem sets just hurt your grade, which is a little bit ridiculous. With a class as broad as macro, problem sets should be graded on a sliding scale (as with intro), or the TAs should help when you make an effort to go and see them.",
    "The sections and office hours and homeworks and textbook were great. That is when I learned the most. I found the lectures to be pretty useless. The professor went to fast and went on tangents that may have been interesting to students who really grasped that day's lecture material but it didn't support the rest of us trying to figure out that day's lecture.",
    "I liked the emphasis on more modern and more realistic models, but if we're going to go consistently go off the textbook, the lecture slides should be more clear and informative. Also the psets are somewhat ridiculously graded. I really wish they would just ask the questions they wanted us to answer. Somehow we're supposed to read their minds by anticipating what they are looking for. Just ask the question you want us to answer and we'll answer it...",
    "Better and more in depth explanations of topics would have been appreciated. Final Exam should count for less. Good professor.",
    "The course did a really great job of teaching us how to derive and manipulate important formulas as well as show us what all the theories and abstract concepts look like in the real-world context. The one improvement I would make is running through the methods and logic of the pset questions during lecture; it often times felt as if we just didn't have the information needed to figure out the logical direction that the psets wanted to take us with each concept.",
    "materials and readings were interesting but class sometimes appeared unstructured and boring, I am not sure if there is a way to make it more interesting though. When presented in class the material is just very dry",
    "Professor Nordhaus is a great professor who cares about his students, and the textbook is very comprehensive, so those are definitely the strengths of the course. The weaknesses might be the inconsistency among the TAs, and the lack of information about how our problem sets were graded.",
    "Strengths include quality of the materials (lecture slides and problem sets), quality of teaching (from Professor Nordhaus), and progression of the subject matter. One weakness is that lectures can sometimes be dull and monotonous.",
    "The professor seemed very knowledgeable about macroeconomics and tried to engage students as much as possible during lectures; however, it seemed like the majority of the course was taught by reading the textbook. If the course had a little more structure (and more teaching and less just presenting of information), students may be able to learn better.",
    "I thought the main strength was how much high-level material was packed into one course. Biggest weakness by far was that feedback on psets\/exams was completely nonexistent. They'd literally just write \"-1\" next to an answer with no explanation or any other kind of marks.",
    "Just like other econ lectures, the professor needs to make the students engage with the class. The material is too dry if there is no interaction. In addition, questions on the tests should be more detailed because they are very broad and then TAs would often say that the answer is only partial.",
    "!A: would still recommend the best sequence (sophomore fall intermediate micro, sophomore spring econometrics, junior fall intermediate macro). This was the MOST (real world) of the econ classes, probably the most enjoyable. Zack is the best TA. But annoying exams, probably worse than intermediate micro which is straightforward if you STUDY.

    "Psets aren't clearly written and have ambiguous answers. Lectures are not necessary to understand material. Should assign more problems out of Mankiw book. Grading guidelines were unclear and little feedback was given to me.",
    "Professor Nordhaus is a nice guy and the TA's definitely tried to be helpful. One of my biggest concerns at Yale is that I am being spoon-fed a particular view of the world which is not being questioned by the student body because most are happy to assume there is only one viewpoint worth considering. With that being said, I feel that Professor Nordhaus tried to give a pretty balanced view of macroeconomics WHICH I APPRECIATE AND AM GRATEFUL FOR and which is the reason I came to Yale. Furthermore, one of my favorite parts of the class was when Nordhaus invited Professor Tsyvinski to discuss differing views in economics. THIS is what I came to Yale for. Top minds in a field having cordial discussion about where their views differ. I didn't realize how much I yearned for this and how much it was lacking in my Yale experience until I took the time to recognize the excitement I had for this class. I know this matter is a larger campus-wide issue than to be addressed in this review, but I just wanted to stress how much I appreciate a professor trying to be balanced and working to present a full scope of debatable issues. Class structure was a weakness. I considered myself pretty active in the class and really tried to take command of the material. However, I felt like expectations for problem sets and tests were unclear and I was always searching for answers, but the course provided more questions than answers.",
    "This is one of the best Economics classes but the it also a very difficult one. More coverage of the material in class might have facilitated our learning.",
    "While the classes were semi- interesting, we almost never had feedback on our problem sets which made learning and applying new skills very difficult",
    "Material was interesting but lectures were relatively slow.",
    "The class had relevant problem sets that helped with learning, but I often felt underprepared to do the questions despite doing all the readings and going to class. There were also outside readings that were confusing and not always pertinent to the class. There was no clear feedback on problem sets (because the class is so large), but answer keys posted online were very helpful.",
    "Strengths: The content is relatively interesting and feels applicable. Weaknesses: Not enough office hours for help with the problem sets. Sometimes lectures could be confusing, and some parts of problem sets had a steep learning curve, such as Excel models.",
    "This course does a good job at transitioning from Econ 116 and extending that knowledge through deeper mathematical analysis and greater conceptual understanding. Furthermore, the discussions in section, along with the study sessions with the TFs, allowed for greater engagement in the course. However, the course does suffer from using the same textbook as introductory macro, which means that the extension to new material is inherently limited.",
    "Too unorganized but fascinating and very well taught by Nordhaus",
    "This was a strong course, however it was similar to intro macro with Professor Tsyvinski. A lot of the material, especially in the first half of the course, was not new.",
    "Nordhaus is a great guy, but that, along with the easiness, is basically the high point of this class. Psets were awfully written and often irrelevant to exam\/lecture material (what, exactly, were we supposed to learn from the inane Excel assignments?). The material was largely a rehash of Intro Macro, down to using literally the same textbook!",
    "Overall, I thought the course was very well designed and planned out. Sometimes the problem set questions were a bit confusing or vague, but on the whole the course was great.",
    "Felt like I learned in the class, Weekly problem sets can be challenging and graded hardly, Challenging exams",
    "The course was extremely poorly structured. It jumped all over the textbook and often had components no where in the textbook. What was taught in class was different from what the textbook taught which just made everything more frustrating.",
    "The material is not difficult but instead is poorly explained, the bulk of the difficulty does not come from challenging students to engage in the material, but obfuscation of what is important or what is being asked.",
    "More engaging TAs and constructive help would be good.",
    "Strengths only. ECON 122 was extremely well structured. It impressed both by breath and depth of the topics captured. Professor Nordhaus made sure to explain even most difficult concepts in a way easy to follow; his Teaching Assistants did a tremendous job in supporting his students.",
    "One of the strengths of this course is that it is taught by one of the world's leading economists who has also spent time with the Fed, which allows students to gain insight into how the most important and prominent thinkers conceptualize the economy. Another strength of this course is that it covers some of the most important models in macroeconomics, providing students with a good background in the subject. It was also helpful that the course did not assume a lot of knowledge, which let all students begin at the same level. One way to improve this course might be to more thoroughly integrate all of the models into their larger context, as it might have been helpful to spend a bit more time building a framework or \"mental picture.\" Another suggestion would be to decrease the weight of the final to put more emphasis on other coursework."

    "No, I would recommend taking this course with a different professor. I think professor nordhaus has some interesting insights and is clearly very passionate about what he does, but I think he doesn't present the material very clearly and as a result I feel like I have had to teach myself everything",
    "I would recommend this course to students who are either majoring in econ (and therefore must take it), or have more than a passing interest in macro, e.g. finance and international trade (which you will see are related), why financial crises such as that of 2008 happen, and how to use models to predict the effects of monetary, fiscal, and trade policy. It is roughly the same amount of work as an introductory econ course, with calculus thrown in (though not much, just 1-variable derivatives).",
    "No not unless you are an Econ major.",
    "Only for an Econ major since it is a requirement",
    "I would recommend this course. We learned basic concepts and models for analyzing individual economic decisions, the U.S. economy, and the world markets, which I think is essential for developing a basic understanding of economics. I really liked how the courses material is relevant to analyzing both historical events, such as the Great Depression, as well as current public policy decisions, such as those proposed under the new presidential administration. However, I felt that the class was not very well organized and could have had clearer guidelines on what was expected on problem sets and exams.",
    "Just do it. Try to keep up with the readings. Final is 55% of the grade so be prepared to get screwed.",
    "You are probably required to take this course if you're in it, so recommendations don'r mean much. Unfortunately, I felt that I understood macro much more clearly after intro macro, and now I know much more but it isn't organized in my head at all. In the course of studying for the final, I discovered some overarching structure to the course material, but during the course each lecture seems like a completely random topic that is unrelated to the previous or next lecture (except for being about macro). If you do this course, make sure to pay attention in lecture and do all the readings, or else you will quickly become very confused.",
    "Yep! Required for econ major but not a class I dreaded or anything. Probably wouldn't take if it wasn't for the major though.",
    "I'm not sure there is a reason to take this course other than to fulfill the requirement for the Econ major; there is no difference between this and Professor Tsyvinski's course in terms of material. If you want to hear from a distinguished professor or are required to take it, go for it; Professor Nordhaus is a pretty good guy. If you want to learn deep material that you haven't yet heard, don't take it.",
    "If you are passionate about economics, this is a great class. I definitely recommend as it gives you a good understanding of the entire economy.",
    "You need to take this class. If you dont have to for the major, then don't take this class. Spend your time elsewhere with a more engaging professor and a more engaging topic.",
    "If you're an Econ major, you have to take it. If you're not and want to learn macro, I would recommend this over 116.",
    "If you need it for your major, take it, it's not bad at all.",
    "Not as bad as intermediate micro, but I don't think I'd recommend this course. However, if you're an econ major and have to take this class it isn't bad. I would recommend taking it with Professor Nordhaus. Be warned about the final. Much harder than the class prepares you for.",
    "If this class is not a major requirement, i do not recommend taking this class.",
    "If you're an econ major, you have to take it, so take it. Lectures can help but the textbook (Mankiw) was especially helpful for me. Look at their graphs and read their text because it's often explained better because honestly, you'll miss some instruction in lecture because it is boring.",
    "Take this class! It really makes you start thinking like an economist! The work load isn't bad and the material is super interesting and relatable!",
    "If you have taken intro macro.",
    "Definitely take this class! Professor Nordhaus is one of the most engaging (and impressive) professors I've ever had, and I rarely got bored during lectures. I personally also really liked the material; we got pretty good instruction in theoretical concepts and math, but also learned how to apply them in a real-world context. Would recommend reading the textbook before doing the psets, and be super thorough with your responses on the exams because they're rather strict on point deductions for insufficient justifications. Overall, really enjoyed the class!",
    "A course you have to get through. Ensure that you just expose yourself to the course as much as possible. Office hours, section, econ tutors. Success in the class in a function of learning the models and knowing when to apply them. Nothing too crazy, just a lot of material. The final was definitely harder than the midterm. If you're not econ, I don't know you should take the course. Intro macro provides a much more digestible understanding of our world economy. This course is more about the different ways that people approach understand macroeconomics and a bit of the disagreement (short term vs long term, growth verses classical, open vs closed economy). Nordaus is about as good as it gets for an old white male teaching an archaic Yale course. He's seems to enjoy teaching the course, but isn't great at walking through the math (which you actually need for the final)",
    "Only they want to major in Econ. but it is required so i guess it wouldn't really be a recommendation",
    "I would only recommend this course to another student if they need it as a prerequisite for a major. However, if you do have to take it, I would definitely recommend you to take it in the fall with Professor Nordhaus, because he made the course very comprehensive and as interesting as it could be.",
    "I would recommend it not only to econ majors but anyone with an interest in the macroeconomic challenges\/questions that shape the policies of the Fed and the government and how these policies have a global impact.",
    "ONLY TAKE THIS COURSE IF YOU HAVE TO. It gives a decent overview of the U.S. economy, but the weekly problem sets and exams are very difficult. The final is worth 55% of your grade, so it is very important to do well on it. Not a lot of teaching goes on in this course -- pretty much students are left to try to learn from a textbook.",
    "If you're going to take this class, you likely have to take it. Nordhaus knows his stuff but is rather underwhelming at times. The TF's were not very helpful when it came to grading. The wording of the psets was ambiguous and the grading seemingly harsh and arbitrary. But, of course, the Econ curve makes these things irrelevant, as long as you ride the curve well. If you use the Mankiw textbook, that will be the most important source of information for psets and tests. In fact, if you dedicated a semester to learning all of Mankiw, it would likely be more informative than the entire course. Good luck.",
    "This course isn't very \"fun,\" and I can't imagine needing the material for anything other than other econ courses and senior seminars. So definitely if you're an econ major or really want to do some kind of work with econ, but otherwise probably not.",
    "Take it if you have to.",
    "!A: would still recommend the best sequence (sophomore fall intermediate micro, sophomore spring econometrics, junior fall intermediate macro). This was the MOST (real world) of the econ classes, probably the most enjoyable. Zack is the best TA. But annoying exams, probably worse than intermediate micro which is straightforward if you STUDY. For macro you get curveballs which is ANNOYING.THE PROFESSOR: I respected him a lot for keeping the material up to date with modern macro theory. Taylors rule, zero lower bound, liquidity trap, etc. But lectures and the Mankiw book became confusing to integrate. What about the liquidity theory of money and the MV=PY theory? The exams didnt focus at all on the textbook. THE FINAL: annoying that they were less problem based and more (look at this graph and tell me what it means with a model). I dont think we are at all prepared for that! Also having to derive the DAD DAS equations is so unnecessary and ridiculous. What were they thinking? The problem sets could have been better, with less of this excel modeling stuff and more drilling of the models and the ECONOMIC INTERPRETATION OF THE MOVEMENTS OF THE CURVES AND EQUILIBRIA. This should have been of been the key focus and not X-axis goes down, so quantity of y-axis goes up.",
    "Only take this course if you are an economics major",
    "It's required. Read the Mankiw book, ignore lectures if you want (though Nordhaus is engaging enough, the lectures aren't necessary, but are nice). If you understand math and how the models work, you'll be fine. Always draw conclusions from what you get out of the models--not your intuition. Easy midterm, easy final, generous curve. No practice exams really given, but he borrows from the psets. Section is unnecessary. Do these psets in a group.",
    "Professor Nordhaus is a nice guy and clearly has a wealth of information. However, expect this class to work against you learning the material, not for you. I actually liked the material, but I don't think I did particularly well in the class. I contribute a large portion of this feeling to the fact that answers on psets and tests were always conflicting and unclear when given. On top of that, Professor Nordhaus put the fear of God in the TA's about helping on Psets, which really hindered office hours for a majority of the course because the TA's would feel the need to skirt around topics to avoid providing question help.",
    "Teaching Fellows carried the class. Better than Intermediate Micro because less straight math. More applicable to broader subjects. Still, take if you must.",
    "It is a requirement for the Economics major but it is also a great Economics course",
    "Yes, I would recommend this class.",
    "I would only recommend this class to economics majors. Most of the topics covered in this course are the same as the ones covered in intro macroeconomics.",
    "I would recommend this course to students who are extremely interested in economics. Otherwise, this isn't super helpful.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student interested in Econ, even though intro macro is a prerequisite. It's an interesting macro course, and gives a good overview of the relevant material in an engaging manner.",
    "Professor Nordhaus is a leader in his field. Very good and knowledgable professor. Class is unorganized though and psets are cumbersome.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student interested in policy or current events, who wished to have more tools and a greater macroeconomic understanding of the world.",
    "Take it if you have to. There's not much work, but if you did well in Macro with Tsyvinski, you're going to wonder why this class is even necessary since so much of it is review from Tsyvinski's Intro Macro. At least that makes it pretty easy. Nordhaus is great though, and obviously a superstar researcher.",
    "Great class! I feel like this course finally helped me understand how economies, interest rates, exchange rates function. Nordhaus was a great professor (probably one of the best I've had at Yale) and his lectures are very clear and well structured. Take this course!",
    "Would recommend this class if you're an econ major or genuinely interested in the material. I'd say the material is pretty interesting but Nordhaus isn't the most engaging professor. Problem Sets are graded on accuracy instead of the typical econ check\/check plus\/check minus, so that can be a little tough.",
    "If taught by nordhaus and structured the same way, 100% not. The sad thing is is that it is required for the Econ major and so poorly taught.",
    "No I would not recommend this course unless you HAVE to take it. The material is not difficult but instead is poorly explained, the bulk of the difficulty does not come from challenging students to engage in the material, but obfuscation of what is important or what is being asked.",
    "I would recommend the course as a required course, though I would not recommend non-economic majors take it.",
    "Definitely. To truly understand macroeconomic concepts and their political implications this course is a must-take. It should be on the schedule of anyone--from informed citizen to political leader.",
    "I would recommend the course to another student who is looking to gain a deep introduction to macroeconomics. This course discusses many of the most important models in the field, which gives students a good background for further study. It also helps give students a framework within which to understand macroeconomic events."
