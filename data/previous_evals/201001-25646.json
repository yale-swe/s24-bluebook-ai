    "I now feel confidnt I can use Remote Sensing for various, practical applications",
    "Although the labs were a lot of work there is ultimately no way to get around the fact that they are the best way to learn the material. There are plenty of them to keep you busy and they help you develop an understanding of the wide range of applications possible with remotely sensed data."

    "More time and structured feedback from the instructor is needed for the final projects. I learnt more from the final project than I did from all the labs combined.",
    "i don't know",
    "Please upload the electronic version of the lecture PRIOR to class, so we can take notes.",
    "Less assignments and more lab time to work on final project. Often I felt as though the TAs were there to discipline me rather than help me.....very strange.",
    "None really. There could have been 1 less lab session in order to have more time for final project.",
    "The amount of labs was almost perfect but I would request one or two fewer or at least end labs one or two weeks sooner so that we can go more in depth into the material and the term project. I learn by doing and I felt like there wasn't much time for me to take it all in for the term project. This is an intro course though and I wish to take a more advanced course in the future so for those only wanting to take an intro course the pace and amount of labs might be perfect.",
    "Some of the last few labs (the last two or so) seemed to be just there as busy work. They could be eliminated since we are spending a lot of time already on the final project."

    "Professor Smith doesn't answer emails, but Larry is very accessible and helpful.",

    "Larry was incredibly helpful. TAs were all good, but were net necessarily well-versed in some of the basic techniques that many students had problems with.",
    "remote sensing anlaysis is funny because everyone uses the program differently. A lot of what you need to do means that you have to learn how to do it yourself too.",
    "It was excellent, very committed group of persons.",
    "Responses by instrucors and TA's for help was excellent.",
    "Larry Bonneau is amazing and very helpful. He's available and accessible and understands your question and needs sometimes before you are able to articulate them. Bravo!",
    "Prof. Smith was always responsive to email and made himself extremely available to us. The TA's knew the material well and were always helpful during lab."

Take your time with the labs to make sure you completely udnerstand what is going on and make notes for the things you think will be useful during the term project. Keep a log of your term project work and don't be afraid to do a \"simple\" project as you will most likely learn more that way.",
    "Don't fall behind in the labs too much - they typically take between 3-6 hours to complete on a weekly basis. Also, start your project by mid-February. If not, Mid-terms hit, then spring break and then you're in April..."
