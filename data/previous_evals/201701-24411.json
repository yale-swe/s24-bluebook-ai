   "question_text": "What knowledge, skills, and insights did you develop by taking this course?",
   "comments": [
    "This course provided a solid foundation of Refugee Law. Additionally, we learned about current events like the executive orders on immigration being passed by President Trump. Our final paper was a legal analysis of a case in which we were able to apply all of the knowledge from the semester.",
    "I learned how to read cases, the fundamentals of asylum law, strategies for representing clients, and current issues in immigration policy. I also enjoyed the challenge of writing a brief for a client at the end of the semester, a much more applied final assignment in comparison to many Yale courses.",
    "Gained a thorough knowledge of case law, history of the law, and contemporary workings of the refugee asylum system. I've really come out of this class feeling that I understood the system, and why it does\/doesn't work. Very well organized in how class discussions\/assignments complement and cement the readings.",
    "I learned SO MUCH about U.S. refugee law. The course was super interesting to take at this time in our history, and each week we got to talk about the newest executive orders and what was going on with them in our system. It was an amazing course.",
    "This class is topical and important. It is skills based and gives insight into how law classes are taught.",
    "I feel like I have a good grasp on what requirements a refugee has to meet in order to qualify for asylum and protection under CAT and withholding of removal.",
    "This was my first exposure to any sort of law related class. It was truly a wonderful experience. I now better understand how law is practiced using both case precedence and written law.",
    "I learned the in's and out's of the asylum system! The class has equipped me with so much knowledge that I didn't have before. I also appreciated that it gave me a taste of what attending law school and participating in a legal clinic would be like.",
    "The class is a good introduction to what it's actually like to practice law. Beware that this class is very technical you won't find much use for what you learn beyond the field of actual refugee law. You memorize many legal phrases and rules that are only relevant within the context of asylum cases. That being said, Sabi is very chill. The class was pretty unorganized, but the workload was pleasantly low. All in all, a good class to take if you get in, but don't feel like you're missing out if you don't.",
    "I began this course with some knowledge in refugee law and policy and felt that I gained a lot from taking it. Understanding the nuance of refugee and asylum law has been a wonderful learning experience, and I feel that I would be much more comfortable now working, for example, as a paralegal in asylum law than I was prior to taking this course."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I really enjoyed the content of the course. We went through different aspects of gaining asylum each week, which allowed us to focus on each topic individually. The mock trial that we did on a case was fun and also helpful to understanding immigration court. We had several great guest speakers. I can't really think of any weaknesses!",
    "This course was excellent, and I hope that an iteration of it continues to be offered next year. I enjoyed the structure of the course - the combination of hands-on class activities, guest speakers, and presentations by Professor Ardalan. The reading responses were effective tools to ensure student learning, and I appreciated that the other writing assignments helped students tests their skills in other formats. I feel like more feedback to students throughout the course would have been helpful - such as on reading responses and op-eds.",
    "Only strengths here. This class is truly amazing. We read a ton of cases and background to case law and how some of our laws developed and the flaws in our system etc. It was truly an amazing course.",
    "This class was great at keeping up with current events.",
    "I liked that it took such a systematic approach to teaching us the in's and out's of the system. I loved the guest speakers -- each gave so much insight to me on different aspects of the legal profession. The class was light on the kind of substantive discussion I would expect from a typical seminar. Especially toward the end, we didn't talk about the readings very much. Some of the activities (like the one with the wooden blocks) didn't feel super necessary. We didn't receive any individual feedback on our assignments during the semester, so it was difficult to gauge how we were doing. The class wasn't really an intellectual challenge. I don't think that's what it was meant to be -- it was a highly useful informational course. But it didn't necessarily match expectations I had from hearing about the previous iteration of Refugee Law and Policy. That's alright, because both types of classes serve a purpose.",
    "This course was great but pretty disorganized. It could be improved by using Alexandra Dufresne's old syllabus and being taught as she would have taught it. Obviously Sabi Ardalan is a different teacher, but I think she could have structured the syllabus and its readings a little better.",
    "I think the op-ed should have been due as a mid-term assignmnet and I would have appreciated more feedback from the professor. However, the class was conducted in an extremely engaging way and the speakers invited were great.",
    "Because of extenuating circumstances (i.e. the current political climate), we spent a great deal of class time discussing the legality of Trump's various executive orders on refugees and immigration, which often left less time than originally planned to discuss the readings and aspect of asylum law we were learning about for that week. I really enjoyed these discussions about current political events and felt that I got a lot out of them and gained clarity as to what has been going on around us. However, I do wish that we'd had more time to discuss the readings and go more in depth into the case law that we learned each week. That said, however, I still learned a lot of asylum law from this course and would not have wanted to give up our discussions on current political issues."

   "comments": [
    "If you are specifically interested in asylum law, I would recommend this course. Everyone in the class seemed to have extensive experience with refugees or asylum, and most of the students seemed to want to go to law school and practice asylum law in some capacity. The course was really fun to go to, and we gained a lot of insight on current events while learning about the specific process of gaining asylum in the United States. Professor Ardalan was really great and brought in a lot of interesting guest speakers.",
    "Definitely - I didn't leave class without feeling emotionally and morally obligated to go take on the zany world of immigration law. Yes, it was a particularly relevant topic this semester, but the topic is so complex, interesting, and impactful. I wish there were more seminars that engaged with applied topics in political science.",
    "Yes!",
    "Absolutely. If you're interested in refugee law, human rights law, general advocacy, etc., this course is a fantastic, hands-on and comprehensive introduction.",
    "YES YES YES it was incredible.",
    "This class is a great introduction to asylum law and problems and I would recommend it.",
    "Definitely. A wonderful course",
    "Take the class if it's offered in the future! Particularly great if you aren't very familiar with the asylum system because you'll learn the in's and out's.",
    "The class is a good introduction to what it's actually like to practice law. Beware that this class is very technical you won't find much use for what you learn beyond the field of actual refugee law. You memorize many legal phrases and rules that are only relevant within the context of asylum cases. That being said, Sabi is very chill. The class was pretty unorganized, but the workload was pleasantly low. ALSO: Keep in mind that you do not receive any grades except at the end of the year. I have no idea how I did in the class Sabi seems chill but I could easily walk away with a C. All in all, a good class to take if you get in, but don't feel like you're missing out if you don't.",
    "This class has been one of my favorites that I've taken at Yale, and it's a bummer that Prof. Ardalan will not be returning to teach it again. Nonetheless, I would still highly recommend this class if you're looking for a legal understanding of the U.S. refugee and asylum system. I came into this class having previously done work with refugees and asylum seekers and feel that I now have a much deeper understanding of the law behind this work and the policies that affect these populations."
