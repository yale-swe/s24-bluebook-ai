    "A reasonably slight elective, 465 is a highly theoretical exploration of problems with obvious but largely unexplored practical ramifications. I enjoyed it immensely, especially the stuff on distributed shared memory. The problem sets were pleasant, as were Aspnes' lectures. Also, the material got very close to the cutting edge, and that was neat.",
    "Content is pretty difficult, but a light course overall. Short problem sets; easy final. Lots of accessible current research. Lectures are full of unique intuitions, and silly diagrams to explain algorithms. But don't take this if you don't like theory for the sake of theory; there are only a couple of topics you might expect to see in the wild (industry).",
    "Short problem sets that cover a lot of material. You could do all the problem sets and still not know that much about the class. The exam was very simple. I would recommend anyone with even a vague interest in distributed systems to take this course. It's not a lot of work, so if you can at least commit to going to every class you can get a lot out of it."
