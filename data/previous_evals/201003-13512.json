    "This is not a step-by-step introduction to Korean history. It consists of discussions on a weekly topics that relate to the question \"How do we map the Korean history in East Asia.\" There are many interesting topics, but sometimes, it can be a little repetitive. It's quite a lot of work, but you will have learned something about Modern Korean history and historiography at the end.",
    "Great course, although it's not your typical approach to a national history, and you may not be able to chronicle out specific moments or movements in Korean history, but it's very worthwhile from a historiographical perspective. It's a pretty intensive seminar, however, so don't take it lightly, it will show and you won't get that much out of it.",
    "I would recommend the course to anyone seriously interested in Korean history. I would hesitate to recommend the course to just any student because it requires a lot of work.",
    "Although this is a survey course for Korean history, it seemed like the course assumed a certain degree of knowledge of Korea and its history. The topics are interesting, and the course covers them in depth.",
    "I would summarize it as a really effective way to study the history of Korea.",
    "HIST 328J provides a topical history of Korea, focusing on major issues and trends in developing an understanding of Korea as a place, a culture, and a nation. I walked away from the course with a much deeper understanding of \"Korea\" and one which was informed by a variety of backgrounds, including intellectual and cultural movements; gender and societal constructions; urbanization; and international diplomacy and relations. Overall, this was a very good course through which to understand Korean history. The readings were fairly intense and sometimes became quite academic and dense, but definitely provided a wide variety of background through which to understand the central tenets of the course."
