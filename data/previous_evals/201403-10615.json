    "ANTH 771 01 is a comprehensive survey of many different theories used to recognize complex societies all around the world.",
    "Summary: A survey of Complex Societies and their origins. Divergent paths to complexity and a dispelling of the myths of those paths. I recommend this course to any archaeologist or student of prehistory. I would also recommend the course to any undergrad who had an interest in the ancient civilizations of the world.",
    "Yes, it is worth to take.",
    "Early Complex Societies excelled at introducing and evaluating the evolving concept of the Early State and how historic perspectives using neoevolutionary theory ultimately failed to offer a paradigm in which to study them. The weekly speakers greatly enhanced the class and offered students a far better view of how individual societies came in to their own breed of complexity. I would highly recommend this class to other students provided they are ready to take on a sightly heavier workload.",
    "Very good overall look at early complex societies, what they are, how they came to be, and how to analyze them for future purposes.",
    "I would definitely recommend the course to other students, as it offers a unique opportunity to explore a variety of regions in one course in a cohesive and fascinating way. Course lectures were very interesting and readings offered valuable background to frame the lectures and discussions.",
    "The class is a review a number of complex societies found throughout the world. I would recommend it, but I would not that it is a lecture class and not a discussion section.",
    "A great overview of emergent social complexity, making good use of guest specialists, and with a helpful emphasis on theoretical methods for understanding social complexity and formative processes. I'd highly recommend the course!"

   "comments": [
    "It helped me understand theories on complex societies",
    "This course vastly deepened my knowledge in my discipline and will be crucial in my dissertation research. Understanding different paths to complexity allows one to challenge preconceptions about social complexity, what it means and what it meant in the past.",
    "it broadens my knowledge. I could think about my research in different perspectives.",
    "This course helped me to better understand how to view early complex societies and how to evaluate the historic means once used to understand them. By taking this class, I have gained a better understanding of how to utilize various lines of evidence in order to evaluate a society of interest. This class will definitely be of use in my future research.",
    "This course exposed me to some of the debates within archaeology regarding early complexity, social organization, and settlement patterns. It added a better understanding of these issues and allowed the exploration of a variety of archaeological methods and early cultures. It created a strong background for personal research within the department.",
    "This course gave me such a breadth of knowledge about areas around the world and the politics associated with archaeological project. This will help me make comparisons for my dissertation and also gave me a number of debates to think about and how I am going to frame the site I am studying."
