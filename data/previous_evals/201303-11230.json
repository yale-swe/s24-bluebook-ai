   "comments": [
    "Directed Studies, in general, is not for everyone. One shouldn't take the course if one believes in a \"one question, one answer\" view of the universe; the course demands thinking from multiple perspectives. It is also not for those inclined towards procrastination, as reading and essays will catch to students quickly. That being said, so long as one completes the work required, Directed Studies is an incredible experience. It is wholly satisfying to consider how much one reads and understands by the end of the semester, and one really does develop a solid foundation in the humanities.Literature is one of the finest components of Directed Studies, as the works read are prime examples of excellent writing. While other works in the other courses provide interesting ideas, they often obfuscate the meaning with poor writing quality. This is not the case here. The translations of the Medea, the Iliad, and the Commedia not only effectively capture the original languages, but provide incisive use of English as well. Linguistically, nearly every book is excellent. When it comes to literary elements, one also cannot go wrong. Analyzing the themes, motifs, and characters of these works is highly rewarding. Given the quality of Directed Studies instructors and the fine quality of the works, this is a very valuable experience.",
    "An in-depth survey of Western literature, beginning with Homer, moving through the Bible and into the Italian Renaissance with Dante. I would recommend Directed Studies, but only for students who are interested in reading a pretty sizable amount of material.",
    "Absolutely take Directed Studies in general and the Literature class was probably the most interesting. I absolutely felt most drawn to do the reading because I was interested in all of it.",
    "A course that covers and connects several texts from the earlier pieces ofThe western canon, returning to many of the timeless themes that all texts contain.",
    "This is a wonderful course if you want to read a lot and write a lot. It is a survey course, however, so you shouldn't expect to go to far in depth with any particular work. It is incumbent on the student to get what they need to or want to get out of the course. I'd definitely recommend it.",
    "DS is amazing. It's so wonderful being in a tight knit community of people all interested in the same thing reading the same books. The lit curriculum is one of the best and it's amazing to see how the themes morph and change as time progresses. I would highly recommend it to anyone.",
    "DS Lit is the most enjoyable of the 3 DS classes. The works do a good job of building on each other, and it's nice to end the semester with Dante because he shows how the Ancient Greek and Roman tradition and the Christian tradition can be combined.Professor Yeazell is a great section leader. She gives enough background info and guides the discussion but still makes sure that everyone gets a chance to participate."
