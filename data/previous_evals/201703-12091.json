    "I learned about how to diagnose various disorders and the nuances involved in diagnostic interviewing.",
    "Through this course, I learned how to evaluate and apply DSM-5 criteria using the SCID interview. I have a much stronger understanding of the criteria for various DSM-5 conditions, and I feel very comfortable administering the SCID interview and writing diagnostic\/history reports.",
    "This was my first experience with learning the diagnoses and I found it the reading\/lecture materials incredibly helpful--striking a balance between covering basics to encouraging nuance of understanding differentials. I learned throughout the course how to think deeply about each diagnostic category separately and broadly through comparison between the diagnoses when considering differentials. I also began to develop clinical interviewing skills for diagnostic assessment, which I feel like I am off to a good start in building this skill (while knowing that there is a lot to still learn for myself of course!).",
    "I learned so much about how to conduct clinical interviews using SCID-5 criteria."

   "comments": [
    "A strength was the interactive format and I enjoyed the mixture of learning through practice, powerpoints, and videos.",
    "Strengths: In my opinion, this was an excellent course! Mary\/Ava presented the course material in a very clear manner, and provided lots of practical examples of cases that did or did not meet criteria for a given diagnosis. They also provided ample opportunities for student discussion and questions, which I greatly appreciated. Also, they provided very clear and extensive feedback, which was immensely helpful for building diagnostic interviewing and report writing skills. This isn't really a weakness, just a suggestion: I would have liked a little more role-playing and to see how Mary\/Ava would administer certain tricky sections of the SCID. The role playing for the suicide risk assessment was immensely helpful!",
    "There were several strengths to the class, as I've begun to describe earlier and will continue to do so in why I would ABSOLUTELY recommend this class. Three strengths in particular that I wanted to highlight here: the amount of support offered outside of class time, detailed\/constructive feedback on courseworks, and the in-class time spent on practicing a risk assessment. One quick note about a potential area for growth, it would have been helpful to see more examples (either in class or video tapes) of expertly administered SCID interviews. I wasn't always sure and worried that I was \"practicing wrong\" if there was a particular way to be skillful about it.",
    "I thought the course was laid out logically and clearly. I think for coordination purposes, it would have been helpful to have the Advanced Psychopathology class cover a given diagnosis before we got to it in the Assessment class so that the assessment class could be more focused on mechanics of conducting an interview. Regardless, I learned a lot!"

    "Yes I think Mary did a wonderful job of explaining concepts, demonstrating them and allowing students to practice skills.",
    "Yes, absolutely!",
    "Absolutely! I was impressed by how well Mary and Ava balanced support and challenge throughout this learning process. I very much felt that I had all the support and feedback that I needed to take next steps in learning the diagnoses and administering the SCID. I deeply appreciate the time and thought that they put into this course to empower the students in this learning process. Such a great introduction to building core clinical skills!",
    "Absolutely! This course is well-laid out and organized to optimize learning and is an essential course for anyone who will be conducting diagnostic interviews."
