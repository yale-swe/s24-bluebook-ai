   "comments": [
    "Tolga Koker is absolutely awesome. He's dedicated, enthusiastic, and very funny. If you can get him, I would definitely recommend this class. Beware of the curve though...",
    "Yes, provides a brilliant demystification of microeconomics and it interestingly covers some game theory and finance too.",
    "This is a pretty thorough introduction to microeconomics. I am pre-med, so I don't know what prompted me to take this. In retrospect, the lecture is \"easier\" and has a more lenient curve, but if this is a pre-req for a major or something you are really interested in, you will learn a lot through this class. Take Tolga!",
    "It's a tough class and moves really, really quickly, but it's completely possible to keep up. Also go to office hours - Tolga goes through every problem set problem.",
    "I would highly recommend it if your seriously considering econ as a major otherwise take the lecture.",
    "I would recommend Econ 110 to any student with an interest in economics. The material was clear and well-covered, office hours were helpful, and assessments were fair.",
    "If you really like economics and have a strong background in it, take this class. Tolga is absolutely incredible, but the curve for the class makes it hard to do well.",
    "Take it only if you either want to major in econs or is wiling to work hard. Material is not easy, exams are not easy and the curve is steep.",
    "Don't take it. Take the lecture.",
    "This class is a great introductory economics class. It's extremely involved extremely quickly. The seminar style teaching allows for greater engagement with the subject matter. One draw back of this, is that the class is curved strictly, and because of the great teaching, the curve is exceedingly competitive. With just this caveat, I would recommend this course to anyone who is interested in pursuing a social science major.",
    "Econ is definitely an interesting class, and Tolga is quite the character. The math required is not inherently difficult, but it does require some savvy in order to translate the concepts into equations. If you find the material interesting, definitely take it with Tolga. If you're not and only want to take it because you think you should, don't take the class. I had quite a few friends who were very unhappy with that choice.",
    "The course is a very fast intro to economics. Because of the lack of clarity, I can only see myself warning people away from this course, unless they already feel very confident about economics.",
    "Don't take the class if you don't have Tolga. Unless of course you're an econ major",
    "Definitely take ECON 110 with Tolga! It's a bit more intense than the lecture, but Tolga's class is worth it because he's extremely engaging. His class is a really fun one; he's always telling us anecdotes about the Turkish government or about his love life that pertain to econ--and his nervous laugh is adorable! The way he teaches is also really straightforward and clear, though a bit fast-paced. Definitely take advantage of his office hours for help with the P-sets, and definitely take advantage of the course. It's much easier to learn from the class than from the book, and I got the sense that he prepared me much better for the P-sets, midterm, and final than Simons would have. Overall, a good course taught by a great guy.",
    "If you are going to take intro microeconomics, then take it with tolga. I've heard that he lecture and the other professor are less engaging. Tolga at least gets you through the concepts and the coursework.",
    "Take it. Take it with Tolga. Go to office hours (he'll go over the entire problem set for that week), talk to him, get to know him, read the textbook, and you'll be set. Actually pay attention in class - you'll enjoy it. The material and the exams aren't too bad, and the workload is pretty light - one fairly easy problem set every week or so.",
    "I highly recommend you take 110. Especially if you win the lotto and get Tolga, you have to take it. I had never taken an econ course and was only enrolling to gain a cursory knowledge before going into Poli Sci. After this class, I think i might be an econ major. I cannot recommend this highly enough!",
    "The best. Yes",
    "If you feel like you already have some knowledge of econ or a lot of time to spend with the book then take it otherwise it can be overwhelming.",
    "It is a lot of work and tiresome at times, but worth it in the end.",
    "This is a good course for those who have taken economics before. If not, I heard the lecture was better."
