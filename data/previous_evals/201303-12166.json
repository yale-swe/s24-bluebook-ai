   "comments": [
    "I would recommend it to anyone interested in Latin American studies, the intersection of history and anthropology, and the study of resistance. I would say that the class teaches you to really analyze a monograph from many angles and to appreciate its strengths and assess its shortcomings. (Helpful for orals.)",
    "I would highly recommend the class to anyone, especially those interested in resistance theory or Latin America.AMST 650 was a great course led by a stimulating and provocative professor. All of the books we read provided valuable insights on the themes discussed in the class. Class discussions were lively and Professor Joseph kept the class moving. The class load was manageable with only 4 memos and a 12-15 page paper. The books were all interesting and each provided a different look at resistance throughout Latin America.",
    "Excellent course that deals with more advanced themes on Latin American history, politics, and anthropology. The mixture between history and anthropology is good, the books are extremely interesting, and the professor loves what he teaches.",
    "The course is a great introduction into the historiography of Modern Latin America, with a special emphasis on themes of resistance and survival strategies. Even for students with a background in the events of the period, this class provides a foundation for understanding the major works in the field. Additionally, the class grapples with fields of thought in cultural studies and anthropology. Prof. Joseph leads a great discussion, based on the readings (roughly a book a week) and on student presentations. Definitely a class worth taking!",
    "I would wholeheartedly recommend this class to students in the future.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student and would describe it as a useful overview of the literature on a unique cross section of social movements in modern Latin America.",
    "Take this class. You will learn a lot from Gilbert Joseph.",
    "This is a really interesting course that covers a particular theme (resistance, history from below) through various theoretical and geographical treatments for twentieth-century Latin America. I would recommend this course for anyone interested in Latin American history or anthropology or anyone from other fields or area studies interested in the theoretical and methodological treatment of history from below. The diversity of perspectives in our class lead to really interesting discussions and allowed for a variety of viewpoints, avoiding the pigeon-holing of an exclusively Latin Americanist history crowd that might otherwise get bogged down in the historiographic nuts and bolts of the particular field.",
    "If you are interested in modern Latin America history and, more importantly, the history of rebellion, resistance and survival in our hemisphere, take this course. Terrific reading list, lively discussion and, in Professor Joseph a warm, encouraging, experienced and strong steady guide into, through and beyond the material and the subject. I highly recommend.",
    "If you're at all interested in the subject-matter, this is a great course to take."

   "comments": [
    "It helped familiarize me with an important set of themes in modern Latin American history. It helped me prepare for orals and added new dimensions to my own research.",
    "N\/A undergraduate student",
    "This course is an excellent introduction into the literature of modern Latin American history, with some forays into anthropology as well. Prof. Joseph selected a wonderful reading list that can dovetail nicely into preparation for orals, and even serves just as an introduction into diverse themes for future study.",
    "This course provided an opportunity to spend a semester thinking about various methodological approaches to writing and interpreting the history of resistance and the popular classes in Latin America. I enjoyed the pairing of theoretical works early on with geographically-focused monographs later on. This course helped broaden my reading background, especially by bringing a number of anthropology and Caribbean studies books to the table, each particularly useful in my preparation for oral examinations."
