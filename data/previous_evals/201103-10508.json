    "I would recommend this course to students who are interested in distributed system, and has a good foundation on algorithms.",
    "First of all, this course is obviously an advanced course in Computer Science.This course is very useful and important, especially for the students who aim to pursue research in the field of computer theory. From this course, any students can be attractive by the presentation of the instructor (i.e., James) and the lecture is very interesting.I will recommend this course to another student. Of course, I will tell him or her the course is challenging but the content is useful. Please take the course if you like challenge.",
    "Take this class if you are into theory and would like to understand distributed systems at a theoretical level",
    "It is challenging.",
    "It is a good course for every student who is interested in systems, networks and theory. It is fundamental and interesting."

   "comments": [
    "I choose this course only because i am interested in theory. The course give me concepts about how to design and judge a distributed system protocols.",
    "Because my research area is distributed systems, this course is very helpful for my future research. Prior to taking this course, I only knew some basic knowledge on the fundamental design of distributed systems; however, after taking the course, I understand almost all the detailed algorithm design of distributed systems. Therefore, I personally think this course helps me very much.Of course, the presentations of James in the lectures are very attractive, thereby making me learn the content easier and like the course very much.",
    "The material is great for having a different perspective on CS theory and distributed systems"
