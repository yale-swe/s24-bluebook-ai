    "GLBL 361 is a great class for anyone vaguely interested in the topic of violence. While a lot of the material covered is the traditional political science literature, there are some interesting new books and articles that we look at in light of violence. Some of the more recent publications were especially interesting, even for those students who may not have any background on the topic.",
    "If you're interested in civil wars, definitely take this class! Best class so far at Yale on the subject, really covers a wide range of civil wars-related topics; something for everyone. Reading responses are more than just hoops to jump through, and class discussions are well structured and lead.",
    "Great class! Watch out for the long term paper at the end, though. You won't get much help on research and it's only tangentially related to the course material.",
    "I highly recommend taking this seminar if youre interested in gaining a more nuanced understanding of civil conflict and insurgencies in particular. Professor Kocher is straight-forward and down-to-earth, considering all of our various arguments and constructively playing the devils advocate to help tease out our thoughts. The subject matter, while obviously not very uplifting, is timely and pertinent considering the rise of insurgencies and rebellions. This class wont give you many clear-cut answers, but you will have a much deeper understanding of civil conflict that will enable you to ask better questions if this is a field you will pursue further. Overall, one of the best seminars Ive taken at Yale.",
    "Great class on the study of theories about the occurrence and effectiveness of violence. I learned a lot.",
    "Would certainly recommend. Great seminar for PoliSci. Global as well. Or really any major. Interested in Violence or not, it's a cool class"
