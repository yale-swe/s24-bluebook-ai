   "comments": [
    "With Miki Havlickova, this class is phenomenal. You will leave the course with a much better understanding of Calculus, and you'll probably like math more than when you came in. Miki is probably the best math instructor I've ever had.",
    "YES, but probably only if you can get Miki. Honestly, I've heard such terrible things about nearly every other instructor.",
    "Math 120 is a typical math class (weekly psets, two midterms, final) but begins to cover more in-depth, useful math. It is a lot of work but very interesting.",
    "Math 120 is a good course, the work is neither too overwhelming or too challenging. The tests are generally very fair and similar to problems in problem sets (nothing overly conceptual or application questions that you might not have ever seen before). Also, take it with Miki-- she actually teaches and that makes a HUGE difference. Be warned though, Math 120 is very fast-paced. You need to stay on top of things because once you fall even a little behind, it is difficult to get back on track and catch up.",
    "I would recommend Math 120 to another student who feels CONFIDENT that he\/she will be up to the challenge to learn lots of content! (Notice how I did not say confident in their current capabilities.) Math 120 is not for the faint of heart who will give up after trying just a bit. No, Math 120 is for people who are up to the challenge! Take chances, make mistakes, get messy!! -Ms. Frizzle.",
    "A course that is somewhere in between a theoretical multivariate calculus and a practical applications course. You learn about the basics of applying calculus concepts to 3D graphs, as well as several physics-esque theorems that apply to graphs of both 2D and 3D surfaces.",
    "Math 120 is a challenging and comprehensive course in multi variable calculus that moves fast but is extremely interesting and you can have success if you put in the time.",
    "Take this course! MATH 120 is an awesome class! It is one of the best math classes I have taken here. The topics are really interesting to learn. It does require a lot of work, but it's definitely worth it. Miki is an awesome professor! I would highly recommend taking this class!",
    "I would recommend this class to another student who has decided that they really want to learn every aspect of multivariable calculus. As a social science\/humanities major, I really should have taken math 118.",
    "Yes! Definitely take it! It can be challenging at some point, but it's worth it!",
    "Difficult, but not impossible, and very important if you want to go further in math. Very interesting most of the time, mind-bending with some regularity. Yes, I'd recommend it--though, I'd say you should probably only take it if you honestly like math. You really do need to work hard on concepts and practice, which probably wouldn't be fun if you're not actually interested.",
    "I would recommend MATH 120 if the student is good at visualizing objects in a three dimensional space. THe concepts are much more difficult to grasp compared to MATH 115, as they are much more abstract. The class also moves at a much quicker pace.",
    "Fast, challenging.",
    "Pretty average multivariable calc class",
    "Math 120 is the natural continuation of the math 112-115 calculus sequence. I wouldn't take it just for fun, but it is a good way to get a QR.",
    "To reiterate: take it if you need to, take it if you like a little challenge or want some more math in your life, and no matter what, try to take it with Miki.",
    "If you are looking for a math credit and have not taken multi, this is your class. Not too difficult if you put in the work.",
    "No, not unless you need multi-var for something else.",
    "I would recommend Math 120 to students who a.) love math, b.) need it for a prereq, and c.) are willing to put in the amount of time and effort necessary to do well. It's a really hard class but can be very rewarding if you put in the necessary amount of work and time. Take it with Miki because she is just the best.",
    "It is a tough course. I wouldn't take it unless it is a prerequisite for your potential major, especially because the course moves very quickly through the material and the curve is not as generous as other courses because many of the students have take multivariable calculus in high school."
