    "Much better at mellifluous translations of literature! Broke me out of my standard \"word for word\" literal translations. First Greek class that has had me engage critically with outside sources and has been treated like a literature class instead of a grammar course!",
    "I think I got better at translating and working with Homeric Greek. More importantly, though, I also learned how to think about the reception of ancient texts: charitably but not uncritically.",
    "Working knowledge of Homeric Greek, with appreciation of the nuances of the Ionic dialect; introduction to the questions and debates about the Homeric texts in scholarship today, including authorship, composition, structure, language, oral poetry, genre, themes.",
    "Deeper knowledge of Ancient Greek, greater familiarity with the nuances, beauty, and history of Homeric poetry, and of the epic in general."

   "comments": [
    "Thought that the structure of the class was fantastic (one day of pure translation, one day of literary comment on the passage of interest, one day of outside reading engagement). I think that a lot of the success of the class had to do with the high engagement of the course, but Treasa did a fantastic job at moderating.",
    "This course is particularly well-structured. Weekly quizzes were useful; reading criticism and talking about reception history added a lot to my readings of the Greek texts. The only improvement I'd suggest would be spending more than one day per week engaging directly with the Greek.",
    "This was my favorite class this semester. The way Treasa structured the class into separate days of translation, commentary, and secondary reading was highly effective, and I learned so much about Homer that I would not have otherwise. Dividing the syllabus thematically, but also allowing us the experience of reading through a whole book, was a triumph of pedagogy. Higher-level discussion is exciting, and it was what I enjoyed the most from this course, but it comes at the expense of philological foundations, which was what I expected out of an L4 Greek class: grinding vocab, solidifying syntax, parsing every third word we read. Treasa was a little too lax with us in this regard (too willing to let go of certain particles). I became a better Homerist, but regressed a little as a Hellenist.",
    "The balance of translation and literary thought was really great. I loved the weekly pacing of the class."

   "comments": [
    "YES! Take this course. I think a lot of it is dependent on the instructor you get (Treasa was amazing), but the material is necessary for any student coming out of introductory Greek courses. We had a good balance of translation and literary critique, but I walked away from the course feeling accomplished and with better sight reading skills.",
    "Yes, absolutely. Unfortunately, the teaching can change year to year but Treasa Bell taught it wonderfully when I took it.",
    "I would. This course was a satisfying capstone to a beginner\/intermediate Greek sequence.",
    "absolutely! Homer is the flower of the Greek language, the fruit of your two years of labor. L4 Greek introduces you not only to Homeric language, but also to current trends in Homeric scholarship. Take this class if you have even a passing interest in Homer.",
    "Absolutely. The texts we read are enduringly great, and they offer a portal into another world."
