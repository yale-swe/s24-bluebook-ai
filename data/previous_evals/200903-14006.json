   "comments": [
    "Strengths: Diverse range of material and resources usedWeaknesses: too many concept sheets that distracted me from really focusing on the other class assignments",
    "More consistency between TAs in grading. Less reading.",
    "The small group section for this course, taught be Heather Cole-Lewis, was far better than the lecture (Heather did an outstanding job teaching the section, led discussion very well, very impressive knowledge and ability to bring out the key concepts for each week)The lecture, on the other hand, was poor, almost useless. Simply regurgitating the readings, most of the concepts discussed were basically common sense. The subject matter was very basic (if you knew what \"public health\" meant, you knew this material) Moreover, the lecturer was often wrong about medical facts.",
    "Not a bad brief overview of social and behavioral sciences; concept sheet assignments were a bit ambitious (including 6-8 papers in a 2-page, double spaced, synthesis response? difficult.)",
    "The strengths are that there is a huge variety of course material, and I find most things every week to be interesting. I also like that lectures are supplemented with small group discussions.The weakness is that, honestly, concept sheets are a pain in the ass to write. It takes a good 4-5 hours to read all the articles and synthesize a cohesive essay about them. I do like the concept sheets in that I got a lot more out of the articles when I wrote about them ... but is there any way to make the writing less academic? Maybe we can make an outline that synthesizes the articles instead?",
    "Strengths: Readings, great TAs, interesting subject matter, experienced and passionate professor. The concept sheets are a great way to get students to actually read and pay attention to the readings and process them in the context of health - great idea!",
    "The course was good as individual lectures, but didn't come together in a cohesive whole very well. I liked discussion section a lot, and wondered if it could be used to create a more clear theme or pattern in the semester, like if each section were focused on how to solve the problems (what programs you would put in place, or policies or research needed). That way, though the subjects were disparate, there could be a skill acquired in thinking about solutions. That's what the concept sheet could be about, too.I also would take out the readings on genetics. The conversation and activity about spit parties was very interesting, but the readings weren't as good or as interesting as other weeks.",
    "Very interesting.",
    "The instructor's enthusiasm and passion for the topics are a major strength. the teaching fellows were also well chosen and contributed to the course. in class discussion was also nice. a limitation is that we only touched upon each of the issues, but this is intrinsic to the nature of the course and really can't be addressed.",
    "A thorough and broad overview of the majors topics.",
    "discussion sessions might be more helpful than lecture, lectures are pretty much just a summary of the required readings.",
    "the lectures for this course were very intriguing. There is a lot of reading and writing assignment, but the topics are interesting.",
    "There was not enough cohesiveness from one week to the next.",
    "The course was very tasking on students. There were a lot of papers to write, which sometimes seemed unnecessary. The TA sessions were useful and helped me to integrate and apply the concepts or issues raised in class. There should be fewer concept sheets over the course. Two or three should be enough. The op-ed and media analysis were very useful and exciting to write. It gave a new and interesting dimension to the course and opened up my senses to medical journalism.",
    "I felt this course did not aid in my education and there assignment load was cumbersome. I did not feel engaged in the assignments, in particular the OP-ED and I felt that the submissions should not have been required. It seemed that the most important part of the course was the theory section (which was needed in depth for the final paper) and not enough time was spent on it. I would recommend having less reading per class, in general, and work on more focused information.",
    "I enjoyed this class because I am really interested in the topics we discussed (since I am in the SBS Division), but I did feel like it was A LOT of work. There were a lot of assignments to keep track of and even the smaller assignments (i.e. concept sheets) took quite a chunk of time and effort to complete almost every week. I thoroughly enjoyed the discussion section each week - it was great opportunity to get more depth from the topics we discussed and I am more proned to participate in a smaller group setting than a big lecture hall, so it was a great atmosphere to share ideas and opinions.",
    "Strength: it's a good introductory course. Weaknesses: for students who already think about the social \/ behavioral aspects of health and illness, I felt the course was too basic.",
    "I took this course to fulfill the sbs requirement and was not otherwise particularly interested in the subject. The course did give a solid overview of social and behavioral issues in health but was a LOT of work. The lectures were fair, though could be more organized and concise. Most people were not attending the lectures by the end of the semester. The 8-10 readings each week are very lengthy and take a significant amount of time to do thoroughly, as you are expected to for at least 6 weeks for which you are required to write \"concept sheets.\"",
    "I found the class to be very interesting and well designed. It was certainly, by far, my favorite class of the semester. I feel that a strength was certainly having a class and then a section, meeting at the same time. It really helped to clear up the material. The one improvement I would say would be to make the concept sheets due after the lecture, in order to clarify the readings further, but this isn't a large issue at all.",
    "This is a poorly organized course. Every chapter is poorly linked with each other. It's more like a lecture series rather than a formal course.Although there is a heavy load of homework and readings, I don't feel I learn much from the course.",
    "This course is an excellent overview of behavioral concepts. The reading was heavy but very interesting. The term paper was challenging but I found it to be a very rewarding experience.",
    "Weaknesses:Having to do concept sheets. If you want to ensure we do the reading, maybe place more emphasis on participation in the discussion sections, or have students lead the discussion sections.Class of 2 hours of lecture is literally unbearable. Must make class time shorter, or more interactive.",
    "Lots of work. Section was a little stale.",
    "This course has heavy workload. There are lots of writings and readings. And all the assigned reading have to be shown up in you writing. It's realy a time consuming course. But anyway I learn many things which I didn't know before.One way to improve this course is to encourge students using class website to discuss. Prof. can provide some incentive such as extra credits to active students.",
    "you write the same paper over and over again",
    "I do not think that all of these assignments were necessary. If we had half the assignments it would still be a class where students would invest enough time.",
    "I understand that as a survey course, this class was necessarily broad in scope. The strength was that it introduced the wide range of social and behavioral influences on health. The major weakness is that I left feeling like I had learned nothing. Do we really need to devote a lecture to explaining that obesity is a public health problem? This class offered no new knowledge and no new skills. An SBS requirement should be necessary, but this class felt like a waste of time.",
    "strengths of this course include regular weekly practice of critical writing skills, the practical and theoretical cross-training to make persuasive social behavioral arguments founded in scientific evidence.",
    "Strengths:-broad survey of variety of SBS topics-guest lecturersWeaknesses:-length of lectures-assignments seemed like 'busy work' instead of truly testing our knowledge of the subject",
    "Major strengths of the course include: (1) the topic itself; (2) the instructor as well as guest speakers; and (3) the assignments because of practicality and they way in which they reinforce the material. Weaknesses may include the lack of integration of public health divisions outside of SBS.",
    "The course does a good job of bringing to light social sciences, but it seemed like each problem could be plugged into a certain formula: \"_____ is a problem because _____ and causes a disparity between ____\" There should be more uniqueness to each topic.",
    "This is a good introductory course but it is a little too general and broad. For example, I was also taking \"Preventive Interventions\" and felt that a lot of the material overlapped.The sections were definitely more interesting.",
    "The two hour lectures were SERIOUS overkill. I don't need to read 5-8 papers and then have definitions provided and the papers' foci repeated back to me.I got the impression (particularly from the stress lecture) that this class bad been taught the same way with the same papers for years now (considering how out-of-date some of the assigned literature was).I thoroughly enjoyed the guest lectures by Christina and Eric Whitaker.I understand the purpose of the concept sheets (to prove that we've done the readings and theorize outside of the basic concepts presented); however, this is GRADUATE school and if other students want to waste their time here and choose not to maximize their education by not doing the readings, that should not result in my having to creatively summarize 5-8 papers on a weekly basis for half of the semester. I promise, discussion WILL RUN OK without this assignment. Alternatively, perhaps students from each section should have to write concept sheets for certain weeks and present to section.I loved writing the OP\/ED. Media analysis was less intersting. The final paper was a fine assignment.",
    "This course gave a great overview of all of the topics in social and behavior sciences. However, it felt a little bit like undergrad or even high school because we were expected to write concept sheets every week, which were basically glorified book reports for the 8 journal articles we were expected to read weekly. I understand that we are expected to read and have a solid knowledge of current literature, however the articles were generally redundant and it just felt forced having to read all of them and incorporate them into a paper. It would be a lot better if 2-3 solid articles were assigned every week and analyzed in discussion - without a concept sheet. I think that we can be trusted to read the articles, we are in graduate school.",
    "I think that the best part of the course was the theory and the lecture series on social capital \/ networks. Otherwise, I found that a lot of the lectures followed the same format, namely: 1) X is a problem 2) here is why it's a problem and an it's increasing problem 3) we should devote a lot of resources to solving or addressing X. I'm not sure how saying that all these discussion topics are issues and that we should do something about them adds to the discourse. Unfortunately, particularly in section everyone always had to tiptoe around issues and most students had nothing really special or original to contribute.",
    "greater introductory class on SBS, but too much time on concept sheet, requirements could be improved",
    "The assignments for the course were valuable, especially the op\/ed and term paper. These assignments give students the chance to explore their individual interests within a social and behavioral context. I realize that this is a survey course; however, I found the lecture material to be too general in nature for me to find practical application in my division. This is a weakness of the course, not the instructor.",
    "I think that the three hour class time was too long. Ideally, the class would be split into two one and a half hour sessions, but I realize that this may not be possible.",
    "I was really disappointed in this course. First because I felt the concept sheets were assignments worthy of a junior high school student learning how to write a 5-paragraph essay; second, because the term paper requiring us to prepare an intervention seemed a little out of the blue considering we did not discuss how to design an intervention- let alone one for sbs- the entire semester. I'm an SBS concentration, and I didn't like the class.",
    "Concept sheets were useful, but tedious; would be better if we weren't required to use ~8 articles in a two page paper (either, assign fewer articles or require that we include 3-4).",
    "I liked the discussion group (had a great TF)The articles were, for the most part, well chosen and interesting.The assigned papers were good learning exercises, and interesting as assignments (i.e. the media analysis and the op-ed).The guest speakers were great.",
    "One of the biggest strengths of this course is that it challenges students to tackle public health issues from a multi-disciplinary perspective. There is though a heavy writing component, which can be both a strength and a weakness. Overall though I found the class fascinating and really enjoyed it.",
    "concept sheet seemed like busy work- the discussion sections would be just as fruitful without the concept sheets and just having the students read the material",
    "1. Good readings although voluminous for each week.2. The classes were very boring and long winding.3. Large volume of work with tons of assignments.4. Grading was very subjecting as it was done by different TAs and differed even with the same TA.",
    "strengths: the discussion section was where the course material was actually learnedweaknesses: what was the point of the lecture? if we are not accountable for the material in a core required class then it is no wonder why no one shows up. The lecture was structured more as a class for SBS majors.",
    "Extremely unfocused course. Everything \"Behavioral\" was lumped together with no theme: true psychosocial influences (peer behavior, etc.), with disparities\/gender issues, with mind-body issues. So broad as to be useless. And most of these topics were very obvious or superficial - this was more of a college-level course than a course for SPH, where the students have presumably self-selected and know something about health."

    "Instructor: Jeannette R Ickovics \u00a0The professor was friendly, insightful and approachableThe professor singled out students in the class and discussion groups for there performance, which created an environment of competition instead of cooperation among students.There is a lot of room for improvement on instruction for the final course project.",

    "Instructor: Jeannette R Ickovics \u00a0See above",
    "Instructor: Jeannette R Ickovics \u00a0Obviously knowledgeable and all that, but not very engaging\/comfortable to interact with. Each time she visited our discussion group, it somehow turned into her doing most of the talking and me (at least) not feeling able to contribute.",
    "Instructor: Jeannette R Ickovics \u00a0Jeanette is an extremely good lecturer, and I always enjoy that she uses contemporary issues in her discussions. She does, however, tend to be very opinionated on certain issues, and it does alienate those of us who feel differently on those subjective issues.My biggest complaint is that class ALWAYS goes long. The course is supposed to end at 11:50, but she'll often keep going through slides until noon. It would be rude of me to leave in the middle of a lecture, but I have to be in another class by noon! She needs to have more respect for our time.",
    "Instructor: Jeannette R Ickovics \u00a0Strengths: Strong knowledge and passion on SB health. Involvement in the community health picture and the ability to translate that into the classroom. Experience.Weaknesses: There could be less name dropping.",
    "Instructor: Jeannette R Ickovics \u00a0She was incredibly enthusiastic about the material. I felt a little like the class was overly disparate and didn't have great cohesion, and having her as a constant helped to dispel that belief a bit. I was impressed with her dedication to this perspective on public health.",
    "Instructor: Jeannette R Ickovics \u00a0Alittle verbose but great.",
    "Instructor: Jeannette R Ickovics \u00a0Dr. Ickovics was fantastic. I enjoyed her lecture style, and her strategy of highlighted much of the work done at YSPH in each of the topics covered. there was a nice blend of more \"historical research\" and current studies, and she really is so energetic. she responded quickly and thoughtfully to emails, and I really enjoyed this course, even though it is not in my division. at first I was overwhelmed with the workload she assigned, but in retrospect it was helpful to understanding some of these complex issues.",
    "Instructor: Jeannette R Ickovics \u00a0She was an excellent communicator of subject matter, but may need to refine sensitivities to the needs of her students.",
    "Instructor: Jeannette R Ickovics \u00a0She is extremely knowledgeable in a wide breadth of subjects. However, sometimes her lecturing can turn into preaching.",
    "Instructor: Jeannette R Ickovics \u00a0The instructor motivates students to participate during lecture. She also does a great job of relating her lectures to current news events.",
    "Instructor: Jeannette R Ickovics \u00a0She was very passionate about the topics and always had interesting lectures.",
    "Instructor: Jeannette R Ickovics \u00a0Dr Ickovics is very passionate about her work and her passion is infective. She is very versatile and really good at what she does. However, I think she should realize that not everyone can move at the same pace as she does. She pushed us hard and I guess it brought out the best in us. She instilled the important ideas and concepts required by the course and ensured we followed current trends in research. Overall, she is an excellent lecturer but maybe passionate to a fault if there is anything like that.",
    "Instructor: Jeannette R Ickovics \u00a0Did not interact much with the professor, she did come to section but I felt like she did not take our opinions seriously and tried to up each statement with something better.",
    "Instructor: Jeannette R Ickovics \u00a0Dr. Ickovics is good instuctor. She was very passionate about the different topics and she invited some great guest speakers to address different issues related to social and behavioral influences on health. The class seemed really lecture-oriented and didn't allow for much participation (except in discussion section). She did also seem to get pretty political in some of her lectures.",
    "Instructor: Jeannette R Ickovics \u00a0Very good lecturer and very responsive to students.",
    "Instructor: Jeannette R Ickovics \u00a0Dr. Ickovics is very passionate about her field and her work and that comes through in her lectures. She is upfront about her personal beliefs and that has a big impact on the tone of the class. She clearly wants to engage the students, appreciates class participation, and is very willing to meet with students. That said, given the size of the class and the prominent role of the TAs, you will not have any personal interaction with her if you do not make the effort.",
    "Instructor: Jeannette R Ickovics \u00a0The course instructor did a wonderful job of not only conveying her passion and expertise in the social behavioral sphere of public health, she also was able to stimulate a great deal of interest in the issues addressed in the course among her students. Dr. Ickovics was always remarkably prepared for her lectures and able to cover a vast amount of material in each lecture. Of equal importance in my opinion was her strong commitment to finding the time to meet with students to discuss course projects or course material whenever requested.",

    "Instructor: Jeannette R Ickovics \u00a0She always presented interesting material, sometime a little basic, especially for people in the SBS concentration. My only qualm with her was that she tends to speak very loudly during lecture, often so loud that I wished I was sitting in the back row.",
    "Instructor: Jeannette R Ickovics \u00a0Super enthusiastic, wonderful professor.",
    "Instructor: Jeannette R Ickovics \u00a0Dr. Ickovics is wonderful. Her lectures were very interesting and attractive. She covered many comptempory topics or opinions in her lectures.",
    "Instructor: Jeannette R Ickovics \u00a0Dr. Ickovics is clearly passionate about SBS, and very knowledgeable in her field. Her best moments were interacting with small groups in section, where I found her to be interesting, dynamic, and genuinely engaging with her students. Her lecture style, however, consisted mainly of reading text-heavy slides to us for two hours a week.On a side note, although I may personally have agreed with her on many issues, I found her recurring need to inject her personal politics into lecture extremely unprofessional. We're paying tuition to learn public health, not to listen to an individual's political beliefs.",
    "Instructor: Jeannette R Ickovics \u00a0Jeannette is inspiring! She actively practices collaboration. The number of other authors of similar studies referenced in lecture was sometimes dizzying (avg = 6., sometimes = 10-12 references)but it demonstrates her commitment to \"prove\" social science through concurrence\/coherence, and definately adds positive energy to her colleagues. The lecture would be better if limited to 1.5 hours. Attendance at lecture would increase if the papers weren't due at the beginnning of class, but at the beginning of discussion section.",
    "Instructor: Jeannette R Ickovics \u00a0Dr. Ickovics certainly has an engaging and dynamic personality. I don't think I learn well from her teaching style, however. I would prefer to learn more about the subject matter at hand than about Dr. Ickovics' personal connection to the researchers presented. In my opinion, the casual conversations and news stories at the beginning of each class seemed more like time fillers than substance.",
    "Instructor: Jeannette R Ickovics \u00a0Dr. Ickovics is an extraordinary individual and professor. Her passion for public health (particularly through the SBS lens) really shines through in the lectures. She's very approachable outside of the classroom as well, which enhances the learning experience. She actively motivates students to aspire to achieve lofty goals. The only weakness I noted was based on one lecture in which Dr. Ickovics essentially read her slides; the slides were interesting, however more discussion would have been appreciated.",
    "Instructor: Jeannette R Ickovics \u00a0She was nice. I would recommend that she rethink the way she grades. The concept sheets may seem simple, but require a significant amount of work and count for surprisingly little. The op ed was enjoyable because we were able to creatively think instead of be confined into specific, sometimes disjointed readings. The media analysis was kind of an off assignment, but the most peculiar part was that all of that extremely involved work counted for surprisingly little compared to a grant proposal at the end that was weighted the most. Its just that none of the assignments seemed confluent.",
    "Instructor: Jeannette R Ickovics \u00a0Although we only had lecture once a week, they were basically repetitions of the papers we were assigned to read and new material was not included.",
    "Instructor: Jeannette R Ickovics \u00a0I really did not like the lectures; period. However, I think Dr. Ickovics has A LOT of field experience, and accordingly a lot of knowledge, to share with the class. I would have rather sat in on two hours each week learning how to actually practice public health from her, a focus that is seriously lacking from the curricula at YSPH.",
    "Instructor: Jeannette R Ickovics \u00a0Dr. Ickovics is very knowledgeable and gave a great overview of all of the topics within the field. The lectures were generally long and uninteresting, however. I think that there were very few people that actually attended by the endof the semester.",

    "Instructor: Jeannette R Ickovics \u00a0Her greatest strength is her enthusiasm for the course and the material. I could have had two lectures per week rather than one! I always left class very charged up and motivated.",

    "Instructor: Jeannette R Ickovics \u00a0She was excellent. Very articulate, knew her stuff.",
    "Instructor: Jeannette R Ickovics \u00a0A really talented lecturer or lesson planner might be able to make the broad and shallow course work by acknowledging it as a multi-topic survey course, but Dr. Ickovics (while personally very warm and friendly) was a very disorganized lecturer, spending as much time on personal digressions, news of the day and political cheerleading as the lecture topic. Most students stopped going to lecture because of this - not because they disagreed with her politics but because very little meaningful teaching took place."

    "The TA was wonderful. She provided excellent leadership of discussions sessions, was available to students and provided good feedback on assignments.The TA (Heather Sipsma) was the bes TA I have ever had. No improvements recommended.",
    "Very informative but grading was highly subjective and differed greatly from other TAs.",
    "Outstanding TA, Heather Cole-Lewis.",
    "Marie Bragg - is great. she manages to be really relaxed and easygoing while maintaining a high level of discussion and efficiency in class.",
    "Ed was fine. He grades well and gave good feedback on our homework.",
    "Heather Cole-Lewis:The TA section was my favorite part of the class. Heather provided structured conversation and information while at the same time, treating us all as peers and equals and letting us learn from one another. It's a rare quality in a TA, and she does a great job with it!",
    "Christina was AMAZING. She was always well prepared and created a positive environment and community within the group. She drew us out and created really interesting conversations.",
    "Heather Cole Lewis was amazing.",
    "Heather Cole-Lewis was an exceptional TA, she had some really insightful comments that helped connect all of the lectures together. I think we had a pretty good discussion group, but she had a nice way of conducting the conversations and challenging us to see things in different ways. a weakness to the discussion session was the time- sometimes an hour really seemed too short, and I didn't particularly like the \"competition\" sections with the other discussion groups.",
    "The TA, Edward Berchick, was a competent leader of group discussion; however, he would benefit by enhancing his communication skills and flexibility during the sessions.",
    "Heather. Great TA.",
    "Heather Sipsma was extremely helpful throughout the semester and always available when necessary",
    "TAs do an excellent job of leading discussion section.",
    "My TA was very helpful and approachable during my sections",
    "Heather Cole-LewisHeather was great, she was always well-prepared for discussion and stimulated the group.",
    "The TA Marie Bragg, performed her duties well. I got the feeling that all we did during the sessions fit perfectly with what Dr Ickovics would have wanted us to do",
    "Christina was a great TA. I felt section redeemed the class in terms of education. I felt she was more at our level andwanted to interact with us on a more constructive level, and not just lecture at us.",
    "My TA was Heather Sipsma. She was an excellent TA. She was very responsive to questions, especially about assignments. She led great disussions during our weekly section and she showed her passion for public health through her own intersts.",
    "Christina was a fantastic TA. She did a great job of facilitating discussion, even when our section was not particularly talkative. She also provided very helpful feedback on our papers.",
    "The greatest weakness of the class is the overly powerful role held by the TAs. There are weekly TA discussion sections and your TA will grade every assignment (all assignments are papers). My TA was Ed Berchick, who complained about the amount of work involved in the position and generally seemed to resent it. He was very discouraging in discussion sections, making the students hesitant to participate. He was also very critical in his grading of writing assignments, but inconsistently so, making it difficult to understand what he was looking for.",
    "Heather Cole-Lewis was my TA. She was always well prepared for discussion sections and quite familiar with the readings of the week. Heather always provided prompt feedback on assignments. She was an excellent discussion moderator and TA for the course.",
    "My TA is quite nice. However the discussion group is generally at high-school level. Everyone tries to say something so obvious and superficial as their opinions, such as \"education can be a good way to blablabla...\"",
    "Strengths: very organized.Weakness: sometimes the grading rationale was a little difficult to understand.After meeting with the TA (Ed Berchick), I noticed an increase in responsiveness and explanations of grading. Ed was very professional about this meeting and it was a positive experience overall.",
    "Ed. Although I though his grading was fair the discussions were frustrating. It was clear he was a philosophy major in undergrad. He was not very effective at eliciting conversations.",
    "Heather Cole Lewis was awesome. She was very helpful and accessible whenever I needed help with an assignment. he was also very humorous and made discussion enjoyable.",
    "Great.",
    "My TA is Ed. He is very good and helpful. My TA sessesion were organized very well. The best thing is that he read the turned-in assignment very carefully and was able to offer useful comments. Thanks",
    "excellent",
    "Heather did a fantastic job of leading great discussions and interesting sections. I really appreciated the way she tried to change the format each week. She was very helpful and approachable.",
    "Heather Simpsa was a tremendous leader who created a great environment for discussion and was always engaged in the conversation, challenging us to think forward into new ideas in the discussion. She was avaialable to me at all points during the semester and I would be lucky to learn with her again.",
    "Heather Cole-Lewis was a wonderful TA who led engaging discussions in section. More feedback on written assignments would have been helpful.",
    "Marie A. Bragg was a great TA (TF,to be accurate). She actively engaged most students and organized creative sections that reinforced and also enhanced the information from lecture.",
    "I literally felt unbelievably lucky to have Christina Roberto as my TA. She is the sole reason I enjoyed this class (which should not take away anything from the instructor).",
    "Heather was helpful with her feedback.",
    "Marie Bragg- she was a good, thoughtful, well-organized TA. I understand that this was a very rough semester for her though, and I\"m not sure she was able to fully engage in the class dynamics.Combining with other sections for certain weeks was both fun and interesting as we got to interact with and learn from other students one-on-one.",
    "My TA, Christina Roberto, was incredible. She was very knowledgeable, helpful and approachable. We always had very good conversations about the material in our discussion section. Also, her lecture on obesity was probably one of the best lectures that we had during the entire semester.",
    "My TA was good (Heather Sipsma) she facilitated the discussion section. I think that sometimes though, she needs to be more willing to tell a student that what they had just said was wrong or what they said was completely counterfactual with what had been discussed in class (particularly when it's clear the offending student had not done the work)",
    "great TA",
    "The TA was very helpful during office hours with assignments and gave thoughtful feedback on concept sheets. Discussion activities always provided interesting approaches to each week's topic.",
    "I thought the TA for my section was very good. Occasionally, the conversation would steer off topic, but he was able to reign it in. I would have liked more direction prior to the reading on what to look out for or what we should focus on before coming to discussion section.",
    "Marie Bragg is one of the best TAs I've had, including both my undergraduate and graduate classes. She's incredibly helpful, organized, and runs her sections really well.",
    "Heather Sipsma was a great TA- she did a good job stimulating discussion during section (not always an easy task) and was helpful and responsive.",
    "My TA was great (Marie Bragg). She did an incredible job of guiding discussions and supplying feedback to students. Really friendly and pleasant to work with.",
    "(Christina Roberto)TF was great--she pushed\/challenged our group quite a bit but was also nice about it. Kudos.",
    "Heather Sipsma was fabulous. I loved our discussion group. She kept the discussion on track\/going when we swayed off on tangents without forcing it. She also tries very hard to help us with any questions we have regarding anything and everything, which I was very appreciative of.",
    "heather sipsma was an excellent TA, very good at stimulating discussion as well as sharing her own opinion without being overbearing.",
    "TA Edward Berchick:Very good",
    "Marie Bragg - did a very good job with our section, appropriately low-key, great."

   "question_text": "How would you summarize this course for a fellow student? Would you recommend it to another student? Why or why not?",
   "comments": [
    "The course involved a lot of work, but it's worth it.",
    "Would definitely recommend it for its ability to make people consider social and behavioral contexts that influence health outcomes.",
    "Take it if it is required for your concentration track.",
    "It's required, so not too much to say. I thought it was interesting but didn't contribute a whole lot to my public health education.",
    "The course is a lot more work than you'd expect from an elective core class. There's 6 concept sheets, an oped, a media analysis AND a 20-page final paper ... it's a little overkill unless you're really interested in SBS. I'd recommend it because I am personally interested in these sorts of topics, but I would recommend caution for those who are less inherently interested.",
    "Lots of reading and writing. This course is heavy on the work, but I really enjoy the subject matter. I would recommend the class to students who are interested in having discussions about the social and behavioral factors that shape health in this country. The lectures are a little intense and a little long, but in the end, the ways it opens your mind to thinking of public health in different ways is helpful for the rest of your experience here. I'd recommend it, but be honest about the workload and lecture style of the instructor.",
    "This is a true survey course, meaning that each week is completely different. The readings don't fit together, which means you have to look for themes yourself. It is a fair amount of work, but the writing assignments are interesting and applicable to real life, and much of the reading is interesting.",
    "Extremely high work-load but u get to read alot of interesting stuff.",
    "The course is a good overview to the social and behavioral foundations of public health. Disparity, among race\/ethnicity\/gender\/socioeconomic status is a major theme as well as psychosocial issues and social context. Be prepared to challenge yourself, I enjoyed the class much more than I thought I would as many students might be a little dismissive of some of the components as too \"touchy-feely\" but there is a lot of discussion of empirical evidence supporting the role these issues play in health and health care, and people going into public health need to understand the interaction of SBS and health. This course provides an excellent overview of these issues. Absolutely recommend.",
    "A lot of reading and writing. The heavy workload is unnecessary.Would not recommend.",
    "If people are interested in social and behavioral sciences it is very interesting. However, be prepared for A LOT of work.",
    "I recommend this course for anyone who has never taken a social behaviors course. If you have, then the lecture information may seem redundant.",
    "The course provides you with an excellent perspective of social and behavioral issues. However, with Dr Ickovics,I can say it is a whole lot of work. If I were to take the course again, I will spend the hours set out for lectures working on my concept sheets or other papers required by the course. I am not saying you should miss lectures but the way the course is structured, more importance is attributed to the TA sessions, concept sheets and other papers than the lectures. No examinations. If you can manage your time pretty well, the stress of writing papers may not be a problem.",
    "I would not recommend this course- while I haven't taken the other class that fulfills the sbs requirement, I would recommend the other. I felt this was not a productive use of my time. This course was an overview of the social side of public health- and one, in my opinion, that did not enhance my understanding of the subject.",
    "I would recommend this class, but with the caveat that the course comes with a lot of work. It is one of the core classes, so I recommend taking it the first semester, since any semester you take it will be a packed semester.",
    "This course is a good introduction to SBS, particularly for EMD and biostat students.",
    "This course is a lot of work, more than any other first year MPH course. If you are interested in the topic you might enjoy it, but generally people did not. Having a good TA makes a huge difference in this class. There is a LOT of weekly reading, 6 \"concept sheets,\" an op-ed, a media analysis, and a research proposal for a final paper. The concept sheets are the most arduous part of the class.",
    "It's required course and you have to get through it.",
    "Professor is good, knows her stuff. Grade really depends on your TA. its a lot of work.",
    "I wouldn't recommend this course to other students as it is very common sense based. I had already had a class like this previously, so this just reinforced much of what i already knew.",
    "Lots of work. Mandatory.",
    "If you want to take another course which has heavy workload too, you need to concern about if you can do both them well or not.",
    "This is a requirement for many, and a large survey lecture. I wouldn't recommend it if you can find a way out of it. This class imparts no new knowledge and teaches no new skills. Everything covered in the course can be better explored somewhere else.",
    "to a fellow student: don't be fooled! Yes, social behavioral characteristics associated with disease are common sense (e.g. depressed people get sick more often) but the amount of reading and writing you will do for this course are tremendous and may not directly serve your purposes at YSPH.",
    "Broad survey of general SBS topics.",
    "A good foundation course for the social and behavioral influences on health. If you are bent toward the psychological and social sciences, this is definitely the course for you. You will love the assignments and the work they require. Furthermore, the readings (which are alot) will not be a burden but rather a boon for those who enjoy the social sciences, especially as they relate to health outcomes.",
    "An annoying amount of work throughout the semester that counts a little for your grade then a random grant proposal that counts for the majority of it. But the material is useful to know in applications to things you may be interested in.",
    "It is helpful, especially the final paper, if you are interested in designing a project for the summer.",
    "You have to take it, so suck it up and make the most of it, specifically related to the assignments: THESE ARE OPPORTUNITIES TO WORK ON YOUR THESIS OR PLAN YOUR INTERNSHIP PROJECT!",
    "An overview of different social and behavioral factors and their impact on health outcomes. I would only recommend it to students interested in fulfilling their SBS core requirement.",
    "good introductory class in SBS, heavier workload",
    "This course provides a good opportunity to improve public health writing skills and gives students the freedom to choose their own topics of interest. I would recommend this course for students who enjoy writing.",
    "This course offers a good background on the issues pertaining to social and behavioral influences on health behavior. If you aren't used to reading articles in the social sciences, this class will help you with that and probably make you a better writer in the process.",
    "Overall this course is very interesting and provides a broad survey of current finding regarding both social and behavioral aspects of health. I found the class rewarding and enjoyable and would definitely recommend the course. The guest lecture component of the course was a plus.",
    "This course is very reading\/writing heavy, but interesting. I would be hesitant to recommend it to someone who does not enjoy a large workload.",
    "I would not recommend this course to another student.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course. It makes one think in ways that some of the more \"science-y\" public health students aren't used to thinking. This was my favorite class this term.",
    "This is a wonderful course. Despite the heavy writing component, I, looking back, found the course very rewarding.",
    "Not recommended. Work load is too voluminous for what is learnt in class",
    "Would not recommend at all - unfortunately is required. Could really benefit from an overhaul."
