   "comments": [
    "Great readings, great class. Professor Rager is awesome. An awesome intro English class.",
    "I would definitely recommend it because the essays aren't that long, and the books are fun to read. You may have read a few of the books already, but Professor Rager adds to the syllabus and that was actually my favorite book that we red.",
    "A few great american books looked at in depth with plenty of room for student discussion. Moby Dick and House of Leaves were especially awesome.",
    "You will read literature, discuss it in class, and then write a papers on it. I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys literature and wants to become better at literary analysis.",
    "If you're looking for a good English class other than 120, take 127! Although it's not quite as fun as 120 imo, it really develops your literary analysis skills through in-class discussion and essays on important American texts like poems by Whitman and Dickinson and Moby Dick, which, although arduous to get through, I'm really glad I read. Rager's a very cool and engaging teacher, and he chose some peculiarly awesome things for us to read, including House of Leaves--a bewildering beast of a book--and even \"digital\" literature. I wonder if the English Department shouldn't just cut back on the number of required readings and leave more for the professors to choose, although I would have liked to have read something from mid-20th century or thereabouts. We wrote four very worthwhile essays over the semester, in addition to a slightly annoying essay revision assignment that was due at the end of reading week. But yeah...although Rager's a grad student, I wouldn't hesitate at all to take his class! He's really chill and is always happy to meet with you over your writing.",
    "Definitely--may even be better than 120. The writing gets repetitive though."
