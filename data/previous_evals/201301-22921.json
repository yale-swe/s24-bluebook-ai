    "I would recommend the class to someone interested in the storytelling genre. There isn't too much daily reading for the class, but each story we read had purpose behind it.The stories are also really funny, and therefore easy to get through.",
    "Both teachers are fantastic and the nicest people ever! The seminar was really chill, discussion was great and the readings were cool. Although Prof. Cardillo might not be teaching any courses next year, if you have the chance to take anything with Prof. Marcus I would HIGHLY recommend it. She is brilliant (and knows near everything there is to know about Boccaccio). The workload is pretty light, and the final paper is short and fun. I would recommend taking this class or any similar class to anyone!",
    "This is a course on The Decameron and The Canterbury Tales. I would definitely recommend it-I'm so glad I took it. The professors, discussions, and literature all make this class amazing.",
    "If you want a writing credit but are turned off by the idea of just writing essays for the sake of writing essays, or by modern literature, or by having to write extra papers for a history class, then this just may be a great fit. For the final paper you write your own medieval story, and everyone reads them out loud. The course is accessible to people who are unfamiliar with the works or the genre (or Italian), but keep in mind that Chaucer (second half of the term) is much harder going than a modern translation of Boccaccio."
