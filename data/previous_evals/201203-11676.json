   "comments": [
    "The department is fantastic! They're all nice and great teachers.",
    "THIS IS THE BEST CLASS I HAVE EVER TAKEN AT YALE. Seriously. It is a lot of work, but it is so rewarding and definitely possible for anyone to master if they put their mind to it, even if they have never taken an East Asian language beforehand. I had not.",
    "Japanese was my absolute favorite course this semester. The work load and intensity of the class may be a bit intimidating at first, but after you stick it through the beginning it gets much easier. The class is much faster paced than I expected, but by the end of the semester I was very surprised and pleased at how much we had learned in just one semester. The professors are all phenomenal; they are all fantastic teachers and very personable. There are clinics, which are 30 min sessions either in pairs or one-on-one with a TF who helps you with primarily pronunciation, but really with anything that you need help with. I definitely recommend this course to anyone who is interested in Japan and Japanese culture.",
    "So much fun! Lots of work but it was such a pleasure going to class every day. Amazing course.",
    "I would highly recommend people who need a language class to take Japanese. It is a bit of work, but I think it's a challenge most people would enjoy. The teachers are all great, the work isn't too bad, and you'll definitely want to continue studying Japanese by the end of the semester.",
    "YES. I initially took Japanese just to fulfill my language requirement but who knew that it would become one of my favorite classes this semester. The teachers are so adorable, engaging, and hilarious. Starting off your morning with this class just makes you so happy for the remainder of the day. There is a fair amount of homework every day but it's well worth the 1.5 credits you're getting and it helps with keeping up with the language and making sure you understand the topics. Don't get behind and make sure you understand the grammar concepts by reading the really confusing and dense textbook! Also take the 1030 section....it's no fun to learn Japanese when you're still trying to wake up,",
    "Nishimura-sensei, Mammoto-sensei, Stever-sensei, and Murata-sensei all present Japanese language and culture in succinct and often humorous ways. If you are even remotely interested in Japanese culture, you will gain so much from this class.",
    "Take it! This is one of the funnest class I've taken at Yale. More work but worth it!",
    "JAPN 110 is the best class I have taken at Yale. Highly recommended!",
    "this class with be a great intro to Japanese, and every teacher is wonderful, just be prepared to do all the work and extra studying on top of that.",
    "Definitely, it's hard, but I don't think it could be structured much better.",
    "It is a fairly fast-paced course that demands you to devote some considerable time to the daily assignments and come prepared to class. Learning Japanese can be quite challenging for those who haven't been exposed to any non-European\/Asian language, so having learned Chinese beforehand (especially at Yale) will definitely make the process easier (at least in terms of Kanji and vocabulary memorization). The syllabus is structured in a way that we can build on what we are learning everyday, so that we quickly feel more and more comfortable with the language. I was not particularly fond of having to memorizing the \"Core Conversations\", as I don't quite think I retained more of the vocabulary by doing so, but, compared to the method adopted in Chinese 110, this Japanese class is actually pretty stress-free. The material is very spread out, so that we do work regularly instead of having big exams. I would definitely recommend this course to anyone even remotely interested in Japanese, especially considering the possibility of using the Light Fellowship to go study in Japan over the summer."
