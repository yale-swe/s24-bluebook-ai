   "comments": [
    "Little work and pretty easy, but probably not.",
    "I would recommend it as a fairly easy science course although the material you learn is not exactly well linked",
    "A lot of busy work but it covers interesting subjects.",
    "There are a lot of small assignments that you earn points for, so do not forget to submit homework on time.",
    "Pretty good class. A bit scattered so you might need some self-initiative to connect the dots but overall good.Basically you learn about microbial communities, different methods of establishing causation vs correlation, the mechanics of gene replication (and everything that can effect it) and discuss topics such as vaccines& global warming.",
    "easy. interesting. gives a good, broad explanation of so many scientific topics.",
    "It's a fantastic course for non-science majors. Science is digestible, and interesting. Professor is great. Only downside is that the other students tend not too be too engaged.",
    "Take it. Very interesting, engaging and interactive without being too simplistic or boring.",
    "Great course. Very informative, but a lot of tedious assignments.",
    "Genes is a great science credit, but you have to do all the work to do well, think<40% participation, high up science hill. Much of this is time-consuming busy work, but you will learn a good amount without difficulty.Material is slightly scattered, but Professor Handelsman is very smart and very invested in her students.Take as one of your science credits.",
    "Great science class for non-science majors, but this is not a gut per say. The tests can be challenging, as they involve application of concepts learned in class. However, the work is always fair, and the Professor does a great job in lecture and in review session exploring key concepts. More time could be focused on making sure the questions on examinations are clear and definitely covered in class or section.",
    "If you need a science credit and would be OK with getting an easy B, TAKE IT.Light workload, but definitely NOT an easy A.Problem is...tests were unfair. You can study all you want, but the questions are pretty ambiguous, tough grading, i just didn't feel like it doesn't reflect what you know.The topics are pretty interesting since they relate the biology to real-world examples, like global warming, vaccines, antibiotics etc.",
    "I would recommend Genes for someone if they are willing to work hard and possibly not get a great grade. It is an interesting course that explores political and historical implications of biology (great for the non science major). It would be much easier if you have already taken biology.",
    "This was a good science credit. The workload can be heavy at times with the numerous small projects, but it is certainly manageable, and TAs are very helpful. The material is interesting and not too overwhelming for someone who does not study the sciences.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this class for non-science majors. You learn new things about a variety of topics and the workload is manageable. It is a good science credit.",
    "It focuses on microorganisms and investigates ways different microbial communities impact the environment and vice versa. It's a really great intro course; it isn't too much work and it's still engaging. If you have a strong science background, you'll probably find it boring, but if you're looking to fulfill a science credit and are particularly interested in biology at a molecular level, then it's definitely a great class to take.",
    "This course is a good science credit for people who are willing to do various projects and assignments throughout the semester. The work is fairly easy, but there is a decent amount of busy work. You will learn about some interesting things that you will realize you did not fully or correctly understand before taking the class.",
    "Take this course!! Even if you're an engineering\/math major, everybody should learn the concepts that are presented in this course (biology-oriented). We learn everything about microbes, antibiotics, to biofuels. Very comprehensive course, and the exams are not that bad as long as your prepare well and take copious notes.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student. It's a great way to learn about the vast world of microbes and how they cause most things.",
    "Take it! Super interesting",
    "Take this class, especially if you think you don't like biology\/science! This is one of the only biology classes I've taken that I've enjoyed. Much of the reading and all of the topics are extremely relevant to everything from antibiotics to global warming, and there's also a lot of focus on how to design a good experiment. The cell bio presented is very basic. Overall, lecture was interesting and I learned a great deal that's actually applicable to my daily life. Section homework assignments could be a bit of busy work, but the TAs (I had Tiffany and Josh) worked really hard to make section interesting and interactive. The only downside was KBT and its awful elevators.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone who wants an interesting and not too challenging science credit.",
    "Overall approach to bio. It was interesting most of the time and I learned a lot. But there were too many assignments. And this class is definitely not a gut. You need to go to class and make sure you are doing all the assignments (there are SOOOOO many)Prof. Handelsman is great. Very knowledgeable. She is a superstar in her field. The TAs were great too, very nice and helpful.",
    "Biology at the simplest level",
    "Great science class for non-science majors. topics vary throughout the semester so it keeps it interesting, and its all relevant to daily life.",
    "While the material is easy to learn, I would definitely say that this class is not a gut. There are several, several weekly assignments that will take up a lot of your time - far more than actual studying for exams (two two-part midterms + final (all three were VERY LONG), and weekly online quizzes, plus several \"homework\"-esque assignments due on a bi-weekly basis). Nonetheless, it was worth it - the topics covered this term ranged from global warming to antibiotic resistance to potato blight. Professor Handelsman herself is one of the kindest, most helpful professors I've had here, and she certainly knows her material. The topics covered are very interesting and relevant. Tiffany and Josh were amazing TAs - try to get them.",
    "Great class, will get good grade if go to lectures and review sessions.",
    "It's a decent way for non-science major to fulfill their scient requirement, but the course is difficult to follow at times.",
    "Dreadful. Physics for Poets is one thing; Biology for 4th-Graders is quite another. You will be embarrassed to have taken this class. If you go to Yale, you can do better. Take Galaxies& Aliens, or whatever it's called, take Cancer, take Quantum Poets for Physics, take ANY science offering over this. But if you take MCDB 123 anyway, do enjoy writing the \"poems\" about microbes.",
    "It is a great introductory survey course to many biology topics in a high school class style. I highly recommend this class to any non-science major who needs a science credit and is interested in biology. However, this class may be too introductory for science majors.",
    "MCDB 123 is a really good science credit and you will learn things that you normally would not get out of a science class on a particular subject. The class makes Yale students who are not science majors knowledgeable on scientific methods and controversial topics in science today.",
    "Great",
    "Disorganized, but probably an ok science credit. Should be called \"All About Microbes\" not \"Genes and the Environment.\" Expect to learn many random things, most of which were interesting, but which did not necessarily connect to one another.",
    "A great way to fulfill a science requirement while learning material relevant to your everyday lifestyle.",
    "If you are shopping for the easiest science class, this will probably be more work than you bargained for.However, Prof. Handelsman is literally the Queen of the Metagenome. She coined the term for her entire field of specialization. If you are remotely interested in a class that starts with the basics of bacterial life (assumes no prior knowledge, components of cells, eukaryotes, prokaryotes etc)and moves on to synthesize a lot of cutting edge research about how bacterial communities affect everything from drug resistance to diabetes and obesity management to global warming - really cutting edge work, in a fairly easy to understand way - this will be great for you.Lots of policy-relevant things.There are a lot of different components to your assessment (exams, take-homes, quizzes, section participation, writing assignments) so just make sure you keep track of them.",
    "The class provides you a new pair of glasses to look the world. It is not an easy science credit, with a lot of small assignments. Don't be fool by last year's reviews. Still, it is a very interesting class with a focus on how to think instead of what to think. So overall, it's worthwhile."
