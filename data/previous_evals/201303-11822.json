    "Not unless you REALLY like data-driven political science",
    "This is a great seminar. It has the perfect workload and the reading is very interesting. Professor Huber always makes sure the class discussion is helpful and thought provoking. The final research proposal is also great compared to a regular paper.",
    "Great class; yes",
    "It's a good course that will teach you about the distance between the Democratic and Republican parties in various dimensions. I would absolutely recommend it to another student.",
    "Yes. If you're interested in the material take it. It's quite a bit of reading at times, but it wasn't anything too difficult.",
    "A really comprehensive class that looks at the question of polarization at all levels. Prof Huber is great. Kinda stats-heavy so it helps to have a good understanding of regressions."
