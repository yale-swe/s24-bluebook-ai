    "Strengths: Meeting every day and the amount of time you have to spend thinking in or about Spanish Weaknesses: They spent a little too much time on culture in my opinion but I understand.",
    "I'm not the most qualified to speak on this, but as an introductory level course I think it does what it is supposed to. Sometimes the grading is a little tricky.",
    "Placement of individuals into this course seems skewed. There should not be people who have taken 5+ years of Spanish in L2, especially if they have passed AP exams. Placement exams should include a speaking component, and if someone can speak nearly fluently at the beginning of the course, they should be moved. A huge weakness of this course is the inability of actual Spanish beginners to reasonably keep up with additional courses on their schedule. A strength is that the class time is enjoyable. My professor was high energy and engaging. My only complaints are that I did not feel that components that were assessments for grades reflected the amount of understanding, engagement and commitment I showed in class.",
    "Focused greatly on the book. Our listening skills always remain low."

    "Sure",
    "NEVER, NEVER, NEVER. I finished Spanish L1 with a straight A and was placed into Juliana's class. She did not know my name for three months. She would ask questions to every other student and would pass me in the line. When I made a mistake to turn in my second draft, she did not accept it and told me \"I deserved an F anyways.\" She made me cry and then sent a complaint email to my dean. She killed all my motivation and desire of learning Spanish."
