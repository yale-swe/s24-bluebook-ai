    "Yes, I'd recommend it. It's a good intro course, and if you get a good instructor, you can actually get a lot out of it, which isn't always true for intro courses.",
    "Only if you've taken math ab calc in high school",
    "Yes. Everyone should know basic calc. Definitely take it with Anup Rao!! He is the best. Don't take it with Sarah; she is a terrible teacher."
