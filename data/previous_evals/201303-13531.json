    "Question 1: the only pertinent reading was Harlow& Harrar's but many did not read it. It should be more mandatory. It will be a book on my professional shelf!Question 4 is difficult to answer. The TA was not great at his job, which caused many of us to feel like we were falling behind. It is the professor's job to teach us (which Ann tends to lack doing) but knowing this, the TA should have stepped up to fill her gaps. Since he did not the pace felt quick! This goes with Question 8: she would point to a plant and ask us to ID it but then walk away without giving an answer. If she were better she would confirm\/correct our answers but since she doesn't do this then the TA should have.This all affects Question 11. It is a necessary class and I learned a lot, but I taught a lot of it to myself because the professor and TA fell short of teaching clearly and effectively",
    "This material is crucial for all MFs.RE Field Trips: Really helpful when out in the woods and identifying trees. I think it could be even more useful in field trips to provide a 15 minute introduction into typical vegetative communities on the site prior to arriving for context. There were a couple of field trips that were not useful but were generally interesting - the Greeley Botanical Gardens\/ Green Houses and the plant storage field trip on Yale campus were neat but not very closely related to material we would be tested on or is useful to know.The taxonomy\/ dendrology book and field guide are great as references but were not incorporated in a systematic way into the course. I think that anywhere from 3-7 very small homework assignments to reinforce field learning prior to the final would have been really helpful.The slides are clearly pretty old and recycled from previous years. There were a bunch of questions on the final that we just did not go over in class at all.I think adding one more lecture in the beginning of the course to explain broad clade relationships would provide a nice framework for filing away information learned about trees",
    "I really enjoyed this course. I wish it were designed a little differently because I think I could have learned even morefrom the course. I wish that each field trip would focus on learned a select set of trees or shrubs so that I could feel more confident in my identifying skills."

    "The field trips were great way to learn tree identification. I thought the field trips and field practicums were well organized, especially given how tough it is to plan field trips around weather conditions. I also thought the exams were fair and covered a nice range of topics.",
    "Field tripsEntirely practicalSpending time with Ann is always a pleasureThe trees to know excel file is amazing",
    "Field trips and applied learning opportunities were the best part of this course. Being able to see plant features in person as you learn the taxonomy is a great approach and one that will ensure that this knowledge sticks with me beyond the term.",
    "I loved getting the chance to be outside every Monday and get to know trees.",
    "The field trips were fun, and it was a great chance to spend some time outside. I did learn most of the trees on the trees-to-know list, which will be extremely helpful in future class and professional work."

    "The professor's explanations and descriptions of what we're seeing. I understand that we jump right in to field trips because it could snow soon, but when she's telling us to \"look at the buds\" without ever having shown or described these buds we can't be expected to learn!Frequently there was no confirmation of what we were seeing, especially no reiteration later in lecture or on another day to give us context or a memory of what we had seen.",
    "I can't think of any. I think the class was fantastic!",
    "Please see above answer",
    "The structure of learning trees is quite jumbled and would benefit from more organization \/ explanation. For instance, if each field trip could focus on one family, I think that the course could teach both plant identification and orders\/families\/etc simultaneously. As it's taught, the course feels a bit overwhelming.I could also see more frequent quizzes proving valuable over one big ID mid-term. For instance, having a quiz on the oaks, then the maples, then the birches would allow for more measured \/ meaningful studying compared with trying to memorize all the plants for the mid-term at the same time. I feel like I lost a lot of that information as soon as the mid-term was over.",
    "A stronger link between lecture material and field trips is needed.",
    "I wish at times that the course set-up would have allowed for even more learning.",
    "The structure of the course needs to change. There were too many field trips--by the last trip, we knew most of the trees\/shrubs. The lecture material needs to be spread out over the course of the semester since it is very dense and covers very specific information. I felt very unprepared for the final since the lecture material was covered at the very end of class. We also learned the trees in an unsystematic way. While the field trips helped, I learned most of the trees the week of the midterm by looking them up online or using field guides."

I cannot say that I have walked away with a strong knowledge of this! I plan to teach it to myself in my free time later...",
