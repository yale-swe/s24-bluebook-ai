   "comments": [
    "I was not a huge fan of this course. That being said, I only took it because I needed a seminar for my major, and it was literally the only one that fit into the schedule I was forming. I just was not interested in the material, and that made it difficult to do the reading and stay interested in a 2 hour class every week. Nevertheless, other students in class speak very highly of it, so if you like the material then I'd recommend it.",
    "This class is heavily theory-based, and the topic is quite narrow. Take it if you are genuinely fascinated by the idea of the civil sphere because that's essentially the topic of discussion every single week. Also watch out for the readings. Easily 200-300 pages a week.",
    "A great course. 3 short, 5 page essays and a final 10 page essay all equally weighted. Interesting readings, discussion highly dependent upon the quality of other students in the class.",
    "Great sociology course which conceptualizes many current day issues and movements.",
    "I wouldn't recommend it. Really boring class, with consistently uninspiring discussion. The ideas of civil society and democracy are really interesting and Professor Alexander's own views are pretty fascinating, but those were treated so lightly that I wouldn't say it was worthwhile.",
    "The class is challenging but if you are willing to be challenged to think and write critically, this is a good course that will fulfill that role. The readings are dense each week but they discuss very interesting concepts. The discussion in each seminar depends on the reading and the interests of the participants in the seminar. Professor Alexander is very knowledgeable and smart and since this course is based around one of his own texts, it is important to understand early on what his book is saying and how it can be applied to the discussions in class. Papers are graded with rigor but if you talk with Professor Alexander ahead of time about the papers, he will be very clear about what he is looking for.",
    "I would not recommend this course to another student. I went into the class thinking that the first session of the seminar during shopping period had raised some interesting issues. As the course went on, however, it became extremely repetitive. Professor Alexander means well but is very arrogant and assigns an enormous amount of reading each week (always more than 300 or 400 pages at least half of which comes from a book that he wrote- and while his theory is pretty interesting the first week, it gets old quickly) and as a result I got the feeling that no one in the class did much of it at all. Because of this discussion was really slow and dry. Overall I'm leaving this course not feeling as though I got too much out of it.",
    "The professor is brilliant and at the fore of the field, but\u0085 way too much reading (200-400 pages\/week of dense material), so no one could do it, so the professor just had to lecture whenever there wasn't just awkward silence. I didn't feel like I learned very much.",
    "This is a great class for students interested in combining stringent theory with empirical study. Professor Alexander is great. The course is challenging, but all the readings are stimulating and enjoyable."
