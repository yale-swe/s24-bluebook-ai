   "comments": [
    "extremely interesting materials, engaging lectures and an awesome professor. be prepared for a slightly heavy workload, but it is totally worth the effort. you learn a lot out of this class and appreciate classical music more deeply.",
    "This class is indisputably fantastic. It will make you love and appreciate music more than you ever thought you could. Professor Hepokoski is brilliant, fair, and such a dynamic lecturer. There is not an overwhelming amount of reading and work, but you will want to spend significant time studying and preparing for exams (listening and written). If you love music, you will be extremely motivated to do well.",
    "I strongly recommend this course to anyone even marginally interested in music history. You learn a lot of interesting stuff about a lot of music you probably don't know very well, and the progression of classical music up to Beethoven. Hepokoski is absolutely excellent professor! One of my very favorite professors\/classes after 5 terms at Yale.",
    "This class is tons of work. It should be worth two credits. He makes you read two textbooks on the same topics in the first half of the semester. Wright's class was more enjoyable; at least he engaged the students more and had performances and showed videos. Take this class only if you are already really passionate about music history and prepared to devote your life to it for a semester.",
    "This is a challenging course that is really only for music majors or those with an extraordinary interest in music. It was fascinating for me, in part because of Prof. Heopokoski's energetic lectures, but it requires a lot of reading and memorization.",
    "This course will give a good overview of baroque and classical music history. Moreover, the course will help you understand the broader trends governing the history of music in those periods. There is a 3,000-word paper that is kind of a pain, but it is worth it. I am not a music major, and the course is a LOT of work; if this course isn't required for you (aka you're not a music major), I would first really consider how much time you're willing or able to devote to it. I thought it was worth it. Hepokoski is a fantastic lecturer, and overall, I really enjoyed this course. (I'll be taking 352, for sure.)Oh, and go to lecture. The midterms will typically ask questions based on information covered in lecture, which you can't always find in the text. Although, to be fair, some people often skipped lecture and did make it out alive. But Hepokoski's such a good lecturer, why would you skip?",
    "Absolutely take the class - it is among the best classes I've taken at Yale and will definitely change the way you think about music in general, not only music of this specific period. It's a decent amount of work, so do not take it lightly, but it is very rewarding.",
    "Thisis a really great course, even if you are not a music major (though it helps to know some theory). Professor Hepokoski is one of the best teachers I've had at Yale, and you will come out of the course knowing a lot about music from 1600 to 1800. I really hope to take the second part!",
    "So excellent. If you've never had the pleasure of sitting in a Hepo lecture, you are missing out on one of the best parts of Yale. If you are a prospective music major, take this one--it will give you a better idea of the best parts of the music department, and you will not regret having taken it even if you decide on something else. The only thing is that, like all history classes, this is very factsy, and a lot of work. But honestly, when your homework is to listen to 6 hours of music,you do not mind.",
    "You're probably doing it b\/c you have to, in which case I don't have much meaningful to offer. The listening tests are tough, so keep up with the listening (but you won't)...If you're not a music major - certainly a great course if you like the music. Then again, this is very few people's favorite music, and the course isn't great enough to make up for not liking the material.",
    "This course is the standard survey of Baroque and Classical music. It is highly recommended to those who are interested in music of these periods. The class is taught clearly and with narrative flair. I warn you that if you do not like Early Baroque vocal music, the first couple weeks of the semester might include tedious listening for you, but once you pass the hurdle, you're into some wonderful music.",
    "If you're into this stuff as much as Hepokoski is, this is heaven on earth. A ton of material to fit in a semester, but you have to go through it all at least once, I guess. If you have to pick between the two books, read Taruskin, it's infinitely more interesting.",
    "It's all the sort of interesting stuff after the middle ages leading up to Bach, and then some more stuff, then Mozart. It's a great course.",
    "This is an incredible course that anyone interested in a phenomenal history should look into. Music history is one of the most important around and it could not be taught by a better teacher.",
    "Music 351 is an intense music history course in the music history series. The course provides a great deal of information while managing to keep the workload manageable and exciting. I loved the course. I would definitely recommend the course to any musician and anyone interested inmusic or history.",
    "This was absolutely my favorite course at Yale so far. Admittedly I am a classical music nerd but Professor Hepokoski is incredibly inspiring no matter what your background! The material presented in class covers music history from about 1690-1780; you'll learn a lot about the beginnings of opera, the rise of instrumental music (symphony, quartet), and the development of sonata form, with special lectures devoted to Bach, Handel, Haydn, and Mozart. There is a lot of assigned reading, which is hard to keep up with, and the tests require a lot of rote memorization which seems a little pointless. The lectures are absolutely fabulous though and I would definitely recommend any class with Hepokoski he is just so good!"
