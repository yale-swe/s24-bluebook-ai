   "comments": [
    "If you don't like thinking about the implications of psychological studies on what view we should have of the world, what kind of monster are you? If you do, take this class, because that's pretty much all we do, and it's awesome.",
    "An class with interesting reading material, take it if you are okay in wading through a little philosophical fluff in order to get to the interesting questions and debates. Makes you think a lot about the purpose of the human race, and about purpose in general.",
    "I would recommend this course for any student, regardless of their major. The commitment is light (two papers and a final). Everyone should take this if Professor Knobe teaches it again, especially. If nothing else, this is a great credit\/D\/fail course (but you should still try).",
    "If you are at all interested in philosophy, take this course!! Professor Knobe is excellent and the topics are all interesting and exciting. You will leave lecture that much more interested in the world around you because of the combination of Professor Knobe's engaging method of teaching and the topics. The class mixes philosophy and psychology in a really strong way. Don't miss out on it if you have the opportunity - you will learn a lot.",
    "This course sounds a lot more interesting than it is. Be warned: you have to read some incredibly long and boring philosophy texts! That said, the teacher is nice and lectures are usually somewhat interesting.",
    "Definitely, it is a good overview of the major philosophical questions. The combination of philosophical theories about human nature and empirical research from cognitive science makes the class a great overview of psychological principles as well. Joshua Knobe is the most enthusiastic and funny professor I have ever had. The only problem I had with the course was that there were only two papers and not much guidance plus you could easily forget a lot of the lectures and still do well on the papers but then you have to go back and review for final exam.",
    "Although I enjoyed the class I am not sure I would recommend it to another student. I am not sure how much I actually learned in the class.",
    "There is a lot of material and the papers require a lot of thought, but this is truly a \"must-take\" course. The format is incredibly unique (reading what philosophers had to say about stuff, and then looking at how contemporary psychologists are approaching those same questions and issues), and Professor Knobe is one of the smartest professors I've encountered here - he can deliver a lecture on Karl Marx with no notes, powerpoint, or pauses and keep you engaged the entire time. Highly recommended.",
    "pretty good course. interesting topics. you have to do the readings, especially for the final. section is kind of tedious and unnecessary but it's required. the reading responses are only a few sentences so no big deal.",
    "If you have ever thought how our minds work, and especially if you are frustrated by the lack of dialogue between philosophy and psychology in general, this is the class for you. It is fascinating, and you learn loads, but you also acquire a new way of thinking about people and how they interact by approaching these fundamental questions about our nature from different viewpoints, and you also gain a new appreciation for the complexity of our nature in general.",
    "If you're interested in happiness, altruism, morality, character or belief in god, take this class! This class is unique in that it mixes philosophy with empirical cog sci in very interesting\/cool ways. It was not much work, either -- just readings for class, 2 papers and a (rather hard) final exam. Loved it!",
    "I would recommend, it's very interesting.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student because it was an amazing experience for me but on the grades aspect I would watch out.",
    "A fairly introductory course: essentially you learn what philosophers have to say on issues concerning human nature and then observe the extent to which modern cognitive science comes to bear on their theories.A solid course. I had already learned about much of the cognitive science, but it was awesome to learn the philosophy. The opposite may be true of people with different backgrounds.",
    "I went to 5 of 22 classes so i can't say much but i would recommend it. CR\/D. Final was hard. Readings were too long. Professor is awesome.",
    "Wack class, AWESOME PROFESSOR, take it credit d if you have to. or just find another class with jknobe.",
    "Its more of a cogsci class than a philosophy class, but still gets you thinking about things in a philosophical way - id recommend it, especially to people who arent usually big on philosophy because it's too theoretical and not empirical enough",
    "This is a course that I probably would have found fascinating my freshman year, but that I now find rather boring. The treatment of each subject is shallow and feels pop-psych. Having read Scientific American Mind and a couple of pop-psych books, I already knew most of what the course offered, and gained little from it. Both the psych and the philosophy parts are treated in a cursory manner without real rigor.However, it's also quite fun and easy, so it can make for a good 5th class.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this, especially to non-philosophy or non-cognitive science majors.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student, and not only to students in the cognitive science or philosophy majors. This is a great course for any Yale student to take.",
    "TAKE IT. Best class I've taken at Yale and I'm about to graduate. Lectures are awesome, Knobe is hilarious, the readings are interesting, and you actually learn stuff. About half the readings are in cog sci\/psych and the other half are philosophy (e.g. Nietzsche, Descartes, Spinoza, Aristotle) so you'll enjoy the course more if you're comfortable with both those fields. But seriously take it.",
    "I did not enjoy this class. Like many inter-disciplinary classes at Yale, it suffered from a lack of focus that caused it to be disorganized. I never really felt like I knew what the class was about. Occasionally I would catch a snippet of an idea from the cognitive science research or the philosophy readings that would interest me, but it just didn't fit together.The papers were poorly explained and had very little to do with the lectures. The whole course essentially consisted of Knobe presenting cog sci research and parallel philosophy, and then the class was expected to make connections between them in section and in their papers. However, it's dubious that there even are connections to be made. This led to awful discussions in section and confusing paper assignments.I would definitely not recommend this class. A lot of it is potentially interesting, but the material was presented in a very disorganized way. You take a class because you think the structure of the class will help you learn something, but the structure of this class did nothing to teach me about what I'd hoped to learn, ie. possible connections between cog sci and philosophy. I'm more convinced than ever that there aren't any.",
    "Take it. It's the most interesting and important topic I've learned of so far, and I looked forward to every reading, lecture, and section.",
    "Yes, I would highly recommend to a student in any major. There is a perfect amount of work (2 short papers and a painless final exam, along with weekly section participation), so I would not suggest taking this class CR\/D. Lectures are interesting and you shouldn't miss them! Also, the readings -- Plato, Aristotle, Marx -- are ones that you should not leave Yale without being introduced to.",
    "Solid class. Puts the philosophers to the test - do current psych studies prove or disprove their claims? Knobe is awesome. Lectures, though, range from utterly fascinating to painfully dull.",
    "Eh.",
    "Great and relevant exploration of serious philosophical questions. Highly recommended.",
    "Take this class to broaden your mind, not to get an A. The grading on the essays seems pretty arbitrary, but the readings make the class totally worthwhile. You will learn to look at the world in entirely new ways.",
    "A good course covering rather hand-picked material. You don't really go into anything in depth so it may seem a little scattered though. Lecture, section (with a credit reading response), and 2 papers + 1 final exam.",
    "An interesting course. The lack of textbook, or structured lecture notes, made it a little hard to study for the final though.",
    "Definitely take a class with Josh Knobe, you won't regret it. This is great even if you've never taken a Philosophy class before (I hadn't). It's a good way to ease into Philosophy if you're already interested in Psychology or Cog Sci. Keep up with the reading to get the most out of class and section.",
    "This is an awesome class! It provides a very interesting balance of Philosophy and Psychology, amounting to Philosophy without the B.S.",
    "Human Nature is a class that is part cog sci, part philosophy. This is obviously an important and interesting connection of subjects and Professor Knobe did an excellent job parlaying each subject's own importance and their influence on each other. The class was great thinking material and the readings were fun and informative, and not too hard either. It would whole-heartedly recommend this class to another student based on the subject and readings, as well as the excellent Professor Knobe.",
    "It's a fun, pretty easy class, but if you've taken a lot of other psychology classes, there's quite a bit of overlap.",
    "Yes, absolutely take this class. Professor Knobe does not attempt to answer any of the questions of human nature, but he creates a framework for questioning everything. You will likely end up staring off into space on random Thursday afternoons contemplating the meaning of life if you take this class - it is simply that fascinating. The class is difficult, so I might recommend it Credit\/D, but it is definitely worth it.",
    "Starts out with AWESOME stuff on happiness. Continues to explore fairly interesting questions later, but gets more boring. Material is covered very slowly, so you get bored in lecture, but Knobe's lecture style is fantastic (once you get used to his voice). It's an easy class, and the readings are pretty good (and if you don't like them, he summarizes them in lecture). Intense final exam though.",
    "This is a gut course for the thinking man (or woman.) There isn't that much work, but if you do it you should be okay. Really interesting, and without question is applicable for anyone who is actual taking classes for self-knowledge instead of for grades\/fulfilling requirements.",
    "Yes, definitely - very interesting topics from Human nature to religion",
    "A weak course that seems to explore my topics at a surface level. Take it as an introductory course if you want a brief overview of what some topics in psychology and philosophy are, but if you have taken any courses in either department, DO NOT take this course. It's the only course I've ever regretted taking.",
    "This was a nice, interesting, relatively laid back course. If you are interested in philosophy or cognitive science, and especially their intersection , take it.",
    "Take it, if you are interested in cognititive science and basic philosophy. The reading is very light, and Prof Knobe is dynamic and engaging. However, if you already know basic philosophy, you're probably beyond this class.",
    "yes. knobe is engaging. the balance of philosophy and empirical findings is refreshing, and discussion sections can be really fun. you can write about whatever you want forthe papers, so they are totally interesting. generally- a manageable and enjoyable class!summary: cool readings, 2 7-9 page papers, final exam (that is quite weird).",
    "It is a great class to think about life. I formulated a lot of my opinions about the world from the readings and lectures of this class, but I would suggest taking it Credit\/D! The essays are gradedtoughly, especially taking into consideration how easy lecture makes the class seem. The final is tough but apparently graded on a curve. Section was fun, take it with Priya! (Or Pamela.)",
    "Wonderful subject matter and very easy, and structured like most psych course (which is to say very well). Some of the readings are hit or miss, and the central concepts are occasionally hard to distinguish - but they do after all concern the same thing and can be expected to overlap. Just a little too easy to be taken wholly seriously, if you know what I mean. However it deserves to be taken seriously.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this class to another student. There aren't many classes that fuse philosophy and science in this way, and I think it was a really interesting class and offered an awesome perspective to both philosophy and science.",
    "I think the course was a challenge but I would definitely recommend it. The course work was fair and the weekly reading responses were very easy, so it wasn't too hard to keep up.",
    "This class is interesting if you have a background in philosophy and would like to see how it stacks up against empirical results. Professor Knobe is a great lecturer and very accessible so no background knowledge is required. However, the material can be a bit repetitive and generally psychology does not do much to inform the philosophy, so this might be best reserved for people who have a strong interest in philosophy, otherwise it may become tedious.",
    "CGSC is a good introduction to various topics in both Cognitive Science and Philosophy. Professor Knobe is great at picking out the interesting aspects of both fields in relation to the topics covered. I really enjoyed this course and would recommend it to anyone interested.",
    "I would recommend this class. As a student with little background in philosophy and cog sci, I found the information accessible and very interesting. (and i believe it was engaging for people with more prior knowledge as well). Most people in the class genuinely seemed to like it and be engaged which was great.",
    "If you like philosophy, this will probably move too slow for you. But if you want to try out philosophy, this is a good starter course.",
    "If you are really interested in philosophy, I would recommend this course. Otherwise, it's interesting but it could end up being your least favorite course of the semester.",
    "This is a very good class that will make you rethink how one thinks and why that is so. At the same time, one learns about recent cognitive science research and the implications it may have about people. Definitely take it even if you aren't a philosophy or cog. sci. major.",
    "Yes, take this class. It's a great mixture of some of the most exciting areas of philosophy and cognitive science, and whether it's Professor Knobe or Professor Gendler who teaches it, the professor will be wonderful. The material is great and the workload isn't too heavy.",
    "This was a good class.It was very interesting how this class was taught in a somewhat historical manner (past philosophers and their thoughts) and also a cognitive science manner (the ongoing studies that prove and disprove theories). I like philosophy, so this was a very interesting course to take. It took away most of the blunt philosophy, and added some spice with the cognitive science aspect. The lectures were always fun to listen to, because the topics that we discussed directly relate to our every day lives.That said, it was very easy to lose focus during the lectures. We spent a lot of time on each topic, so there were many times when we would discuss the same experiment (or similar experiments) at length, and I would drift off and stop listening. It would also have been nice if the lectures were posted online, but they were not. You have to pay attention and take notes.The weekly section was my favorite part about this class. It was one hour a week during which we had debates\/discussions about the topics, and could actually express and defend our own points of view. So much fun! Probably my favorite part of the entire semester, in any class.",
    "Wonderful class, lectures are extremely entertaining!! Papers are graded a bit harshly, especially the first one. But overall a low workload."
