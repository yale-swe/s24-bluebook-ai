   "comments": [
    "Math 222 is a good way to learn linear algebra in a way accessible to non-math majors, although there was still certainly a lot of pure math in the class, more so than applications. Nothing particularly special about this class; I would think the reason to take it is if you need linear algebra for further studies later in math or sciences.",
    "I don't think taking this course, or even doing well in it can qualify a student as someone who knows linear algebra. The professor avoids any challenging material like the plague, as witnessed by the absurd number of people who get perfect scores on the midterms. Despite doing very well in this class, I am not confident at all in my ability to take any class that assumes prior knowledge of linear algebra.About the professor - one thing I was highly disappointed with and never expected to happen in any Yale course was that Professor Dymarz actually missed class (did not show up to her job) on multiple occasions because she was too busy finding a different job.Despite everything, I think linear algebra itself has potential to be a very interesting subject, and I encourage you to take it with Schultheiss or to take 230.",
    "Take it if you need to take it, but take it with a different professor. If you are thinking of being a math major (or applied math, or math and CS, or math or phys) you'll find 222 boring. Think about shopping 225.",
    "yes, take it instead of 225 (with prof howard garland). 222 is supposed to cover less material than 225, but in the end, u actually learn more in 222",
    "Decent class. Don't take it if you don't like math. It isn't too hard, but fairly disorganized as the subjects is pretty huge and we just kind of skim the surface in a lot of areas.Dymarz is pretty solid although feiszli is supposed to be good.Take it if you need it although I have a sneaking suspicion that I should've taken diffeq instead.",
    "I took this course instead of 225 because of how horrible the 225 professor for this semester was. I was extremely pleased with my professor for this class, but sadly for you guys, she's leaving. Unfortunately, the class itself could sometimes be boring. The curriculum is kind of elementary in places, and I wished we could cover the tougher material that we were skipping in the book and talk about more applications. If you're good at proof-based math and the professor for 225 isn't absolutely horrible, take that instead. If math isn't your strongest subject but you need a linear algebra course for whatever reason, take this.",
    "Take the main section, this one is nowhere near as good.",
    "I took this class thinking it would be not too hard and somewhat enjoyable. While the actual material isn't difficult (its a lot of simple arithmetic, really), I struggled with the course because I did not find the lectures easy to understand, and the homework problems were always much more challenging than any example problem worked on in class. But it's Tullia's last semester teaching this (I think), so this class might be better organized next year.",
    "Basic linear algebra survey. Much more interesting if taught in a logical way; not super difficult. Frustrating textbook.",
    "Linear Algebra is a great class and extremely applicable in various other fields.",
    "I was one of the numerous kids who started out in Math 225 and dropped down to 222 halfway through the semester. Compared to 225, 222 is MUCH easier to comprehend. If you have a decent background in linear algebra, then I would recommend looking at 225, but if you have never taken linear algebra before, and want to learn the basics, then heed my warning: take 222!",
    "Math 222 with Prof. Dymarz was very good. Dymarz is a great teacher, she's very nice, and she makes the class very easy!",
    "A pretty normal math class, not based on proofs but on applications, like your high school calculus class. This professor won't be here next year, but for what it's worth, the first two tests were extremely easy (average was 36\/40) and the final was a little harder (average was 79\/100). Weekly homework took about an hour or two, so not much.",
    "Good class. I would recommend it.",
    "Take the class. That's it. So much better than 225.",
    "Mathematics 222 02 is the easier section of MATH 222. It is a basic overview of linear algebra without much focus on the applications. I would recommend it because it is a higher level mathematics course that was not too difficult and I know it is required for many engineering and physics majors. I am not sure if I would recommend my section, though. I think that the other section learned more.",
    "Well... Prof. Dymarz is leaving. I don't know about Schulteiss... So if you didn't take it with Prof. Dymarz, you missed out!",
    "Linear algebra is ok. Everyone says it's tons of fun--I thought it was much more enjoyable than multivariable calculus and some of the applications are pretty cool, but it's not THAT fun. That said, it's pretty easy and important stuff. Take the class if you need to...it's not a lot of work, it's pretty easy and it's sort of fun.",
    "Be prepared to do A LOT of work with matrices. Very useful for higher level chem classes. The textbook was less than helpful too.",
    "Math 222 under Prof. Dymarz was a very frustrating experience for me and many of my peers. As I understand, she will not be teaching at Yale next year, so many of the complaints of herrelatively frenetic teaching style should be irrelevant to future students.However, I should point out that Gilbert Strang's book, \"Linear Algebra and its Applications\" is positively one of the worst textbooks I have ever worked with. In it, large computational shortcuts are made, even in techniques that are new to the student, and the verbal explanations of ideas are confounding and wholly unhelpful. The problems in the back of the chapters serve more to instruct the student, rather than as a medium for application of knowledge acquired in the chapter itself. I strongly recommend investing in a better linear algebra textbook if Strang's (expensive) book is used for your class."
