    "While I didn't learn anything particularly new in the course, I did use skills I'd earned over my past 4 years during the senior project.",
    "Didn't really learn much. Was a pretty pointless 1 hour and 15 minutes of my week.",
    "Everything I ended up learning was due to the group project! To be perfectly honest I didn't really learn any new skills from the material covered in this course. I think almost everyone already knew how to write technical reports and how to give presentations.",
    "Great course, the skills lectures taught were actually practical and very helpful",
    "I learned how to conduct an independent research project on my own. I really gained a lot of experience working with MATLAB. I also learned a lot about the focus of my independent project, sustainable design and green infrastructure.",
    "I do not think I developed any particular skills or insights in this course. My project made use of skills that I had developed in other courses.",

   "comments": [
    "Towards the beginning of the semester, it seemed like there milestones were not particularly relevant to the project and detracted from actually being able to spend time working on the project. This let up towards the end of the semester, as class stops meeting, and we were able to devote more time to actually doing the project.",
    "Didn't really learn much. Was a pretty pointless 1 hour and 15 minutes of my week.",
    "I think the time spent on this course would be more valuable being put into spending time on the individual or group project. There could be made resources available to help students prepare for elevator pitches and presentations and the final report but I don't think weekly sessions are necessary. Maybe rather these sessions could be for groups to have a dedicated time to meet up.",
    "Organizing time to work on projects would be helpful in creating checkpoints.",
    "Strengths are the overall structure and organization of the course. I thought the instructor organized the course very well and made all the information self explanatory and self contained. Weaknesses is that if you're inexperienced with research or independent work it can be hard to find an advisor and hard to make and stick to your own schedule throughout the semester.",
    "I think the lecture portion of the course should be abandoned. Since we had to do the reading before the lecture, it makes no sense to simply repeat the slides in the lecture. Moreover, I do not think I got anything out of the exercises that involved input from classmates. The classes simply take away from time that could be spent working on the project. I also thought the grading in this class was misguided. When it came to presentations and exercises, points were taken off for the smallest infractions, like not having a line of text indented or text in a slightly light color. I understand the importance of attention to detail, but I think that technical challenge should be emphasized more. Based on the presentations, it is clear that some students did more compelling work than others, and I think it's ridiculous that the course prioritizes the smaller details over the scope and importance of a student's work.",
    "You can do what ever you want, so lots of freedom, but then you are challenged to use that well."

   "comments": [
    "Didn't really learn much. Was a pretty pointless 1 hour and 15 minutes of my week.",
    "No. I would much rather have taken a design course than do this project course because the course meetings feel unnecessary if you've already written reports and given presentations before. If you haven't, this is a good place to learn! The \"skills lectures\" feel weirdly geared towards freshman while the projects count as senior projects; there's a mismatch that was frustrating to a lot of us. Either way if you've got to take it, it's not bad!",
    "Great for anyone who is MechE and wants to pursue a project, not just seniors",
    "This is a great class for MechE majors if you're looking for an elective. Beware tho, this class is about as good as your choice of project\/advisor. If you have a good project and a good advisor you'll have a good experience if not, you're going to struggle. Beth is an awesome lecturer and teaches you a lot really important skills for researchers. She doesn't deviate outside of the material she's prepared in class. There is absolutely no work except your elevator pitch, prospectus, midterm and final presentations and your final paper. You just have to keep up with your project and make sure you don't leave it all until the last week. One piece of advice I will say is DO NOT DO A GROUP PROJECT. If you do a group project your performance and grade will be heavily dependent on other people which is what happened to me and didn't work out well AT ALL. My partner and I weren't even working on the same project, we were working on different projects of the same topic and just got lumped together. If you do an individual project it's all at your own pace and everything is completely up to you. Ultimately it's a great class, gives you a lot practical real world research experience, especially if you're interested in academic research and graduate school.",
    "I would not take MENG 472 unless it is required for the major. I found the lectures dull and uninspiring, and they took away time from actually working on the project. My advice would be to take the time to find an advisor and project you are very interested in, because it will be a lot of time to spend on something that you do not enjoy working on.",
    "Yea. This is an opportunity to study what ever you want."
