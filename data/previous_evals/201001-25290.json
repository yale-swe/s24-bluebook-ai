    "This is a great class! Our class was very small so we didn't have any pop quizzes and instead were graded on our discussions which were fantastic, especially since the class was so small. Professor Gorski is excellent, very smart, and is a great seminar leader. The readings were very very interesting, so if you have any interest in the material and topic at all, this is a great class to take and discuss those interests.",
    "Take this class if you're interested in religion! I'd imagine the feel of the course changes from year to year since it's small and the kids really drive discussion, but I can't imagine that it wouldn't be great again if people are interested enough to stick it out after they realize there's a significant amount of reading (~200-300 pages a week). It was a great window into sociology and we got to read and talk about lots of cool communities and theories of social organization and the role religion plays therein. The midterm and final come a little bit out of nowhere, as the class is really relaxed and discussion-based and great and then you have to do a ton of work to prepare for those two, but worth it in the end, I think. Just be prepared for lots of reading and synthesis.",
    "If you are interested in religion and how it interacts with the world we live in, this class is a must-take. It was well-taught and poignant, and made me reconsider my stance on several issues.",
    "Sociology 246 01 was a solid course. I enjoyed the readings and class discussion was generally engaging. Prof. Gorski does a good job presenting the material from what is a well-designed reading list and syllabus. In class, he asks thoughtful and thought-provoking questions and he does his best to create a warm, familial atmosphere in class. However, as there are not many evaluations, there are not many opportunities to receive and grow from constructive criticism. In the end though, I think I got a lot out of the course.",
    "A really great seminar with super interesting reading and discussions. Gorski picked great books and led great discussions--he's a super interesting guy, so definitely try and take a class with him! Loved the few other people in the class and got to know them quite well because of the fascinating discussions. This is a super relevant course and if you are at all interested in studying religion definitely take it. The reading is a lot and the midterm and final were difficult, but it is worth it. One of the best seminars I have take at Yale."
