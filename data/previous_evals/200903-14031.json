   "comments": [
    "The course material was very interesting and an excellent introduction to health policy.",
    "Great course. This course is very worthwhile for people who have little to no background in Policy.",
    "Weaknesses1. Course packet was the worst mistake that I have made thus far. It was 137 dollars (nearly 40 dollars greater than if I just printed out pages at 47 College)2. Class readings were often not really relevant to class discussion3. Professor's style of dictating seemed more like a morning session with grandpa than an actual class.4. Professor\/TAs exhuded an overly slanted approach to health policy and other ways of thinking. It made class discussion a waste of time for people who disagreed with a policy or the professor's position. You learn quickly to \"go along to get along\" in this class.Strengths1. Group projects2. Class touched upon many issues that are often not covered in other classes.3. Great survey course for people with limited understanding of U.S. healthcare system",
    "Would prefer to look at current health statistics and not statistics from the 1980's.",
    "rigorous. interesting.",
    "Very theoretical. I had already taken a more concrete policy course before this one and this seemed to be too fluffy as an intro to policy course.Also, the group projects are a horrible idea. I ended up writing 2\/3 of the first paper and doing all the editing for it while other group members contributed minimally. I have heard that the rationale for the group work is due to the fact that not every first year MPH student is capable of writing a 15 page analysis. If that is the case, they shouldn't be in a masters program. Don't punish those of us that can do the work.",
    "Very good class but very subjective. Should be entitled \"Health Philosophy\" instead of \"Health Policy.\" Subject matter would make much more sense then. Loved the cartoon contest!",
    "Like many other people, I didn't get as much out of the group project as is expected. The lectures were simply outstanding, and I really felt as though I was \"at Yale\" in this course. The flow and content of the classes was really engaging and enjoyable, and I briefly even considered switching to policy as a concentration. The instructor may want to focus on\/incorporate more current events in the lecture, but overall it's a fantastic introduction to health policy.",
    "It is a new way of thinking, but a lot of the information is out of date and could probably have been updated.",
    "Overall, the course is a very sucessful course.Strengths: Instructor, readings are interesting, controversal and informative, the lecture style of this class (powerpoint free) is GREAT, having domestic and international options when it comes to the readints was a nice option as well.Weaknesses: Some of the readings seem a bit dated, it's a required course so there are some people who are not interested in the subject matter that bring down the quality of group projects and case-simulations...perhaps find a way to weed out those who truly want to participate vs. those who are dead weight.",
    "I minored in health policy as an undergrad and found this course to be infuriating. I assumed heading in that a graduate level course would be much more in depth than anything I had previously experienced and the course overview given during orientation led me to further believe this. Much to my dismay this course was incredibly high level and theoretical and Mark actively avoided discussing the actual implementation of any of the topics. The most I got out of any discussion was \"why this doesn't work\". I already knew that policy was difficult and opinions differed, I want to know how to meld these various opinions into policies that get passed and then how to implement them effectively.All that being said, I realize now that I am writing my final that I learned a lot about how to frame my analysis and discussion of policy which is valuable. Perhaps the topics I wanted to cover are more advanced that this course.The town office simulation was valueless, I could have read it all and gotten the same value. The group projects were far and away the most valuable part of this course as we actually had to discuss and write solutions as a team - much more realistic.",
    "The course could have benefitted from the use of more updated materials, especially given all of the current health policy debates taking place.",
    "One of the best courses.",
    "It was a little frustrating that, in the midst of this big political discussion and reform of health care, we only talked about theory when we could have gained really important perspective on current events. That class and the readings were interesting though.",
    "As a policy student I was very disappointed in this class. I do not feel that we learned enough about how the American system works. Also, the group projects were terrible. Way too much information for even a group of people to attempt to synthesize. I also feel that i actually learned less doing projects as a group because I only focused on my part of the project, and not how it fit into the whole topic of what we were writing about.",
    "Strengths:- Approaches health policy from a very theoretical perspective.Weaknesses:- Group projects were extremely difficult and seemed to require significant amounts of (sometimes unrealistic) extrapolation.- Lectures could have been made more structured through use of powerpoint.- More focus on the relation to current issues in healthcare would have been good.",
    "Strengths in this course include assigned groups earlier in the semester. The second group project might result in better quality if groups are assigned.",
    "The course was a great course, but I definitely would like to have some more basic information about how the US healthcare system actually works before I learned about all of the theoretical issues that we covered in this class.I often felt like I was lacking in background to fully understand the material, and the TA review sessions didn't really help. I felt like that was the stuff we should have learned in class (or at least had a summary).",
    "It was good, it just needs to quit making me think that every policy I could create is wrong and there is no right answer to anything,",
    "The strengths of the course were the lectures themselves, which were clearly outlined and related in a coherent manner. Another advantage was the dialogue\/discussion between student and professor (and student to student) that made the core course feel more like a section. More background informational sessions would be helpful for those unfamiliar with the labyrinthine health care system of the United States (and perhaps there could be informational sessions on health care systems of other countries).",
    "One work: NOTES.Not comprehensive notes, just enough to give us a clear idea of the framework of ideas we were discussing each week.Mark's a brilliant lecturer and his classes are very fun, but his style of teaching is not suited for everyone to absorb learning points in class.",
    "Cons: Group work is tedious. I also wish that we had more grades for the course so the work of others didn't impact our own final grade so significantly (~60% of final grade is based on group projects). Group work also makes assignments much more difficult than they have to be... While I do believe there is real-world value to it, especially in a policy analysis setting, it is extremely frustrating in class to work with non-policy students who don't care about what grade they get in HPA 510 and aren't willing to put as much effort in as they are for their other courses. As a policy student I didn't mind doing slightly more than my group members at times, but there were some instances where it felt like I was doing so much hand-holding I wasn't able to get as much out of the assignments... Maybe I will feel differently about this as I get further from the class and gain more perspective though. Other cons are that there is a ton of reading - too much sometimes to the point where it doesn't always feel valuable. Finally, more discussion in class, or perhaps a discussion section once a week and lecture once a week, would be more interesting, but Mark is a great lecturer so it's not too bad usually.Pros: Mark is an awesome lecturer. As a student I could feel his passion for policy and his interest in teching this course in particular, which was nice. The course is very comprehensive, which is good as well. Mark is always sure to point out arguments of their being 2 sides (at least! Usually more!) to every policy story which is great. He also really lets you form your own opinon, which is clearly part of the purpose of the class.",
    "I felt this class seemed to be really biased in its opinion of controversial subjects, and the projects seemed to force students to present a certain sentiment expressed in class.",
    "Strengths: a whirlwind tour of US healthcare systemWeakness: I often question the neutrality of this course",
    "This was an excellent course. The class discussions were very interesting and informative. I really liked Dr. Schlesinger a lot.",
    "helpful to understand basic health system",
    "I thought the course should have been more on current topics",
    "I was a little frustrated at how much paper was wasted during this course. Every class we were given a packet of charts and graphs, and often times these were not even printed double-sided. I think that it would be very easy to put these graphs on powerpoint slides to use during the lecture. In addition, many of these charts and graphs were from the 1980s and 1990s. It just seems that given everything being discussed in the healht care debate today, it is a shame not to include that in the class discussion.In additon, our second group project was due right after Thanksgiving, and on the same day that our final was handed out. It would have been much more convenient if the second group project had been handed out a week earlier so that it was due before Thanksgiving.This would mean that groups didn't have to try to cordinate work during the break, and it would give us a week before the final is handed out.",
    "Strengths:1.) The professor knows his stuff. He may be biased to the liberal view, but he does not teach the class in a biased way -- he is open to discussion and points from other views.2.) I like the idea of having to read articles instead of using a book. We had to read one required reading and one of the optional readings per class, and I think that is the appropriate homework for this type of course.3.) Mark is always open to class discussion and welcoming in office hours.Weaknesses:1.) Many of the articles and class handout graphs are outdated.2.) We barely spoke of reform - since this is a health policy class, I figured we would talk about it.3.) The TA sessions I attended (2) were not helpful - the TAs read directly off the powerpoints.4.) The classes were a bit hard to follow - there were outlines, but the notes on the board were not helpful and the discussions seemed somewhat whimsical because they followed student input.",
    "It could have been better",
    "I enjoyed this class a lot. I found the readings to be a bit onerous and often extremely dry but otherwise informative. The group projects were a good opportunity to think analytically about certain topics in health policy. This seemed like a class that would greatly benefit from having a discussion section attached to it, as often there was nothing to reinforce what we were talking about.",
    "Overall the course was very informative and interesting. However it relies to heavily on group work. Both groups in which I participated, I felt some members experienced much more of the burden compared to others.",
    "I felt like I learned nothing. I was expecting to gain a better understanding of how public health works with policymakers to translate research into action\/law and instead I felt like all I heard was a bunch of abstract, redundant concepts without much real value. I was really disappointed- this class had so much hype! I liked Schlessinger's lectures- they were interesting and thought-provoking- I just feel like I didn't learn anything new- although this could be because I had a fairly sound grasp of policy\/policy-related concepts prior to entering the MPH.",
    "Unfortunately, this course did not live up to my expectations. While I understand that there are certainly no definitive answers in health policy, I scratch my head a bit in terms of thinking what I took away from the course itself. It was not for lack of effort by the professor or myself - I did all the readings and attended every class. My expectations were that we would take on the major issues of the day and given what was simultaneously happening in Congress with respect to Healthcare Reform, there was a golden opportunity to engage and debate and while it was acknowledged, it was a perfunctory nod at most and I think the lecture was kept to a script. The papers could have been great tools to hopefully developing real tools to address major issues, but I think that the group element interfered with that objective. In particular, the group element generally meant that assignment gravitated towards the least common denominator and the work product was motivated more by expediency than thoughtfulness. While I understand that policy is necessarily a consensus building exercise, in this case, the group element interfered with the learning. In the real world, there are also consequences for group members who do not do their work (e.g., they get fired). The assignments were way too wordy to the point that what was goal or core question sometimes got lost in the verbage.",
    "The course is a good introduction to health systems in the U.S. especially for international students.",
    "The lectures are great - Schlesinger is a truly wonderful orator, and shows real enthusiasm for the material. The course only addresses domestic policy. We spent a lot of time discussing the problems with making health policy reform, but there wasn't much time spent actually explaining the actual structure of the US healthcare system, which would've been helpful. Group papers are a horrendous idea; they are frustrating and they aren't a very good way to test one's knowledge of the material.Schlesinger is definitely the best thing about the course.",
    "The papers are helpful in learning the material. It is great to be able to talk through ideas with your classmates.",
    "Strengths: unique approach to health policy, requiring careful thought and critical analysisWeaknesses: did not discuss any relavant current events, such as national health care reform; more \"real-world\" parallels should have been drawn; group project was a bit difficult to tackle (especially the first project, where we were unable to select our own group...)",
    "strengths: great instructor, reading materials, and assignments; weaknesses: lecture topics could have been made more global\/international in its scope",
    "I enjoyed this course very much. The topics were interesting and timely and the lectures were much more discussion-based than other similar courses. It would have been nice to have a smaller class because I have a difficult time participating in discussion with more than 100 people in the room, and it seemed that the same people were always the ones participating. There is A TON of reading for this class. It seems nearly impossible to stay on top of all of it, unless this was pretty much the only class you were taking (or you didn't sleep). The group projects were interesting, but beastly - they take a lot longer than anticipated. Overall, I felt that I learned a lot from the class, but it seemed hard to demostrate that in the two group projects and the final alone.",
    "Great and interesting lectures and reading. The readings don't all get applied until the final (for better or worse)",
    "I really enjoyed this course. One thing I did not like was that practical information about healthcare systems was only given in an optional setting, outside of class, by TAs. I would appreciate more. However, I did think that everything taught was valuable and really made me think about things in a new way. Multiple times I have been tempted to change concentrations because I enjoyed health policy so much.",
    "Weakness: we are taught like we are in kindergarten,Strengths: challenging.",
    "The strengths were that we covered a lot of viewpoints and used a variety of learning methods (lectures, simulations) to gain an understanding of the material.Unfortunately, I don't feel like I learned any concrete health policy principles, and would have liked to incorporate more of the current health care debate into the course.",
    "This class was a good survey of issues in health policy. It would have been nice to have more discussion of CURRENT health legislation. The case simulation is sort of a good idea, but overall wasn't really worth it in my opinion. I enjoyed the group projects. The class handouts are a bit excessive...save some trees!!!",
    "The class lectures were always very enjoyable and interesting. Student involvement in the discussion makes it much easier to pay attention and be invested in the material. However, the group projects did not seem very relevant. The assigned readings for these projects were consistently 5-10 years old so it makes it difficult to connect material to an understanding of health policy today.",
    "The course helped provide an overall framework for understanding health policy today. The composition of the course including different modules helped guide the explanation of overarching concepts and terms in health policy.",
    "Strengths+Course makes students ask very difficult questions+Readings compile a variety of areas; international, American, comparitiveWeaknesses+Many students, including myself, do NOT have a solid understanding of the fundamentals of the American health care system, and we are discussing the different programs and making judgement calls. I think this class should be offered only to second year students.+Another assigment, other than the final exam, should be based largely on individual achievement. Too much of the grade is focused on group work. We should have had an assignment that compared the readings as we went along in the semester.",
    "The lectures were interesting and thought-provoking. The group project experience greatly depended on the group I was a part of (excellent for the first project, horrible for the second project). There were a lot of readings, and I wished I had made more of an effort to read them all.",
    "I wish there was more assignments other than the final that where we were evaluated individually. I was lucky to have a group that got along for the most part, but I would like to demonstrate beyond the final my understanding of the material?",
    "Did not enjoy writing group papers.",
    "Strengths: Very general overview of health policyWeaknesses: Topics were dull.",
    "Strengths - good foundation course on health policy with lots of interesting readings provided.Weaknesses - The number of reading seemed overwhelming at times.",
    "Great course, well structured, broad but not fluffy. Mark has really created a good syllabus with readings and lectures that fit together. There were times when I thought that Mark tried spent too much time trying to include students in the lectures by pressing the class for answers, and I think his lectures may have been occasionally more efficient if there were less calls for student input. Mark is great at pressing students to justify their intuitions, which is really valuable in health policy.",
    "Excellent course!Strengths: Professor Schlesinger's intelligence, familiarity with the material and engaging teaching style; the class's thorough and well-organized structure; interesting readings.Weakness: The prominence of group projects in determining grades",
    "My main take-away was how policy issues are framed, how the story is told. The concepts tend to be very philosophical, some students may find the course to be lacking in practical knowledge.",
    "The class does nothing to better understand the health care reform.",
    "Strengths: The course provides a general outline of policy issues and topics. The interactive class session, namely the city council meeting, was fun, informative, and innovative. I enjoyed the experience immensely. The comics were also quite fun.Cons: The course has too much reading. In all reality, students cannot read 150 pages per class session. Even 50 is pushing the limit. Slim down the readings and focus only on the most important ones. There is so much reading that even if the student does attempt to do it all, retention is minimal. (Note: If every class assigned 50 pages of reading per week with 2 sessions per week, that's a grand total of 500 pages a week... a lot.The professor should state his political beliefs (i.e. progressive) to the class during the first lecture so that students can be more critical.Group papers are hell. Everyone hates them except for the free riders, and the social pressure makes those \"what everyone contributed\" sheets inaccurate. I know it is easier to grade 15 papers instead of 60, but the experience and process of writing a group paper is tortuous.It would be amazing if we could have some PowerPoint presentations so we know the mainpoints to focus on. The discussions often seem scattered and hard to follow.",
    "Great course. Very interesting take on the subject.",
    "Overall a very strong intro course. Students come in with a huge range of backgrounds and it's difficult to teach to everyone's level, and Mark and the TAs did that as well as anyone could expect.It can be a little easy to get lost if you're unfamiliar with the health system. The TAs try to help with this by doing extra sessions, but that's limited. It might be helpful to either require or at least recommend a basic textbook, e.g. Bodenheimer and Grumbach or something similar.Group projects are a little contrived and hokey but get the job done."

    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0Although he is a good policy teacher, he has limited clinical experience and in policy, I think this is a major negative. It is difficult to understand issues of feasibility of change without ever working within the system.Furthermore, he told a classmate of mine to not do a policy analysis on medical malpractice because it wasn't solvable. I thought this was the point of doing a policy analysis - to perform an academic exercise. And also what exactly is a solvable problem in health policy?",

He obviously had the knowledge to but instead of saying \"that is for another course\/class\/whatever\" he just played down questions and moved on to the next nebulous point.",

    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0He's an authority on the American health care system. However, it would be helpful to delve into other health systems or international health programs instead of totally focusing on the US. I mean, the course title is somewhat misleading since it appears to refer to a general introduction to ALL health systems and policy.Otherwise, he's a good lecturer and very knowledgeable on the subject.",
    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0Mark is the best part about this class. He is an awesome lecturer. As a student I could feel his passion for policy and his interest in teching this course in particular, which was nice. Mark is always sure to point out arguments of their being 2 sides (at least! Usually more!) to every policy story which is great. He also reall lets you form your own opinon, which is clearly part of the purpose of the class. Class could be improved by having more involved discussions in smaller settings. Problems with that would be that Mark couldn't teach every section! It would just be nice to have a smaller setting for discussions that was a little less structured than the class is now. Mark also did a good job with not making the class feel rushed, even when it was clear we had lots to cover. He is also incredibly approachable\/accessible - which is great! It would be nice if Mark shared some of his viewpoints more clearly sometimes. You're left wondering not only how you feel on a topic but you also find it difficult to figure out how he feels... More direction in this area would be good. Sometimes I ended up wondering if it was okay to have an opinion about anything or if we should always argue from all sides of a topic... Because of Mark's teaching style the answer to that wasn't always clear.",

    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0I think he is energetic and well informed.",
    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0Mark is very open to discussion both during class and in his office hours (or by appointment). He is very skilled in his area and is friendly.",
    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0He is smart guy and amazing lecturer. He barely had notes when he used to come to the classes. But he did not make the class interesting even though he had really interesting. I used to zone out of the class after 15 minutes of the lecture.",
    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0I really enjoyed the lecturing style of this professor. I have mentioned before that I do not like powerpoint presentations and find them difficult to follow. Mark did not use powerpoint but instead, used a combination of \"story-telling\" and provocative questioning to encourage discussion in class. Most people seemed to feel comfortable participating in class, so the method worked well and was very engaging.",
    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0Mark is a fantastic and really engaging speaker. It was sometimes rather difficult to get access to him outside of class.",
    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0Mark is an excellent instructor who weaves various components of health policy and theory almost seamlessly.",
    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0Enjoyed Schlesinger's lectures but didn't feel like I got any tangible, applicable value out of them.",
    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0I think that Prof Schlesinger tried very hard, but I think he needs to be more critical of ideas coming from the class and more definitive on some of the issues we would talk about. Sometimes, we would go through a topic, he would solicit answers from the class and they would somehow populate the answers he had and then we would move on. I think that using the frameworks developed in class, we should have had a much more current debate or discussion.",
    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0At first I really liked him and was able to be engaged in class. By the end everything was so repetitive that it was easy to get distracted. I do like the charts he hands out during lectures, however the figures are quite outdated.",
    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0Enthusiatic about material. Encouraged participation, despite being a lecture-style class.Incorporated creative approaches to learning, such as a class debate.",
    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0well-articulated lectures, provided necessary support to students",
    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0Mark was a great teacher. I especially like his flow for the class. I felt like each topic lead naturally into the next, which made it a lot easier to understand some ofthe difficult policy concepts. He encouraged a lot of discussion and critical thinking in the class. I was quite impressed with the last class with the awards ceremony. It was definitely an above and beyond effort for an instructor.",
    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0A great lecturer who gives great feedback and is really interesting.",
    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0He was a fantastic professor and was very inspiring. He held people up to a high standard as far as what we could comprehend and understand, and I appreciated that.",
    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0Overall, the professor knows the health policy material that has been around for many years, but is not very open-minded about new ideas or trends that fall outside of those historic trends. For example,the professor was keen to promote the idea of regional differences in health status in the US, but when the data showed something different, then he would dismiss it as an outlier or something beyond the scope of the day's theme. Also, the turn-around time for the second group project grades could be improved.",
    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0Presents the information in an interesting way. One can get a feeling that he is well-versed in what he is talking about. Some lectures were a bit nebulous, and at times I could have gone for more concrete information and less input from other people in the class. On the whole, a good lecturing style. Things like the cartoon contest added some interest.",
    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0Mark is extremely interesting and very approachable. Lectures were always enjoyable but much more philosophical in nature than I expected.",
    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0Mark was a great lecturer. He is engaging and keeps the ideas and topics covered current and relevant to health policy debates nationwide. I enjoyed his use of popular culture and cartoon example to show how health policy debate is framed within the US.",
    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0Mark has a wealth of knowledge, and many of the student do not value it because of their short attention spans. They would rather update their FACEBOOK page than pay attention in class. About 20% of the student with laptops have absolutely no idea what is going on in class because they are watching YouTube or CNN. Well, I digress. Mark connects with students via the cartoon contest and his sense of humor. Also, the Montgomery County, Maryland simulation is an excellent opportunity to break the regular class mold and get students to step out of their comfort zones.The class had some substantial drawbacks. Mark's strong point of view often colored his analysis of the issues. We were told \"The only right to health care in America is for people who are incarcerated.\" Yes, this is technically true, but hospitals provide billions in uncompensated care every year for people who can not pay. The focal point of the semester, the success of America's campaign against smoking, had a major factual omission. The multi-million dollar tobacco settlements were used to fund PR campaigns that helped change people's opinions. He told us \"The southern states, in general, are not a good place to be.\" When one girl said she was from Arkansas, he laughed! Can you imagine if a student saidhe\/she was from a developing country and the professor laughed?",
    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0He is a great lecturer and very willing\/eager to help students understand and engage with the material.",
    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0Prof. Schlesinger is the most amazing lecturer in a very long time. It's amazing the structure in which he has, and his ability to deliver in such a conversational manner. The whole course was an eye opener. I really enjoyed the participation aspect as well and the case stimulation.",
    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0Mark is a rock star. He is the most impressive lecturer I have ever had. He goes up to the stage and eloquently lectures without pausing, working with feedback from the audience. It was a pleasure to be part of that audience.",
    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0Mark is an excellent lecturer and is very good at controlling the flow of the class and staying on track with the subject of the discussion of that day. He is very knowledgeable and I learned a great deal during the course.",
    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0Professor Schlesinger is smart, knowledgeable, engaging, and accessible.",
    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0Great, nothing bad to say. An engaging and terribly knowledgeable lecturer. Very creative.",
    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0The instructor is okay. He is just an ok teacher.",
    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0The professor works hard to create discussions and succeeds in creating psychological safety for the class. He has a lot of energy. Putting the outline on the handouts would be helpful.",
    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0Schlesinger is brilliant. One of the best lecturers I have ever encountered.",
    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0Overall a great, solid lecturer. We appreciate how well he thinks on his feet. Perhaps a little less time on soliciting discussion and more didactic time? It's great that he keeps the group engaged, and he's very good at using each comment to further the discussion, but I also came here to be taught by professors!"

Jeremy Green is a good man though his behavior outside of class (namely GYPSY) somewhat discredits him inside the classroom. It's hard to take someone serious when you've seen him completely trashed the night before (and yes this happens way too often).3. Pooja was a star in this class. She was amazing---so helpful, so genuine, so well-versed in the class\/class material.",

    "Our TA for the 2 group projects was Laura; she gave us good feedback on the outlines and stuck to Mark's strategy of not really answering questions somuch as asking questions that led us to our own answers. (?) the TA led review sessions were really good, Jeremy is a very bright guy.",
    "Jeremy Green: Jeremy did a nice job with the one lecture he gave, despite some pretty hard-core push back from the class.Other TA-lead review sessions were not as helpful. I would recommend holding them in smaller classrooms (not Winslow, as attendance is low) and having TAs split off into smaller groups.Having Joe Hero's on the group project was very helpful - he's great.",

    "The TAs were basically useless in the course. Even when they were supposed to help, they would refuse or would act completely obtuse, citing that they are not supposed to give answers. I understand from a practical standpoint that the prof doesn't want them giving answers, some of them took it way to far and wouldn't even clarify or give reasonable guidance, which would have helped. The few review sessions that they conducted were basically useless and also factually incorrect at time. I'm not sure why there are actually TAs in the course.",
    "The TAs were strictly not of any use to me personally. They only read off slides during review sessions. They might as well have posted them on the classes website instead of having us come to the session. They could have made better use of their position as TAs.",
    "They were fine.",
    "There wasn't really any instruction by a particular TA, but I did work with Pooja Sripad on both group projects and she was responsive and helpful.",

   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this course to fellow students because of Mark's teaching style.",
    "Some words of advise1. Don't buy the course packet2. Peruse the readings (they're not all relevant to the class and at times are not all that interesting)3. It's better if you just side with the professor on his views rahter than actually speaking up.",
    "Great for learning group communication skills and getting to know a little about health policy.",
    "TONS of reading. TONS!!",
    "Touchy-feely policy without much meat. You will leave with what you brought to the table.",
    "Good intro to health philosophy (not policy) class. Still would highly recommend!",
    "Take it. The group projects are a pain in the butt, but looking back you will have an overwhelmingly positive view of the course. Highly recommended, this is the only class this semester where I didn't miss a single class.",
    "This is more like a policy analysis or policy history class. It is not about current events. I would recommend this class highly to all incoming MPH students to get a firm grounding in policy before heading into their more science focused directions. Mark is a great professor and a great person to introduce more science minded folks to the policy world. He used fun and creative ways to teach and although the group projects can be a pain, they make you think together in ways that you won't encounter in other classes in your first semester of your MPH.",
    "If you have never taken a policy course before than take it. If you have some background in policy then avoid it and take another core course instead. If you are a management student avoid this course at all costs. I flipped out half way through the course, spoke with multiple second years on different occasions and they all echoed the same sentiment. They all had gotten very frustrated with the course's theoretical nature and wanted to know how these things actually worked - which is why we all came to school in the first place.",
    "Instead of suggesting strategies to come to policy conclusions, the course focused on providing others' explanations of general U.S. and international trends, which was interesting but did not help me to develop any practical skills. Generally, the course seemed somewhat outdated in its materials and missing some key skill development opportunities for policy (and general problem) analysis.",
    "I would recommend this course.",
    "I would not recommend this class to anyone else. I just don't think i came out of this class knowing any more than when I entered.",
    "A good course on the theoretical perspectives of healthcare. However, lacks in real-world applications, and you don't necessarily come out feeling as if you have learned all that much.",
    "I could read policy everyday, all day, so the readings didn't feel like a burden to me, but they definately did to others. Some felt the lectures weren't contextually rich, but i felt the framework-thinking was useful and topics were always applicable to what i was doing\/thinking about anyway.",
    "I'd say \"You're gonna love the awards ceremony\"",
    "A good course to become familiar with the intricacies of the American health care system. If you are interested in international health systems, this is not the course for you. Nonetheless, Mark's skill as a lecturer outweighs any qualms I had about the course. I would sit in the course even without being enrolled.",
    "Recommended for broad policy overview. Definitely will leave you with lots of questions, but that's the point I think! =) sometimes can be very repetitive of you have a strong background in the American health care system, but the information isstill interesting.",
    "Lots of readings",
    "Yes, if you want to know more about US healthcare system.",
    "Current topics in health policy. I would recommend this course for students looking to fulfill their policy requirement.",
    "important for those who do not have policy background",
    "if you like interactive classes you would like this course.",
    "This course doesn't have much to do with current policy reform. Even though you can easily get by without reading the articles, I recommend staying on top of the readings. Not only are they interesting and a great way to learn, but they will help when working on your group projects and on your final papers. You should start a weekly discussion group with classmates to truly understand the articles. Mark is very open to talking, and accommodates your schedule if you want to keep talking outside of class. Make sure to build a relationship with your team - the projects take a long time, but it feel good to hand in a well-done paper.",
    "I would not recommend it to other students.",
    "This class is a broad look at health policy in America and abroad. By the end of the class you will be familiar with Medicare, Medicaid and what it is like to think like a policy maker. The course has a particularly dense amount of required reading and the articles are often rather incongruous. This course poses many questions about policy and generally requires the student to come up with their own answers. Work load was 2 group projects and a take-home final paper, which required quite a bit of time in terms of coordination and execution.",
    "This course isa lot of work (hello, annoying group projects) for little value. Don't get caught up in the hype!",
    "I would summarize it as introduction to the philosophy of health policy. I think the people who enjoyed it the most were those who had the least background in health policy. Those who did have background or experience probably found it frustrating.",
    "The course is a good introduction to the U.S. health care system. Definitely a must-take for HPA students, especially international students.",
    "Mark is entertaining to watch and a super bright professor. However, his class can be quite mundane at times and the readings aren't all that helpful because he goes over the same information in class the next day.",
    "Great introductory class for understanding health policy related issues. However, the class falls short in helping one to develop policy making skills, though the assignments involve some policy analysis.",
    "I would summarize this course as a great introduction to health policy, but quite a bit of work. I would recommend this class because I felt like it helped me understand a lot of the key issues surrounding health policy, but I would add the caveat that everything in this course takes longer to do than anticipated - that means that the assignments and the finals are highly time-consuming projects - but in some ways, they are well worth your time.",
    "A great overview of information anyone should know. There is some overlap with other health economics classes.",
    "I would highly recommend it.",
    "I thought the class was okay, and would recommend it to another student. The class had a lot of readings and I would recommend tagging each week's reading by theme, this helps with the group projects and final paper.",
    "Yes, this is a good class overall. Mark is an interesting guy, and will make this class interesting.",
    "This class is very interesting but it is really a philosophy class at heart. While I had a good time taking it and participating in lecture discussion, I don't think I learned anything I would use again. I don't think I understand health policy any better. Also, you don't really need to do all the readings to get through the class but you'll need to have a grasp of them for the final so keep that in mind. Group projects can be really difficult if you don't choose your group well. So if you're looking for a fun elective and work well with people, take the class. If you want to gain any kind of practical knowledge, take something else. Also, one last piece of advice - date your class handouts. You'll wish you had during the final.",
    "A excellent introduction to current issues surrounding health policy and the effective allocation of health funding.",
    "Interesting, thought-provoking, engaging intro class in health policy. Don't take this course if you can't work well in groups because 2 of the 3 assignments are group projects.",
    "Be ready to be challenged; this is a wonderful course.You truly get the most out of it by participation, but be sure to take good notes. It's easy to get caught up in the lecture and forget to take notes, which becomes a little bit problematic when you need to reference them later. The group projects are fine as long as you get a decent\/good group, though beware on the second project if you choose to pick to be in a group with your friends (from seeing other groups this seemed to create more friction than harmony...).",
    "I would recommend this course as a foundation course on the topics prevalent in health policy and how to develop a frame of reference to think about these various topics.",
    "Great course, well structured, broad but not fluffy. Mark has really created a good syllabus with readings and lectures that fit together.",
    "Excellent course!Strengths: Professor Schlesinger's intelligence, familiarity with the material and engaging teaching style; the class's thorough and well-organized structure; interesting readings.Weakness: The prominence of group projects in determining grades",
    "See #6 above. In addition, I would recommend that a student strongly consider Howie Forman's financial concepts of ph funding over this course if they are looking for more applicable work.",
    "I would not recommend the hotel. It is just ok.",
    "I would not recommend the course to a fellow student, largely due to the group projects. Additionally, having to write a 10 page paper during finals week is painful.The class gives an overview of federal policy concepts through a very progressive lens. Do not expect a politically balanced course.",
    "Very interesting course. You don't learn too much about american healthcare, but you learn the psychology behind why people perceive healthcare systems.",
    "Strong intro course, gives you some room to think."
