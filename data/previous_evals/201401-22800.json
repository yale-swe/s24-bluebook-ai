    "Amazing variety of texts, some that related more closely to each other in terms of influence (Freud and Lacan) and others of different methodology, but most writers were concerned with the same kinds of neuroses and psychoses that inhibit a happy life. This common thread helped the texts speak to each other in sometimes unexpected ways.As much a class on psychoanalysis and therapies as writing about others."
