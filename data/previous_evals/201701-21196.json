    "I learned to understand drawing as interpretation. The biggest development for me was using charcoal. This class is taught mostly through doing though; we never really had direct instruction for how to draw.",
    "drawing",
    "I developed more confidence in my drawing abilities.",
    "In Drawing Architecture you learn that drawing is a very labor heavy act, an analytic act, and a difficult one. You will learn some drawing techniques and have some practice at free-hand drafting.",
    "How to observe space, how to draw space using line contours, tones and with different medium. Also learned how crucial observation and spending time on drawings are important, and I enjoyed the process of finding the right style for each drawing through repetition.",
    "This class was about producing work faster than you ever did before, so I definitely feel more confident with each mark I make on paper since you learn to go through a piece of paper literally in 5 minutes during class. So I can say I am not scared of white space on paper anymore.",
    "The course encouraged students to abandon conceptions about drawing conventions and think inventively to use drawing as a design tool.",
    "A survey of different media and drawing styles in architecture. Ways to visualize and break down the visual world.",
    "I loved this course because it opened me to new methods of drawing. I usually draw with a lot of detail and precision. With the instruction of this course I learned new ways of drawing quickly with a new type of \"accuracy\" that conveyed the feeling of the building instead of just its formal qualities.",
    "this course provided a rigorous approach to drawing that forced me to experiment with techniques and media . The course was not focused on architectural drafting, but rather visual and spatial experiences with architecture and representing them through abstraction. This class forced me to think about spaces and how to capture them through drawing.",
    "This was an amazing chance to work on my drawing skills. Be aware that this class is about drawing architecture, not drafting architecture."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I think that sometimes have a partner can be helpful, but overall I had a negative experience with having to always work with somebody else for every assignment. Part of it I think was that the architecture students always paired up, so that left the non-architecture students to have to work together. This was an issue for two reasons, one being that the less experienced people were always working with each other, and I think it would have been nice to have a pairing of experienced in architecture and those with different expertise. This was also an issue because I believe a lot of the non-architecture students were taking it credit D, so this was a low priority for them. As somebody who was non-architecture and not taking it credit D, this was annoying because I often had to do a majority of the work. I see why working with others can be helpful, but I would recommend encouraging or making architecture students pair up with non-architecture students.",
    "I wish there had been more teaching of technique. I understand the merits of letting students figure it out for themselves and develop their own style, but some basic concepts of proportion, perspective, and use of various media would've been helpful.",
    "could be easier and the TA's could be less high and mighty.",
    "The class is a great introduction to drawing and using different types of materials. The assignments were interesting and took us to different sites across campus, which was refreshing. If anything, the main weakness of this class was sometimes unclear direction of what needed to be completed. Usually, this had to do with changes in the class schedule, but the instructor and TA's were flexible. One improvement for next year could be having more time in preparing for the final review. This semester, the final review was the day after the review for Analytic Model and was stressful for many of the students because we weren't given time to work on our drawings during class.",
    "The biggest strength of this course is that it gets you to draw really productively and explore drawing techniques and observation in a totally new way. It was also very inspiring to see other people's creative works during the group crits. Victor repeatedly mentioned that this course was 'Drawing architecture' and not 'architectural drawings', and we were discouraged to do too architectural or too technical drawings, but as an architecture major, I think we are expected to have some basic knowledge and skill in architectural\/technical drawings going into the junior\/senior studios, so the elimination of drafting from syllabus wasn't really helpful.",
    "I think that drawing is an integral part of architecture and that all architecture students should definitely take a drawing class. That said, this class is a lot of work and although Victor and the TAs are very understanding in accommodating your needs and sometimes at reducing workload, you'll find yourself drawing for hours every week. I think one thing I really didn't like was that all assignments are structured so that you have to draw with a partner. Although I agree that teamwork is important and that there could be some assignments that are group work, I did not enjoy collaborating in every single one of them. I think many people do not have a certain style coming into this class and it is important for everyone to improve on it themselves and I believe being forced to work with people all the time constrains that.",
    "The course offered many opportunities to practice different techniques, but my peers and I often felt that we weren't sufficiently instructed on the various techniques, but rather had to teach ourselves.",
    "The course taught me very little about drawing architecturally or just drawing in general. I felt that the critical comments from the instructor were not constructive and assignments were excessive without cause.",
    "This course gives students a lot of leeway to work on their own, and as a result I feel as if there sometimes is not enough structure: students are not taught any techniques or mediums specifically, which can make things complicated for some of the less experienced students in the course.",
    "I think this is a very strong course in its organization. It pushed us to work in groups when we drew, which was helpful because we weren't so focused on how we thought we should draw but instead how to respond to a mark on the page in relation to the scene we were drawing.",
    "It was often unclear what the expectations for each assignment were, and I would have preferred some additional guidance in class, as most of the time we drew on our own, both in class and outside. I would also have benefitted from some lessons on drawing perspective\/ basic drawing techniques, as we were expected to know this already."

   "comments": [
    "This is a great class that teaches you how to draw, perceive space, and learn more about architecture even though you aren't doing \"architecture drawings.\" You don't have to be an architecture major or a sophomore to take it! Almost all assignments are group projects though, so if you hate people consider that.",
    "I would recommend this course as a way of understanding many different ways to interpret 3-dimensional space into 2-dimensional form. I learned to use new mediums as well. The biggest surprise was just how long drawing takes.",
    "I might if they really like drawing architecture.",
    "Yes, take this class even if you're not an arch major. You learn a lot and get to do fun activities.",
    "A really challenging course. Take it if you're committed to improve your drawing skills but otherwise, the workload is very heavy and the class is fast-paced, and you're expected to invest a lot of time and energy, so that it might be too exhausting\/stressful.",
    "Although the course is advertised so that non-arch majors can also take it, I wouldn't recommend it to someone who have never drawn before since the expectation levels are actually pretty high.",
    "If you want to better your drawing skills I would not advise taking this course.",
    "All drawing classes at Yale are fairly high workload, so this is not too different from basic drawing in that regard. However, this class will assume some baseline level of experience, and may not provide enough fundamental instruction for those without prior experience. Nonetheless, it is an interesting class that covers a lot of ground.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student who wants to improve their drawing skills.",
    "I would recommend this course to other architecture students, but probably not for those who want to take a drawing class from other majors. It is time consuming, and because most assignments are group ones, coordinating with a group could be difficult, andI ended up doing most of the work on my own.",
    "Great course, even if you don't have a lot of previous art experience. That being said, it will be a lot easier if you have some sort of prior fine arts experience."
