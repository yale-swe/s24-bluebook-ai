    "I would highly recommend English 120. It teaches you how to read, write, and think about essays and the conveying of ideas in general. Great course.",
    "Oh, absolutely. The readings are fun and I felt that I grew as a writer by the end of the course.",
    "Take this class. You'll learn skills you can use throughout your time at Yale. However, keep in mind that what you learn from this class is directly associated with your effort. If you want to get the most out of this class, make sure it is a priority. On top of all that, Professor Shirkhani might be one of the nicest instructors at Yale University. I totally recommend a section with her.",
    "TAKE ENGL 120!! If you're lucky enough to get Shirkhani, you won't regret it!",
    "Take this class if the rest of your schedule isn't too rough and you genuinely want to improve your writing. Be prepared to struggle through at least one of the prompts and constantly think about what's successful in the readings and how you can emulate that success.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this to another student. It was a lot of writing (essay about every 2 weeks)but very good practice.",
    "My favorite class I've taken. I would definitely recommend it to everyone - it was the one class I always looked forward to going to in the morning. I really think it improved my writing more than any other writing class I've taken. It changed the way I read - now I'm always thinking about the way that I write. The teacher especially made the class worthwhile.",
    "A great class with fun readings and essays where you just get to talk about yourself. It never feels like work. Take it!!"
