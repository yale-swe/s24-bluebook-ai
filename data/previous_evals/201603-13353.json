Ethan constantly made himself available to help students and his responses were always promt and helpful. This class had a disconnect between what was covered in class and what was represented in the homework, and Ethan bridged that disconnect in his office hours. Without Ethan's guidance most of the homework assignments would have been unmanageable.",

    "Instructor: Ethan Addicott \u00a0Ethan was so incredibly helpful and generous with his time and energy. He always made sure to plan his office hours so that time was not wasted and make thoughtful priorities for us. In his explanations of complicated mathematical concepts, he would create math \"recipes\" for us and that was transformative for my learning of the material. THE BEST. Thanks Ethan!",

    "Extremely useful, but very difficult to cram so much into one semester.",
    "Concepts taught in class and demonstrated in the class videos were not of the same caliber as the homework, which forced students to rely heavily on the TA. In class we were taught how to crawl and then the homework assignments expected you to sprint. I feel like if we could have covered more example problems in class to help build our intuition, rather than the usual 1 or 2 example problems, the intuition would have been there when it was needed for doing the homework.",

    "Ethan Addicott",
    "This course teaches relevant mathematical concepts that are incredibly useful for systems thinking applications. The best aspects of the course were the connections the lecturer made between mathematical concepts and their application to the management of natural resources. For example, the concept of limits and how one could apply this thinking to the exhaustion of natural resources over time. The computation of eigenvectors and how they are applied in understanding the stability of a system was an aha- moment for me. Lastly, had I know the full scope of the course beforehand, I would probably have opted not to enroll in the econometrics course at IDE as this course aligned more closely to my academic areas of interest.",
    "Great contextualizing math in a more applied instead of abstract manner",
    "I appreciated learning throughout the course where the mathematical concepts are applied in real life. It was motivating and interesting.",
    "This course provided a really useful reintroduction to concepts I'd learned before but had let lapse since HS\/college. Best part of the course was how well it helped me in my other classes where scholarly articles were regularly assigned--I felt I understood the math used in scientific literature better after taking this course."

    "There was a huge gap between the level of questions in our homework and the level the material is taught at. It was impossible to do the probem sets without a lot of help from the TA. The R questions were also frustrating. We had a one hour intro to R and were expected to be coding as if we had taken a semester or two of it.",
    "Prof. Fenichel has done a great job of developing a curriculum that helps us catch up to graduate level math in 12 weeks. However, the instruction in class can be improved on, by adding more description of the concepts and possibly offering definitions to concepts in words to aid note making.",
    "The homework assignments. 1) they were at a much higher level of difficulty than what was covering in class, without any build up or prior practice 2) The homeworks (and exams) were often sloppy and riddled with typos. These concepts are hard enough without having to muddle through the instructions and the question prompt's poor grammar.",
    "See above, more structure within the course lectures. More explanations of real world applications throughout.",
    "I would like to see more application of environmental studies problems discussed and used in class. At times, it felt like they were either only explored on PSets or thrown in as an after thought."
