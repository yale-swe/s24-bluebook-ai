   "comments": [
    "The course the starts with basic set theory and gradually moves to discussion ofgrammars and languages. I would recommend this class to another student. If you, like me, do not have a math background the class will be frustrating at times, but it is doable if you work hard and Professor Frank is always willing to answer questions and help you. This was one of the hardest classes I have taken at Yale, but it was also one of my favorites.",
    "I found Formal Foundations very interesting, but it is a strange combination of math and linguistics, and there was a very wide range of backgrounds in the class. I would recommend the class if the topic sounds interesting to you!",
    "Formal Foundations is, in a lot of respects, a math class, so if you don't want to write a lot of proofs, don't take it. If you do like math, though, and you like linguistics, I would highly recommend it.",
    "Great math-based curriculum, particularly mind-blowing when the professor sneakily related what we were learning to different areas of linguistics. I loved doing the problem sets (the midterm\/final are just slightly longer problem sets, nothing too challenging). Would recommend for any linguist\/mathematician, but unsure how easy it would be for someone without at least a little bit of abstract math background."
