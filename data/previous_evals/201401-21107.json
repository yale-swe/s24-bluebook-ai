   "comments": [
    "The Dutch department is being cut this year. That being said, I would recommend the language, as it is still relevant in the modern world. I think it is a shame that they are cutting the program, especially for a language that almost 20 million people speak. This language has enormous importance in history, art history, economics, and many other subjects and will help students with their studies in these areas. Dutch is a very academic language, and it is more than a shame that Yale has deemed it unworthy of funding.",
    "I would highly recommend Dutch to anyone who enjoys learning languages. I hope that it will be offered again soon!!",
    "A fantastic language course that emphasized grammar and Dutch culture. The small class size allowed every student to have time to interact with the professor everyday. It is very unfortunate that Yale canceled the Dutch program."
