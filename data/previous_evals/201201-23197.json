   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this class. It is definitely challenging and there is a lot of work, but the books are so important to read and the class really helps to pull out some major themes and connect all of the works.",
    "do it. unless you're some prick who's already read all of these books in their original languages and just wants to show off.",
    "English 130 moves very quickly and requires a lot of work, but it is a very fulfilling class. Be prepared to put in the time to do well.",
    "If you can keep up with the reading and you've got the discipline toslug through most of Don Quixote and Ulysses (rewards in themselves) then the seminar will be fantastic. If you don't plan to read four thousand pages of literature don't disrespect Justin (or any of the other professors, whatever) by taking the class. It will be worthless to you and you will be worthless to it.",
    "I would recommend Epic to anyone. Take it for the books. The books are great, and this will make you read them. As long as you are comfortable with not being able to spend a ton of time analyzing each one of them because of the pace of the class, definitely take it!",
    "If you look at the syllabus and find yourself excited by the majority of the books, go for it. If not, don't do it: you have a ton of reading, and much of it really does matter. In addition, it might be nice to choose a section by looking in to the one book the teacher gets to choose and picking the one you're most interested in reading. Justin is a great teacher and really makes this a fun experience, even as you're slogging through your fourth 500+ page book.",
    "This course provides an introduction to several important works of literature, including Joyce's Ulysses. Epic traces the development of the themes and conventions of early epic poetry beginning with the Odyssey though to more modern works. The workload of this course is high and the pace intense."
