    "Take this course if you are placed in L5 Arabic or have climbed up the language ladder. This class is very important if you wish to learn Media Arabic and hope to communicate with others in the Arab world.",
    "I would recommend this course to a fellow student.",
    "ARBC 150 is an advanced level Arabic course that focuses on reading material that one often finds in Arabic news outlets. Although the class purports to build on writing and speaking skills as well, there is not enough rigorous practice in either of those areas to really develop skills. I would recommend this class to a student at the L5 level of Arabic if they want to sustain their current level. However, I would warn them that they may not develop many new skills.",
    "If you've taken Arabic up to L4, definitely continue and take ARBC150 as well. It's a great course that gives you a lot of practice in Arabic speaking and reading."
