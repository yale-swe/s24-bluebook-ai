    "Absolutely take this class. It seamlessly engages with critical theory, classical texts and contemporary political issues. Kasimis is a dream.",
    "Take it! The topic is super interesting and can take on shapes and questions you wouldn't anticipate, although it won't be the same without Kasimis.",
    "YES!",
    "This class was a perfect balance between classics and critical theory. We used current readings to illuminate classical ones and vice versa. This contributed to very rich interpretations of the text that helped us gain a better understanding of the use of myth in Athenian society as well as the use of myth in American society and of the politics of immigration in both. I would definitely recommend it."
