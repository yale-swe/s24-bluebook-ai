    "I became familiar with a range of ethnographic literature, approaches, philosophies. I learned to think attentively about the form and content of this type of academic writing. I now feel that I have a broad understanding of the issues that ethnographers and anthropologists are thinking about and grappling with, and the various ways that they have approached the challenges of the form of ethnography."

   "comments": [
    "Strengths: The focus on one book a week (instead of a variety of readings and more than one book which can be common in other classes) allowed for a deeper engagement with each author and work, which I felt made for a higher level of discussion and engagement in class discussion. The workshop portion of the class was incredibly motivating and helpful, and a rare chance to read and respond to the work of classmates in a coursework setting. The flexibility allowed in the essay assignments was also a great chance for students to identify and follow their interests. Weaknesses: While I appreciated the chance for every student to speak in the go-around at the beginning of class, sometimes it got a bit lengthy and was hard to stay engagedmaybe in the future it might be worth restricting this to a couple sentences. Additionally there were times when I would have appreciated more direction in discussion facilitation. Sometimes it felt like one or two people were monopolizing the discussion by focusing on one critique of the book that sometimes made it hard for others to feel like they could speak about some other aspect of the work."

    "Yes, if they are interested in the chance to think deeply about writing and ethnography. It was quite helpful in both of these aspects. And the format allowed for discussions that were (for the most part) lively and accessible."
