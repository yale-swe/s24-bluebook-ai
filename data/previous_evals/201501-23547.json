   "comments": [
    "I think the content is very reasonable which help us to understand how light works during the whole design process.",
    "Lighting practical is the best part of class. Seeing what the lights can do is much more helpful than talking about. Field trips to rep shows were also extremely helpful. It really gives the big picture and is like opening a book and flipping through the pages.",
    "The hands on activities were the most valuable for me. The practicals, although sometimes frustratin for my lack of knowledge and skill, were where I learned and gained the most from. Working with Robert and the two substitutes on our idea lists helped inform me how to develop lighting ideas and how to translate them on paper. Going over them more than once was also helpful."

   "question_text": "What improvements can you suggest?",
   "comments": [
    "I suggest that if we can do the certain play in a long time , it will help me more. Like we can start from discussing the play , then design the play and do the real practice.",
    "I think more focus and attention should be paid to the theory and properties of light. Maybe learn some color theory. I also think a better guided tutorial of how to draft lighting would be extremely helpful. Although we touched on and reviewed many of the steps of drafting, I do not feel confident or ready to be able to draft for 134.",
    "It would be extremely helpful to combine the idea plotting and the practicals together. Going over the idea of one lighting idea in the 101 space would help info my drafting. Vice versa with the practicals - it would be very helpful to create a rough plot of what our group practical is before going into 101. And going over them in class before working in 101 would be to our advantage."

   "comments": [
    "I think 124 with Robert was informative at times, but the lack of structure made the year end with a fizzle. Why is there no attention to lighting or projection in the final project?",
    "It was difficult to get a firm grasp on what is expected out of a light plot. I don't feel confident going into 2nd year with what I learned this past year. I think that it may be in part of how the classes are organized. It's hard to keep the momentum moving forward. It felt like I was continually retracing my steps."
