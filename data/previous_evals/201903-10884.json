   "comments": [
    "This course provides a comprehensive and self-contained overview of the field of asynchronous\/self-timed circuits, working up from the electrical properties of an individual transistor, up to how we think about designing gates and logical rules, all the way up to compiling high-level descriptions of a process down to individual gates and transistors. We learn how to work with open-source tools for designing chips for laying out individual components by hand, and then build out higher levels of abstraction throughout the remainder of the labs in the course.",
    "Learned about some core design ideas, challenges, and tools involved in making asynchronous chips! Learned the basics of writing ACT and CHP, testing their resulting chip layout, and designing basic components in Magic manually and through auto-generation.",
    "The course is a deep dive into asynchronous VLSI design, theory, and practice. I came in not knowing that asynchronous circuits existed and walked out with a chip implementing a program I wrote. We cover everything from transistor layout and sizing to asynchronous circuit communication and timing theory. We use the tools that we wrote in class and developed by Professor Manohar's group to compile a program from pseudo-code to circuit layout."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The course is very well organized: we systematically build up from the lowest levels of abstraction up, covering the major topics of circuit design and asynchronous circuits along the way. Professor Manohar does a wonderful job of demonstrating the elegance of many ideas in asynchronous circuits (compared to the clocked alternatives), and because of the small class size, discussions often moved towards ongoing research directions and Professor Manohar's own interests, which kept class lively and engaging. The labs, while intensive, were also well designed to give us a deeper understanding of what we were covering in class. As for weaknesses: some of the tools we had to work with in our labs and for the final project were finicky or buggy. This is an understandable consequence of the fact that these tools are part of ongoing research work, and I expect them to get better each year as more work is done on them.",
    "Strengths: Prof Manohar's lectures, his enthusiasm about the subject, ability to ask questions during office hours, the psets help teach the topics learned in class, the open-ended nature of the final project, two-person teams for the labs in the second half of semester, the subject is still an exciting, relevant, and open field of research Weakness: more documentation for CHP, ACT and PRSIM would have helped, little tips early on about how to debug in P-\/I- RSIM, such as \"break-on-warn\", printing current values of nodes, etc., would have also been greatly helpful",
    "Strengths: the ideas and benefits behind asynchronous circuits are very compelling\/interesting and you get the sense that the main hurdle holding back even further adoption of asynchronous circuits is primarily industry inertia and a lack of tooling (which are being worked on in Prof. Manohar's lab). Professor Manohar is brilliant and a very engaging lecturer. The projects build on each other and give you a chance to grapple with the problems in a real context. Not really a weakness but be aware that the field is being developed as we speak. It has existed for decades but there isn't really a canonical textbook for this yet. You get to use a compilation toolchain that is actively being developed in Prof. Manohar's group, which is exciting but you need to put in the time and effort to figure out how things work. Personally, I really enjoyed this aspect of it, and it feels more like a project you might do as part of research work compared to other classes."

    "Yes. Coming from a CS student with little background in EE, I found this course to be both very accessible and extremely interesting. If you're serious about taking this class, be mindful that it will take you a lot of time to complete the labs, so keep your other classes on the lighter side. There's nobody better than Professor Manohar to teach you about chip design take advantage of the opportunity while you can. If you have even the slightest interest in the methodology of how chips are made, you should seriously consider taking this class while you're at Yale.",
    "Yes. Know that there is a decent amount of work involved. But if you have any interest in chip design, this is a wonderful class to take. If you are a CS major, you will have to pick up a few core electrical ideas about transistors. That should not take too much time outside class. If you are an EE major, you will have to learn two new \"coding\" languages and use a bit of C. Prof. Manohar does a great job teaching the two languages in class. The lab involving C might take more of your time to implement. If you are an EECS major, this class is right up your alley.",
    "This is one of my favorite classes that I've taken at Yale!"
