    "I definitely recommend this course. It's mandatory dancing; what more can you ask for??",
    "This class is not a conventional Yale course.. which I loved. It was a great break from the monotony of sitting through lectures and memorizing material. And the best part: you get to dance!",
    "This was a course like no other! We danced about 75% of the time which was a nice break from my more academic classes. Professor Coulibaly is such an interesting person and has a lot to teach about not only West African dance but also life philosophy if you're listening closely enough and draw parallels between dance and life. Discussions were a bit weak because there was no pressure to do the readings. Professor Coulibaly's voice is also very soft so you may have trouble hearing him. Be warned that the class can be strenuous! The class felt like a heavy workout in the beginning but the movements seemed to get easier as the class went on. Perhaps this was also due to the fact that the seasons changed from summer to fall to winter and also that PWG has poor AC.",
    "MUST TAKE!!!!! This was my favorite class at Yale. You must attend most classes, but they are so fun- you dance the whole time. And, talk about West African culture, and hear of Lacina's experiences. It was a great class, on a subject that I would have never known anything about had I not taken it.",
    "This is a fantastic class and I would absolutely recommend it to another student. A willingness to dance and participate in the class activities is necessary. You'll need to be willing to try every dance style and exercise, and I would say the fewer limiting constructs you place on yourself the more you will gain from the class. Don't be afraid of making mistakes or messing up the choreography, you will mess up and it's completely ok if you do.",
    "Take it as a fun easy 5th. Stress-relieving fun physical activity, although the second hour of class could drag at tines",
    "I loved Coulibaly's choreography and ability to perform. He gave very specific instructions, although less focused students had trouble hearing his often quickly delivered edits or adjustments to the choreography, I usually heard him accurately. With that said, it was hard being in the minority: more clear instructions at times would have been helpful. I would also say that seminar discussions were pretty disappointing. I stopped doing the readings because I had realized that Coulibaly did not place an emphasis on them at all for our discussions; it is difficult for me to prioritize the readings as a student if he does not do so as the instructor.",
    "YES",
    "I recommend this class. It's fun and if you like dancing at all, you'll love this class.",
    "An amazing dance class focusing on West African form, with an hour discussion section during part of the Thursday section",
    "Definitely recommend for anyone, dancers and non-dancers! This is a great course. Professor Coulibaly is very knowledgeable about West African Dance and is eager to share his knowledge and personal experience with students. The class is not stressful, but you learn a lot and have the opportunity to explore new forms of dance.",
    "Absolutely! Good senior year class, especially if you need one low-stress class. Professor Coulibaly is more concerned about your focus and improvement over the course of the semester rather than your actual dance skills. Don't be put off by the amount of time (2 hours twice a week), you can generally get away with just skimming the readings as long as you have something intelligent to say during the discussion.",
    "I would highly recommend AFST 435 to anyone who is looking for an unusual class at Yale. I took it as a junior, concurrently with a lot of math\/science courses, and I really appreciated getting the chance to use a different part of my brain with this class. I also appreciated that the bulk of the work for this class is in class only. The outside readings are light but interesting, and will certainly help when it comes to write the end of term paper, but it isn't essential to read them all every single week, and you can catch up on them later in the semester. This is definitely a dance class first and foremost, and I had no experience going into this, but some of the other dancers were disappointed at times because the class moves sort of slowly, since the class is open to students of all levels of experience. Overall, though, this class is a great workout and it is interesting to be exposed to different kinds of dance and music I wouldn't have otherwise encountered."
