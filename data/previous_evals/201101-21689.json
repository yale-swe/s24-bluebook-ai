I would highly highly highly recommend this class to anyone who is interested in India, visual media, both or neither!",
    "Almost the entire grade in this class is based on the final paper (and a presentation on that paper). Besides that, if you have a moderate understanding of the readings, you'll do fine week to week. I definitely encourage you to take this class if you feel confident writing a 20-25 page paper for the majority of your grade.",
