    "definitely - class is really fun and interesting, and pinzka is great",
    "I would recommend 160 to anyone who wish to know something general about the important topics surrounding France--immigration, employment, family, EU, etc. However it is a LOT of work--about 2-3 hours worth of homework per class (reading&writing&other assignments), and you write a LOT. But on the upside, your writing will improve throughout the course, and you learn to write much faster thanks to the quizzes.Besides that, I also think it's a good way to retain your current speaking level.",
    "French 160 is a good way to improve your oral and written French. You debate contemporary issues of social change in France. Many of the topics are truly fascinating and discussing them in French improves your capacity to express yourself in a sophisticated manner. The workload in heavy but steady. Plan ahead and you'll find your French will improve a lot.",
    "Absolutely take this course! I took it so that I wouldn't lose what I learned in Paris during the summer, and I'm glad I did! Mme Pinzka is amazing. She is so supportive.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. If you do not enjoy French and French culture and are just looking to finish you're language requirement, I would not recommend it. There is a fair amount of work and obviously it is all in French. However, if you do enjoy French, I highly recommend the class especially if you also enjoy current events.",
    "Very good overview of French culture and politics. Really good for improving your spoken French.",
    "I would recommend this class! The material is interesting and good to know, although it is not always beautiful or inspiring. I think the real worth of this class is in the speaking practice and exposure to contemporary sources. It's a good class to practice all of the skills gathered in previous years: reading, writing, speaking. Also, Madame PInzka is a great professor who makes the class interesting, and the environment is always encouraging.",
    "This was a great class overall. The focus was on becoming more comfortable and familiar with the French language and culture through studies of current events and various aspects of French life; it was good practice for French language skills, but not the class to take if you are still looking to develop basic knowledge of the French language. Professor Pinzka was great- she was always energetic and engaged, and very personable. It was easy to talk to her in and outside of class, and she was very understanding. The workload was very manageable- the readings tended to be interesting, but it was easy to skim them in order to discuss them in class."
