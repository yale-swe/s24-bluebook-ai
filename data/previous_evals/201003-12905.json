    "I would recommend this class to others. There is almost no work during the semester. The 15\/20 page paper at the end sort of sucks but it really isn't as bad as it seems. Sometimes class could get a little dull, but for the most part it was an enjoyable class",
    "Urban Ecology in New Haven is an amazing course. I definitely recommend taking this course if you are interested in addressing real life issues in the context of the city Yale calls home.",
    "This is a class for people with an interest in environmentalism in a city context. It is a class that gives you a strong introduction to New Haven. We met with the Mayor, looked out over the city from the top of the Omni, and all did projects in the community. Take this class if you are interested in ecology and how it relates to urban life and policy.",
    "Urban Ecology is a great class to take if you are interested in cities and their environmental impact. There is a relatively low workload and Gordon is a great person\/professor. However, Urban Ecology does not fulfill any distributional requirements and the class-as-is lacked a comprehensive, cohesive curriculum.Taking this class really depends on personal preference.",
    "Great way to get to know New Haven as an incoming freshman. We met with the Mayor, walked around the city, and learned about Yale's \"vision\" for the future. As a class, however, it's not very challenging. Not a whole lot of material is covered.",
    "This class is very enjoyable and nice because you get out of the classroom a lot and into New Haven. I learned a lot about the city of New Haven which was helpful because it was all very new to me, as a freshman. Gordon is incredibly accessible and a great professor. The Community Based Learning projects are interesting, but make sure you get one that you are interested in because it ends up being most of what you remember and spend your time on for the class. The material gets a little old after a while because it is the same basic principles that you continue to apply to different aspects. I thought this was interesting and learned a lot about ecological analysis not just in nature, but also in an urban planning context. However, if you do not think that sounds interesting, this may not be the class for you.",
    "I would recommend Urban Ecology in New Haven to another student. The CBL project was time-consuming, but was a good way to learn about New Haven. You will learn a lot from the guest speakers. I don't really know how much I learned about ecology, and the class was somewhat disorganized, but the professor is very accessible and knowledgeable.",
    "Loved the actual class but I don't konw if it actually helped my grade. Urban Ecology is about how cities can become more sustainable as examined through industrial ecology, landscape ecology, and ecosystem ecology (don't be intimidated, I didn't know what anyof that was until I took the class). New Haven is used as a case study so you get to walk around New Haven, get out of the classroom a lot, and meet different guest speakers that Gordon will ahve come in. Gordon Geballe is a great professor. He is very nice, understanding, and genuinly cares about his students and about what he is teaching. I will warn though: this is one of those classes that you love but you feel like it may or may not be helping your grade. Just know: this class is A LOT of work and can be very stressful (it was for me). This isn't a reason not to take it; I feel like you can be fine if you go into it knowing it's going to be hard instead of like me, thinking that \"freshmen\" seminar meant that it would be more of an introduction-level class.",
    "Urban Ecology is an awesome class. Don't let the early time deter you; Gordon is wonderful and the course material is interesting. The workload is not too difficult. The Community-based Learning projects are hit-or-miss and typically fun, allowing you to get to know New Haven and its leaders. The class takes tours of New Haven and Yale and has meetings with the city and environmental leaders.",
    "It's a \"get to know New Haven\" class more than anything else. We take walks around the city and learn what the university is doing to better integrate with the city."
