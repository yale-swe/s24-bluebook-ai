    "This course covered the fundamental concepts and techniques in biology. I would highly recommend this course to non-biology background students who want to conduct research in biological\/biomedical sciences as it is very helpful as a boot camp training.",
    "Biology overview for engineering or physical science students who have had no or little experience with biology.",
    "A good class for introduction to \/ review of biological concepts. If you have a fairly strong background in these topics, then you'd probably be better off reviewing them with an old textbook or online resources. If you're background is quite limited, however, this class should be very useful."
