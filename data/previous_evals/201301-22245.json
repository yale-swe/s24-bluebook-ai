   "comments": [
    "Yes, very interesting lectures. Good class with lots of reading and papers.",
    "You take out as much as you put in for this class. Without any background in architecture or without having taken a class on it before, it was definitely very advanced and at times hard to understand.",
    "The lectures are a bit disjointed, but I learned a lot through section. Really interesting topic for someone who's not majoring in architecture.",
    "Enjoyable lectures, easy homeworks, authoritative readings, sexually ambiguous architecture grad students. What's not to like?",
    "Never.",
    "It's a introductory class. I'm not sure how other Urban Studies courses compare but I enjoyed it even though lectures weren't necessarily that helpful. The readings, though sometimes quite dense, taught me a lot.",
    "I really enjoyed the course. The readings are a lot of the famous urban design literature, which are great to read, though you're not given much incentive to do so. The lectures are a little nebulous, though you see a lot of cool stuff.If you're interested in learning about the progression of the field of urban design from ancient Greece to modern day, then take this. It's an intro course, but it definitely got me interested in learning more. If you get a chance, do the Community Based Learning option for your final essay. It gives you a lot of practical, relevant interaction with the information that the rest of the course sometimes lacks.Put a lot of effort into the three assignments--that's where I learned the most.",
    "I really like the idea of this course, and Yale doesn't really have much else in the area of urban design. However, there are many things that could be improved. It is so broad that it doesn't really do justice to a lot of the individual topics. The lectures are a bit disorganized, and the slides are kind of jumbled - I think Professor Rubin said that some of them were from a different course, so there is random text that isn't always applicable. I enjoyed the assignments, but they weren't really related to a lot of the information we learned in lecture. I think this led to a lot of students skipping class. The lectures weren't structured that well - I found it difficult to take notes and for much of the time Professor Rubin would just talk about individual sites, architects, or cities and I wouldn't understand the general theme or how everything was tied together.The course has a lot of promise but also needs work.",
    "Intro to Urban Design is two distinct courses in one. The class and section content is mostly about the history of urban design. What were people thinking about how cities should look through history? If you are interested in urban issues, this course gives you the sort of background you probably want to be able to discuss New Urbanism or Modernism in more detail. Go to lecture, though it is too long and too early.The work is a little different from the class. It asks you to practice different elements of urban design work, from analyzing a space historically, to designing or studying a contemporary space, to writing a long piece about an urban topic. The projects do take some time, but I found them engaging and interesting, but I LOVE CITIES.Also, there should be more urban studies courses. Peace.",
    "An introduction to western urban design theory, conducted in chronological fashion from the Ancient Greeks and Romans to the present-day. I would recommend this course to another student as a great architecture course to take; if you hadto just take one, in all four years at Yale College, it would be this one.",
    "good introduction to urban history though heavy on the architecture side of things, Professor Rubin is entertaining and energized, and usually a good group of interested people take the class.",
    "Take it! The lectures are awesome, and the projects are really fun.",
    "ARCH 345 is a nice class. The lectures are interesting but the really fun part is in the three projects. I had no experience with urban design or architecture previously (which means some things were a little hard to follow). However, I thoroughly enjoyed the projects and learned a lot about alot of interesting things.",
    "History of thought about urban design. Really interesting to understand the logic and history behind the different types of buildings and city plans that we all encounter all of the time. Great readings and I would recommend it.",
    "Definitely take this class if you are interested in urban planning and urban design. Will learn so much about this topic and it is very applicable to real life."
