    "Recommended to anyone with an interest in computers.",
    "Great class, you end up understanding what is going on in your computer and you actually build a processor which is amazing. It is challenging, but not difficult at all, if you study right you'll be ok. Labs are soooo annoying and time consuming I hated them, I guess I did not read EACH AND EVERY WORD on the lab every carefully, which you should definitely do because what has a .000001% chance of going wrong WILL go wrong. but TAKE IT such a good class, amazing amazing professor.",
    "Really really great course, definitely take it, especially if you're curious about the electrical engineering major. The stuff you learn is super relevant and all around useful. Not a ridiculous amount of work though labs can be frustrating because the software is temperamental (read: you will at some point have to start from scratch on a schematic or maybe even an entire lab because of some weird malfunction). But all around an excellent class, DEFINITELY take it.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class and in fact have been doing so already. Not only is this a very useful class for engineering majors but is also a very good choice for non-science majors to get introduced engineering. The class doesn't require much prior knowledge and teaches you how computers work, complete with designing your own processor. Its also quite fun.",
    "This is a great class to take. If you are interested in EE, this will give you a great idea of what the major is like at Yale. If you are not, this is a very good basis for understanding basic topics in EE and is very itneresting. The labs assigned throughout the class are very, very time consuming but you will learn a lot by doing them (and not just copying the assignment). Prof. Makris is great and very helpful with any questions or problems.",
    "This was an absolutely amazing course when Professor Makris taught it. He explains everything adequately so you understand what you're doing, the labs aren't too difficult but they're still informative, and the homework isn't graded. The tests do require sufficient studying, but if you've been to class and you know your stuff, you can do very well on them. And you really do learn a lot but it doesnt seem difficult!If it's still being taught by Professor Makris, take it now, before it goes to someone else.",
    "I would recommend this course to someone who doesn't know if they're interested in EE yet. It was challenging but very fair. Very good course.",
    "You probably have to take EE201 if you want to major, but otherwise it's a very slow paced easy class. The labs are cool though, and if you want an easy class without too much time commitment, its fairly interesting throughout.",
    "I would strongly recommend EENG 201 for a fellow student. It was a very interesting course and a great introduction to the subject.",
    "I would summarize it as a medium workload, interesting class. I don't know what the major is like, so I can't say if it's representative of what the EE major is like. That said, it is a class designed for freshman and sophomores without any previous experience (which is mostly true) and that's what the demographic mostly was. I think EENG201 requires a type of thinking that is unusual and distinct from most other QR classes. I found this refreshing. I would recommend it to others who have some vague interest in electronic circuits and logic and etc. It probably wouldn't be the best for a strictly humanities-type, and it's certainly not an easy QR credit.",
    "This course will let you know if you want to continue on the EE path. Take it if you want to. You definitely won't regret it.",
    "It's good course to get you on the track of EE. This is an useful course even if you are not a EE major. Also, this is an easy course and grading is very lenient.",
    "Yes. It is a good and interesting course that does not require much background, and the material is taught well."
