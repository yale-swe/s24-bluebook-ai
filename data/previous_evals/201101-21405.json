    "An excellent course that introduces a student to Judaism from the pre-exilic era until the Savoriam.",
    "Yes, certainly. The breadth of materials with which we engaged and the methods of interpreting rabbinic literature were aspects which made the course extremely valuable.",
    "I would recommend the course, especially for those without much prior learning in the Old Testament, the second temple period, or rabbinic writings."

   "comments": [
    "It helped fill in many gaps left by previous courses and introduced me to Rabbinic literature in a brief but thorough manner.",
    "My major area of study is not in Judaism\/rabbinic writings; however the course provided much useful background not only in thinking about Judaism but also early Christianity. The course also helped me to narrow my preferences for future study."
