   "comments": [
    "A great class for reading, a little confusing on the writing side especially if you are not well trained in writing a literary analysis paper.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. The workload is not overwhelming and it is very worth your time.",
    "It is a class that looks at Italian and American authors writing about Italy and the US. It's fascinating and not crazy difficult, which means you can really take the time to enjoy the works you read. Professor Sodi is great, and I recommend this class to everyone.",
    "A million times yes. I switched from the English major to the Literature major largely because of this class. Professor Sodi is one of the warmest, most approachable human beings I've ever met, which puts her far beyond any professor I've ever had in terms of overall wonderfulness. The readings for Cross-Cultural Narratives are diverse (short stories, poetry, and novels), fascinating, and not too heavy, though having an interest in Italy (or at least in history) is necessary. Professor Sodi also incorporated movies and TV shows into analysis of the texts, which made the course even livelier. Highly recommended.",
    "Take it! The readings are fantastic, and though it doesn't require too much work to get a lot out of the course, putting a little more time in to do the readings along with the study guides makes a tremendous difference. Professor Sodi is terrific.",
    "This is a hidden gem of a course. [Congratulations, you've found it!]But seriously, take it. I've gotten more from this one class than I have from whole semesters. Risa is wonderful. The discussions were genuinely productive, neither instructor- nor bullshit-dominated. And you get to read authors you've never heard of (Pavese, Hersey, Sciascia) whose work is so good you won't be able to understand how you'd never read or studied them before. Trust me, if you're the kind of person who's even looking at this review and thinking about taking this class, you are the kind of person who will absolutely love it. I promise."
