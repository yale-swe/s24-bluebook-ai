    "The readings were accessible and relevant and the class was run in an efficient manner. Guest lecturers enhanced the material and provided great opportunities for learning.",
    "Nationally administered curriculum is a little dry but the professor did their best to make it as engaging as possible.",
    "Colonel McCarthy cares about his cadets and in this fact lies the learning. His ad libs teach far more than the curricular vehicle in place to create that relationship. He gives us faith in him as our commander.Of course, the curricular content is trite memorisation of premised not on intelelctual rigour but on having the resilience to find details in online resources that are both poorly-formatted and unnnecessarily difficult to access. The course could be improved by making its resources more difficult to access. (Col. McCarthy's emails of the important readings was an excellent step in this direction.)",
    "This was a great class with a great lecturer. The only thing is that the readings were sometimes unrealistically long.",
    "The first midterm I was unclear what we would be tested on, but the subsequent assignments were very clear."
