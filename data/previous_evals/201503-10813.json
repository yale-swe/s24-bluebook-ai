   "comments": [
    "I will recommend the course to other students. It is a great course if you want to get a big picture about cell biology and find interesting knowledge to deep in.",
    "Recommended because it was interesting to hear the different professors talk about their own work. Fun problem sets.",
    "A journey to the edges of humanity's knowledge on the intricacies of the Cell navigated from the perspective of remarkable experimentalists.",
    "Overall this class was a good survey of cell biology as a whole. Although there were many faculty the course had a strong flow and everything to connect well. I would absolutely recommend this class to other students.",
    "It's a course that teaches advanced cell biology covering almost very aspect of intracellular activities. I recommend it to fellow students for it can broaden our knowledge for modern cell biology, especially useful for people who are interested in cell biology.",
    "As someone that never took a formal cell bio course as an undergrad, I found 602 to be super helpful in filling in some of the gaps in my cell biology foundation. That said, I also found it to be very manageable. I would recommend the course, even if it wasn't a required one.",
    "If you've taken a cell bio class before, I'd say this is a great way to go one step further. Rather than focusing on fundamentals, it focuses on specific topics (stem cells, cytoskeleton, etc.), and the professor who presents each set of lectures does research in that field, so they really know what they're doing. It's also more relaxed, as there are no tests, just psets. While the psets can sometimes require a lot of thought, it's a lot less stressful.",
    "A recommended course in cell biology that is well structured and delivered overall",
    "It is a good course, both basic knowledge and new progress are taught in this course.",
    "This course overall introduces fundamental but insightful cell bio knowledge that would be needed for graduate study. I will highly recommend this class to other students.",
    "A solid review of basic cell biology, with some cutting edge research being represented in the course. I would recommend this course to someone who does not have a strong cell bio background, or wants to review the material.",
    "The discovery of everything we know about cell bio from the people that discovered it.",
    "It's a course that covers the basics of cell biology. I would recommend it to those that are interested in cell bio, as long as they have a background in cell bio or are willing to do a great deal of reading outside of the course.",
    "This class covered great content of cell biology. For students with interest or need in cell biology research, taking this class should be beneficial."

   "question_text": "How did this course deepen your knowledge of your discipline\/profession? To what extent did this course contribute to your dissertation\/research?",
   "comments": [
    "Because I am interested in cell biology, the course is very helpful for me to get to know faculties and decide my research direction.",
    "Not at all, the course content was 99% review material. But I liked the problem sets because they allow you to design any experiment you want.",
    "This course was very useful because it provided a good deal of background information as well as different applications of various techniques which will come in handy in the lab setting.",
    "It gives me a deeper understanding of cell biology and intracellular activities, which are essential for my future research since every biological study cannot leave the cell.",
    "This course did a great job filling in gaps of knowledge I had regarding a few topics integral to cell biology (e.g. cytoskeleton dynamics, membrane-membrane interactions). I'm sure this information will be helpful to any budding cell and\/or molecular biologist.",
    "The homework was open ended and forced me to think critically about areas outside of my focus. It would have been helpful to cover some of the HW in class. This would have allowed people to share their varied thought processes. Additionally, some of the grading on the HW was in the form of a negative with no correct answer. I would have gained more from the homework that was incorrect if a correct alternative was provided.",
    "I have a better understanding of a few biological concepts, as well as a deeper appreciation for some of the seminal cell bio experiments.",
    "I didn't really feel like it it helped prepare me for hw because the hw only shared topic but rarely had something to do directly with what we heard. Also hw is graded very very hard.",
    "I was exploring while picking this course, so I'm not sure how well it will contribute to my eventual thesis project but it provided the basics that I think are necessary for success in science."
