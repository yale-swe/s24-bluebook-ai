    "Take the course. A lot depends on your PI but it's great.",
    "Research for credit is an awesome way to learn a lot about a field in particular and to have your efforts culminate into a project you can continue even after the course. Being able to work in a lab for this much time is really rewarding!",
    "It's a great way to carve out time to do research and actually get something done.",
    "Same as first semester research for credit.",
    "This is research for credit. If you work in a lab, you might as well do this course. It gives you an excuse to get a more individual project and also gets you some credit. Make sure you choose a lab that you like!",
    "If you're interested in doing research, I definitely recommend doing research for credit. It's a good way to apply your lab work toward your major, and produce do some substantial writing about your work. Doing the presentation and writing the paper definitely helped me think more critically about my research."
