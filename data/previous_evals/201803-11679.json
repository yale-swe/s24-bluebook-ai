   "comments": [
    "This course is generally well planned and organized. One thing that could be clearer is the prompts on writing assignments.",
    "This course had too many students, and too many readings for each week. This felt like a year's worth of material crammed into one semester. There were many interesting readings, but I felt we never really had time to address any of them fully. Perhaps more interactive online assignments (like responses to readings on canvas) would help if the course retained this amount of material. This would also encourage people who never participated in the discussion to voice their opinion.",
    "Strength of the course is serving a need for more diverse course offerings in music department, but syllabus could use some updating. The last couple weeks of the course had thematized readings (gender, recording technology), and organizing the readings from the first half of the course based on more explicit themes could also be helpful",
    "The course allowed you to gain a comprehensive survey of the field. The nature of of the exercises and the lectures also assisted in synthesizing this information",
    "Some of the early readings, while historically important, were heavy going. The more contemporary material was very interesting though",
    "Michael is a good teacher and does a solid job of making sure students know \"what they need to\" each session before launching into seminar discussion. Honestly, I think the class was too large, and probably should've been capped at a lower number of students. I don't mean to point fingers, but it should be said that a lot of social loafing was happening in the class. As a consequence, weekly discussion was awkward, with large silences and only a few people consistently contributing in class."

    "Yes, but know what you're getting into. The class is very important background on ethnomusicology, but it can be fairly dry at times, while other times it is fascinating. Be aware of this, and you will enjoy!",
    "The material is fairly specific, but anyone who is interesting in diversifying their toolbox for thinking about musical methods historical must take this course",
    "I would recommend this course to other students. It offers much insight in how one can approach understanding the evolution of a discipline and placing its development within a broader historical context",
    "Yes, this material is crucial to a broad understanding of music",
    "I would, but students should understand that this is NOT a course about \"doing\" ethnomusicology. Rather, it is a critical survey of the discipline of ethnomusicology."
