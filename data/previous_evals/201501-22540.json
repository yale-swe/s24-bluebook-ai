    "This class is like a series of TED talks, very introductory and easy to understand, on the different topics listed in the syllabus. You feel like you learned stuff in lecture, but section will confuse you. Most of the course was enjoyable but it definitely got tiring and a little boring toward the end since it is frustrating not being able to delve in depth into the materials. Another frustration is the inability for students to engage in classroom discussions during lecture that would further understanding when Knobe answers.",
    "I would recommend this if you have a slight interest in Philosophy, but don't really want to go all out and take a pure philosophy course.",
    "the ultimate dinner party class. learn the psychological and philosophicl frameworks for most of life's most interesting questions",
    "Don't treat this class like a gut--you won't get anything out of it. If you take the time to do the readings and really think about the material, this class will change your view of the world. Definitely take it.",
    "Great class. The connection between psychology and philosophy is very interesting and this course provides a nice intro\/survey of this connection. As a math major, this was a good humanities class to take because it was interesting and not too much work (generally two papers to read per week, and then two essays and a final). The TA's were helpful with the papers and Knobe is a great lecturer. I think I will take more philosophy classes after getting a little taste of it in this class.",
    "Perspectives on Human Nature is a psych\/philosophy class. It's definitely intro level, and might help you ease into Philosophy or get that Hu requirement as a social science-y person. But the questions are ones that you can think about at any age given you haven't spent a ton of time studying them already. There were five themes that we covered about human nature 1. Happiness: can it be attained and what does that mean for how we should live our lives? 2. Altruism: Does it matter morally whether humans help each other for one reason or another? Do people ever actually act altruistically? 3. Virtue and Character: How are we to live? 4. Morality and Motivation: Why do people make the moral judgments they do? What is the role of reason and what is the role of motivation? and 5. Religion: Why do we believe in God and does this give any evidence into whether god actually exists? We would generally look at philosophical theories and then see if evidence from psych studies supported those theories or provided different answers. Professor Knobe is really kind and his lectures are well thought out.",
    "This was a fantastic course, definitely one of my favorites so far. I learned to think about human emotions and morality in completely different ways, and Im now considering cognitive science and related subjects as potential majors. The course covers happiness, altruism, virtue, morality, and religion, all tied together with larger overarching themes. Assignments consist of biweekly readings and a weekly reading response, as well as two papers overall, a very manageable workload. Be warned that a lot of the same ideas were reiterated multiple times this wasnt much of a problem for me because Ive never taken a philosophy or psychology class before and learned new things in every class, but for students with previous background in the subject, I can see how it might have become a little too repetitive. Overall, though, wonderful class.",
    "Definitely take it!!! Cool course! And very applicable to everyday life. Nice integration of philosophy and psychology and cog sci.",
    "Yeh! It's an interesting class and great way to take care of your HU credit.",
    "This course was not something that I particularly enjoyed. If you like philosophy maybe you would get more out of it but as a psych major I was not a fan.",
    "Fascinating course and a good mix of philosophy, psychology, and cognitive science. I'm not planning on majoring in either of those three fields, but I felt like I got a lot out of this class and learned a lot more about the human condition",
    "It's a class you should definitely take if youre interested in the topics or just philosophy\/psychology in general",
    "A fun, engaging course with a relatively small workload (NOT a gut course, though- the material is interesting and intellectually captivating). Professor Knobe is a great lecturer, and the intersection of philosophy and psychology is absolutely fascinating.",
    "Ok, so if you're a psychology major, keep in mind that this course is both (1) a humanities credit and (2) counts towards the social science distribution (at least I think so), which are already two major factors in favor of taking it if you ask me. The course itself is, well... alright. It's basically a broad and very cursory overview of a wide range of philosophical ideas on human nature and a collection of empirical psychological studies that either support or contradict these ideas. The whole thing feels kind of superficial and Professor Knobe often talks\/goes through his slides too quickly, which makes the course feel like a rather rushed experience rather lacking in profundity. However, the section is really quite enjoyable and helpful (you basically just sit around freely discussing ideas with not much structure), so don't let the presence of a section be a deterrent, and a lot of the readings we did were really pretty interesting - learning the key points made by the greatest thinkers in history probably really adds to your cocktail-party-conversation arsenal. So overall, not a good course for delving deep into the core of where philosophy and psychology intersect each other, but a manageable and moderately interesting choice for anyone looking for a psychology credit, a humanities credit or perhaps a fifth class that won't drown you in assignments.",
    "Really fascinating course that covers topics like happiness and religion from both philosophical and psychological standpoints. Readings are not overwhelming and are, for the most part, quite interesting. One note of caution: if you've never taken a philosophy or psychology course before, the papers can be challenging.",
    "Perspectives on Human Nature is a very interesting class and I would recommend it. It should be noted though for anyone considering taking it that the class does have a very significant philosophy component, so it's not straight psychology.",
    "This class will get you to think differently about altruism, morality, god, and much more. Only two papers and a final exam are manageable, and the reading before each class is short. The course intersperses philosophical models with psychological evidence for and against each model.",
    "Grading is harder than expected. Concepts do get more abstract than I'd expected but still a very interesting",
    "This class is premised on a really interesting concept -- it involves looking at different phenomena (happiness, altruism, religiosity, virtuousness, ect) from an empirical data-driven perspective and from a philosophical perspective, and looking at whether the data supports the theory. I loved the material and the structure of the course, but was less enthralled with Professor Knobe, who speaks pretty quickly and whose lectures were at times difficult to follow. Workload was very manageable (short weekly reading responses, two 7-9 pg papers and a final), and graded pretty easily.",
    "A good new perspective on things, coming from an engineering major. In retrospect, a good class in terms of major themes presented -- happiness, altruism, morality, and explaining (our beliefs in) God\/religion. I found some of the lectures and readings and in general some of the details somewhat difficult to follow, but the overall topics and themes (which are the only ones you'll likely remember anyway months\/years after taking the class) were interesting.",
    "An interesting interdisciplinary course that offers a (very) introductory level approach to the fields of philosophy and psychology. I didn't get as into as I thought, but I think it's because it turns out that philosophy isn't to my liking. Very light workload: an hour reading once a week, two short papers, and then one last grind for the final, which is quote IDs and short answer questions. Definitely doable as a fifth. Don't expect any challenges if you're already experienced in either psych or philosophy.",
    "CGSC 282 is a fantastic class. The juxtaposition between the philosophy and psychological research enriches your understanding of both. It is an excellent HU credit for the non HU inclined. Professor Knobe is great. The course is not too much work but you still learn a lot.",
    "Anybody with even a passing interest in Philosophy, Psychology, or Cognitive science should take this course - It's awesome! Prof. Knobe is a wonderful professor and the TFs (based on my sample size of 1) are great! The readings are the most important part, but most of them are pretty enjoyable - although some are more engaging than others (cough cough Nietzsche). I really looked forward to section every week and I super enjoyed pretty much everything about this course. One of the best courses I've taken at Yale, if you pass this up you're making a big mistake!",
    "It's a good course, but not right for me. If it wasn't for the Hu credit, I would not have taken it. Haven already taken Intro Psyc, Intro Cogsci, and many psyc courses, it was too Intro level for me and there was a lot of repeat. Knobe is great though and I liked being forced to think about the philosophical questions that guide the course. Discussion sections were good too. Not too much work either and grading is fair. If you are interested in the material, take it.",
    "Not too much reading, only a few papers and a weird final exam. Great discussion. I found it more useful for personal rather than academic development. It seemed strange to have it cross-listed as a psych course because it felt much more like philosophy to me, but maybe that was because I was already familiar with 90% of the psych studies we discussed in this class. If it's possible, I would definitely recommend taking this class at the same time as sexy psych with Laurie Santos. They complemented each other really well, and since they were back to back, the similarities in the material were especially obvious.",
    "A fascinating yet simple class that gives the students an excuse to look at some of the greatest philosophical and psychological concepts and papers.",
    "I don't know if this class is good for working towards any major requirements, but it is pretty cool to take just for fun. The things you will learn and have to think about are some of the world's big questions, and it's awesome to find answers that you really feel you've given some thought. The classes themselves are a very light commitment, although the reading assignments vary wildly in both length, density, and engagement. Luckily you can probably get by without reading a few, as long as you take good notes, listen, and study.",
    "This class was pretty interesting and engaging for the whole semester. There were times, however, when I lost some interest in the class when we went deeper into the philosophical abstract that seemed a little removed from the material at hand. For paers, definitely go see a TA, and don't start the night before cus they're 7-9 pages and requir serious thought.",
    "I would totally recommend it!",
    "Most definitely. Please take it. You learn so much about the human condition and what it means to be a human being. You'll identify with so much o this course and feel more at ease with your thoughts, knowing that you are not alone in the way you behave and understand the world.",
    "This is a fun class. I originally took it for the psychology part, and was surprised that the class seemed to focus slightly more heavily on the philosophy part of the material. That said, this was a really fun class and I am very happy to have taken it. I would recommend this class to anybody.",
    "Interesting material. Writing good papers will be a challenge. Take it if you are interested and can grasp ideas in the lecture.",
    "This class is a broad survey. Definitely an intro course and very variable by TF. The papers are the most intellectually stimulating portions of the class. some of the TFs are also fantastic.",
    "Overall, I think this is a really good course and you should definitely take it if it's offered. You'll approach life's most important questions (about happiness, altruism, belief in God, etc) from the angles of philosophy and psychology\/cognitive science, which I found to be a really fascinating intersection (it's also pretty cool that Josh Knobe is at the forefront of this kind of research). The readings are easy enough to get the gist of, and you only have to do weekly reading responses, 2 open-ended thought papers, and a final exam. The workload isn't bad at all, but you do have to put in some effort to keep up with all the lecture material since Professor Knobe's Powerpoints are pretty vague and hard to understand by themselves. He is a really enthusiastic and genuine guy, but kind of hard to connect with because he speaks kind of quietly and can move through the slides pretty quickly. If you're looking for a class that will get you thinking about the meaning of life, take this course!",
    "It is a good course to explore some interesting philosophical questions in a structured, focused way. It also provides a good introduction to experimental philosophy which is a fascinating field.",
    "If the topics interest you, you should take it!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone who would like to try a philosophy course, especially for those who have never been exposed to much philosophy before. As a STEM major, I also found the comparison between psychology and philosophy to be very interesting. Professor Knobe is so engaging and made the course a lot of fun. It was also really nice to have a discussion section to review the material and go more in-depth.",
    "I would recommend you take this class if you've ever wondered by so many people are religious in the world or what true happiness really is. I'm not saying this class will answer these questions, but it will provide you with the vocabulary to think and talk about them.",
    "Yes!",
    "I would recommend this course. It is a great course. My only concern is that 50% of the grade comes from 2 essays, which are graded by TF's and are very subjective.",
    "Joshua Knobe is so cool. He knows all the things. Pretty good class. Reading responses, 2 essays, a final exam. Section. The essays are pretty hard--you have to have clear, well-written, original thoughts that actually make sense. Section is pretty cool. Some of my deepest thinking at Yale happened in this class. Pretty cursory overview of a lot of things though.",
    "I would suggest this course if you are interested in cognitive science or social psychology and want an intro to philosophy as well. while the course seems like a philosophy course i felt that I understood it better from a social sciences standpoint. if you want philosophy and come from a social science background this is a good class."
