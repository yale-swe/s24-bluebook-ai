   "comments": [
    "An interesting course, not too much work and definitely worth the time.",
    "This class is a great way to improve your Spanish speaking, listening, and writing skills while learning about an interesting topic in a very relaxed environment. Take it if you need an L5 Spanish credit, even if you're not pre-med.",
    "TAKE IT IF YOU CAN! You won't be disappointed.",
    "take it if you truly want to learn about medical needs in spanish",
    "Definitely take this course!! Seora Carreras has a ton of enthusiasm and love for the course, and it really shows throughout the course of this semester. I am so glad I had the opportunity to take it.",
    "It is a relaxing way to learn some medical spanish vocabulary and also medical conditions, generally. If you want to make the most of this class, I highly suggest actually doing all of the reading and participating fully. It is easy to slack off but you don't learn as much this way.",
    "This was an absolutely brilliant course, and can be undertaken by students who think their Spanish is on the weaker side; there are a great number of writing assignments, which have improved my grammar far more than anything else ever did. That said, be aware that this is NOT a conversation course.",
    "Great class. I think that it should have more of an emphasis on improving Spanish writing and grammar (such as a requirement to use the subjunctive or other more complex elements in daily assignments).",
    "Yes! You'll learn a lot if you put in the effort.",
    "You will talk a lot in Spanish. So do your reading and come ready to chat at 9 AM. Don't be that student that comes in half asleep complaining about how early it is and how you're ready to talk. Let loose and have some fun! All you really do in the class in talk.",
    "I recommend this class as it increases your ability to converse in Spanish about medical issues and have conversations in Spanish that a doctor and patient would have. It was a fun class to attend and covered interesting medical issues!"
