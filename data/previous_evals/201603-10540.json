   "comments": [
    "Critical thinking ability that comes with analyzing complex nuanced works of philosophy. A background in philosophy and a general understanding of a diverse body of Western philosophy.",
    "I learned how to dissect, analyze, and refute arguments",
    "I learned a great deal about the philosophies of Plato, Aristotle, Augustine, Epicurus, and others, and became comfortable with building arguments and writing papers in philosophy.",
    "Writing, thinking critically and reading quickly and efficiently. I learned a lot about philosophy that I hadn't known at all before, and feel ready to write philosophy papers in other classes.",
    "I learned how to engage with different philosophical schools of thought and who to extract philosophical arguments from complex texts.",
    "From this course, I learned about (the first half of) the history of Western philosophy, with an emphasis on how different thinkers responded to or extended the ideas of their predecessors. I also began to develop philosophy writing skills. From this first entry into philosophy, I gained an understanding of the discipline, including its history, questions, and methods.",
    "In this course we covered an important part of the ancient Western philosophical canon. We read",
    "I learned how to reconstruct philosophical arguments in a logical, concise manner, refer to specific details in a text to support a claim, and capably approach a philosophical text.",
    "I developed a foundational knowledge of classical and medieval philosophy, and (this being the first philosophy course I have taken) the abilities to deconstruct a philosophical argument and construct my own response.",
    "DS Philosophy was one of the best courses (intellectuals endeavors in general) that I have ever taken in my life. It helped me reevaluate my own goals and perspectives on life. It introduced me to a very rich tradition of philosophical thought. The class discussions and the lectures were absolutely astounding.",
    "A sense of evolution and core ideas in philosophy from Plato to Aquinas. The structure of philosophical arguments.",
    "In taking this course, I have developed a new way of thinking that was once foreign to me. It has encouraged me to be more inquisitive and critical of arguments presented in novels and in seminar settings, which in turn has made me further develop my own ideas in my writing assignments and class discussion.",
    "I gained a general understanding of classical and pre-medieval philosophy. I also realized that a lot more people believe in objective moral truth than I originally believed. (Not a pleasant realization, but probably a useful one.)"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I loved coming to class. It felt like the reading selections were appropriate and my classmates were really perceptive. Sometimes our discussions went down a very pedantic path that lost sight of the interesting parts of the argument and started discussing very subtle distinctions. Professor Winkler is extremely effective in class discussions. The paper topics were good and feedback on the papers was extremely extensive. So helpful!",
    "Strengths: lots of readings, good discussion sections Weaknesses: none The course might have been improved by reading more Platonic dialogues, such as Timaeus, but then something else would have to be sacrificed.",
    "Some strengths is the wide range of p philosophers it exposes you to as well as the insightful conversations we have in section trying to make sense of each author's arguments. Some weaknesses are the heavy amount of reading is done too quickly to absorb all material well. You end up knowing one philosopher's' arguments way better than others whom we go over very quickly.",
    "A particular strength of this course is the hybrid seminar-lecture format. Lectures provide an experienced interpretation of challenging readings, allowing new philosophy students to discuss ideas with confidence in seminars. The focus on philosophy writing helps students develop skills for later philosophy coursework.",
    "DS is tricky because it attempts to cover such a huge temporal and thematic canon of works. This is tough to accomplish, whether it is in a semester or in a year. However, the DS faculty does the best it can to create a cohesive syllabus that both makes sense to read (the works feel at least somewhat related) and also accurately represents some of the most important works of philosophy of the period in question, ancient or modern.",
    "Strengths of the class include the small seminar structure of sections and the supportive cohort of students in Directed Studies. The class could perhaps be improved if students were allowed opportunities to revise their papers after review by the professor to fully realize an effective paper.",
    "I think the DS Philosophy professors performed an admirable job in terms of constructing a cohesive syllabus that introduced a solid number of schools of thought without being overwhelming. However, the course inherently privileges breadth over depth, which is natural for a freshman course but can result in superficial understanding even with the twice-weekly seminars. I had hoped that the philosophers would be placed in historical context and put in more of a dialogue with one another. Sometimes discussions wound up feeling esoteric in that we were discussing the logical coherence and validity of certain arguments instead of their significance\/impact and application.",
    "Some more time should ideally be allocated to Aristotle and the Arabic philosophers, I believe - they were the hardest for me personally.",
    "I don't think this course could get much better. I enjoyed Prof. Winkler's sending out questions in advance of class. The discussion did wander, especially at first, and Prof. Winkler could have done more to rein it in to being on topic.",
    "STRENGTHS: 1. Professor Winkler is a deeply compassionate and all-around wonderful person. In someone else's hands, this material could have felt archaic and deservedly so. Professor Winkler gives it some relevance and warmth. 2. The curriculum is interesting, if not exactly my taste. We covered a wide range of philosophical concepts and arguments. Our discussions usually managed to strike a balance between depth and breadththough our class erred on the side of depth, which I'm not going to complain about. 3. Most of us wrote our first philosophy papers for this class, and we got plenty of help in the process. WEAKNESSES: 1. We have all these discussions about different modes of thought without asking why people came to think in such different ways: as if philosophy sprang from some sort of pure ether, and it was never tangled up in the politics of this messy human world. That's a shame. Some people have told me that's just how philosophy worksyou're supposed to discuss ideas, not the people who developed and promoted thembut ideas are only powerful *because* of people, so I find it difficult to imagine how separating people from ideas helps us to better understand those ideas. I fail to see the reasoning behind that divide. But that's not really a weakness of this course, which was about as good as it could have been for me. It's a general complaint about the philosophy of philosophy class."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "YES! It changed the way I make arguments. It also changed my impression of philosophy. I love the understanding that we could achieve in trying to understand arguments and reconstruct them.",
    "A WONDERFUL DS philosophy teacher (and probably philosophy teacher in general but I'm just a freshman who has never taken philosophy so I wouldn't know these things). He's encouraging, open-minded, not condescending (which is v important), and so very intelligent. The kind of discussion he fosters is one of a high caliber, and he really lays out the arguments very clearly to understand-- so even the student who's not well versed in philosophy can figure out the arguments (albeit with a bit of a learning curve, as expected)",
    "Yes, the course provides a solid background in Greek, Roman, and medieval philosophy.",
    "Yes!!!",
    "I would recommend this course to another students if they were willing to do the heavy reading load (which is manageable if you plan ahead) and are interested in Western philosophy that connects schools of thoughts and makes insightful connections across different philosophers.",
    "This course is an excellent introduction to Western philosophy. Though the material is certainly broad and the course moves at a quick pace, both of these features contribute to a spirited tour through the history of Western thought. This course, particularly with its lively discussions and emphasis on writing skills, will prepare you well for future courses in philosophy and other disciplines.",
    "Of course! DS is an experience like no other, and honestly, when else down the road are you going to pick up Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics and give them a read? DS Philosophy allows for deep and invested discussions of great works with some of the best professors Yale has to offer and also some very interesting and dedicated students.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to another student, since the course material was intriguing and the seminar structure of the class facilitated productive discussion.",
    "DS is suitable for a very particular type of student who has very particular expectations. If they were that type of student (humanities-loving, fast-reading, with a strong memory, a strong sense of priorities and a good sense of historical perspective) and had those expectations (a lot of reading, a lot of sometimes irrelevant-seeming discussion that can be limited to superficiality) then I would say yes.",
    "Yes, one of the best courses you can take! A life-changer!",
    "Professor Winkler is patient and kind. His explanations are thoughtful and nuanced, modeling not just skills, but also joy in, philosophy.",
    "I would recommend this course, alongside the other two Directed Studies courses, only to students who have an interest in intensive reading and who wish to vastly improve their critical thinking and writing skills. Though I ultimately intended to pursue either Electrical Engineering or Architecture, I saw these classes as a chance to see whether or not I would be interested in pursuing any majors related to Humanities. Though it has not changed my mind about what I want to pursue, I see them as worthwhile distributional requirements, ones in which students are given the opportunity to cover some of the most well-known texts in history. I have enjoyed challenging myself in these three courses, and I encourage all students, whether they are interested in Humanities or in Engineering, to consider taking Directed Studies.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in learning the fundamentals of philosophy.",
    "It's kind of a package deal along with DS Lit and H&P, so I'd recommend it to anyone who's interested in meeting some of the foundational works of Western thought."
