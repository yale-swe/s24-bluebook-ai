    "This was a really great class. I have a lot more confidence in my writing and reading of poetry. JDM was very helpful; he's so sassy. He has so many super-funny anecdotes: \"That one time I approached Elizabeth Bishop,\" etc. It was a chill experience and you get to read some great stuff. I heard that the reason you should take creative writing classes is to give yourself space to reflect\/think. This course definitely does that. If you get in, I definitely think you should take it.",
    "I would definitely recommend English 460 to another student. It's a great way to improve your writing, while also exploring contemporary poets and poetry. It's quite time-consuming, but it's definitely worth it!",
    "The Writing of Verse is a good grounding in poetic forms, one that gives experience in writing a variety of poems I certainly would never have written otherwise. There's also the opportunity to workshop and revise, and a selection of readings by and about poets and poetry. If you want a class that will push you to write poetry, this is a great place to start. Do make sure in shopping week that Professor McClatchy suits your style, since he's a lot of fun but the class is very much shaped around his personal attitudes of poetry\/teaching.",
    "If you are enthusiastic for poetry, this is a must-take course and will improve your writing mechanics a great deal. The workload is manageable but you're going to have to put in the effort in improving if you are to improve."
