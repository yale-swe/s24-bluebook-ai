    "Take DS. Stay in DS. Grow, learn so much, and just become a much better person.",
    "Lots of reading and writing, but worth it!",
    "DS Literature is a great survey of Western writing, and while Fall semester was interesting and enjoyable, almost everyone I've spoken to enjoyed the books we read Spring semester more. One of the great things about this course is that we actually read the entirety of most works, instead of getting fragmented snippets. This particular class does have the most reading of any DS class, Spring or Fall - Don Quixote and War and Peace alone are about 2,000 pages combined; but you do get breaks over which to read those books, and the rest of the reading is manageable. In regard to Professor Bloch, if you get a chance to take a section with him, you should definitely do so. Class is always fun and entertaining, and he provides insight every single section that can really expand your understanding of the work.",
    "Just a lot of reading of the classics... pretty much what you expect. I couldn't keep up with the reading at all so I didn't really get much out of the course, but that's really up to the specific individual.",
    "I would recommend 2nd semester Directed Studies Literature, as I think it provides a very solid grounding in the Western canon which may be used as a point of departure for future studies.",
    "Yes! Take Bloch!! He is a great professor and made literature my favorite section of DS. A very fair grader too!",
    "I would hight recommend this course.",
    "Absolutely! If you are willing to dedicate to it, Directed Studies is an excellent program, and Literature is by far the best out of the three courses. The course material in the second semester is extremely interesting and thought-provoking. AND BLOCH IS PHENOMENAL! He's hands down the best professor I've had at Yale this year: he's incredibly knowledgeable and really good at guiding the discussion in class."
