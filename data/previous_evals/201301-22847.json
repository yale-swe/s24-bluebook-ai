   "comments": [
    "Good overview of trade models and the political economy behind various trade policies. The readings were interesting though sometimes the lectures should be based more on the readings.",
    "Not much work. 3 problem sets (3-4 hours each), a 3 person - hour long presentation, and a 10 page paper. Very relaxing seminar. Recommend for a light seminar, but there are definitely better classes out there",
    "I would recommend it for anyone wanting to learn about Trade Policy and also for those who aren't particularly interested in Trade Policy it is still an interesting course and overlaps with other areas of economics; fascinating to see how everything is connected.",
    "I would not recommend it now, but maybe after a couple of years it could fulfill its potential. The topic is so interesting.",
    "It is a great class for those who want a good overview of international trade policy, its theoretical models and economics analyses, and the political economy of the policy."
