    "It is a wonderful class. I think it should be required for all college students, and probably high school students, too.",
    "Take it if you have to - but take it credit\/d.",
    "Obviously by now you know the grading is tough, but there's room for improvement. Also, section is worth just as much as a paper, so if you attend each one and participate, it's like doing super well on a paper. It's definitely worth taking just to be in a class with Professor Kagan and learn from him. If you're worried about grading, just start it Credit\/D.",
    "Great introduction to philosophy class, but be aware of how difficultly the class is graded. Don't be surprised if you pretty much fail the first paper. I've taken other philosophy classes and have done rather well, so this was a bit of a shocker. But it's all based on improvement, so don't panic.",
    "Intro to Ethics is an excellent first philosophy class (but it's not wasted on people who have some experience in philosophy, either). The reading isn't heavy, in order to encourage careful reading of a few writers rather than skimming many of them, and though we covered relatively few books we never ran out of things to discuss. More than a survey of philosophers, this course is intended to explore and illustrate major trains of ethical thought. So keep that in mind. As for other things: Kagan's a very fun (though sometimes repetitive) lecturer, who seemed to really enjoy talking to students after class. TAs were chosen extremely well, so section was great -- this was definitely facilitated by its format (guided discussion, no raising hands required). Despite its reputation for difficult grading, I thought it very fair and even-handed.",
    "Maybe, if it's your first philosophy course. It would seem to be a good overview of some important ideas in ethics. Might teach you to write a philosophy paper...?However, if you've done ANY philosophy before (or have just read Kant, or Mill, or Hume, or have thought about issues), this will be a dreadfully boring course. The lectures rehash extremely familiar and rather boring philosophical puzzles and provide stock interpretations of the texts that you can get on Wikipedia. The sections are unpleasant rambles. The workload is light but (as everyone else says) graded extremely erratically, without much rhyme or reason. Shelly is engaging, but has pretty dogmatic opinions that you don't really get a chance to challenge. On the plus side, you can not go to lecture and not do the reading and still do fine as long as you talk in section and spend some time on the very short papers.",
    "Professor Kagan does a great job explaining philosophical ideas and philosophical lines of argument. That said, papers written for philosophy classes require a certain (very logical) style of argument, and if you're like me you probably haven't written much in that style before. So a C+ on the first paper isn't out of line with the average. (Therefore, I'd recommend starting out with this class Credit\/D\/Fail.)If you go to lecture and follow what Professor Kagan says in class, the readings probably aren't all that necessary (he covers his interpretation of the authors pretty well), since the main purpose of the course seems to be developing a logical argumentation style through a discussion of ethics.So: If you understand lecture and argue deductively with logic in writing your papers (all three a short five pages each), this is a great course and it's not impossible to do well in it if you put the effort in. Good fifth class with Credit\/D\/Fail, though.",
    "It's really good to get a sense of the basics of moral thought. I just hope that us Yalies can actually apply ethics to our daily lives instead of just talking about them.",
    "Lecture are interesting, but very intro. Shelly uses a lot of examples and spends a lot of time illustrating simple points. It is interesting to talk to Shelly in office hours, but he won't be much help for papers. The grading is hard in this class because they aren't looking for well-argued papers, they are looking for interesting papers. Since different things interest different people, it is extremely difficult to tell what they are looking for in grading. If you respond well to the prompt, thoroughly and including objections and responses, you will get a B. Talking to the TAs in advance helps very little because they don't try to help you develop more interesting ideas, they just try to make sure you aren't making egregious logical errors. Because the papers were so stressful and the lectures were a little...empty, Iwasn't particularly satisfied with the class, although I did learn how to think about philosophical issues in the abstract.",
    "This course is, by no means, introductory for students who want to try out Philosophy! This is not a class for the weak of heart or mind. This is not a class for students who think that their english courses in high school had philosophical aspects. This is NOT a literature course. If you are wondering what philosophy classes are like, then explore a different course first. This class is filled with students who have a strong base in philosophy already, or who are in EPE and thus need to take this class -- and do well in it! Sections felt like warzones; lectures expanded your mind by presenting different ideas on morality.In the end, though, I walk away having gained very little from this course. I know how to go along with thought experiments and challenge a philosopher with a counterargument, but do not feel any more confident about my beliefs in Ethics.",
    "Starts out cool but gets old. You will get a C on the first paper for sure. Take it cred\/D",
    "Only those who really want to learn. Too many students come to the lecture just think that the course is some funny course. One needs to take this course seriously, even if you may take it credit\/d, you still need to put a lot of effort on this course to get the most of it.",
    "It is really interesting! I would recommend this class to another student as a Credit-D class . The readings are completely manageable and the lectures are fascinating, but the papers are tough and graded really, really toughly! They do have a grading policy that counts later papers more IF you improve, but it's still very hard to get an A!",
    "Take this Credit D if you have to take it. Shelly Kagan has a superiority complex such that he feels the need to fight the good fight against grade inflation. I'm not one of the people that got C's on the papers and I still found him infuriating. Basically, the papers are graded very harshly, but they'll give you better grades as you go on in the course because Shelly likes to feel like he's really improving your ethics paper writing skills and is a great teacher. This artificial improvement is fine, BUT my primary issue is that if you actually want to improve you're at a dead end. The TFs aren't allowed to read drafts, which makes it impossible to test our your arguments and make them better, or present the most relevant objections. Thankfully, the class is graded based entirely on 3 papers and participation so at least there are no exams which sweetens the deal a tiny bit if that's possible. I'm sure you're getting this but this class was the bane of my existence and I really felt like Shelly got to the point of disrespect for his students in being so nonchalant about tossing around C's and D's because he \"wants them to try harder\" but really just kills their spirit ;)",
    "Shelly Kagan is a great lecturer, but think carefully before you take this class. I heard all the horror stories, but I really thought that wouldn't be me. I've taken Intro to Political Philosophy and Moral Foundation in Politics, and I did really well in both of them. I had already read most of the works we read for the class. I thought I had an upperhand. I went to every lecture, every section. I met with my TF to discuss my papers. I spent two weeks writing and rewriting each essay. I did everything you were supposed to do. I did fairly well on the first essay. I tried getting help to fix whatever was wrong on the first essay to get a better grade. This resulted in my next essay grade falling over an entire letter grade. For the third essay, I felt completely helpless. I could very well be looking at a C in this class; a class I was prepared for and did everything I was supposed to do. In short, this class would have been great Credit\/D.",
    "If you're interested in getting a taste of the ethical questions out there, this is a good place to start. However, the shallowness of the topics and the infamous grading system makes it a course that should be viewed as a gateway to greater things, rather than a particularly enjoyable philosophical experience in itself.",
    "Its a great course, but its also very challenging. The day to day work is virtually non-existent and the readings are interesting and short. Depending on who your TA is the class can be a cake walk (they feed you the talking points and are lenient graders) or something of a nightmare. A great class to take C\/D\/Fail if you want to learn about ethics or even philosophy in general. A great class to not take C\/D\/Fail if you think you have the philosophical chops to handle it.",
    "I LOVED THIS CLASS!!! Shelly is a FANTASTIC lecturer, easily one of the best I've had at Yale - he's extremely talented at breaking down complex arguments into their most simple, most accessible components, and building them up again from scratch. I found it a bit strange how worked up people would get at him sometimes \u0096 some people in the class seemed to find everything he said repugnant and would just try to viciously attack him over and over again. I'm really not sure why. There seems to be a split with Shelly - you either really love him, or really hate him. Incidentally, most of the people who really hate him also were getting poor grades on papers. It's true, the grading is tough, and grade inflation is not a thing in this class. The average on the first paper was somewhere around a C, if not lower. But, he does weight the later papers higher, so if you do better later on, then you can still come out of the course with a good grade. When you do start getting better grades, you will likely feel more proud of them than almost any other humanities class at Yale - it's a real achievement to get a B+.Just to give you a better idea of its structure, the course goes through, more or less, 4 units: 1) utilitarianism, 2) deontology \/ Kantianism, 3) contractarianism, and 4) Why be moral?Although you do apply these theories to actual cases, they're usually just illustrative examples - ie. don't go into this class expecting to automagically discover the objectively moral thing to do about abortion, or other controversial issues, or anything like that. What this class does is explore the foundations for morality, and the characteristics of what the content of that morality might look like, given those foundations. The application of it he really leaves up to you. That was one thing I loved about this class - rather than have you regurgitate other philosophical arguments and critique them, or analyze them like literature, Shelly encourages you to actually *do* philosophy, just within the moral frameworks you learn in class. If you put work into it, you'll come out feeling like you have some greater intuitiveunderstanding of logic, clarity, and good argumentative skills - pretty useful stuff.If I have any criticism, it's that I wasn't a fan of Shelly's \"office hours\" - the only \"scheduled\" office hours he had were right after lecture, which could range either from intimidating (for those who aren't used to talking to professors outside of class), or irritating (because you had to wait for all the uppity freshmen and obnoxious upperclassman EP&E majors to finish gratifying themselves).",
    "I would highly recommend this course. There is no course that comes close to teaching the material as Professor Kagan does.",
    "You won't be bored: Shelly is an enthusiastic lecturer who knows his stuff. You may be terrified of your first grade or so, but people exaggerate how harsh the grading is. It gets better, and if you're using your resources effectively (office hours, your TA, talking to Shelly, etc.) you'll do well. Also, don't assume that you know it all just because you have studied philosophy before. The class has a lot to offer, even if you've read Kant and Mill before.",
    "It's an ok ethics class. There are better ones at Yale, and don't buy into the hype of taking it to say you took it. Kagan's serious about the grading system...essays that would get an A in any other class will get a B or a C here.",
    "i would definitely recommend this class. Shelly is amazing and the materials and discussions are really interesting",
    "This class has amazing lectures by Professor Kagan. The readings aren't hard\/aren't necessary to do, and it's nice only having three papers and no exams. Of course, the papers are graded very harshly, and it's difficult to figure out what the professor is looking for, but it is a kind of mental gymnastics that can be fun-ish.",
    "First off, grading isn't as hard as everyone says it is. You really just have to communicate with your TA and section about your ideas and follow the \"How to Write a Philosophy Paper\" guidelines, and you'll do fine! Don't not take this class because of grading; that would be a big mistake.Shelly Kagan is brilliant, and every single lecture made me think about a topic in a new way. He knows SO much, and he's very skilled at sharing that knowledge. He forced us to ask questions we hadn't even considered and definitely made philosophy accessible. Watching him have debates with himself was actually one of the highlights of my semester.",
    "I'd recommend it.",
    "Absolutely. My favorite class of the semester.",
    "Good class, and pretty interesting. You should take it if you have even the smallest interest in philosophy.",
    "Kagan is a great prof, but I'm not sure how I feel about Ethics as a subject. If you know you'll like philosophy, take it.",
    "I would recommend taking it Credit\/D\/Fail. It's a great class and it's really interesting, but the papers are extremely difficult to do well on, and they make up most of your grade.",
    "It's a great survey of major ethical theories without too much reading, but with engaging papers. If you take this course, be prepared to work very hard on the papers. Professor Kagan is a great lecturer and very engaging. It's totally worth it, but be sure to put your effort into it.",
    "I highly recommend the class. If you are going for a good grade, be prepared to fight for speaking time in every section.",
    "Why not? It exposes you to a whole world that you may have only seen as footnotes in the past. More than anything, it's a good introduction to learning how to think in a way different than what is required by literature or history courses.",
    "Disclaimer: I don't regret taking the class. Whatever I say is in warning, but not in caution. There's basically no way to get a philosophy survey outside of DS, so take it if you're interested.The first day, Kagan will read you past comments. This is to scare some people off, but mostly to enthrall you. I guess it works both ways. The comments are all true--from the people who said it's the best class ever to those who hated the class beyond anything. Mostly, I think, people would say something in the middle.Kagan doesn't live up to his own mythology. Lectures were engaging, but were somewhat repetitive and more about him and his \"unorthodox\" lecturing style than about the material. The other reviews were right about that--they get more boring and repetitive as the class goes on.The \"hard grader\" thing is no myth--I got straight C+s on papers. Did I deserve to get a little better? Maybe. Did I deserve As? No way--I was taking it Cr\/D and didn't write good papers. People in the humanities believe they deserve at least a B+ just for turning papers in. I like that the TAs and Kagan don't buy into this. Also, if you improve, they'll go so far as to discounting the first paper in your final grade. Super fair. Take it Cr\/D to save yourself the stress.The best part of the class was section, which I've never said before. My classmates were brilliant. There was some bullshitting, but it was pretty good overall. My TA was great--taught the class before, he's been learning philosophy for, like, decades basically. It was one of the most diverse groups of people, and sparked discussions even after section was over.The class will leave you with more questions than answers, and you'll be able to spout some philosophy. I wouldn't say I improved as a writer, because that wasn't my goal.One thing I would recommend is taking Intro Microecon at the same time--almost every lecture matched up between the classes.",
    "Hard grading. Good class.",
    "This class is awesome but damn hard. Shelly Kagan--adorable man that he is--guides you through all the most prominent schools of thought about moral theory. Along the way, you go through the single best training process of how to write a philosophy paper that you could ever hope for.Just be aware that Shelly Kagan is notorious for his tough grading: the average really will be a C or a low B. Don't let this keep you from taking the class, but do let it weigh in your decision as to whether or not you want to take it Credit\/D.",
    "Introduction to Ethics (PHIL175) is a survey with limited substance. The syllabus races through readings of Mill (Utilitarianism), Kant (Deontology), Hume, Hobbes (Contractarianism), and a handful of contemporary writers. The lectures then summarize slowly what you should have read, \u0093dumbing\u0094 down each work to an encyclopedic entry-like blurb. The section meetings don\u0092t even treat the texts at all, but favor off-the-cuff pontifications about everyday moral problems. The three papers give students a chance to make the course interesting, yet only to a point. In each, Kagan asks students to apply one moral philosophy to a moral dilemma, and to thereby evaluate the plausibility of the moral philosophy by reckoning how it agrees or disagrees with our moral intuitions. Yet this approach to evaluating moral philosophy, which is Kagan\u0092s approach generally, is so modest it may make you lose faith in the importance of Kagan\u0092s project. He seems to believe that our moral intuitions mostly can be trusted, and that the value of philosophy is then to give us a coherent account of where those intuitions come from, such that we can abide by that same coherent account in deciding the few moral questions for which we lack clear intuitions. So, it almost seems that what follows must be true: if you\u0092re a decently self-reflective person already, you probably won\u0092t learn much more about morality and its malcontents from this course, nor become a much better thinker, reader, or writer. Wishing you the best if it\u0092s required.",
    "If you have taken DS, you will find that many of the readings are repeated from previous curriculum. However, 175 is an opportunity to explore the same texts from a more dialogical point of view. More importantly, the course is less focused on the texts than it is on advancing the most charitable forms of consequentialism, contractarianism, and deontological ethics (and evaluating different understandings of each). In general, the reading is light, the material is not.",
    "The course is often described as difficult and Shelly Kagan has apparently received the mark of a hard grader. He mentions this himself, but even if true, it only reinforces Kagan's passion and seriousness in the topics he teaches. While I cannot rate this in relation to other Yale College courses as I am a professional school student, I would highly recommend it to anybody. It's approach to the issues demand a sort of critical analysis which is applicable in many fields outside of philosophy, and I think such a course would be beneficial to anybody. Kagan and his team of Teaching Fellows certainly design a course which is both challenging and interesting.It is unfortunate that letter grades are still important, and often times the only thing that a student cares about, but this course, while I assume is relatively difficult due to the complaints I've heard and read, is ultimately worthwhile. Education should not be about rote memorization and rubber stamped grades based on a bell curve. I truly believe that Shelly Kagan maintains the sort of course which is what education should aim to be.",
    "Tough but rewarding if you can put in the time and effort. Professor Kagan is a brilliant person and a great lecturer. The readings are pretty slim and not too demanding (except for Kant of course). Paper topics are pretty interesting and rewarding to work on. If you're worried about the grading, take it credit\/D - don't let it stop you from taking this class.",
    "I absolutely loved Professor Kagan's lectures and looked forward to them every week. However, opinions about lectures are subjective and so it does not follow from this alone that you will like his lectures just as much."
