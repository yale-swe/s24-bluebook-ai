    "J.R.S. is an incredible teacher who is extremely good at explaining concepts, is extremely patient, and extremely available. His organization of the material into a path that he takes us down in an entertaining way is a highlight of my Yale education.T.G.G. is an extremely nice man who just doesn't present the complex concepts in a way that is easy to grasp. Discussing things with him outside of lecture is more helpful, but I would have really appreciated it if he made more effort to describe the issues that he covered in lecture in a more palatable way. I often wanted to raise my hand and ask 'what are you talking about?' Explaining the objective of a lecture in plain english - both in the notes and verbally (not just a reference to a statistics term or an R function) - at the beginning, middle, and end of the lecture would have been very helpful."
