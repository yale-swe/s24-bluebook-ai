   "comments": [
    "Yes, but the kinks need to be fixed. There was a lot of disparity between different sections and the various grading, which was frustrating. This is a class that all students should have to take before they graduate.",
    "The course was a survey of various topics in political science with a focus on the American perspective. The course had breadth, but not much depth. I would recommend the course, but with some reservation. For freshman who want to find out which subject areas interest them, the course would be valuable. For upperclassmen, the course would be substantially less rewarding.",
    "Incredible class. Take it if offered!",
    "It's hard to say. It was a great class and very interesting, but it was the first year it was taught and it will probably look pretty different next time around. The work load was a bit inconsistent. Some weeks had hundreds of pages of readings, while other weeks had a few articles. The policy memos are fun to write and even though the lectures seem pretty disparate (considering every other lecture is taught by someone else), the material somewhat comes together to give a basic introductory view of public policy.",
    "I would never ever recommend it it was horrid",
    "This is a class about whining. In the course of the semester I learned: our climate is screwed, our education system endlessly broken, our financial system tanked, our country unequal, and don't THINK about using our government to fix it because it's polarized, lethargic, elite-centric, and generally broken in structural ways that are hard to correct. What I DIDN'T learn, EXCEPT from Senator Dodd's fantastic lectures and a very few climate change offerings, was one real option for what do to about any of this--what POLICY could or should be pursued, how we would do it, what effects it might have, why it may or may not be feasible, how it could be framed\/proposed\/executed--anything useful or positive.Some of the lecturers (including Hacker, I thought) were great, and some were absolutely atrocious (flee if Brill is lined up). Regardless, I think it would be hard to make a class formatted this way cohesive and strong--I thought it would be refreshing to switch things up every few weeks, but the disjointedness and lack of direction or themes drove me crazy.CAVEAT: in the last lecture, Hacker was very open about recognizing some of these issues, and had real ideas for fixing them (including having him give some introductory lectures to different modules, or monitoring the reading load better). It may turn into a much stronger course.",
    "If you want to understand how and where America is failing and what are potential ways forward, take this class.",
    "This class will surely change a lot year to year. When I took it, it was a lot more work than it should have been, so it was annoying to be credit-d'ing it and still have to stress a lot. Check out the extent to which the course goes in-depth with specific themes and if it's too broad, maybe wait till another year ortake a different course with Hacker, who is awesome.",
    "This was a trial-run and a disaster. Professor Hacker is probably what convinced me to take this course, as he seemed like the inspiring type, but don't let him fool you!! He doesn't lecture after the first couple weeks and a lot of the lecturers he chose were bad, sprinkled with a couple good. The average was maybe mediocre, and at some points it literally seems ridiculous to bother to go. Also, the policy memo topics were on awful topics, too vague and not related to the lectures. The TAs were actively unhelpful- they wouldn't read drafts and wouldn't really help besides that. Beyond the first memo, when I learned the format and basics of how to write one, I didn't improve and it just became frustrating. This is sort of the epitome of polisci- if you're good at it, it's awesome and you can run with that! This was the first time I'd taken a polisci class expecting to learn a new skill, and it was so stupidly unhelpful. Beyond that, no consistent themes emerged from the class, which is especially fun when heading to a final with bundles of topics and information but no focus. Just say no.",
    "I'd definitely recommend the class to any student interested in American public policy and current events. Sometimes the lectures were boring, but for the most part we had amazing speakers and we learned a lot of cool stuff.",
    "Great class. I loved becoming more informed on very important issues in American public policy. It has a liberal bias so be prepared, but the memo writing is fun.",
    "I would recommend this because this class covers public policy issues that any American should understand.",
    "four policy memos, section and a final. this was the first year, so i'd guess some things will change over the next few years, but there were too many guest speakers and not enough tying it all together. there was a lot of reading. you get to write policy memos and learn a lot, which i realized in retrospect, but they're kind of miserable to write while you're doing it. only take it if you're willing to do the reading, because otherwise you won't get much out of it, and it makes the memos hard to write and the final hard to study for.",
    "Yes. The material is fascinating, whether or not the lectures are.",
    "I would take a serious look at the guest lecturers for next time. Though it seems like they'll all be amazing, that is not the case by far. Keep that in mind before taking it.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. Even if you are a policy buff and feel like you already know everything about these subjects, it is extremely valuable to hear about these issues from the people who deal with them in the field--the experts themselves.",
    "Lectures seemed fragmented, scattered, and uneven. I don't know how much better I got at policy analysis (which is what I wanted to get out of the course), and if I got any such experience, I had to learn it on my own.",
    "I would really, really shop this course before you make a decision to take it. Also - shop your TA! Nevertheless, do not think that this course is for you if you are just interested in public policy - this class goes more into current events and less into policy. The memos are a little weird and are hard to get through.",
    "I'd recommend this class with considerable hesitation. Some of the guest lecturers were interesting, but some were mediocre, and some were outright bad. Section, even though I had a very smart and thoughtful TA, was tedious and a pain. Some of the readings are really interesting, but most people won't do them at all, or at least will just play catch up at the end of the semester.If you're interested in going into the policy world, then you'll be able to leave the class feeling equipped in writing policy memos. I can say that that's a skill I definitely developed from the class, and I actually find it an intellectually engaging and challenging process. But, other than that, you're not going to get that much more than you could by just reading the newspaper every day and a few other things here and there.",
    "American Public Policy is a survey course that spans many modules-climate change, education, the politics of the middle class, and inequality. I thought it had its shining moments, and some dull moments as well. Overall, I thought it was good, and hopefully the kinks (some of the guest lecturers weren't that good) will be worked out for the next class.",
    "A summary of some big issues in public policy. Some of the lectures and readings were off-topic or boring, but there were also some stellar assignments and speakers. Overall, I would recommend it.",
    "This class was often very good, but it was sometimes not good at all. That's because there were so many guest lectures. Some speakers--like Chris Dodd--were famous and interesting. Others were either dull or angry--like the global warming guy who kept explaining how the world was ending or someone who complained about the situation of African Americans in the US for four lectures (neither offered many feasible solutions). I walked away as a more informed citizen and I definitely do not regret taking the class--but you should know what you're getting into.",
    "The guest lectures are mostly great. The overall class is much less so.Section is painful and often not really connected to the lectures; too much focused on broader polisci stuff that you would learn in any polisci class.The work isn't too much, but it is significant. Four 2-3 pp memos that do require a thorough going over of the readings and class stuff. My section's at least were graded very technically, making it a question of putting certain words and ideas down rather than actually writing a cogent memo. They also require thorough end-notes, which is another pain.The test was ok--ids, short essay, long essay--but the ids were quite specific and the essays were very, very broad, so it's tough to study for.Basically, if you are willing to endure a less-than-fun section every week, write 4 painstaking memos with uncertain grading metrics and do a somewhat challenging final, then the usually very cool lectures are definitely worth it. If not, go sit in on a lecture when a particularly interesting person is speaking and save yourself the worry.",
    "This class should be conceived of as a way for students new to public policy to be introduced to some of the most important policy questions and to determine where they would like to focus more. That said, even though I'm a senior, I learned plenty of valuable policy information in each unit, particularly that on education.If the guest list is as strong in the future as it was this year's, the class will be worth taking.",
    "Wait until Hacker fixes the syllabus to take this class. If he's more involved in the actual teaching, sign right up.",
    "Great class. The guest lectures were usually great. Don't think it will be offered next year though because Hacker is on leave.",
    "Take this class if you want to learn about the problems and debates occurring about US domestic issues.",
    "Yes, I learned a lot. The grading was all over the place though, so maybe take it Credit\/D.",
    "I think certain guest lecturers were strong, but a large majority of them were weak. Furthermore, the amount of reading required for the course was large. Of course, keep in mind that this was the trial run for this course; if Professor Hacker lectures more (as he says he will), and if he guides the course more, this should be a great one to take.At the end of the day, I learned how to write a good policy memo, and most of the readings were really interesting. I'd recommend taking it Credit-D and then seeing how well you keep up with the readings\/do on the policy memos. It's a good course, but not an absolutely vital one to take.",
    "PLSC 271 is a pretty basic survey of American Public Policy. It is a great way to start digging into contentious issues like education reform and economic inequality. You write four 1000 word policy memos and take a final so the workload isn't too bad. The policy memos are actually interesting to write because it helps you to develop your own policy stances. Be prepared that the final is heavily reading-based but you can split the reading with a group of people and it won't be too bad.",
    "Great class, incredible guest speakers; they all have intimate experience with the modules they're teaching, and are experts in their field. The policy memos are really useful assignments to prepare for a future of writing memos of any kind, and the final exam really wasn't that bad, as long as you form a study group to divide up the readings. Take it!",
    "Fun class, cool lecturers. Not super difficult but not a gut.",
    "The speakers during the lectures were amazing. The readings were very long boring. The memos were graded harshly. I would take this class credit\/d. Don't be fooled into thinking that this is an \"introduction\" to policy - the majority of the class was juniors and seniors.",
    "This was a good class. It gave me a better idea of the issues present in our society and some views on how to solve the issues. The course really changes though based on your TF. Some TFs are awesome, and some are not that good (a bit harsh). But that goes for every class.",
    "It was an overwhelming amount of detail of a wide range of subjects. The memos were also very challenging and not related to lecture.",
    "This class was an interesting overview of key areas in american public policy, but the strength of each module depended largely on the speaker. Greenberg was great, the best of all of them. But the other modules with several speakers seemed disjointed and hard to incorporate into memos.",
    "As an introduction to the conception and creation of policy, you learn some good academic and intellectual skills. As an introduction to the specific topics covered in the modules, you get a sometimes strange combination of very particular details and very specific opinions and views. The class couldn't really be described as unbiased or evenly distributed, but the information you do learn is at least interesting. There's a hell of a lot of reading but you probably don't need to do it all in order to get a decent amount out of the lectures.",
    "It was pretty disorganized (keep in mind this is the first year it was taught). The topics were interesting, and SOME of the speakers were interesting, but I wish we had gone more in depth. Professor Hacker is wonderful and I wish he had taught more of the classes. But there was WAY TOO MUCH reading, a lot of which was dense, uninteresting, and irrelevant. Take it in the coming years when it's more solidified.",
    "I would not recommend this course as it was taught this year. Do not be fooled by Professor Hacker's charm during shopping period: your experience will depend ENTIRELY upon the guest lectures he invites to speak for the remainder of the semester. This year's speakers were particularly abysmal, and most of them used the time to promote their latest (rambling) book rather than speak about the policy topic at hand. The assignments, readings, lectures, and sections were all disjointed, and the final exam was daunting due to the sheer quantity of material covered in the class. Unless Professor Hacker finds better speakersand seriously pares down the syllabus (approximately 400 pages of reading some weeks was outrageous), this class will not improve.",
    "I would recommend the class to anyone who is interested in gaining a unique perspective on public policy and learning from the speakers. It is not worth it if your are not passionate about some of the main issues we face today like inequality, education and climate change.",
    "Great class--take it before leaving Yale.",
    "This is a great class to get a grasp not just on a range of hot topic issues, but also on different ways to approach thinking about the policy process and its problems. Because it's structured through guest lectures, the quality of the lectures is fairly hit or miss, but some of them were really excellent. Hacker is planning on lecturing more and giving the course more structure next time he teaches it, which will probably resolve most of the problems I had with the class (problems like the difficulty of connecting lectures to each other). He's an excellent lecturer, so I envy the students who'll be taking it next time. Sections were generally very engaging and helpful, and full of students\/TFs who were genuinely interested in grappling with the problems raised in lecture. I'd recommend this class pretty solidly if you're interested, especially with the changes Hacker is considering.",
    "Good introduction to some interesting policy issues, but if you're already familiar with these topics, I'd consider other classes.",
    "Great intro to Public Policy, you will walk out of this class and know whether you want to focus on policy or not.",
    "I highly recommend this class because students have the opportunity to learn directly from people who have greatly impacted their fields and are passionate about the topics they cover. This class is not for you if you are looking for an easy class to give you an idea of American Public Policy. It requires a lot of reading and outside research for discussion and policy memos.",
    "There are a good deal of readings. Section is graded. The four public policy memos are short but graded intensely.",
    "Okay--lots of reading. You'll get a good overview of current problems. Not sure how much it's relevant other than in terms of social capital. Good speakers.",
    "This class brings in some awesome lecturers to talk about really important policy issues in America. For us, it was important we had a background in the issues prior to the class because the course didn't really give a general foundation in any of them -- lecturers just gave their particular view on how to fix them. Hacker said he is going to try and fix that next year by lecturing more and only inviting guests at the end of modules. Check to see if he's made those reforms.The course is not too hard.",
    "Unless the class changes dramatically, no.",
    "This class taught me a lot about some of the major political controversies in the US today, in more depth than one can get from simply reading the news. The quality of the class definitely rests mostly on the quality of specific guest lecturers, so your mileage may vary depending on who the lecturers are. It's very cool to hear the opinions of people who have been involved firsthand with these issues though.",
    "American Public Policy was a strange course, but one I enjoyed. I know that it will change radically, with different (perhaps) better speakers and perhaps different \"units\" (policy issues in modern America) covered. My advice would be to shop this class and see if it's for you. The policy memos, I will say, were some of the more helpful writing practice I've done since coming to Yale.",
    "Amazing class and definitely worth taking (if you don't plan on majoring but would like an intro to poli sci starting it credit\/D works too). extremely knowledgable speakers and interesting assignments",
    "Yes, i would definitely recommend it to someone who wants an intro to american politics course.",
    "Take it! Great class, incredibly interesting and very different (in a good way) There's a good amount of reading, but most of it is so interesting and the kind of reading that you WANT to do.",
    "This is a good class for an introduction to public policy but it was a bit disorganized. Hacker is quite smart though and knows a whole lot about the policy realm - not just the academic theoretical side, but the practical side since he proposed the single-payer system for healthcare reform (which was sadly not passed). Also, one should know going in that the class does present a very liberal view on how government should work, which is fine by me, but if you're some raging conservative, then this might not be the class for you. I expect Hacker to organize the class much better next time around with fewer guest lecturers and a more cohesive syllabus. The topics covered were all very important but the policy memos were a bit frustrating - not quite sure how comparable it is to the stuff they said think tanks and govt. departments write, but I suppose it was an interesting exercise.",
    "This course is a good overview of a lot of important topics in American Public Policy. But as it is, the course in practice did not quite live up to the promise of the syllabus.If the structure is changed slightly to feature fewer guest lecturers and more of Professor Hacker, I'd definitely recommend it, but as it was this semester it wasn't quite what I'd hoped for.Medium amount of readings, relatively light workload (4 memos, which you sort of get the hang of as you go along, and the final).",
    "This class consists of various speakers. They bring in pretty interesting people to speak. The talks they give are interesting, but lack test-able substance, so I found myself coming away from class with few notes. I'd recommend it for a Credit\/D class, but if you don't take it Credit\/D, you might find yourself worrying about what material you're going to be tested on."
