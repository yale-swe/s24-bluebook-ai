    "Very good. Relaxing class. Perfect for brushing up on your Spanish without having to worry about your grade",
    "Legal Spanish is easy, fun, and interesting. You study the Spanish and Latin American legal systems, as well as certain aspects of American law, such as jury service and the death penalty. There's a fair amount of discussion in class, as well as lots of videos.Reading is light--just a course packet--and while there are written assignments due every class period, they're easy and usually just review material from the previous class. There's also one group project on a legal topic, but those tend to be fun to put together and present to the class. The last assignment is a 5-page paper on a legal topic of your choice, which was not difficult at all and actually very interesting. I would absolutely recommend this class to a student looking to practice their Spanish and learn something new about law.",
    "I can't imagine a student not benefiting from this course, especially pre-law students, simply because so many future careers require a second language, and this knowledge is sure to be helpful later.",
    "take legal spanish if you have any interest in law, the government, even current events (i.e. immigration). very relevant course. carreras is fun but beware: it's early.",
    "not too demanding runthrough of lots of legal principles.",
    "Definitely take this! It's fun and you learn a lot, and the course load isn't bad at all.",
    "Spanish 222 is a class on legal Spanish--it will teach you to read and understand legal documents in Spanish. I would definitely recommend this class to another student.",
    "I would recommend it to students interested in learning more about legal systems and Spanish-speaking legal systems in particular. I would not recommend it to someone who is hoping to use the spanish learned in this course to assist clients."
