    "DEFINITELY TAKE THIS COURSE!",
    "An interesting course that isn't as hard as everyone claims. Lots of reading but you don't have to do every page.",
    "Yes, absolutely! Probably because the class starts at 9 in the morning, there are so few of us for this lecture class. I think it would be a lot more fun if the class is turned into a seminar, because all the reading materials are kind of challenging and discussions would certainly help with that. Or we can change the meeting time, so there would be more people attending the lecture and have discussion sections.",
    "First you learn theory, then you apply it to history. This was my first International Relations class, so I think I would have benefited more if I had more experience with the subject. Still, the class was great. Darden picks some really great readings for the class, though it was overwhelming at times and I didn't do all of it. Not as hard as Darden sold it on the first day. Not that much work, despite the overload of readings. Once you get past the first midterm you can start slacking.Darden's lecture on chemical weapons was one of the best I've sat through at Yale. Some of the ideas I was exposed to in this class will definitely stay with me for years to come -- this class changed how I understand international politics. A five star class.",
    "The first thing Professor Darden said in the first class was that the class was going to be \"lots of reading with harsh grading\".I think it's true that there is a lot of reading, but it is totally manageable, and interesting.In terms of grading, I think he and his TAs are pretty reasonable.Not necessarily harsher than any other course I've taken at Yale.Take this class if you're interested in Politics or History; it's a great course.",
    "Take this course!!This is a great introductory class to international relations theory and how theory can be used to understand historical phenomena and current events. Darden is a great lecturer, and his lectures are chalk-full of information and great analysis. The readings are tough at first because they are advanced political science literature, but they get better afterwards. You will walk away with a fascination of current events and a more systematic approach of looking at international politics. Work load is not bad (a midterm exam, 10 page paper in place of second midterm,10-12 page final paper).",
    "The grading in this class is difficult, but the material covered is so interesting that you should consider taking this class Credit\/D\/ Fail.",
    "This course introduces three basic camps in political theory and examines them against historical background. Very interesting material. Difficult reading though.",
    "An interesting look at the history of international politics. Heavy on applying theoretical approaches."
