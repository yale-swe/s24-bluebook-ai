    "Great class! Take it.",
    "I think you really really really have to take this before you graduate.",
    "only if you feel okay to spend most of your time on photography",
    "Yes, great class, learn a lot about photography as an art form rather than just commercialized media",
    "Fantastic class, tons of work, but so totally worth it.",
    "Take this class if you've ever wanted to learn photography - it's pretty cool the way it makes you see the things around you differently. Do know, however, that it takes up a LOT of time, especially before critiques, and that you do have to shoot ~35 rolls of film by the end of the semester. That being said - a great investment. Very rewarding.",
    "My best class at yale so far. loved it.",
    "A great introduction to photography and photographers. A bit expensive, but worthwhile for taking better pictures in personal life and academically. I would highly recommend this class.",
    "Yes. If you are interested in photography. But if you aren't going to put a lot of work into it, and do not except to spend hours per week in the darkroom and shooting on your own, then do not take it.",
    "Art 136 is black and white analog photography that shows us all of the basic things that you need to know to do photography. I would highly recommend this course because it helps you see the world differently and pay attention to little details. It should be known thatit is not an easy course, you have to put in many hours shooting and developing."
