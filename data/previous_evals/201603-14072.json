   "comments": [
    "We were introduced to a framework called \"humanistic communications\" or \"value-based communications\" which, in a sentence, is the idea that people's cultural backgrounds and discourses matter when you are trying to communicate an idea (e.g. climate change) to them. The first two weeks in the course were an awesome opportunity to delve into the idea. However, after that, it felt like we were belaboring the point. Especially as someone coming from a social science\/humanities background, it was not news to me that culture matters. I grew very bored and frustrated by this course by the third week, and that unfortunately continued throughout the semester. The best days were when we had guest speakers.",
    "I learned a tremendous amount in this course, not only about communicating climate change, but about communication in general. This course provided me with a way of thinking that is very applicable to many different realms. This course went beyond just talking about the difficulty of climate change communication to examine the underlying values that motivate others to do and say what they do. This course has provided me with useful tools to use in the real world more than any other course I've taken.",
    "I gained EVERYTHING from this class! Wow I do not even know where to begin. This class teaches strategies to approach communication in environmentalism, but it will teach you to be a better communicator in life, not to mention a more understanding and compassionate person. This class teaches you how to speak to anyone through their values so you can have meaningful conversation in places never expected and collapse barriers that stand between ideologies and cultures.",
    "How to use values in communication\/negotiation.",
    "This class really helped me understand how the world operates through human interactions, the shortcomings of the environmental movement, as well as how to communicate to actually make progress on and solve environmental issues like climate change. This class changed the way that I understand the connection between humans and the environment and has also made me appreciate the power of communication as the biggest facilitator of positive change in our society.",
    "Learnt about the theory of humanistic communications",
    "I don't even know where to start here because I learned a whole new way of looking at the world and what drives people to action. The most critical insight I gained is why most Environmental communications fail why they bring about vehement opposition (hint: they dont align with most peoples values, and are often in direct opposition to the value of progress). In this class we learned the methods and process that one can use to craft successful Environmental communications, ones that reach people based on where they are on the Maslow pyramid, what job they have, and what their core values are. In addition to gaining a completely different mindset on how people live in different mindsets and paradigms and how one should approach communications based on that, I developed a lot of skills in planning and tackling ambitious projects. In this class, we are split into groups, and each group must strategically plan and tackle an ambitious project.",
    "I gained knowledge of a communications tool kit that aids in not only discussing environmental issues, but all sorts of issues. I learned the theories and practiced them hands on.",
    "For me personally, this semester represented a period of deep personal and intellectual growth. The concepts explored in the classroom coupled with the opportunity to correctly implement and practice them yielded an educational experience like none other. More than any other course I have taken to date, EVST 311 effectively married theory and practice, allowing me formulate a vivid conception of humanistic communications in the real world and a clear-eyed understanding of why narrative engagement tools are so effective and desperately neededparticularly in the fight against climate change. Notably, crafting narratives that penetrate through the modern media clutter carries greater import than ever before. Unlike most of human history where the chief obstacle was acquiring information, today the greater challenge is distilling it. And given that most people lack the information processing skills necessary to do so, effective messaging strategies have only ascended in importance. Throw in the daunting and unprecedented threat of climate change, and the result one the clearest mandates ever: the striking need to craft effective climate change narratives to help halt our warming planet. Accordingly, our work in EVST 311 this semester wasnt just interesting. It also felt morally necessary."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "We didn't know what the assignments were in advance; Professor Lussier would throw assignments your way at the end of a class that were due next week, and it was rarely specified what exactly we needed to do or when we needed to do it by. I wish there were more organization in this respect. We should have at least had a written version of the assignment somewhere to use as a resource. Most importantly, though, the group project was a NIGHTMARE in terms of scheduling. If you're going to require that ten students meet once a week outside of class, you need to call that a SECTION and schedule it in advance. Instead, three weeks into the course we were told we needed to find a time, and the only time available was 9am on a Monday (and I had to change my work schedule to accommodate that, and not all students could make it!). We were also forced to meet up on a Saturday morning, which felt inappropriate. I think a formalized section needs to be organized for the class.",
    "The success of this class depends entirely on the project you are working on. I worked on the Dallas project and found it very unorganized and poorly led. Professor Lussier was not engaged with the Dallas project at all, and the concepts we were learning in class did not translate to what we were doing in Dallas. I really loved what we were learning and thought it was all very interesting, but I thought the projects took away from the class. They were a lot of busy work. I wish we had done smaller scale projects throughout the year, like we did for the Trump transition team. This would give me a broader understanding of how to apply the conepts we were learning to the real world, insted of in only one case, in Dallas. Because of this, I think the project and the amount of outside class time it required took away from my enjoyment of this class. If you are going to have students meet for an hour every week outside of class, you should call this a discussion section. Moreoever, many of the assignments had poor directions that we only recieved clarity on after constantly asking for help.",
    "Paul is a tremendous, passionate lecturer and brilliant communicator. The short lectures during class time are very insightful and interesting. The project provides the opportunity to work with real stakeholders in the real world, but for much of the semester, it felt like there was a gap between what we learned in class and read about and what we did for our projects. This was something that Paul addressed towards the end of the course.",
    "Strengths: engaging, hands on, real life communications work, not like any other class at Yale Weaknesses: a bit of a step learning curve that caused a slow start to the projects",
    "Interesting material, but somewhat disorganized. After the first few lectures, it was difficult to follow what new concepts we were supposed to be learning.",
    "The class structure is very fluid and accommodating of students' concerns and issues. I personally find the group projects that accompany the class to be really rewarding and complementary to the course material in a good, but not perfect way. At times, it was difficult to truly employ the techniques learned in class to the projects; I'm not sure if this can be improved, but I can say that my project allowed me to come to realizations about humanistic communications that augmented what was explicitly taught in class. Clarity in assignment expectations could be communicated better (and with better consistency) between the professor, TA, and students.",
    "Strengths - enthusiastic professor, new and important material, opportunity to engage with real world client Weaknesses - poorly organized course, often asked to put in a lot of unscheduled group meeting hours outside of class without an organized \"section\" or meeting time which was very difficult to schedule; assignment expectations not always fully clarified; material felt very repetitive at times",
    "Strengths: very cutting-edge and fresh content. The class changed the way I thought about environmentalism. Now I feel more equipped to deal with the real world and I understand the state of climate change communications better than I did before. Weaknesses: lectures were confusing but eventually made sense. I also would have liked more assignments applying Paul's communication strategies",
    "This is an incredible course in general. There are two ways the course might be improved. The first is by adding a few more mini-assignments for humanistic communications that align with we are currently learning in class. While the group projects are extremely valuable, they often do not reinforce the current and new material, because it is difficult to plan the material being taught around the unpredictable directions the group projects take. Another way the course could be improved is through more feedback on our work. While both the TA and professor make themselves very available to meet, email, or talk on the phone, to give feedback and answer questions, the less proactive students can go through the term getting very little feedback on their work from the TA or professor. Otherwise this course was fantastic and unlike anything I have ever taken before. It gives everyone a lot of real world experience with making things happen, a great group and network of students to be a part of, a fulfilling project to work on, new perspectives on how people receive messages and how to communicate with them effectively, a lot of knowledge about different environmental issues and common environmental communication frameworks, and lot of ahah moments, and an inspiring and passionate teacher who shows us how to act effectively and with purpose on an issue as daunting as climate change.",
    "We could have done more work-shopping and practicing the tools we learned.",
    "Strengths: -I really loved the seminar format of the class. Professor Lussier was a whiz at blending lecturing with classroom engagement. He quickly learned everyones name and made sure to include everyone in our discussions. -The team project component of the class was a new experience and a hugely rewarding one. I loved working with my team and applying the theoretical concepts from the classroom to real-world projects. -The guest lectures on religion and industrial ecology were great. I hope they are offered again in the future. -Having the opportunity to visit Dallas was awesome. It was a fascinating trip and really helped crystalize our narratives for the final deliverable. Areas for Improvement: -Perhaps my main suggestion would be to extend the number of weekly class hours. The material is incredibly rich and 2 hours of weekly course time cannot always do it justice. -I wish there were an opportunity to collaborate more closely with the grad class. -In future years, it might be nice to have a class dinner to celebrate the end of the semester."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this class to someone who is entirely new to social science\/humanities\/cultural studies, e.g. a STEM student. However, if you are in the social sciences or humanities, I suggest you find a different forum in which to talk about environmental issues. Also, take this as a 5th class. It isn't super intellectually stimulating and involves very little theoretical\/intellectual reading, which is a blessing and a curse. The readings are super interesting and easy, which for me was pretty refreshing this semester since I was in other heavy theory classes. EVST 311 is really just Professor Lussier explaining his own theory, and he doesn't really do the work of showing how predecessors in academia have already proven the points he's trying to make and done so in greater detail.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student if you are coming from a completely STEM background. If you have taken other social science classes, however, everything you learn will be a reiteration. The thesis of this class is that to make people do what you want, you have to cater to what they value. This was something I grasped on the first day of class, and the rest of the semester built off on this in frivolous ways with silly models that did not really mean anything and did not contribute much more depth to my understanding of the material.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class because you will learn things that will change the way you look at many of the world's issues and will end the semester with a skill set that you can apply to climate change and any other issue\/topic you pursue. Beyond Paul's short lectures, the main part of the course is a communications project that involves real stakeholders form the outside world. These projects were a great learning experience--very rewarding at times, but also almost always a pain in the ass. Paul is unlike any professor you have ever had, for better or for worse. He is passionate and brilliant and makes himself incredibly available to students. He treats you very much like his peer and, because he is not an academic, there isn't your typical professor-student divide. Keep in mind, though, that this class is, at times, a 24\/7 commitment. There were times when Paul would call me at 9pm on a weekend and ask me to send emails to our project stakeholders. You should take this class because you will learn how to think like Paul and the world NEEDS more people who will think like Paul, but be ready to go all-in. It won't be worth it if you go halfway.",
    "100% take this class regardless of your major or interests. I spent the whole semester working with my team and the Virgin Earth Challenge to facilitate dialogue surrounding carbon dioxide removal (CDR) and climate smart agriculture in the Greater New Haven area. If nothing else, I am no longer afraid to spark conversations with strangers, even when I am not speaking with 100% knowledge and confidence on the topic. Paul Lussier is incredibly kind, caring, involved, and at the leading edge of the field and an incredible person to become acquainted with. This class is like no other, it is not about the time in class but the many hours working with your team, stakeholder, and partners throughout the semester. This class with change the way you view communications and advocacy and desire to reshape the very foundations that underly our language and culture! Please please please for the sake of humanity take this class and tell all of your friends to take it too!",
    "If you have little knowledge of the material\/methods presented, this is an interesting introduction to humanistic communications. However, for people looking for something more in depth who already have some knowledge of this, it might be a bit too disorganized for you to learn as much as desired. (Though this was likely a more disorganized year due to election commitments and such.)",
    "I personally found this class to be one of the most formative I have taken at Yale. Professor Lussier articulated many of the thoughts that I had had on my mind answering the questions of why people don't care about the environment and why they are unwilling to act to protect it, and he provided the theoretical and practical foundations of great techniques to use to actually solve environmental problems. The class can be a bit dogmatic at times, but I think you need to understand the material of this class if you want to be an effective facilitator of change. I always found this class engaging and would quickly recommend it to anyone.",
    "This course is a great opportunity to interact with leaders outside of the Yale community on interesting and important projects. I especially recommend it for motivated science or engineering majors looking to learn more about how their work fits into the larger political\/social picture (NOT a gut, though).",
    "Worth taking since you'll learn some important new theories, but I really hope the organization of the course improves in the future. You'll have to meet outside class often with your group, and coordinating a meeting time with a large group is HARD. Assignment expectations are often not clarified even though grading seems to be lenient... *knock on wood*. Some parts you have to grit your teeth and get through, but Paul will uncover a lot of interesting things for you to think about and that's worth engaging with.",
    "Yes, if you are interested in media studies, communications, and\/or environmental science. Paul has very new, practical, cutting-edge ideas that will change how you think of environmentalism. In class, his ideas about communication are often applied to things unrelated to the environment (once he had us rewrite an anti-Trump ad for homework). Also, take it if you want to do a group project working on an actual environmental communications project. Most grades in this class are about how well you did the group project and there are no tests. This is a pretty unique class. Paul is an experience that you don't want to miss. He oozes motivation and drive to save the world. I've never seen a professor as excited and focused for the entire ~2 hours of class. Because he does actual work and has failed in his life, he is very practical and is confident that there's some way to find a solution that will engage different groups. He's also very warm and helpful. If you hate group projects or are easily stressed out by logistics, don't take this class. I'd say, however, that Paul and Dana are extremely warm and friendly. They worked really well to be accessible to students and clear up confusion. It's also a good exercise in dealing with real life. You should shop this class at least. It might change your life.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to any student who cares about the environment and wants to something to help fight climate change. You learn so much about how we should communicate climate solutions and how to make them happen. In fact, everyone in the class gets the opportunity to work on a fulfilling group project, that can help make our world more sustainable. This is such a breath of fresh air from all the classes where you learn things and just take a test without contributing to society. The material is also incredibly interesting and will change your perspective, helping you become a more pragmatic person in general. Professor Lussier is also an incredibly inspiring individual, who has done a lot of amazing and impactful things in his life. Just hearing him talk in lecture will make you inspired to make an impact in the world and optimistic about our capacity to solve environmental issues. At first I thought some of his claims in class were a bit too good to be true and was skeptical, but as I became more familiar with the material and stories of his past successes in climate communication, I began to see that there really is a way to influence changes through humanistic communications that directly benefit the people involved in the changes and mitigate climate emissions.",
    "I would highly recommend this course!! It changed the way I think about climate change communications and communications in general. The pedagogy was incredible because you got to practice what you learned rather than just learn the theories. Anyone would benefit from taking this class.",
    "I would highly recommend EVST 311 to another student. If you care deeply about climate change, but find the politics surrounding it bafflingly, maddening, and seemingly intractable, look no further. This course is a breath of fresh air. As Professor Lussier outlines in clear-eyed terms, the chief obstacle to addressing climate change is one of communication; the current discourse, far from being just ineffective, actually entrenches climate denialism and political divisions. In turn, crafting new narrativesbuilt around the principles of humanistic and values-based communicationis essential to unlocking fresh thinking and forging a new climate consensus across industries, religions, cultures, and political parties. EVST 311 gives you the tools and perspective to do just that. Through a combination of theoretical study and real-world projects (my team, for example, worked with the city of Dallas to develop a narrative framework aimed at promoting sustainable development), EVST 311 brings the practice of humanistic communications into vivid focus. Moreover, the skills you learn are not just applicable to climate change but to nearly every public policy issue. The material you learn in this class will have life-long value. To top it all off, Paul Lussier is a terrific professor. His passion for the subject is absolutely infectious, and he is an articulate and engaging lecturer. He really strives to know each student individually and always includes everyone in the discussions. He cares deeply about his students and works to help all of them succeed. In sum, EVST 311, both in substance and style, is an excellent class. If you have the opportunity, definitely take it!"
