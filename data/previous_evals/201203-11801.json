    "As stated above, make sure you get an adviser who can put in the time and give you the back up and support you need. Otherwise, this class can become a nightmare.",
    "You know if you need this, there's really not much of a choice in the matter",
    "Independent research project, relates to physics but there is flexibility in exactly what field your research is in. I personally recommend it highly, but I knew what research I wanted to do from the start and was already motivated by that.",
    "Do research! It's awesome.",
    "Gotta take it -- it's a pretty chill course so no worries. Make sure you have a good relationship with your research advisor.",
    "gotta do watchu gotta do.but for not seniors: it's not a bad idea at all to get going on research early on. you learn a lot! and getting an adviser is super easy: just email professors.",
    "It's independent research. It will depend on your advisor and how much you want to get done.",
    "If you are reading these evaluations, you probably have to take this class. But if that's the case, why are you even bothering reading evaluations? Hurry along and sign up before the physics department runs out of advisors! (Kidding!! This won't happen for, like, another two years assuming the current STEM admissions growth rate.) The only other possibility is that you don't have to take this class. But then surely you're only thinking about taking this class because you've heard from your friends how wonderful it is to pursue independent physics research in a very low-stress, high-flexibility environment. But if that's the case, you must really distrust your friends that you have to come and read MY evaluation just to convince yourself that doing research for credit is an awesome gig. If this is indeed your case, I advise that you forego research and spend the next semester focusing on developing better ties with your friends - your enhanced interpersonal skills will serve you well during your future research experiences too! Finally, I admit that there is also the possibility - vanishingly small in the physics major limit - that you don't have physics major friends, and that you have stumbled across this course in the depths of social despair. If this is your case, despair no further. Professor Werner will be your friend. And he will guide you with excellent advice as well as helpful feedback (for real!) for your report and presentation. He may even post a Yale Compliment about you to boost your spirits, but these rumors are unconfirmed and dubious at the present moment. In short, you should take this course under any circumstances UNLESS you specifically have friends but don't trust them, in which case you should still take the course merely at a later time. And that, my friends, is what we call a proof by casework.",
    "Physics 471 is required for the physics major, but is also an excellent way to learn more deeply about certain research topics and to find a field that interests you.",
    "If you have a good mentor and project then go for it! It doesn't matter who is supervising, though prof Werner is nice, it really depends on which lab you end up in. Good luck!",
    "Take this class if you need it for the physics major. It's as much work as you make it.",
    "...you have to take this course at some point. Research is fun",
    "Independent research is one of the best classes for a physics major at Yale. It lets you develop a close relationship with a professor, work on cool research, and best of all helps you raise up your physics GPA! You can take it up to six times. All that is required are some reports on progress and a final report and presentation."
