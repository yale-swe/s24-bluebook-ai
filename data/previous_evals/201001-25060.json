   "comments": [
    "You read a variety of short stories plays and poems, and are expected to write more frequently. Conversation usually is in a separate day of the week. Good class, and less frustrating than L3.",
    "Similar to L3, again if you have gotten this far only your personal feelings can stop you from taking this course.",
    "Persian 140 certainly shifts emphasis to reading and writing - daily translation assignments and weekly writing assignments keep your on-paper skills sharp, though I personally felt this made my verbal skills slip a little. While I know some students in the class weren't too crazy about our focus on Classical Persian, I personally enjoyed both the challenge and the foundation in essential Iranian writers.",
    "Take it. If you work, you will do well. And, you'll learn a very, very important language. The class is always interesting and exciting.",
    "I would recommend this course to a fellow student, and will miss it. Persian 140 is difficult, with a widely variable workload, and requires that one demonstrate great enthusiasm for the language and consistent effort in reading sections."
