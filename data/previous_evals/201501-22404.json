   "comments": [
    "Not sure what to make of this course overall. Lecture pacing was sometimes too slow, sometimes very fast, likely because Gaja (who is very patient and otherwise a good lecturer) had to keep both the linguistics majors from getting bored and non-majors from getting lost. The material is generally interesting but gets more difficult after the midterm, and the hardest concepts aren't in the textbook (which itself was often difficult to follow). Lecture slides are put up on Classesv2, but aren't all that helpful as study material, so studying for the exams and trying to catch up after missing a lecture was more of a struggle than it could have been. The homework (mostly coding, with some short response questions) was useful for understanding the concepts and satisfying to complete but VERY harshly graded, especially on the written responses; the midterm, however, was much easier than we'd expected.",
    "I was a freshman taking this class, and it was definitely my hardest class. I came in with CPSC 112 and LING 110, but I still felt overwhelmed by a lot of the concepts. The way this class is graded, though, is beautiful. You get 10 flex days over the semester, your lowest pset gets dropped, exams count for a total of 30% of the final grade. After the class was over, I was really able to appreciate how much I learned and how applicable the algorithms we covered were. During the class, I was frustrated as hell. If you're good at programming, you'll be fine. If you're not, shop it, because the content is pretty interesting. And Gaja is a pretty good lecturer, but sometimes she can go a little fast. All the slides are posted online, so you can go back through it if you got lost.",
    "LING 227 is a good introduction to computational linguistics. You should have some programming experience, though. The problem sets are of moderate programming difficulty (about as difficult as CPSC 201). The tests are very fair, and Professor Jarosz is great.",
    "I would definitely recommend LING 227 to another student. It's a great way to learn about several areas, especially linguistics, machine learning, and statistics. The work load is manageable (and fun), and the grading is very reasonable.",
    "'Twas an excellent course! I had heard bits and pieces of computational linguistics from many sources before this class, so it was great to finally get all the fundamentals of this field in one place so that I could really understand them. I thought that Gaja (the professor) did a great job of making an intimidating subject accessible. The problems sets were also very enjoyable because they had you solving problems that are very much applicable to the real world such as spell check or part of speech tagging.",
    "it's good.",
    "Take it only if you're interested in the material, especially natural language processing or computational linguistics. If you are, the course will definitely teach you some new things but they won't necessarily inspire or blow your mind. If you're not interested in the material, then it's not worth it.",
    "Homework is usually manageable and tests are easy. Some of the concepts are hard to understand, though. Python is easy to pick up if you don't already know it. Going to class is marginally useful.",
    "As a computer science major interested in NLP, I thought this was very well-organized and well-taught. We learned a lot of neat algorithms, which are presented in an NLP context ofc, but also have applications in other fields. And the assignments were fun and practical -- spell checkers, sentence parsers, etc. -- and gave you a good intuition about how the algorithms you learned in class work. Take it!",
    "I really liked this course, even though I didn't go to lecture. The programming psets were fun (although the grading was a bit nit-picky), the exams were fair,, and I got a good sense both for NLP and some of the linguistical underpinnings. I wish there had been more of a focus on machine learning and less of a focus on linguistics. Take this if you want to write Python, its a lot of fun.",
    "This class is great for anyone interested in natural language processing, or for brushing up on Python skills. It is rigorous, but expects a slightly lower amount of work per week than a typical computer science course, which is refreshing.",
    "No. Find a different SO distribution requirement.",
    "Take this class ONLY IF YOU'RE EXTREMELY COMFORTABLE WITH PYTHON. Otherwise it's a struggle the entire semester.",
    "An overview of computational techniques used in linguistics. This is an awesome class to take if you are interested in CS - you'll do some great programming in Python, and learn techniques that are helpful for any discipline, such as hidden Markov models and clustering.",
    "The material is really interesting, though the lectures can sometimes be dry because we go over algorithms by hand. That being said, Gaja and the TAs were receptive to questions and feedback. Know that the homeworks and exams are very different homeworks are all about coding, exams are all about theory.",
    "A fairly straightforward (but not low workload) prgramming class focused on Linguistics.",
    "A great course if you're interested in the interface between linguistics and computer science. Linguistics majors who haven't done programming before should definitely spend some time learning Python before taking this class, so that the problem sets don't take forever. If you're good at coding, the workload is really manageable, and the topics are fun and interesting. I highly recommend!",
    "If you're interested in both language and computing then you'll probably be interested in this class. I would not recommend taking it if you don't have any programming experience, though. The first few lectures are dedicated to teaching Python, but unless you already know another language it'd be difficult to pick up.",
    "Good course. Learn the basics of a lot of relevant language processing techniques. Psets aren't too hard.",
    "This class was one of my favorite classes out of all 4 years at Yale, and it wasn't remotely related to my major. Gaja is an awesome lecturer, the assignments are so well-designed, and you will learn so much about computational linguistics and natural language processing (and Python!).",
    "A great introduction to computational linguistics. Pretty much all of the students came out of the class wanting to take more courses in this field. You don't need much computer science background to do well, since the first few weeks are spent reviewing Python (the only language you use in the class). Some linguistics background is probably helpful, but some students were able to do well without it. The problem sets were super interesting, and the tests were long but doable. I recommend not skipping class, as we go over examples during class that are not in the lecture slides.",
    "This class is an introduction to machine learning for language technologies. You should have a solid understanding of python before you take it -- otherwise you'll have to work double time to catch up on programming. That said, this class is really approachable and fun, so if you're curious about linguistics or language technologies I recommend it highly!",
    "A challenge without linguistics or cs background but you learn a lot.",
    "This class is great. Material is super interesting and workload is light and flexible. Gaja is a great instructor. General note: make sure your code follows the exact guidelines of the spec, and whenever you're even slightly unsure be sure to ask for clarifications in the forums or office hours.",
    "This class is a lot of fun and I definitely learned a lot. That being said, I could see it being pretty difficult if you have no programming experience -- plan accordingly.",
    "Very interesting material that has made me view language differently (in a good way). All homework assignments are in python. Prior programming experience would be helpful (even if not in python).",
    "I'd definitely recommend it! The psets are really fun, and while many of the topics are covered in other Linguistics classes (OT, syntactic trees, etc) this is the only class at Yale I have ever encountered that really looks at them from such a quantitative and algorithmic perspective. I learned so much!",
    "For students who are computer science majors or have extensive programming experience, I highly recommend this course. The course covers many of the most important concepts and applications in NLP today. The problem sets are fun and the material is interesting. Highly recommended.",
    "Good class. Interesting subjects, fun homework. Moves quickly at times, so pay attention and keep up with the readings or you'll miss stuff.",
    "Fascinating course you cover a huge number of linguistics algorithms in a short period of time. Ngrams, min-edit, k-means, PCFGs, to name a few of the topics. This was my first exposure to linguistics, but Ive programmed extensively over the past few years. As such, the problem sets were challenging, but manageable. There were 7 in total, each worth 10%, with the lowest dropped. The exams were also pretty hard, but they were only worth 15% each. Professor Jarosz did a fine job leading the class and I look forward to taking further computational linguistics courses in the future!"
