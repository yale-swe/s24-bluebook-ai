    "It's a language course, you know what you're getting into. Nothing is out of the ordinary here, just a continuation of the language study from L1 and L2.",
    "Italian 130 is the third semester of Italian. I would recommend taking Italian because it is a very interesting language and interesting culture.",
    "I feel like my italian improved a lot, because we not only reviewed, but went into more detail with the grammar. The weekly compositions were a big part of that.",
    "I would recommend Italian 120 to another student. After L1 and L2 I was pretty disappointed with the Italian department, and I did not feel as though I had a grasp of the language, after L3, I am much more comfortable, though I still have a long way to go!",
    "This class is a good overview of the things you learned in L1 and L2. However, I would recommend, if you have the time in your schedule, the intensive L3-L4 instead. I found 50 minute classes to be frustrating because I found myself only preparing enough to get through class the next day and not enough to really get into the material."
