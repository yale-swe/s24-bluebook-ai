   "comments": [
    "Absolutely! This is a rare opportunity to know what is going on in the global heath world from the first hands.",
    "This is a discussion-based seminar that delves very deeply into complex global health policy issues and decisions. The course has a good balance of case study, statistical analysis, and original research. The two papers and presentation for this course are relatively open-ended and allow for creativity and the opportunity to pursue global health issues that really matter to you.",
    "This was a fascinating class that gives both a wide understanding of different health financing trends and techniques and a deep understanding of the strengths and limitations of specific programs. If you're at all interested in a career in global health, I highly recommend you take this. You'll come out of it with a much better understanding of how the field actually works.",
    "I would strongly recommend GLBL 821 to a fellow student.",
    "Yes, Professor Hecht was a great professor. He was constantly trying to improve the class and was very attuned to what we thought. It's a very interesting course where you discuss many current issues in global health financing.",
    "The class is a great induction into the world of policy-making. But it is not an easy class- the assigned readings for each week were long (on average 200 pages). We had to come to class prepared to discuss them by participating in class debates and role-plays. The instructor sometimes also asked us to submit one page written responses. I found the reading response exercises and the in class debates and role-plays very useful for focusing on the main points from the readings. It was also a good way of hearing from my classmates about what they thought about the topics discussed in the readings. The instructor did a great job of moderating the classroom discussions. The topics discussed were already very practical but the instructor made them even more relevant by giving insights from the work that he does with his organization.",
    "I would recommend the course to students interested in global policy and health. It provides a comprehensive overview of cost-effectiveness and cost-benefit interventions.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to anyone interested in global health. It will expose you to the economic side of the field, which is something you only gain cursory exposure to in most of the other global health classes at Yale. It is a privilege to work with Professor Hecht, who is incredibly well-respected and well-established in the field, and he will do everything possible to make the seminar feel like more than just another class - including dinner at his house, speaker events with experts, and even helping you to find internships\/jobs after the class ends. Be prepared to work hard, though; there was a good amount of reading each week, with a reading response every other week or so, one midterm paper and one final project\/paper. Professor Hecht expects the quality he would expect of someone working for him at Results for Development. Aka, he expects professional-level quality, not student-level work, and you must be prepared to step up to that expectation. That being said, it was a truly phenomenal experience and was probably my favorite class this semester.",
    "YES absolutely. Best professor and he truly cares about the students progress in the class-- he's like a father figure almost. You will learn more about life direction and career choice in this class than any other at Yale. Praises of the professor aside, the assignments are not too difficult, just follow his instructions because he trains you the way you'd be expected to write papers in the real world. Loved it and would absolutely take it if he is brought back to Yale. The class was geared towards policy applications and he used case studies to teach the nitty gritty of the process involved in this kind of policy research and implementation. There is a lot of dense reading so be wary of that, but he always does a good job of tying it to presentations in class.",
    "An excellent policy-focused class in which you will learn a lot about global health financing through case studies. Most of the class is spent reviewing projects by Results for Development, for which Professor Hecht is a managing director. The workload is reasonable, with a midterm paper, a final paper, weekly reading responses, and one presentation. Professor Hecht is extremely knowledgeable and cares a lot about the students. He has very high standards and will constantly push you further in your thinking. Overall, I would highly recommend this class to any advanced global health student interested in global health financing. This class fills a unique niche among Yale's global health course offerings and is taught by a real expert in the field!",
    "Amazing class! Consisted mainly of case studies that were done by our professor Dr Hecht in his think tank in DC. Case studies revolved around health financing: how does South Africa develop a long term strategy for AIDS? How do middle income countries graduate from GAVI (vaccine) funding? What are some innovative financing methods for malaria? In addition to weekly classes, we had guest speakers come in once a month to complement our knowledge of a course or to present a different topic altogether. Overall great course! I hoe Dr Hecht is allowed back at Yale because he is one of the most humble (he presented his work on AIDS vaccine in front of Nobel prize laureates and they accepted it!!) and genuine professors I had at Yale.",
    "This class presents a series of case studies in how global health and development projects and interventions are designed, modeled, analyzed, and implemented. It is a fascinating look into the agencies and actors that actually implement development projects, and the economics, epidemiology, and statistics that goes into the endeavor. It is highly recommended for any students that has a professional interest in the fields; I can think of few other courses that are so important in their material and are so well taught.",
    "I would definately recommend this class to anyone in Health looking to gain an understanding of cost modeling for large epidemics and hypothetical situations aimed at shaping policy. This is less applicable for anyone looking to build modeling skills."

   "comments": [
    "This course significantly improved my knowledge of the global health.It also helped me to understand more exactly what I want to do in future.",
    "I have studied domestic health policy and global health in terms of epidemiology and intervention implementation, but this course really synthesized these areas. I also gained experience doing critical analysis of global health policy decisions, especially related to funding. I was able to investigate a global health issue that I previously studied, and expand my analysis. I was really proud of the progress that I made during the semester.",
    "It helped me evaluate global health policy decisions and the evidence surrounding them.",
    "GLBL 821 gave me exposure to the economic side of the global health field, which was incredibly valuable. I also learned how to conduct and evaluate cost-effectiveness models, as well as design my own models myself. I feel much more equipped to take a job in global health after having completed the course.",
    "Contributed to knowledge of work\/career after Yale. Not much to research yet since my major is different and not applicable.",
    "I learned a lot about global health financing and the realities of global health policy through case studies. I also learned the importance of the data-driven mindset in global heath, thanks to Professor Hecht's relentless emphasis on it.",
    "Introduced me to a new way of looking at global health.",
    "This course provided immeasurable insight into how global health and development work is actually conducted, and what a career in those fields might actually look like. I credit the class with steering me closer to those disciplines, and for providing me with invaluable knowledge of how analytic tools, research, and critical thinking is applied in those areas."
