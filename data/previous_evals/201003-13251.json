    "There is very little reading compared to other seminar but for good reason. it is very difficult reading. still, the topic is fascinating for physics and philosophy majors alike. you actually have to work for the Sc credit (need to get a grasp of certain concepts in physics) and the Hu credit (20 pages of writing total). Still, you never have to write a long essay because the 20 pages of writing comes from two 10pg takehome exams. The subject matter easily sustains 13 weeks of 2 hour seminars. and the professor is welcoming, nice, and brilliant.",
    "I would recommend this class for the reading material with the caveat that it is a \"seminar\" taught like a lecture. If you can't focus for a two-hour lecture (and you probably can't), this course will pose challenges for you.It is best to take this course if you feel you have a strong background in both physics and philosophy. Don't take this course casually.What you will think about during this course is really interesting stuff.",
    "This course receives a wholehearted recommendation.",
    "Take it, but be prepared to paddle upstream if you don't know a lot of physics.",
    "TAKE IT! Especially if you are a philosophy student-- it is 1) a philosophy class 2)fills the metaphysics\/ epistemology distribution requirement and 3) is a science credit. It is too perfect for a philosophy major, basically.",
    "This course is a mind-bender. It actually explores a pretty focused set of ideas, but then it's a philosophy course so there's a lot to explore. Unusually for a philosophy course, you can choose to answer questions (which pretty much ask you to recap what was said in seminar and in the readings without much original thought) or traditional philosophy papers for the assessments.",
    "This course investigates the question of how we can explain macroscopic asymmetries in time - especially the asymmetry of entropy - given that the fundamental laws of physics do not seem to be asymmetric in time. It is a course of considerable philosophical interest, trying to understand how our everyday macroscopic experience relates to the picture of the world given by physics. The course is more of a philosophy course than a physics course - one must understand physics concepts, but there are no actual math problems or equations to be worked through.",
    "if you are a philosophy major, i think this is a great way to fulfill a science credit. that being said, it's pretty challenging stuff. i got headaches the first few seminars trying to get every little detail. but really, you only need the main concepts to succeed in the class",
    "This class is a lot of fun, and you learn a lot about the topic. A strong background in physics isn't necessary, though it is helpful. I recommend it to anyone who likes physics and philosophy.",
    "Take this course if you are interested in time, but also have a strong philosophy or physics background. This course is technical, so you will need to have some relevant prior academic experience. If you do, then you will find the seminar content among the most - if not the most - interesting you have encountered at Yale. Also, you get to be taught by Professor North, one of the leaders of the field.I would not recommend taking this course simply because you think that time, as a subject matter, sounds 'cool.'Rather, you should have a genuine, mature academic interest in the material - else you will be left way behind.Finally, note that this course is graded strictly.",
    "Wonderful! Jill North was very insightful, the questioned asked in class were amazing, and the class was wonderful all around. The topics and papers were great, well more than great, and I liked that I had the ability to focus on the math and physics of the time-asymmetry topics. WONDERFUL! A MUST TAKE! This type of course is EXACTLY what I came to Yale for!!!!!!!!!",
    "I would definitely recommend this class! Not a huge workload (which is nice) but I learned about whole realms of study that I had not even known existed. The discussion is pretty science-heavy, which appealed to me since I'm a physics major, so I wouldn't say it's a gut science credit -- this stuff really makes you think! And Professor North is superb, especially at leading discussions. Great class!",
    "You should take this class if you have any interest at all in the interaction between philosophy and physics.",
    "Jill North is a great professor, but this class wasn't as fun as Philosophy of Physics for me. Talking about ALL of physics for a semester is interesting, but just talking about time, and particularly the Direction of time, gets stale pretty quickly. The questions that are posed for each class period are somewhat poorly stated (maybe I should expect this from a philosophy class?) and we spent most of the class period trying to clarify what the topic of discussion actually was. That said, this wasn't a great class for stimulating discussion. North lectures for about the first half of the period, too, which may be good or bad for you. Also, the class work is very straightforward, and if you select the takehome midterm\/takehome final you should be able to get an A by regurgitating from the readings. Anyway, if this is a genuinely interesting topic for you, by all means take the class."
