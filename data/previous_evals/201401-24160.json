    "It is very surface level and extremely ideological. I was really disappointed.",
    "Great course. Very relevant and engaging. Projects were creative and fun, and class discussions were engaging. I appreciate the 5 minute breaks each class to stretch and refresh. Not many professors do this!",
    "Very good overview course on health of women and children in the United States, including the history of MCH. I think the course covers all the MCH topics very well.",
    "It's a great class on a great topic. It was interesting and fun, and I felt like I actually learned a lot. This was my favorite course this semester and I am not a policy or SBS student, I think that says a lot.",
    "strengths: learn a lot of background on Medicaid, few interesting things about maternal careweakness: instructor is absolutely terrible - does not care about studnts' concerns, can appear to intentionally wish to bring students down; goes out of her way to screw students over (pardon the language, but i absolutely mean it) - also is very quick to violate student's privacy; very very very unfortunate that a prominent institution like YSPH would employ someone who is this horrid.another weakness - absolutely no need for a final exam that is so deliberately challenging, instructor clearly has no idea how to write multiple choice exams",
    "It was ok, very informative lectures, but exam was almost impossible to study for and the writing assignments were incongruous with a grad school class. Requesting policy briefs and memo writing would have been more useful.",
    "This was a great course; I'm so glad I was able to take it before graduating. I particularly liked the last part of the course where we discussed advocacy and federal policy-making.",
    "Long time to be lectured at. Readings are not required. Only a few of the classes are required. Very easy course, except she was a very harsh grader on the final exam. The material can be very tedious and the detailed medical breakdowns of health problems are a bit too much for a policy class.",
    "strengths:-interesting topic matter-development of a practical skill set (e.g. testimony writing)weaknesses:-a little lackluster-seemed less integrated with other courses",
    "The final exam did not reflect the material we learned over the course of the semester - it was way too focused on minutia detail.",
    "I felt that the course was not what I expected it to be. The lectures were not engaging and felt a bit boring.",
    "Very useful course for anyone who is interested in the field of maternal and child health."

   "comments": [
    "Instructor: Mary Alice Lee \u00a0She cares about the policies but had tunnel vision. I felt like she had taught using the same slides for a long time.",
    "Instructor: Mary Alice Lee \u00a0Mary Alice is a great professor who creates a fun learning environment. Her classes typically include slides but she doesn't just stand up and lecture. Discussions are organic and engaging.",
    "Instructor: Mary Alice Lee \u00a0Professor Lee's experience as both a nurse and a policy-maker gives her an excellent ability to teach the course. She is very knowledgable and able to draw from her experience as a clinician and policy-maker, which I particularly appreciated since professors at YSPH overwhelmingly come from a research background.",
    "Instructor: Mary Alice Lee \u00a0She is wonderful! She is extremely knowledgeable and approachable and just so passionate about women and children's health. She has such a great background and can speak on many, many topics. You can just tell she loves this and her enthusiasm is contagious. Her assignments are fun and she has super fast turn around.",
    "Instructor: Mary Alice Lee \u00a0please see above comments re weaknesses. one of the worst professors at YSPH.instructor expects preparation of a testimony for a maternal\/child health federal program, yet gives us no direction on how to write one. passes around a few paper copies of sample testimonies in class, but that is it. yet has the nerve to be unnecessarily critical when reviewing your work.instructor is alsovery very condescending. not sure where this comes from. she obviously is well accomplished and educated as she for sure is the Medicaid Expert. no need for arrogance, especially when you should know that the students that you teach may also be well educated as well.",
    "Instructor: Mary Alice Lee \u00a0Mary Alice is a really great instructor. She's also a practitioner, so she's able to supplement what we're learning with real-world examples. I also liked how the assignments gave us a chance to work on something that we might be asked to do in a real world situation.",
    "Instructor: Mary Alice Lee \u00a0Mary Alice is a very sweet lady and very clearly an expert in a particular area (women's health). I do, however, wish that she was a little more understanding (or aware) of the way that YSPH works (i.e. utilization of classesv2) and a little more connected with students (more difficult since she is rarely on campus which is understandable). I think her teaching style could be improved by incorporating much more discussion and less lecture, specifically with a decreased emphasis on exact numbers, measurements, and definitions. While important, it is harder to be engaged when the material is presented in a \"here is a bunch of information, write it down and you will be tested later\" sort of way. I also think incorporation of more guest lecturers could be interesting.",
    "Instructor: Mary Alice Lee \u00a0I felt that she was not responsive to the student's needs. She did not seem open to wanting to help the students improve or at least in my experience with her. I hope that in the future she makes more of an effort to really reach out to the students and provide assistance on the assignments, which can be a bit confusing."

   "comments": [
    "I would not recommend it to another student unless they had absolutely no knowledge of health policy. It was not at all intellectually challenging and there was very little discussion about what could have been extremely interesting topics.",
    "Great class for those interested in on the ground\/real-world women and child health initiatives. This is a refreshing course that allows you to escape stuffy textbook theories for a bit.",
    "Great overview course in MCH health in the United States and also provides a good comparison for MCH in other OECD countries.",
    "Take it! It's fun, not a lot of work, and you will learn a lot. Women and children's health is so fundamental to almost all aspects of public health, I would fully and whole-heartedly recommend this course to any student at YSPH.",
    "just dont take it. absolute waste of time. slides are boring, nothing interesting in class, take a class that will actually teach you something. most interesting thing we did was watch a video about a few women who have no concept (or care) at all about the needs of newborns and wholeheartedly endorse the tub birth experience.",
    "If you are going to take it, really pay attention to specific details from lecture and slides, make flashcards. Understanding programming or broad themes isn't enough.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student, even if they aren't explicitly interested in Women and Children's Health. The topics are very relevant for anyone interested in health policy.",
    "I would probably only recommend this course to a student who is really interesting in learning more about the health of women. The policy component is not something that I think you could not get from another policy course.",
    "I would not recommend this course to a fellow student because I did not feel like I learned much from it."
