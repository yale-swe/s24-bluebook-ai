    "The best class I've ever taken at Yale. The material you learn is actually useful in life.",
    "YES TAKE THIS. You'll learn so much about your own emotional intelligence, how to improve it, how it's been researched, and how it affects our schooling. Not too difficult, and really interesting subject material. Plus, Marc Brackett is awesome. You'll definitely either really like him or really won't, but it's worth going to the first two lectures at least to get a feel for him as a lecturer. Moral: Take this class.",
    "Want a class that's actually relevant to your life? Want to take a class with an incredible human? Even if no, definitely take this class!",
    "Highly recommend, interesting, applicable to your own life, and straightforward exams",
    "It's an okay class to take if you're interested in assessing your own emotional intelligence.",
    "This is a class where you can learn to be more emotionally intelligent: you learn about the field and you also learn about yourself. Would recommend.",
    "This class is important and relevant to anyone not just psych or ed studies majors or people who like sharing their feelings. I would absolutely recommend this class to other students. It was fun, you learn a lot, and not a lot of work.",
    "An overview of the field of emotional intelligence, as well as a course that teaches the skills of emotion management.",
    "Take this! You'll understand yourself better and improve your life. Plus, if you're interested in teaching, this will revolutionize how you look at your classroom.",
    "Emotional Intelligence--sounds interesting? Yeah I thought so too. DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS. You learn nothing. The whole class is about Marc Brackett promoting his RULER Program--a program to improve EI in K-12 schools. You really don't learn much about emotion regulation and how to use your emotions in a positive way--we skim the surface of those topics but there isn't much emphasis beyond that. The first half of the course was about the history of EI and some general information about EI but then the second half of the course was all about how the RULER program he invented is important. The second part was so boring. It was all self-promotion. Brackett doesn't seem to care about students--he takes about a month to respond to emails and can be quite arrogant.",
    "Not a bad class for a 9am. It's not much work, but you should do the readings because they come up on the exams. I'm glad I took this class because the information you learn is really helpful and eye-opening.",
    "The best course I've ever taken at Yale. It was highly interactive and engaging. I can never get up early in the morning, but I got up for this class.",
    "The first third of the course I really enjoyed. However, the last two-thirds was extremely self-referential. I feel as if Professor Brackett placed a disproportionate amount of emphasis upon his own work and didn't really acknowledge that the field of SEL extended beyond his work. The readings were interesting and not too overwhelming. In terms of assignments, three tests and a paper, the course was extremely manageable.",
    "Super-easy and fascinating introduction to Emotional Intelligence. Brackett is hilarious and the content is engaging. Great way to start your life at Yale and consider emotions as a part of your holistic wellbeing practices.",
    "A course in which you will learn emotion strategies which will help with managing the rest of your life at Yale.",
    "YES!",
    "TAKE THIS COURSE! I know it probably sounds useless or gutty, but it isn't at all. Marc explains the material in a very straightforward way, but still underlines the importance of what this course is teaching. Emotional intelligence is absolutely huge to be a successful, functioning human being, from everything to improved academic performance to relationship quality. Basically, 10\/10 would recommend. Take it. Add it to your worksheet now. Stop waiting. Marc is worth the 9:25 class.",
    "Great class! The topic is super interesting and important, especially at a high pressure campus like Yale. Professor Brackett is funny and engaging. He's open to answering any questions you have about the course\/assignments\/EI in general. He really tries to make the class less stressful.",
    "This is the single best class I have taken at Yale. Brackett is a natural born lecturer and his purpose is only in teaching students the importance of EI. Grades are secondary and he will make that clear. That being said, the workload is not intense, but lecture attendance is mandatory.",
    "The best class that you could ever take at Yale. Three exams with a decent amount of reading for each. However, I was not only energized, but also motivated by this course every single monday and wednesday. A MUST take!",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone! You will learn a lot about how to understand and regulate your own emotions and recognize them in others. Professor Brackett is the best lecturer I've had in five semesters at Yale--engaging, funny, coherent. The course is accessible but not \"gutty.\" You will have to go to lectures, as attendance is taken. If you pay attention in the lectures and study the slides (publicly posted) + skim the readings for main points for a few hours in the days before the exams, you should have no trouble getting As or A-s. The paper is not too onerous (10 pages) and is on a topic entirely of your choice. In return for this reasonable amount of effort, you learn quite a bit--the material is easily accessible to pretty much everyone.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS!!",
    "I would absolutely recommend Emotional Intelligence to other Yalies! I am not a psych\/education studies major and this is actually my first \"psych\" course, and it is definitely a keeper!",
    "I agree with Professor Brackett that all students should take this class. EI is important in life (as you'll hopefully learn).",
    "Emotional Intelligence was a GREAT course. Seriously, take it. Pretty much everything I learned in this class, I applied to my own life. This was a really tough semester for me in a lot of ways, and I honestly don't think I would have handled it half as well if I didn't have this class guiding the way I dealt with a lot of crazy emotions. Professor Brackett is clearly passionate about getting emotional intelligence widely recognized and taken seriously so it can be implemented in every school in the country, and it's cool to know that you're a part of this \"emotion revolution.\" You get to do a lot of fun activities in class and take tests that measure your own Emotional Intelligence, which is fun and could be surprising. The exams aren't too difficult and you have a lot of time to work on the final paper as well as a lot of flexibility with your topic. Take this class!!",
    "Emotional Intelligence is a very good class, I recommend it to all students. It will open your eyes to a new way of thinking. The information you learn you can accept or not. Some students may not like Professor Bracketts humor and some may love it.",
    "Emotional Intelligence is a completely necessary course for everyone regardless of their major. It applies to everyone's life and is beneficial for your overall well-being. I constantly found myself talking about this class to friends and family.",
    "Yes. It's an interesting class on a topic that you'll never cover anywhere else.",
    "This class will teach you skills you can actually use in your own life. I felt that what I learned about emotional intelligence helped me grow as a person and better manage my stress levels. There isn't much reading, and although the exams are very thorough and a little challenging, if you review the readings\/powerpoints in the days leading up to the exam (don't do it the night before, I practically died), then you should do well. He also gives extra credit throughout the semester and on exams, which really helps in relieving test anxiety. Overall, I enjoyed the class (though his anecdotes sometimes made me feel a little uneasy because they were a bit judgmental) and I'd recommend it because I feel that I grew as a person because of it.",
    "Everyone should take this course! Professor Brackett is wonderfull, and it was so worth waking up in the morning to go to his lecture. The course material is very interesting and very applicable to everyday life. It is not an easy course, but not super difficult, and the evaluations are fair. This course is definitely one that sticks with you even after all the tests and papers are done.",
    "I would recommend it as an interesting and low pressure class. If you don't take it to seriously you can coast by. If you do, you might really learn how to improve your emotional life which is probably more important than all the rest of your classes put together.",
    "Take this class!!!! Coolest class I've taken at Yale by far, and undoubtedly applicable to all aspects of life. It really made me more emotionally intelligent, and able to deal with setbacks and other emotional experiences a lot better. Everyone should take this!! The exams were a bit harder than expected, but if you study and do the readings, you'll be fine.",
    "I would highly recommend this class to everyone, regardless of their background in psych or education studies. It was by far one of the best classes I've taken at Yale. Professor Brackett's energy and lectures are highlights of the course. I learned a great deal about the theory and application of these skills, as well as my own strengths and weaknesses.",
    "This class was incredible. It has been my most favorite class I've taken at Yale so far. It is so applicable to every aspect of life and really improves your emotional intelligence and awareness. Professor Brackett is an incredible lecturerer and he makes the class seem like a seminar. I was so excited to go to every lecture and it went by so fast.",
    "This class is good for the soul and will provide you with actual life skills to make you a better person. The tests are difficult. Take this class.",
    "The class was really laid back, and I got to use what I learned in it to become more conscious and improve myself.",
    "Highly recommend. Presents an unorthodox topic, which many would not think of as important, and shows how crucial it is in daily life. Also gives tools to improve one's emotional intelligence, which could be helpful for many college students.",
    "Emotional Intelligence was a safe, easy course. It lost its novelty halfway through, but with different focusing techniques demonstrated in class, it was still a great way to start the day. Definitely shop before signing on, as Marc Brackett's teaching may not be for everyone. Minimal work, personal benefits - a good fifth course. If you are interested in cognitive science, psychology, or neuroscience\/biology, there are definitely better courses to take (The Human Brain and The Cognitive Science of Language are both great ones).",
    "YES! Take this class, even if it isnt in your major. The lessons are very applicable to life and it is very interesting to learn about Emotional Intelligence!",
    "I loved this course. Even though it was at 9am, I was always engaged and looked forward to coming. I think it was a fair amount of work and reading, and Professor Brackett did a great job of keeping the students interested. A weakness was sometimes it felt like we were learning the same thing over and over again. I wish there was more applicability or ways to teach the tools he grazed over in a more tangible way. Professor Brackett's stories were hilarious and kept people wanting to attend lecture. 3 exams that are very straightforward, a lot of extra credit, and a paper. You also learn a lot about yourself and how to act in certain situations and improve your emotional intelligence.",
    "Pretty easy course except for a few difficult exams. It was very early in the morning which is difficult but the material itself was pretty interesting.",
    "Yes I would recommend Emotional Intelligence to another student. This class is very interesting and fun to go to with a great professor. It also teaches you skills to understand and deal with your emotions more effectively which can be useful in everyday life.",
    "yes, i would recommend it. It was kind of like going to therapy twice a week. It was relaxed and I learned a lot about how to be healthier emotionally, especially in terms of dealing with stress. It wasn't a lot of work, which was nice, and it seemed to be graded pretty fairly. Marc is pretty cool. He knows Lady Gaga. It was a good fifth class.",
    "This course is an overview of \"why emotions matter\", what emotions really are, and applications of the field of emotional intelligence. I would recommend this class to another student because it was interesting and practical. Most of the course was based on real, current studies and there was an introspective portion of the class which allowed us to apply what we learned to our personal lives.",
    "This class is a thorough and interesting overview of Emotional Intelligence including its applications to education as well as the individual lives of students. I would recommend it to someone looking for a fairly laid-back class that is extremely applicable to real life. I would not recommend it to someone looking for a rigorous course in education.",
    "fantastic course, take it take it! You will leave understanding yourself much better, the kind of person you want to be, and strategies to get there. The most relevant and actionable class I've taken at Yale by far. Prof Brackett is also fantastic and even assures that some of the more theoretical material, which could get boring, remains interesting. Exams are fair and Prof gives you ample opportunities for bonus points towards your final grade if you stay engaged with the material.",
    "yep, I would recommend the course wholeheartedly. enjoyable, teaches real-life skills,",
    "I would definitely recommend this course! The subject matter is incredibly interesting and useful in daily life as well as in future studies. Lectures are extremely interactive and interesting. This was an amazing course!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. The material was very interesting and applied directly to the real world. The class taught me various things about emotion that should help me succeed in the future. I really felt that I learned a lot. In addition, the lecture had a relaxed atmosphere that made the material fun to learn.",
    "this class is a MUST for EVERYONE (not just psych or EDST majors). emotional intelligence is so important and will really impact your life. it's the kind of lecture where you will be discussing the material outside of class because it is so applicable. Professor Brackett is fantastic.",
    "Take this class! It will teach you so much about yourself and the potential of emotional intelligence. It was an incredible class and you will enjoy every lecture! Such an interesting subject and it's going to change the world.",
    "This class is very helpful for personal self-improvement. I think it is valuable in that sense. The focus is on Brackett's system for the implementation of emotional intelligence training in schools, which he developed. There is quite a lot of information to memorise for each exam but overall very interesting (not to mention useful) and the reading load is very manageable indeed. Brackett uses a lot of personal anecdotes.",
    "This course is an incredible and eye opening look into the study of emotional intelligence. You learn why emotions really matter and see that they affect so much of what we do every day. Along the way you become much more aware of your own emotions, and learn to integrate these emotional intelligence skills in your own life. Absolutely every student would benefit from this course, and I highly recommend it!!!",
    "I would recommend the course as I learned a lot.",
    "Highly recommend",
    "AMAZING YES TAKE IT, especially if you've never taken a psych class before. If you have, then it would be fun to audit this class because really the best part was the lectures and Marc's outfits. I also really liked the final project.",
    "Interesting class, fun teacher, I say take it.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student. But remember this class is what you put into it. It's definitely one of the easier, at the same time interesting classes offered here. You could not show up and still get a decent grade.",
    "I would recommend because of the content. If the fellow student could get annoyed by a professor's lecture style, especially the anecdotes and lack of discussion of research, I would not recommend it.",
    "EDST 150 is by far the worst class I have taken at Yale. Professor Brackett makes class completely uncomfortable. He asks students to answer personal questions in front of the whole class. The material is complete pseudo-science."
