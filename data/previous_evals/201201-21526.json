   "comments": [
    "French 140 is a course that is a transition from the grammar heavy 130 to the reading heavy 150. The stories you read are interesting and engaging and the class time is great SO LONG AS YOU HAVE A GOOD TEACHER. You have tests biweekly that never require more than a night of studying.",
    "Expect to discuss and discuss and discuss and not really understand the grammar. If you like to talk, this class is for you. If not, you're gonna hate it.",
    "I don't like language classes in general, but as far as they go, this one is pretty excellent. In comparison to 140, it is structured differently, because we read a lot of short stories. At the end of the semester, you read Un sac de Billes, which is really long and means an unmanageable amount of reading each night. Other than that, it is really good.",
    "French 140 was fantastic. It allowed me to expand my grasp on the French language, and in particular helped me become accustomed to a number of different accents through the nature of the small dialogue with students of various French backgrounds.",
    "I'd recommend this course especially for people who want better reading skills, because it looked like this was the focus of the course.",
    "It's fine if you have to take it. A lot of obscure grammar and little speaking\/pronunciation, but if you need it for a language credit it's definitely not too bad. Get Annabel Kim if you can!",
    "It is mostly a course focused on grammar and speaking. But be prepared to learn the grammar on your own.",
    "Absolutely! Nice blend of literature and grammar. I hated the Barson text -- it seemed extremely poorly suited to the grammar we learned, and I resented having bought it given how little we used it. (And also how unhelpful it was. The coursepack was much clearer and more relevant to the assignments.) But that's a super small quibble."
