    "Interesting overview of modernist poetry in America with a heavy emphasis on the African-American tradition. It is likely that you won't like many of the poems, but they are all interesting for academic discussion.",
    "I'd absolutely recommend this class to anyone interested in literature, African-American studies, post-World-War-I sentiments, or any combination of the three. For the course, we spent most of our time reading poetry excerpts in preparation for in-class analysis. There were only three major essays in addition to six 500-word blog posts, so the reading is the heaviest part of the course.",
    "Modern Poetry is a fantastic seminar. Professor Reed infused the course with a level of argument, bridging the gapbetween poets typically considered \"modern\" and those typically considered \"African-American.\" Though scholars of literature often divide their work along racial lines, Professor Reed created a syllabus that departs from such dated views of literature. As a result, this is more than your typical \"[time period]Poetry\" course.Despite its unconventional and innovative approach to poetry, the class was far from disorganized: the readings interacted with one another in fascinating ways, and gave a careful survey of the issues at stake in modernist poetry. I feel comfortable picking up a poem from the modern era, even one written by a poet other than the ones we studied, and being able to identify major thematic concerns.As far as workload, this class is very manageable, and the assignments are graded extremely fairly. If you work hard and do a good job, your grades will show it. Additionally, Professor Reed provides very thoughtful feedback that is genuinely useful. Rather than simply tell students they could have \"pushed their arguments further,\" he will provide ways they could have done so or ways they could have strengthened their existing arguments.His approach in seminar is very skillful: letting students raise their main questions, ideas or concerns about the reading and letting discussion flow from there. As a result, there was never the awkward problem of professors and students failing to meet one another on the same intellectual plane; instead, the discussion was adequate for students and the professor. Few professors are able to guide a seminar as well, and Professor Reed responded phenomenally to the instances when students were caught incapable of analyzing a particularly difficult poem or poet, and tried to scale back the level of his questions accordingly."
