    "You learn a lot of techniques and build your own creative sculpture",
    "Julian was very chill and helpful and the class gave you a lot of room to develop your ideas independently. At time I wished that we had more directions and structure though. I didn't feel that I was comfortable and familiar enough with the material and the tools to be able to play with my ideas as freely as the class would have otherwise allowed. I also wished that I had focused a little more in terms of developing my ideas with the three projects. A semester is so short for any art classes and I feel that I would have benefited more if I just dug deep with one idea.",
    "Definitely take it if you're interested in working with wood in particular! We do three big projects throughout the semester, and learn a lot of things hands-on. We get a lot of time to work in-class, but you are also expected to come into the wood shop on your own time to finish your projects. Overall a good class--I would recommend it!",
    "I went into this class without any background in sculpture and was initially rather anxious about it. As with learning any new skill, time and practice is definitely required, but the class does a great job of easing people into the workshop and equips you with a basic set of skills to explore sculpture with. For students looking to explore more formal or theoretical aspects of sculpture, I think that this class does not disappoint. We went into far more theoretical discussions about sculpture and art than I had initially expected from the class. It was also a pleasant surprise to see how smoothly class critiques moved from practical discussions about woodworking techniques to conversations about Art, with a capital \"A\".",
    "ART120 was a very fun, really rewarding class. The assignments were generally very open-ended, which allowed us to experiment with what we wanted and to each pursue our own interests. Overall there were 3 main assignments plus one small one at the start of the course."
