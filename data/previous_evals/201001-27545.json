    "Yes, I'd definitely recommend this! It was my most time-consuming class, and I really recommend budgeting your time carefully if you choose to take this class. It paid off, though, and it was a lot of fun.",
    "I would say that this class is for those who want ART major for sure and who want to spend at least 5 hours of thursdays or tuesdays painting. I do not recommend this class for non-ART majors.",
    "It's a lot of work--depending on who your teacher is.",
    "take it if you have homework time to dedicate to it, that was my real problem, i really liked learning how to paint and improved a lot, just wish there wasnt homework",
    "I really loved this course. I would not recommend Keltie's section for a student looking for a breezy fun painting class, or for someone who isn't going to put in time and effort to improve. When you work hard on your paintings, you will find that this is a creativity-enhancing and mind-expanding course that's different from the usual offerings. I loved having the studio time built into my class schedule. And I loved how this course taught me to think about making paintings, encouraging me to make more interesting paintings on a larger scale than I had made in the past. Keltie is also a very fun teacher who is interested in pushing you hard and addressing your personal interests, strengths and challenges as a painter.",
    "Will certainly help you grow as a painter, but a lot lot lot of work if you want to truly take advantage of it.",
    "If you want to learn how to paint, take it. Beware! It is fun and liberating but very time consuming.",
    "yes. I loved this class. It was a ton of fun. Even though I didn't feel like I was an especially strong artist when i stared I felt like I was able to keep up and that they found ways to really teach how to paint in a way that was fun and possible for people who don't have experience in art."
