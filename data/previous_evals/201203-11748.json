   "comments": [
    "Take the class if you like to sing and want to get better at singing, especially in front of peers.",
    "I would definitely take this course. It's a low-stress way of practicing singing in front of your peers. You learn an incredible amount about performance, singing, music history, and have a lot of fun along the way. If you are at all interested in singing, I would highly recommend this course.",
    "The class is great for anyone who wants to learn a bunch of songs and get feedback on musical interpretation and performance. In class we talked about the evolution of the genres we were studying, and then performed for each other each week to get experience. There is also a weekly coaching with Sarah Kohane, who is wonderful to work with.",
    "Yes, yes, yes. Even if you don't have a lot of experience singing this genre of music, Prof. Lalli is super encouraging, and you will learn lots.",
    "Music 222 is one of the best classes I've taken at Yale. I am absolutely not a music major, but this was a wonderful class. I feel like I really improved as a singer, and thoroughly enjoyed doing so with Professor Lalli. It is not very much work, but very rewarding if you put some time in to practicing and improving in coachings.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in learning a little more about the specific genres of music covered in the course (be sure to ask as this changes from semester to semester) and who would like to add a few new songs to their repertoire and really get over stage fright and in fact build stage presence and learn how to be expressive through music. Professor Lalli is great at giving advice on stylistic choices and how to be expressive and Sarah is wonderful with pronunciation and breath allocation. Don't expect to get too much advice about improving vocal technique though. This is not a replacement for voice lessons.",
    "On the one hand, having to sing in front of the rest of the class every week was very effective in helping me overcome my anxiety about singing solo in public, and the one-on-one coachings with Sarah were very helpful in improving my technique. However, it was often a little boring to sit around for 2 hours and listen to other people sing for all of that time with very little interaction from the rest of the class, and the written assignments are sometimes disorganized, but never difficult."
