    "I would recommend this class to anyone who wants to learn portuguese. It is a typical language class with a little more focus on Brazilian culture, and is not too focused on vocab memorization, which is great.",
    "Decent amount of work but not too difficult. Would recommend.",
    "Becuase it's still beginners, grammar is discussed for the majority of the class.",
    "Great intro course if you have experience with a Romance language. If you don't, I could imagine this would be pretty tough because the textbook moves pretty quickly. Low workload, and Brazil is really cool would highly recommend this for a language credit."
