   "comments": [
    "Broad economic theory class",
    "Definitely take it.",
    "Take this course if you are interested in social theory, but be warned that there really ins't any critique of capitalism (except for Marx). So you pretty much just learn about capitalism. Also if you are taking Econ at the same time or before you take this, the principles from microeconomics (especially on firm theory) really help.",
    "I'd summarize MGT697 as a deeply interesting and objective look at the strengths and weaknesses of capitalism as an economic and social system, especially with relevance to the developed world. I would highly recommend it to a fellow student.",
    "I very much enjoyed this course. Take it if you can. Prof. Rae is one of the better lecturers I have ever had. You will learn something every lecture, and whatever your ideological convictions may be before or after the course, you will come out of the course with a deeper understanding of capitalism, its power, and its limitations--an understanding that is the responsibility of an educated citizen. This course will stay with me for very many years. Do not hesitate. Take this course. Just do it.",
    "Capitalism is a great 5th class with minimal work. Lecture can be frustratingly boring, but it's important to pay attention because the midterm and final will test exactly what was discussed during class. You definitely don't have to do the readings to do well in the class, but they are awesome, enriching and very do-able. I would definitely take the class as a straightforward overview of Capitalism, its history, and its opponents.",
    "One of the best courses I've taken in my four years as an undergraduate student at Yale; seems to be a great primer for business school; course is expertly designed and executed by Professor Rae; the TF's are always helpful and contribute into the lively class discussion (which can sometimes be difficult to pull off in a large lecture course, but they do it here); Professor Rae is able to tie in many current events into the covered topics to may the course seem especially relevant (which, of course, it is); overall, great experience and definitely a course to recommend to others",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. You will think about markets differently. The class is very dynamic and I always looked forward to it.",
    "This course is good if you want a better understanding of why capitalism is good and how to defend it from critics. If you are looking to tear down the system because you think capitalism is evil, this course may prove you wrong.",
    "It was a decent course. I thought it would be amazing, but definitely still learned a bit.",
    "An interesting but very scattered coverage of capitalism and different concepts inherent in its success or failure. Definitely some cool topics but the lectures are fairly unorganized and I often left wondering what exactly I was supposed to have gained, plus the slides are generally only pictures making it difficult to review them and come up with a coherent narrative. Professor Rae is very engaging but can possibly open things up too much to class discussion at the expense of actually covering the topic he initially plans on covering. It's pretty easy workload-wise, with two short memos to write (out of 5-7 opportunities) plus a midterm quiz and a heavily weighted final, so it's not a bad easy 5th class if you want to take something at SOM, but I wasn't impressed with it overall and would not recommend it unless you are really interested in the specific topics covered in the syllabus.",
    "Take it if you want a substantially laid back ride through how this capitalist society and its institutions (corporations, shareholders, the gov) came to be how it is today. Do not expect a chance to rigorously criticize or engage with these institutions.",
    "Capitalism and Its Critics is an intriguing survey of the political and economic system currently running our globalized world. It covers vast and interesting topics in varying depth, and I highly recommend taking it.",
    "I would surely recommend this course to other undergraduate students. This course gives a broad overview of how\/when capitalism succeeds or, possibly, fails. Seeing as so much of our lives is influenced by this economic system, students should take this course to develop a more nuanced opinion on capitalism.",
    "It's a pretty good lecture course. I would recommend it. Although, be aware that the lectures can be rambling\/ unstructured, at times, just a flow of ideas. This was frustrating at times, but if you go into the course anticipating this, it'll be more tolerable.",
    "FANTASTIC COURSE. Interesting material, Prof Rae does a great job of engaging students in class discussion, and the workload is very manageable. Highly recommended, especially for those with a penchant for business!",
    "A solid class. Professor Rae is a great lecturer and I feel like I actually learned a lot. The class is a mix of SOM students and undergrads. I liked the format of the midterm and final. Also, there are 2 memo assignments but you can choose out of 5 or 6 options spread out over the semester. It really didn't end up being too much work and I enjoyed the class. I would recommend it to other students."
