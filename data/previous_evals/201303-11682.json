    "Must take course, if you can get in. If not, still take the time to get to know Papachristos- he's awesome! Chill sociology class about neighborhood change, the underground economy, and neighborhood effect. The class has a cool structure in which you pick a neighborhood as your semester case study.",
    "A fantastic course, probably one of the best I've taken at Yale. I wish it were two semesters. Professor Papachristos is one of the coolest professors I've ever had. If you're at all interested in cities, policing, racism, etc. Take this class. The workload is light and the readings are fascinating. Admission was competative my year, but it can't hurt to try.",
    "Neighborhoods and Crime is an awesome class for anyone interested in cities and sociology. The assignments are interesting and not particularly burdensome, so the course has a relaxed feel. It was one of the most engaged groups of students I've had in a class at Yale. Professor Papachristos is absolutely wonderful, and everyone should take the opportunity to have a class with him if possible.",
    "Neighborhoods and Crime is a great course that really teaches you to think about what a neighborhood means and what it means to live in a neighborhood. You talk about topics like neighborhood effects, concentrated disadvantage, social control and collective efficacy, culture and codes, andphysical vs social space. Professor Paapchristos is very \"chill,\" and he makes the class all the more interesting and relevant, although there is a tendency to stray away from the main topic. The discussions are very engaging, and the readings are even better. Also, the neighborhood case study that you work on throughout the semester is a great way to get outside of the Yale Bubble.",
    "Neighborhoods and Crime is a great class. Professor Papachristos is a really cool, accomplished guy and classes are really fun and engaging. The workload is manageable and the final project, the neighborhood case study, is really fulfilling and easier to write since the assignments for the class help in the writing process throughout.",
    "Take this for Papachristos. He's the man, the literature is chill, and the neighborhood project is awesome. Really a fun seminar.",
    "Best class ever. You'll learn so much about how neighborhoods work and you'll get a chance to really get to know New Haven (if you choose, some people chose neighborhoods elsewhere). The assignments take some time - you actually have to go into a neighborhood, and meet people - but nothing ever feels like busy work and it is all directly applicable to your final project\/general knowledge of the neighborhood. Take it if you can - you won't regret!",
    "Absolutely take it (if you can get in)! This class is the perfect mix of having fun and learning a lot. We got to review the most prominent literature on neighborhoods and crime, which were all worth reading. The assignments, which lead up to the final paper, are all straight-forward and allow you to learn about a New Haven neighborhood. Also, Professor Papachristos is the coolest and he really knows his stuff.",
    "Papachristos is dynamic and lots of fun, recounting many (mostly) relevant anecdotes. Still, you learn a lot from him and from the reading. Topics are broad and covered relatively shallowly. Some of the topics include policing, gangs, broken windows, social disorganization theory, etc. The class can get a little repetitive, but that is really only a minor problem. No reason not to take it. It's easy, fun, and intellectually engaging. you have an entire semester to develop your project, so start early and make it really cool: Papachristos will help you along the way.",
    "I recommend the course to students if they are interested in learning about crime at the neighborhood level. The final project is fun as long as you find a neighborhood that truly interests you and can help you question a theme\/hypothesis\/claim that you will come across in the class readings.",
    "Yes. It will give you a nuanced understanding of crime and the problems of urban poverty that few people have. The world would be a much better place if our municipal and police leaders took this class. Also, Papachristos is the man.",
    "Seminar on a broad range of topics relating to neighborhoods and crime, including broken windows theory, collective efficacy, gentrification, gangs, etc. I've never seen someone as into gangs and sociology as Professor Papachristos, and I couldn't recommend the class higher.",
    "Really interesting and enjoyable. Papachristos is great, the readings are great, and class time is great. There are assignments roughly every other week but it wasn't a stressful workload and they all help you prepare for the final paper. One of my favorite classes at Yale."
