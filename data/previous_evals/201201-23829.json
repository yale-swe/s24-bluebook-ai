   "comments": [
    "Really great class. I learnt a significant amount in a short space of time. Extremely well organized. Themes from week to week were all nicely linked together.",
    "The course was interesting and thought provoking though the style of class made it easy to become disengaged. A more discussion based classroom could provoke more class participation.",
    "Strengths: The class was well organized and it was nice that it wasn't a large lecture class.Weaknesses: There is no room to develop research skills in areas that are of personal interest to students as the projects are so specific and structured. There needs to be flexibility to allow for more learning. The class was very repetitive of HPA 510 (although a millions times better) so I'm not clear why both 510 and 514 are required for HPA students.",
    "Strengths: The class provided a solid theoretical foundation for understanding the politics of health policy. The instructor also did a great job (and selected great readings) explaining the PPACA and the politics of health care reform. Surprisingly few HPA classes actually discuss the ACA... I think the first 3 lectures were my favorite.Weaknesses: Perhaps too much emphasis on theory -- sometimes only spending 10 minutes talking about real-life policy examples. Also - I felt the class discussions could have been improved. The instructor is incredibly interesting, but I thought the questions he posed to the class didn't really stimulate discussion--the answers often seemed obvious--as if the instructor was looking for a particular answer from an article we had read, rather than an opinion about the article.Suggestions for improvement: Perhaps a 50\/50 split on theory and application would make the class feel less abstract. It would be nice if the instructor asked questions which stimulated debate or deeper analysis. Also - the guidelines for the individual papers were incredibly complex and dense. It would have been nice to have clearer expectations on each assignment.",
    "strengths... Complex US healthcare policy making elaboratedweakness.. Extensive readings",
    "This course was not what I expected it to be. It focused much more on the American political system than I expected and less on concrete policy options. The readings were comprehensive, but also sometimes tedious and irrelevant. With much summary in class, and written assignments based on separate reading, it sometimes seemed futile to spend so much time on the reading. The classes themselves were very interesting and well structured. I wish it had been run more like a seminar, though. Participation was rather minimal and everyone seemed to want to get as far away from the board as possible. The writing assignments were very frustrating. The instructions were often too vague and the assignments themselves too expansive. I did not like the fact that we had separate readings for the assignments - it hugely increased the workload around paper writing time, and made the writing seem discongrous with the topics covered in class. I like the idea of writing a policy brief, but I wish there had been more concrete instruction on how to do so effectively, especially for those of us who had not done so before.",
    "The format of the class worked great. The mix of lecture and discussion was just right. An additional, small assignment early on would have helped in terms of getting same practice writing policy memos before starting either of the two big memo assignments.",
    "Strenghts: Lectures were extremely organized and thought provoking. Student's input in discussions was encouraged and professor had an excellent command of the classroom and material. Topics addressed in assignments (policy briefs) were challenging and a good exercise in learning.Weaknesses: Exclusive focus on domestic health policy was not as interesting to me than if more global health policy issues were incorporated to the class. While useful and informative as a learning tool, assignments (2 major policy briefs) were perhaps too all-encompassing of class material, which made them very overwhelming and difficult to complete in a way that felt like it satified the expectations of the assignment. (However, professor seemed to grade appropriately on these assignments and with a thorough explanation of the grading process.)",
    "It was amazing! I gives great background and balanced perspective on the politics surrounding the U.S. healthcare system.",
    "The course tackles a lot of substantive issues in health policy. The assignments integrate the concepts well (and are tough!).The reading list is extensive and it is regularly a challenge to keep up with the material on a weekly basis. If the curriculum can't be narrowed, one might consider groups of students presenting the readings for a specific week to the rest of the class for an additional 20% and reduce the complexities of the existing assignments somewhat.",
    "Pretty good class. Well designed syllabus, could use a little tweaking. Assignments were vague and obtuse.",
    "The structure of preliminary readings, lecture, and class discussion was very conducive to learning and created an engaging classroom environment.",
    "Great course. A little theoretical at times but very engaging overall",
    "This class was excellent. The assignments were challenging and time consuming. Classes were engaging.",
    "This class is too repetitive of the other required domestic policy oriented classes.",
    "The course gives us a very good idea of the American healthcare system and the American political system as a whole. However, I believed the assignments were a little confusing (too vague). The readings were interesting and the teacher was very engaging.",
    "excellent.",
    "Great course and definitely learned a ton. The amount of reading was very unrealistic though.",
    "Excellent course for anyone who is interested in health policy. Covers all major issues from different perspectives."

   "comments": [
    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0Clear, precise teaching style. Engages the class in meaningful conversation. Very approachable, very quick to repsond to student questions and concerns. Overall really great professor.",
    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0Obviously an expert in the field though assignments were rather cryptic. It was hard to know exactly what the end product was meant to be or do. Feedback on the first assignment was incredibly thorough and more detailed than any I have received in other classes which is much appreciated.",
    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0He is very responsive to student and he seems to be the person that is most interested in the policy students and the HPA division as a whole. He is interested in improving the course and isn't defensive about criticisms making him very approachable.Class gets a bit boring sometimes as it two hours. Maybe it could be spiced up by using more of the socratic method when just trying to get information about the readings. It was encourage more people to do the readings. Another option is a 5 minute break.",
    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0Mark is brilliant, and it is obvious in each of his lectures. I think he did a really great job of making everyone feel comfortable to speak, and he validated everyone's answers, even if they weren't the answers he was looking for.I really appreciated that he solicited our feedback halfway through the semester. I could tell he was really invested in making this a good learning experience for all of us. I also appreciated how much time and effort he put into grading our individual assignments - as well as the incredibly detailed feedback he provided.",
    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0The session sometimes tended to be vague... going all over the place.. Most times the session was well contained.. Would like the session to be more comprehensive...",
    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0Mark is a great instructor. He obviously loves both teaching and the topic. He's immensely knowledgeable, and always makes himself available to students. The lectures were well-structured and interesting. My main critique is in the framing of the assignments. I wish they had been on narrower topics, integrating into the course material more, and with more concrete instructions.",
    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0Mark has an impressive depth of knowledge in the health policy field. His lectures are cogent and effective in reinforcing material from the readings. He's also vert accessible. A great professor.",
    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0Excellent instructor - extremely knowledgeable on subject matter, provided material that resonated with discussions, receptive to students' feedback, and provided clear expectations on thecourse and outside assignments.",
    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0Amazing! Listening to his lectures is like sitting under a wise sage of chatting with your grandfather about the good ol' days. He has a thorough understanding of the nuances surrounding healthcare poliies and politics, and guided us to discover and understand these factors. He had a very systematic presentation that followed a logic that was clear and intersting.",
    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0The instructor is very experienced and an expert in his field. Both filters through in class and he was certainly the best instructor I had this term.",
    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0Impressed by his desire to be accessible to his students, and his sincere requests for feedback. A commitment to teaching that I've yet to encounter at YSPH, with the exception of Linda Niccolai.Lectures can be a little long, perhaps a little boring, but I can attribute most of that to a two hour class period and material that can sometimes be a little dense.",
    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0Mark actually managed to keep the whole class engaged during a two hour lecture, and he was always available to answer questions. He also give very open ended assignments, which were a bit difficult, but allowed the students to work creatively.",
    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0A-",
    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0Mark Schlesinger is possibly the best instructor I have ever had. Despite lecturing for almost two hours, without slides, the class was engaging, cogently presented and followed a logical pathway through the material.",
    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0Mark was very engaging and knew how to lead a class discussion. He was also able to incorporate the reading material into the discussions.",
    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0excellent. very enthusiastic for all the topics tought.",
    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0Exceptional instructor. Presents information in a very thought provoking way. Very structured in presenting the material. Enjoyed being in his class."

    "Great health policy class with a great professor. Workload is slightly more than normal, but I would definitely recommend.",
    "I took it as an elective because I was interested in the topic so I would say it was a good course.",
    "If there is an option, take this class over HPA 510. You will learn a lot more. Or if you are frustrated that you didn't learn anything in HPA 510, this will help you out.If you already have a policy background and you are in HPA, it is going to be too basic but it's required, so you don't really have an option.",
    "This class is a highly theoretical overview of the politics of health policy. I'm not sure I would recommend it to other students because of how theoretical it was. I guess it all depends on what you are looking for in your coursework.",
    "Its an OK course, not very good...",
    "I am not sure whether I would recommend this course to another student. It is an interesting overview of health politics, but no so much on the policy. I learned quite a bit about the American political machine, but that's not really what I went into the class hoping to accomplish. Mark is a great lecturer and very open to students, definitely the highlight of the course. The reading is heavy, but manageable, except around paper writing time. We wrote two policy briefs - one individual assignment on Obama's health care platform, the other a group work on improving long-term care in the US. Both had massive topics, with lots of required outside reading, and little direction. They were generally very stressful assignments, but this was the first time they were assigned and may be changed in the future.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone seeking to understanding U.S. health policy.",
    "Yes, I would highly recommend this course. Excellent overview of pulic health politics\/policy topics and literature. Excellent professor.",
    "Great survey course with a wonderful professor. Anyone looking to understand the U.S. healthcare system (beyond just the nuts and bolts) should take this course.",
    "Great and work intensive course. I would always recommend it to a fellow studentwith the caveat that the time commitment is substantial.",
    "This course gave a great introduction to the institutions that form the foundations of health policy making. The lectures were excellent. The assignments were challenging and quite time consuming, however, the professor provided excellent feedback for developing better policy analysis and writing skills.",
    "This course gives a nice overview of the US political system and how it affects healthcare. It is a good introduction to healthcare politics and governance,",
    "excellent. highly recommendable to all the MPH students.",
    "Very good course for anyone interested in inner workings of policy making process."
