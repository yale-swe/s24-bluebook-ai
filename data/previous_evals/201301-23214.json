    "Very much a sociology course on modern China, with a little urban studies mixed in. I was excited about it in concept, but it fell short of my expectations in a lot of ways: the urban studies and spatial aspects that I had been looking forward to ended up being pretty limited; the reading list drew heavily from the professor's own work, limiting exposure to different angles and styles; and while the professor seemed very thoughtful and engaged during the first session, he fell to lecturing for most of the ensuing weeks, often in a way that only rarely referenced the reading. I'd probably appreciate this class a lot more if I hadn't taken very many courses on modern China before.",
    "If you're interested in China or in Urban Studies this would be a good class.",
    "Take if you really want to learn about details and theories of urban development. Not a fun survey course",
    "Good course, and broad assessment of the topic of Chinese urbanization. The course itself has interesting readings, but because of the scheduling of the syllabus, we did not always cover all the readings. It's very accessible, as well, since the class covers urban theory (a bit) as well as evidence about modern China. A worthwhile class if you have limited background in the subject.",
    "I would summarize this course as the urban study of China, with a focus on regional development. I would be hesitant to recommend this course to a fellow student. I would not immediately tell a student to avoid this course, but I would warn them that it feels a bit scattered.",
    "Some interesting reading, but very hit or miss -- sometimes just a more scientific version of what you already know about China, or what you'll quickly learn about China in any class on contemporary issues.. Prof. Chen is a pretty poor discussion leader -- not a whole lot of discussion, mostly just him rambling on.",
    "Yes!",
    "A survey of topics in Chinese urban development, this course takes a very sociological approach to Chinese urban development. I found it interesting, because I live and breathe cities. People who didn't weren't as excited. If you are interested, I'd go to two lectures if it's offered again, as Chen is a visiting professor.",
    "A class that will introduce you to major trends in contemporary China, as well as China's major urban areas."
