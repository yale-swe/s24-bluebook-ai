    "really interesting class. dufresne's a great teacher. not that much pure mechanical engineering but the topics do talk about were great. definitely take this class if you can. probably one of my favorite courses at yale so far",
    "Thermo might seem like a scary subject to some, but Professor Dufresne approaches it in a way that is easy to understand. He focuses on key concepts and really explains what it's about. In addition he's a ton of fun as a professor; he's always energetic and friendly. We delved into quite a few topics in the class, which add variety. If you like taking field trips and have an interest in energy\/entropy (which I actually understand now), even if you're not an engineer, I definitely recommend taking this class.",
    "Professor Dufresne is the best engineering teacher you'll have at Yale. Take this class if he's teaching it! If he's not, wait until he's teaching it and then take it. Seriously. Class was really fun - we took a couple field trips (power plant, Gibbs grave...), went out to lunch as a class, and did a lot of cool demos in class. The material is difficult but there is so much help available to you if you take advantage of it(section, office hours, etc...). Best engineering class I've taken.",
    "Great course. Not too much work. Reasonable exams.",
    "If you are interested in thermodynamics, it is a great course. If not, save yourself the hassle and find something easier.",
    "A great way to learn thermodynamics for any field, even if you're not a mechanical engineer. Applications are considered for many topics, such as chemistry and material science. The professor is very engaging and makes the theory clear and well defined. He also creates a friendly, casual atmosphere. However, the problem sets can be tough and hard to figure out, simply because you have to make many assumptions (some of which make no sense at all). For this reason, going to section or office hours is vital.",
    "A required class that you may actually enjoy. Covers a wide range of interesting material and stays fairly high-level. As the professor says, the math is easy but subtle.",
    "An awesome class you should take rather you need it for mechanical engineering or not! If you are at all interested in science\/understanding the basic principles at work in everything surronding your life, take this class!",
    "Definately an intro to thermo, begins by teaching the basic laws for the first half and then applying them the second half, several topics are covered but mostly graze the surface of thermo, homework takes a really long time but is very similar to exams so it prepares you, Dufresne is really enthusiastic and very casual\/down to earth, we didn't use the textbook so notes were really helpful and definately go to section",
    "It's a course that is incredibly useful in the real world, but very arbitrary. What I mean by that is that it often deals in measurements, constants, and variables that are amalgamations of intuitive quantities (combinations of things like temperature, energy, etc.) and this can make it difficult to fully grasp what is being discussed in class. If Professor Dufresne had gone a little slower and made his tests slightly easier, this would have been a greatclass. As it is, it morphed into something of a nightmare for me halfway through the semester."
