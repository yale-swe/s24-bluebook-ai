    "Yes. It is a very good one and exposes students to buddhist studies, as well as the historical and cultural background of those studies. But it makes more sense to take an introductory course to buddhism before taking this course.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to a student who has a good knowledge of classical Chinese language, and has a keen interest in Chinese Buddhist tradition."

   "comments": [
    "Buddhism has been playing an essential part in cultural life and literary works in China. An ok knowledge of buddhism would definitely help one to further his or her study in this aspect.",
    "I work on Buddhism and literature in late imperial China in my dissertation. As a student from a literature department, I really need to expand my knowledge of Buddhism. Through taking this course, I learned a lot about how the ancient Chinese literati apply traditional Chinese thoughts to interpret Buddhist texts. Although it's not directly related to my research, the methodology of this course is very helpful for my dissertation writing. Moreover, through doing translation every week, I learned a lot of Buddhist terminologies."
