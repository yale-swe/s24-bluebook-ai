    "This is your standard second-semester analysis course, covering Lebesgue measure\/integrals, Fourier analysis, and differential equations. It's fun, it's not hard, and it's essential for further mathematical study. Take it. Datta is a good lecturer and posts his (very, very good) notes online. The stylistic difference between Jones and Datta is almost comical.",
    "If you're a serious about math, you're going to have to take it.",
    "Math 305 is a solid course for the math major. It has a standard workload (for a math course) and is a significant improvement on math 301.",
    "Absolutely take 305 if you're interested in the fundamentals of real analysis. Measure theory is shocking; the Fourier analysis and differential equations topics are quite beautiful. The course under Swarnendu was quite tough and demanding. He is a very clear lecturer, and a nice guy.",
    "It's a continuation of Math 301, with some overlap. Pretty standard Analysis course: not easy to master but straightforward ideas. Swarnendu Datta is a good professor.",
    "It's a second course in real analysis; if you like analysis, then take it of course. Homeworks were largely from the Professor's notes, and the tests were at a decent difficulty level."
