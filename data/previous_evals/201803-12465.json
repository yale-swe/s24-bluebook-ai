Given Professor Hierro's background, I think she provided a legitimate source of knowledge and passion regarding the subjects presented in this course. I also liked the substantive readings which were very stimulating.",

    "This. Should. Be. Mandatory. Every PLSC student *needs to* know the material that we cover in this course, particularly given we are supposed to be able to conduct original research for our theses! Prof. Hierro walks through how to design research questions and the types of designs available that would be best suited to answering our questions. You will walk away at the end of the course with a fully-fleshed out proposal and an understanding of how to read\/critique other papers. Also, Prof. Hierro is essentially the most supportive professor one could have, and she is responsive to student feedback throughout the course. TAKE THIS!!",
    "I think this course if a great introductory course for those who are not as familiar with quantitative research design.",
    "I would highly recommend this class for someone who is writing\/will write their senior essay.",
    "Yes, if you are looking to gain the fundementals of research methods in political science"
