    "I recommend this class.",
    "Not a lot of work but can be boring at times. Good writing class",
    "Very interesting and a great survey of political philosophy. Definitely take it writing intensive if you want more real world application though.",
    "Interesting class",
    "Basic course, what you see is what you get. Take it WR and get the writing credit, the grading is better that way anyway (who wants a 50% final?)",
    "The official title is \"Moral Foundations of Politics\" but I would call it \"Political Philosophy II.\" It's really an overview of political thought that picks up where PLSC 114 ends. Lecture is engaging. If you go to lecture and pay attention, the class is very easy, especially if you take it non-writing, and even more so you're not a freshman and know how things work. A good fifth class.",
    "Sure. Only two papers for a writing credit. And, the final is open-note. Not a bad class at all as far as work. Plus, these theories are good to learn at some point in your life I think.",
    "Class may be one of the worst I've taken at Yale. If looking for an easy writing credit, take a different one.",
    "Bottom line: an easy but ineffective course covering the history of political theory in the West.\"Moral Foundations of Politics\" is a lecture class taught by Ian Shapiro that introduces students to some of the most prominent political theorists in the Western tradition. On the plus side, it covers an important and interesting reading list, and Shapiro's lectures are pretty clear. But the course has many weaknesses: you're only asked to engage on the most superficial level with course content, so you won't learn much about how to think like a political theorist, and you won't have many options to dig in deep and discover what you think about these authors. Sections are usually pretty dull (since the class has a bit of a reputation a a gut so students don't feel particularly committed or engaged), so the class ends up being mostly about memorizing a few key ideas that you could probably pick up from a few hours on Wikipedia. And Shapiro tries hard to make the content relevant to the world today, but most of his examples are a few decades out of date. I took this class because I had to, so my hopes weren't high - and they were more or less met.",
    "1. It's a good survey course on moral philosophy as applied in the political sphere - the central question of the course is, after all, 'when are government actions legitimate'? Take this if you want to be able to analyze the moral considerations behind government actions without merely resorting to intuition.2. There isn't a great deal of writing - don't expect to drastically improve your writing even if you take it WR-intensive.3. Lectures are good - the professor condenses ideas nicely, provides illustrations, criticisms and counter-criticisms, so attend lectures. Sections are decent. Furthermore, even if you don't attend lecture, PLSC 118 is one of the courses on OYC, so check out the videos and transcripts; Prof Shapiro even has a book dedicated to MoFoPo.4. Be warned: readings are heavy on the mind if you have not encountered these ideas (and THOUGHT about them) in some detail before - the bulk of the legwork occurs not in reading the stuff but trying to understand them (and then trying to take them apart). Conversely, if you have, this course doesn't go into too much depth.",
    "Make sure you get a good TA because they own your grade. NOT A GUT IN TERMS OF GRADING",
    "Interesting course for a science major",
    "Take it if you are interested in political philosophy. You'll come out with a good understanding of Locke, Mill, Rawls, Marx, Nozick, Burke to name a few. I always wanted to learn more about these thinkers so this course was perfect for me.The readings were often tough going. Almost all primary texts and they take time. The hardest part of the course for me was going through the readings.",
    "Yes I would if you want a survey course in political philosophy.",
    "good introduction to some important political thinkers. I think this is a great first class to take for someone interested in political philosophy. going to lecture is not important, the reading is rather manageable (in retrospect), and the exams are open book. take it and find out if political theory interests you!",
    "Very interesting class, but there's a lot of reading.",
    "An informative survey of important more modern political philosophers balanced with more traditional philosophies beginning with the Enlightenment. Sometimes a little bit dry. I definitely would recommend other students to take it as writing intensive.",
    "I recommend taking this class with the optional writing credit. Not a significant difference in workload (2 papers, but no midterm). Also helps distribute the weight of assignments more evenly. For non-WR students, the final is worth quite a bit of the grade, whereas the papers dilute this.",
    "Take it writing intensive to get rid of your writing requirement. That being said, understand that political philosophy warrants a different writing style and structure. The class is pretty interesting and will give people who enjoy politics new ways of thinking to support and destroy their previous perspectives.",
    "MoFoPo was a solid introductory political science class. It's not hard and the fact that the midterms and finals are open note open book make it way less stressful during finals time and you have other classes to study for. Shapiro is a good professor, but choose your section wisely.",
    "If you're interested in political philosophy take this course. If not, do not take it it will be boring.",
    "Take it with friends.",
    "Definitely take this class if you think you would be interested in analyzing and synthesizing the theories of political philosophers.If you're not, then you won't get much out of the course. Yes, you can definitely get by without doing much work, but it would be a waste of your time unless you're actually invested. Taking it writing-intensive is a good deal.On the final, if it remains open-book, bring Shapiro's book. It IS the final.",
    "Yes, especially if pursuing a major in global affairs or political science.",
    "Take intro to political philosophy first!!",
    "Good intro to political philosophy. Good but sometimes dry lecture. Worth taking if you have any interest in philosophy",
    "Worst class ever so boring did not enjoy anything in this class.",
    "Great course. Will open your mind and make you think about ideas that you probably never thought about.",
    "A lot of reading that I didn't really understand, but it's one of those courses that you should take. Good overview of philosophy that every person should know.",
    "A decent intro PoliSci course. I took it non-WR and found it pretty easy, especially since the midterm and final were open-book, open-note.",
    "To get anything out of this course, you must do the reading. It will keep you engaged in section and help you digest the big chunks of direct source text that can otherwise seem unmanageable in the lectures. Mofopo is a good survey of general schools of political thought, and the authors we read are important names that people ought to be familiar with. However, what you get out of it depends largely on the effort you put in, and staying on top of the reading will be the greatest challenge.",
    "I would definitely recommend for a solid background in political philosophy. I got to learn a lot. It makes you think about things in a different way. Even though it is a lecture, it is quite interesting and engaging.",
    "A great survey course on political philosophy, MoFoPo explores a variety of authors with medium depth. Try to keep up with the reading, and take writing-intensive so you engage more actively with each author.",
    "Political Science 118 is a good introduction to political theory, but it is by no means basic or elementary. You go very deeply into some very interesting and controversial aspects of political argument and I would recommend this course to anyone even remotely interested in politics, government, or social or political theory.",
    "Would definitely recommend to a student interested in gaining an introduction to political philosophy with a professor who is highly regarded and an expert in the field",
    "If you have no experience in political philosophy, I would definitely not recommend this class. The material is thick and a lot especially if you are not interested in it. THIS IS NOT A GUT. Especially as a writing credit.",
    "It's an interesting course - not life changing. If you don't like philosophy, don't take this course. There's a lot of dense reading, but you really don't have to do it all. By the end of the course it's cool to have a pretty good grasp on a lot of the political philosophy and moral arguments that have shaped history and modern discourse. I took it non-writing credit and I'm glad I did. Aside from Shapiro's book (which is super useful), DON'T buy the books\/reader. Most of it's public domain.",
    "take it WR.",
    "yes, though I would warn them about the overload of reading in the course.",
    "I would recommend it- it is a good general overview class of major philosophers. The writing section requires a lot of time, as the TAs grade the papers harshly.",
    "If you are looking for an easy Poli Sci course that requires minimal work and reading, then this is the course for you. If you're looking for a political philosophy class that will inspire you with its discussions and gripping lectures, steer clear. You'll come away from the course with some information that's definitely worth knowing\u00e2\u0080\u0094it's essentially a survey of political thought from the 17th century on. But, honestly, I probably would have gotten just as much out of the course if I'd watched Shapiro's lectures on iTunes U. If you do take it, I'd recommend taking it writing credit. The papers are not all that difficult and you'll at least have a much better grasp of the material.",
    "I don't recommend taking this course unless you have to.",
    "A great overview and intro to political philosophy since Locke. Do the readings and you'll be rewarded with a lot. But you don't need to if you are just looking to pass the tests.",
    "I'd definitely recommend this class. It wasn't a ton of work and both exams were open note. It's especially great if you're interested in the topics it covers, but if not it's still a good class to take.",
    "I would not recommend this class. It was recommended to me and I did not enjoy the material.",
    "Yes.",
    "This class is not hard but I hated it. Nothing stimulating about the material at all, and the papers and final are a huge pain. Your TA can make or break it for you if you take it writing intensive.",
    "It is a philosophy-based politics lecture course, with a lot of analytical reading. If you're interested by that, then by all means this is up your alley.",
    "So, here's the thing. MoFoPo is actually a pretty decent intro class. I don't know how it compares to Intro to Pol Phil (although I've heard Stephen Smith's version is much better), but I think this class gets a bad rap undeservedly. Shapiro has taught this class a bunch, and while he's not the most entertaining lecturer, at least you get a bit of his own take on many of the readings. The readings aren't too bad, although we spend a lot of time on basic Enlightenment stuff. There's a lot of half-brains in this class, and so the sections are mind-numbing. But, Shapiro and his section grads are actually really good people, and quite knowledgeable. Lucas is the man. The class is made a gut because of the type of people who take it, but the content itself is actually presented really well and is rich.",
    "Take this course if you are interested in modern political thought. It gives you a good overview of the key thinkers",
    "In this class, I realized that MoFoPo wasn't for me at all. The workload was quite heavy, since we had to read different (very cerebral) books and chapters from prolific philosophers. I ended up not reading most of the assigned readings. The class didn't interest me the way I thought it would. I struggled in this class.",
    "Yes. It is a great SURVEY COURSE. If you want a general overview of the modern political philosophy take it. If you are a hardcore philosopher who likes to dig deep, it's probably not what you want.",
    "I would recommend MOFOPO writing intensive, but it did turn me off from the political science major. The work is heavy and often times dull.",
    "I might have misconstrued the course from lack of attendance, but even from looking at the lecture slides, PLSC 118 feels more like one on modern political philosophy (heavy emphasis on Rawls, Nozick, political philosophers of democracy) than moral discourse on politics. Compulsory reading was hardly relevant to the slides, and almost all the information Shapiro wanted us to know was hidden in the supplementary reading. WR option feels more restraint than exploratory because the political philosophers have already been chosen in light of a modern political discourse (Obamacare or Wikileaks). Would only recommend this class to a student who doesn't mind anachronistic applications of Enlightenment and Anti-Enlightenment political philosophies and who wants to gain only a cursory understanding of political philosophy, not the moral foundations of politics.",
    "I would not recommend this course to another student. The lecture is pretty boring. However, you do learn a lot and it is an easy way to get writing credit. Also the finalis open note so that is very nice as well. I made the mistake of doing every single reading, which made the course load seem a bit unmanageable, but you really do not need to do every reading in order to do well in this course. Pay attention, go to lectures, participate in section and you should be fine. If you care about learning about some political theories with little historical backdrop, then take this course. If you like history then don't.",
    "If you need an easier writing credit take it but very boring course.",
    "After taking this class, you should be able to understand and craft your own ideology based on the ideas greatest political philosophers. By pushing each idea to its extreme, you will be better able to compare different philosophies. Highly recommend to anyone interested in politics.",
    "It is a good course to take if interested in philosophy although it does not have very many relevant applications to politics. I would not recommend this because it is a lot of reading that I felt like did not have much applicability to the lectures.",
    "A survey course in Political Philosophy, good intro to philosophical thinking. I would recommend the course to almost anyone as a good background for future learning.",
    "Not of fan of this class. There's probably around 60 pages of reading for each lecture. If you're completely new to the material it is going to be pretty difficult.",
    "It's a good course, and the essays are not too burdensome if you do it with writing. It's very helpful to have both the online lectures and the slides to review. Use them (and figure out how to watch the online lecture in 2x speed on Youtube---it's a beautiful thing).",
    "PLSC 118 is an introductory course to political and moral thought. I would recommend it to anyone who wants a survey of the content and hasn't yet read many of the major philosophical thinkers.",
    "Covers basic political philosophy from the Enlightenment to Democracy--you learn some cool stuff, but the class itself isn't all that exciting.",
    "PLSC 118 gives students a good background in contemporary philosophers, and grounds critical thinking in the historical and philosophical context necessary for a fully developed argument. I strongly recommend PLSC 118 to students interested at all in the ethical justifications of government and political actions, because it provides exposure to many important modes of thinking in addressing these questions.",
    "Yes, it is a good intro course.",
    "If you are slightly interested in Philosophy I would recommend this course to other students. You have the opportunity to gain a deeper understanding of the major thinkers and their works.",
    "This is a good class for anyone interesting in political philosophy. Take it for a writing credit. Writing sections are smaller, and the two essays are on interesting applications of what is discussed in class. Most important, the TAs read and give feedback on first drafts of both essays before you hand in the final copies.",
    "No. The readings were fascinating. However they were not necessary to do well in the class, and the lectures did little to enhance my understanding beyond them. If you do take it, read his book, as it helps far more then the lectures as supplementary material.",
    "Be interested in the topics and realize that this course is about political philosophy or else you are in for a very long semester. Also, take the class for a writing credit. It's easier that way and I believe the writing topics are interesting.",
    "A pretty average intro to political philosophy, studying a lot of famous philosophers to examine the legitimacy of different types of government. Interesting stuff, if a little dry, but not bad as a fairly easy writing credit or used for Poli Sci. Shapiro is a great lecturer who can make some ordinarily boring and incomprehensible stuff seem pretty interesting and simple. I wouldn't call the class spectacular but I enjoyed it and would recommend it if you are interested in the subject at all.",
    "Good survey, but experience depends very much on which TA you get.",
    "Great overview of political concepts and their origination, take it!",
    "It's a good course to take in order to get a good knowledge of political philosophers. It can be a bit boring at times, but the writing course was a good course load. If recommend it only if a student wishes to learn more about political philosophy, but otherwise it can be tough to get through.",
    "Lots of reading and dulling lectures but randomly very interesting",
    "It is a tougher class than you think. A lot of different authors to synthesize. Get a good TA",
    "I would not recommend this to another student. I did not enjoy the class, but that is because I personally did not enjoy the materials. I thought it was very dry and hard to learn. However, Professor Shapiro is great, and if someone were interested in the topic, I would definitely recommend it."
