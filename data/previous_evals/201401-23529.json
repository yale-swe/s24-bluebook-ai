   "comments": [
    "The syllabus is clear, but our chronology got a little scrambled in the attempt to follow a different thru line (themes).",
    "Having lecture over two days is better than having it all on one day, as I've heard it has been scheduled in the past.",
    "I was able to test out of Drama 6 this semester. Paul Walsh was supportive and available for any questions and is a lovely staple to the YSD community. His intelligence and deep love of theater is evident in his class structure, lectures, and the tests themselves. I look forward to hopefully working with him in some other way at YSD.",
    "I found the course with Paul to be fantastic as far as its organization goes. It was well laid out in its ISMS and what was on the syllabus was what was covered, even if sometimes we didn't make it to all of the material. What was sometimes frustrating was the online resources didn't match up with what was studied and reviewed in class. This was fairly easy to work around after some clicking here and there, particularly on the PPTs, but it was frustrating come test time when you'd have to waste time trying to find the PPTs.",
    "the balance of how the course was set up between lecture and discussion makes sense and works well",
    "I do wish the timeline information in lecture was presented in a more linear fashion. The jumping around made it difficult for me to follow the timeline progression. All of the information was very interesting and well lectured though.",
    "This class was not only a great insight into the larger scale of theater history than anything I've learned in the past. The extensive range of historical information provided by Professor Walsh and his TA's was insightful, fun and opened my eyes to just how deep the history of theater is and it's grand future.",
    "I tested out of this class!",
    "The actual course that Professor Walsh taught were very well organized. It was mainly a powerpoint presentation that lasted the full hour. Lectures flowed well and stayed on schedule with the Syllabus. The sections were organized with varying success.",
    "The quickly changing styles\/ideologies of theatre overlapped a great deal in this half of the history course and it would have been nice to check in more frequently with which ideas were happening concurrently.",
    "So much worth to take for education purpose",
    "I greatly enjoyed this course and felt I learned a great deal. Lectures were a joy, and I feel the course gave me a key to understanding how I operate in a larger theatrical tradition.",
    "The class was very clear and informative. It was a great opportunity to learn the details of theatre history and to read more plays outside other design classes. The examination was tough was it was totally worth it. I would take the class again."

   "question_text": "How effective was the balance between instruction and discussion?",
   "comments": [
    "It was all instruction. I did not feel like I had anything to discuss.",
    "Paul always has excellent lectures prepared and the discussion sections on Thursday with TA Illinca were always interesting and stimulating.",
    "Discussions are great in sections. I really appreciated that time to review what we discussed in lecture and to relate the material to a play of that time period.",
    "The section with Kee-Yoon was very informative, but I felt he wanted it to be more than what it was designed as. His leading questions were very hard to answer, and rather than opening up the floor to a general discussion that could have led to more in-depth thinking, he posed some severely difficult questions that left the room absolutely silent. I was disappointed and frustrated with this, as I couldn't really engage in some of the questions because frankly, I didn't understand them.",
    "Every week we had one discussion class along with two of our lecture classes and I greatly enjoyed that balance. I did find that in my discussion, we could have ended earlier and that we sometimes seemed to be scrambling or killing time.",
    "see question one",
    "My section leader was exceptional this semester. Paul has allot to cover in a short amount of time, so I wish he had a little more time to have discussions after he finishes his lecture. However that is made up with really amazing teaching assistants.",
    "The discussion group led by Maya Cantu I found very insightful, but there is part of me that wishes that there would be more time left at the end of lecture to pose questions to Paul as well.",
    "Every week prompt discussion with a TA had been great to understand plays and relat",
    "Kee-Yoon was a great discussion leader, but I sometimes felt that I expressed most of my opinions about the course material in our promts, and wouldn't have much to contribute during discussion. I also wish that the promtps had been due on Wednesday rather than on Tuesday - occasionally we wouldn't receive prompts until late Sunday night, and I felt I couldn't read the play without having the promt in mind to focus my reading, as prompts often asked for certain close-reads of the text. I think it's only fair to give three days between students recieving the prompts and needing to turn them in."

   "question_text": "How well did the assigned papers, reports or other projects reflect the aims of the course?",
   "comments": [
    "I think I enjoyed this semester better than last semester mainly due to the fact that my section leader did not require a written weekly response to plays. This fostered more discussion and exchange of ideas weekly than it had in the previous semester. I enjoyed the open ability to select a topic from a range that we wanted to write on. Taking ownership of a paper that is written on a topic you actually enjoy goes a long way.",
    "The papers felt very removed from the course as a whole. Almost as something that was done because there needed to be another assignment. Perhaps there could be an option for people to volunteer the thesis of their papers for discussion in the section groups.",
    "The paper we wrote this semester was more a script analysis vs. related to any area of historic theatre that we learn in class. I would have preferred to write a paper similar to first semester, where I was able to analyze conventions of the era and relate them the play I choose. That type of paper I feel helps me to have a better understanding of the lecture. Our 2nd semester paper seems to be geared to a different class.",
    "Last semester's paper was very enjoyable and clear to write. This semester in the Spring was less clear. After talking with people in other sections, everyone's assignment was a little bit different with some being more of an outline and others being a clear essay with thesis. More clarification about what we're doing and how to apply \"A Visit\" would be useful.",
    "I loved the small planet paper. The essay was so helpful and has made me a much more insightful reader, explorer and experiencer of play during the first read.",
    "Every week prompt discussion with a TA had been a great help to understand plays and related theatre history topics",
    "The only concern I have with assignments is in my response to the question above.",
    "I believe that one paper per semester is just right enough."

  {
   "question_id": "DR332",
   "question_text": "How did the amount of assigned reading work with weekly discussion?",
   "comments": [
    "The amount of weekly reading certainly helped the discussion. However, I think the number of both assigned plays and suggested plays is entirely too high. It would be useful to incorporate more essays or series of newspaper articles around a historical theatrical event rather than reading an entire play. This stems directly from the fact that most weeks other class work that pertains directly to our area of emphasis will take more time and ultimately be more important than a Drama 6 play.",
    "I had a hard time completing the readings- some were long and hard to follow. It was sometimes easier when the response prompt fit the reading - then I had an easier time picking up on themes. Sometimes I got bogged down trying to understand the plot itself. I found myself wishing for a short dramaturgical introduction - like we see in the program before a play - before reading some of the more obscure plays that weren't heavily discussed on the internet.",
    "I have a problem of managing time reading the play because English is my 2nd language so i take a lot of time to reading the play. Paul and TA really understand my circumstance which I really appreciate.",
    "The discussion prompts were sent out about 48 hours before the discussion group. If the questions were sent out the weekend before it would have given me better opportunities to fit the work into my busy YSD schedule. It was particularly difficult to turn around responses on weeks I was in tech or on run crew as I didn't have the question available on an off-day over the weekend.",
    "The plays assigned were well-suited with the weekly lectures.",
    "The reading is a very good idea in theory, but sometimes it just became way too much. Some of the plays were so hard to get through as well, but I'll take blame for that simply because it's really hard for me to read plays outside of realism and naturalism.",
    "I love reading a play a week and never found the plays to be too long.",
    "one play a week was appropriate- or two one acts. That's about all I felt i could handle at least",
    "The cohesive nature between the assigned readings, the required weekly responses for discussion section and the lecture and our personal take on things made discussion fruitful and diverse each week. The TA's were really great about prompting discussion and indulging us when conversations lead to different aspects of a particular movement letting us explore more than what was set to discuss.",
    "Each assigned reading was very good introduction or sample of the themes of the week.",
    "I found it hard to balance the reading of the plays with the rest of my work load, eventhough I found the plays in this semester far more interesting. I would suggest a play every other week while alternating discussions that are purely focused on what has happened in lecture.",
    "I got the impression that, often, the amount of assigned reading wasn't possible for everyone to complete in time for the discussion, so sometimes our discussions faltered. I wonder if it's possible to always begin discussion with an overview of the promtp - it felt like on the days when we did this discussion was more productive.",
    "It was very hard to keep up finishing those assignments especially during the production week, but it was definitely worth it. Even though I needed to skip a few reading, I tried to finish them soon later. I totally understand why the teacher assigned those particular plays for the week. They definitely helped my understanding of the each type of theatre history."

   "comments": [
    "There were little to no supplemental materials. I would have enjoyed more videos and clips.",
    "These additional materials were often shown in discussion group. It really helped to put a visual to the text of that week. It also promoted discussion about the choices made by the artists in the videos\/recordings.",
    "The music to accompany the musical were supremely helpful. The few videos we did see were also extremely helpful and, while I wouldn't say we needed more videos, I will say that I think the videos we did see in class brought the focus back in and rekindled and interest in the class and material.",
    "I almost never was able to read or use supplementary materials because of time constraints. any recommended readings beyond the assignment was never possible.",
    "Paul doesn't really use supplementary materials. I think youtube clips could be a good additions, especially with the more obscure theatrical practices.",
    "There were very few additional materials for this class.",
    "Again, Maya Cantu was amazing about sending our group extra videos to aid in the conversation and understanding of the various theatre styles. It greatly increased my ability to dissect plays whose mode of theatre I was unfamiliar to.",

However, I don't think given my concentration there is a whole hell of a lot to gain from having an improved knowledge of theater history.",
    "It started to fill the rather large knowledge gap.",
    "As someone who came in with very little previous knowledge about theater history, I found this course overwhelming. I spent nights before each test cramming pages on names and concepts.",
    "I feel the style of lecture is too repetitive and at times it can be difficult to pay attention. I learned the most when studying for the exam and was able to piece things together on my own.",
    "Paul Walsh is an amazing man, and I very much enjoyed the informational aspect of this course. But standing and talking for an hour is really detrimental to a diversified learning environment. Where is the hands on stuff? The visual aids were helpful but in review they were general and not very helpful. The rate at which Paul gave out information was impossibly fast, so taking notes became mission impossible. I would have enjoyed a more diversified class structure.",
    "I had absolutely NO theater history before- which is a failing of my undergraduate department as much as mine. I believe it has significantly helped me, and gives a much broader background and base than previously had.",
    "I feel like I have so much more knowledge of theater history and a deeper appreciation and understanding of where this art form came from and why it is what it is today.",
    "Not only in theater history but in art theory as well. This was a happy side effect to Paul's teaching style.",
    "I left this class with far more questions than I had about theatre as a whole and what it means to be a theatre maker, which is a GREAT thing. Being able to see theatre theories that are so ingrained into what I practice now has made me question why I do what I do now that I know the origin. And whether or not this is the type of theatre I want to make, and if not, what does that theatre look and move like. I could only ask these questions by going back into the history with this class.",
    "This semester of Drama 6 was especially interesting to me, shedding light on a lot of gray areas in theater history. I loved it!",
    "My Theater History was spotty at best before this. Though the course was a survery and we couldn't cover everything in depth (Paul was always open about this and encouraged us to widen the scope of our study), I feel I have a general knowledge of the the global theatrical tradition."

In order to take notes in class, I had to decode the phrasing and then pick out the key theme, while keeping memory of the last sentence in my auditory working memory. It sometimes got obscured by the next sentence.

I needed to be stimulated in that class, it was so hard for me to get up and go in the morning because I knew i would just be talked at for 50 minutes. Where is the innovation? The information is so rich, why just spew it out? We need to be able to digest this incredibly important material in multiple ways.

    "I feel that Drama 6 as a whole could probably stand to be a one semester total class. It would be great to free up additional space in the 3 year schedule for more coursework in our areas of study. After all, this is a terminal degree in my field, so I would appreciate maximizing my time here. If for some reason Drama 6 could not be one semester, then I think the volume of reading and responses should be dramatically reduced. The class could benefit from less reading and more interactive discussion, such as sections\/videos\/live performance discussions\/etc.",
    "The course is designed to be inherently challenging. This means the work is hard and the grading is forgiving. That makes for an excellent balance of challenge, without fear of undue pressure.",
    "Provide transcripts or audio recordings, or outlines. It was really helpful for me to have the slides in front of me to take notes. When the content of the slides was changed less then 24 hours in advance, it was more tricky to follow.",
    "I feel there is a false assumption of the theater history knowledge the students have walking into the class. Paul specifically stated that the people identification section of the tests does not cover mainstream people because \"everybody knows them.\" THIS IS NOT TRUE. I feel I know more obscure people than mainstream people because that's what I had to learn. The course needs to be able to cater to the vast range of incoming theater history knowledge in a more inclusive manner. The class does not need to go as in-depth as it does. If this means more people test out then that is fine. My understanding of the purpose of the class is to make sure we all have a fundamental knowledge of theater history. This objective was not met for me. No class at YSD has made me feel as stupid as this class did.",
    "Was able to test out this semester but studying for the exam there were some really intriguing subjects that I'm personally going to invest time in researching.",
    "I absolutely loved the course. It's clear Paul and the TAs have a strong understanding and grasp on the subject of theatrical history and a passion for it. That alone is enough for a great class. But what makes this class truly superb is the engagement we were able to all achieve together in our class. The ease and openness of the room.",
    "I passed the exemption exam so I did not take this course and do not understand why I am being asked to evaluate this course.",
    "I would just suggest more multimedia. Also Spring is a difficult year for YSD. Less readings might also be helpful for the spring semester. I completed all the readings in the fall, and a little over half in the spring. Not because I didn't want to, I just simply did not have the time.",
    "I found the weekly reading responses to simply be busy work. Reading would happen, but I would discuss in class versus writing it down. In the room is where the true learning would happen for me.",
    "I think regularity across the demands of different section leaders would be good. Though I had a great experience with both section leaders I had (Fall and Spring) it would have been easier on me if things like promt response deadlines had been uniform.",
    "Overall the class was just excellent enough, but I would suggest that the class would be more interesting if we can communicate or interact more with the teacher. - exchange thoughts or ask questions to the students during the lecture."

    "I thought Illinca was wonderful as a section leader. She always encouraged discussion, and identified the value of having a good back and forth over any kind of rigorous schedule of points to talk about. I felt that her section was my favorite of the two, and should be a model moving forward. Not having to write a weekly response because of all the other work that has to be done was very thoughtful and sharp of her. The reality is while the other two section leaders are very smart and very passionate, the students required to take the courses don't really care about how much a DFA Dramaturg cares about a certain idea and topic. The idea for the section is to make it about the people taking the course, not about the person teaching the section. I think that concept gets lost a little bit in regards to this course.",
    "Best part of the class.",
    "The early discussion sections were very useful, and then the content got more abstracted and they were more difficult to become engaged in. Also, when I didn't understand the play, the discussion section was not as useful. I would hope that the opposite would be true.",
    "The topics covered in discussion were not at all helpful in preparing for the tests. If the discussion groups covered questions similar to that of essay questions on the tests I would have been better off in the class overall.",
    "The discussion sections really helped me understand the different eras we explored in class.",
    "I love discussions. I was very usefull to discuss the plays we had read in relation to the period or era was learned about in lecture. Discussion section was my favorite part of Drama 6",
    "I wish the study guide sessions would be more helpful. It seems like we have to answer our own questions, which defeats the point of us going to a study session. We are looking to the section leaders to answer the questions. Sometimes the students who give answers don't give the in-depth responses that our teacher will grade high on.",
    "There is room for improvement in that, as I said before, sometimes it felt that we were searching for something to discuss when we could have simply ended our discussion early.",
    "Ke-Yoon was my section leader this semester. He's tough but fair. The most helpful thing he did was et us talking about the plays and movements in context of period, when, and where- which i found really helped me see the works on a greater timeline, and made it easier for me to understand where\/when\/why things happened, and where movements originated.",
    "My section leader was amazing. She has a natural gift in monitoring the discussions. She is also very generous with her time and energy.",
    "Unfolded a great deal of the knowledge from lecture to see how it is relevant to theatre artists now.",
    "Some days were enlightening, and I loved the clarity that Kee-Yoon brought to new terms. However, on days when the group wasn't ready to discuss or didn't have a lot to say, discussion lagged, through no fault of Kee-Yoon's.",
    "I enjoyed the reading discussion. It was a great chance to exchange idea and thoughts about the play and also meet our classmates from other departments. I am a design student, and I always find something new and interesting from actors, TDs, and directors."
