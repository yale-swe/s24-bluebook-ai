    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student, especially if Molly is teaching. It was truly an amazing class. At the beginning, there was quite a bit of structure (for example, guided figure painting, still life assignments with quick deadlines, grid assignments and so on). Towards the second half of the year the projects were much more independently guided, though there was of course still a lot of very helpful and insightful feedback from teachers and other students. There were lectures, sketchbook assignments, photo assignments (to help focus on object shape relationship and how to better apply in it paintings), and lots of great class discussion. I felt that it was a perfect balance of instruction\/useful framework and independent thought. The way the class is structured is great, and Mollys teaching made it even better. I absolutely became a better painter, but this class particularly provided a rare chance to reflect on how art and academic study relates to life and to the world. Cheesy as it may sound, it was an enriching and generally fantastic experience. I would honestly recommend any art class that Molly teaches simply because shes guaranteed to turn any kind artistic study into a life-changing course. Bottom line: good class, fantastic teacher. The class will make a you a better painter, Molly will make you both a better painter and a better person.",
    "Take it. Especially if it is with Molly. Everyone should experience the joy of using a big fat paintbrush to slap a glob of blue onto a blank canvas.",
    "I would recommend the course to everyone. My view of the course is limited to the way Molly conducted it (which I believe was very different from past teachers). I really endorse her method."
