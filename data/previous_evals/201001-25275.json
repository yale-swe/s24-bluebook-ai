    "Perspectives on Science is good in that you get the sumer research money. The lectures are also interesting many of the times, although sometimes they are disorganized or impossible to understand within the time frame. Doing the readings does really help, but there is absolutely no incentive to do so, so most people do not, and nor will you by the end in all likelihood. The worst though is the time on Friday afternoon when you hardly want to be there.",
    "Pretty interesting lectures. Not a lot of work except the term paper, and even that isn't so bad if you stay on top of things.",
    "An overview of a range of scientific topics spanning from evolutionary biology to quantum physics. The topics are interesting but often tedious and hard to understand for the freshman science student. But the discussions are fun if you get a good leader and enthusiastic students. The problem sets vary greatly in difficulty, and are not graded very clearly.I am not sure if I would recommend this course to another student. It depends on how committed you are to science and how motivated you are to write a 4500 word scientific paper during reading week!",
    "If you want to do research take the class. It is a very poorly done class, but does offer good opportunities if you are able to sit through a years worth of lectures and discussions.",
    "I feel like its either a love\/hate relationship with this course and you should take it for the first few weeks and then decide quickly which side of the spectrum you are on so you can drop it. Unfortunately I did not make that decision.I personally would NOT RECOMMEND this course. You just have to trek up science hill to hear a series of random lectures that are way too advanced for you to understand. Then you have to answer questions on them, which nobody can get from the lecture so its all just wikipedia and other internet research which takes a while and is actually a lot of work despite only getting 1 credit for the whole year! Discussion sections are not fun, but stressful as you get called on to answer questions that you don't even really understand.Many people only stay in this course because of the summer research. If you're not going to do summer research, then you also are going to have an extremely difficult time writing the massive paper which is half of your grade so the course is basically biased to those doing research who will get help from their research professors.",
    "I would recommend it for someone who likes science, but isn't sure what they want to study yet.",
    "Perspectives is a great program which provides support for summer research. This is definitely a great class to get exposure to scientific literature in various fields, although important to note that the nature of these faculty lectures give in-depth views of very specific topics rather than providing a broad overview of the various science departments.",
    "Bi-weekly assignments take up your Thursday nights. However, 4,000 dollars for research is probably worth it.",
    "Perspectives on Science and Engineering was successful in presenting the work of a diverse group of researchers through the course of the year. The class was a good way of becoming aware of contemporary research techniques in multiple contexts, and was helpful for navigating the research scene at Yale. The summer research opportunity is called \"Summer Research Opportunity\" for a reason, and involvement with Perspectives makes it much easier to find a research position for the summer.",
    "The only point to taking this class is to get funding for summer research. However, it is very easy to get this funding without the class. The lectures are either way to technical or way too simplified.",
    "No. This is a strange class, and unless you have no other way of getting summer research money, not worth your time.",
    "Take it if you need the funding. otherwise, seriously its interesting, but the busywork and friday schedule is killer when you realize all your friends are chilling. also crazy long paper due at the end, start early!",
    "Good lectures, and the discussion section quality largely depends on your fellow peers and your contributions to discussion. Also good ifyou want to stay in New Haven during the summer to do research.",
    "Overview of current research at yale: opens doors on campus to find out what science research you want to do. ANY LAB ON CAMPUS will take on a PSE student.",
    "This class was much better than the fall semester, in that lectures were much more comprehensible and accessible and discussion sections were much more helpful and engaging. I thought adequate support and clarity was provided on the final paper assignment. I also appreciated the variety of lecture topics: genetics, organic chemistry and drug design, quark and gluon soup, immunology. Even though I'm not staying over the summer to do research, I though this semester made it worth sticking out the fall (which wasn't as good due to more dense lectures and fairly stagnant discussion, though I heard that other students enjoyed their discussion sections). The courseload isn't overly difficult, though I would recommend starting early on the final paper so your reading week isn't so miserable. The course is interesting and lets you hear about lots of different fields (to see what professors you might want to work for or take classes from, or what subjects you might want to study in more detail). It's a unique opportunity to hear from lots of professors on their research.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student. Even though you might not fully enjoy every lecture, the class is not much work and you gain some interesting information nevertheless.",
    "While others I know are really critical of perspectives, I don't really see a particular reason not to take it. It's sort of nice to be in the class with other science-y freshman, and it really isn't a lot of work, except for the final paper. If you're not going to do the research over the summer, you might not want to take the course second semester.",
    "If you get in to Perspectives, I do recommend it. I would especially take it if you're not sure which of the sciences you want to major in. It has some (major) rough spots, but it's a relatively small amount of work, and gives you the opportunity to do paid research over the summer, which is great, and very much worth it. The research paper at the end gives you the opportunity to really delve into a topic of interest, but don't leave it until the end!",
    "Take it",
    "Perspectives is not a class that you have to take to do research at the end of your freshman year. It is a way for you to meet other freshman interested in the sciences, though, and it provides you with a generous stipend if you want to do research at Yale over the summer. The exploration paper is a lot of work, but it really provides you with a foundation to understand the research that you will begin during the summer. I would recommend Perspectives to students who would utilize its resources-summer research, meeting other students, and learning about general research-to their advantage. If you are just going to go through the motions of mandatory work from the class, you will not really get anything out of it.",
    "DO NOT TAKE THIS COURSE IT IS A WASTE OF A PERFECTLY GOOD CREDIT",
    "Decide how much you like science, and how much you want to spend your friday afternoon in class.",
    "Take it only if you plan to do summer research in New Haven with the Perspectives grant. Otherwise, it is way too much work for 1 credit minus funding. Writing the 20 page paper was a great experience for the future, but it was also incredibly stressful right at the beginning of reading period, given that I am not staying here over the summer and so I did not have a specific lab project to write about.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to someone interested in science and engineering. The topics are cool, and the research with fellowship is nice. Don't let talk about the paper discourage you from taking it. With the every other week psets and one paper, this course is not too much work for one credit. Just know that the more you put into the discussion sections and lectures the more you will get out of them.",
    "You have to do work during the semester, and write a really long research paper during reading period, but then over the summeryou get a paid internship with any lab at Yale you choose, which is a really good deal.",
    "A lot depends on the discussion sections, but the research opportunity is probably worth sitting through the lectures. If you're not planning on spending the summer using the funding then definitely don't take this class. The lectures are open to everyone, so just go to any you think might be interesting (though they probably won't be). Discussion questions every other week are easy if done in groups, but the paper at the end is brutal if left to the last minute,which most people do, so heads up there.",
    "SCIE 199 is a great way to be exposed to variety of scientific fields and interests. I would recommend the course more to someone who is unsure about which field most interests them or who has multiple interests, rather than someone set in a particular field. The paper isn't particularly arduous, but don't expect very much guidance. The funding is quite possibly the best aspect of the course, but should not be the sole basis for your decision.",
    "Perspectives has its pros and cons. The lectures can be amazing! There were some fascinating topics this semester that I absolutely loved, like the quark-gluon plasma and immunobiology. On the other hand, sections are pretty useless, not to mention the fact that sitting in class is the last thing anyone feels like doing on a Friday afternoon. The end-of-semester paper isn't as bad as you might think; if you get a good mentor and find a topic that you're interested in, it's actually an enjoyable process. Of course, the sooner you start the happier you'll be in the end. Perspectives is definitely worth it if you want to do summer research though, they give you a great stipend!",
    "All in all, I really enjoyed this experience. I did not really know what to expect at the beginning, and I still had that romantic prefrosh dream that maybe the course would introduce me to something that I would fall in love with. That didn't happen, but I still got a lot out of the class. In fact, I'm sitting right here in the lab I'm working for this summer, and I'm enjoying it so far. The class pretty much does what it sets out to do; that is, it introduces students, even those who do not have research experience at all (like me), to the scientific research sphere of academia. Even if you disregard some of the cool subject material that we learned from professors' lectures, such as structural colors (physics), VDJ recombination (immunobiology), etc., I feel smarter knowing about how modern research is done. For example, we were acquainted with GFP (a hugely prevalent molecule which has become common in molecular biology procedures), the newest types of microscopy, some information about informatics, and both the backgrounds and day-to-day activities of some outstanding researchers in their respective fields. The p-sets sometimes seemed like hassles, but the final paper actually did a great job at preparing me for my summer research. When I got to my lab just 2 days ago, I did not have to waste time trying to figure out what my project was, since I had already read up on a lot of literature, looked over certain lab protocols, and written about my PI's research. If you don't mind giving up 90 minutes of your Friday afternoons, and want to give research A TRY (I'm not sure if I want to continue research in the long run), then this is a great way to do it. (And although discussion sections could be dry at times, it really depends on your section group and the two professors who are assigned to your section. Section was never stressful, and on some days it was fun. You also get to meet a few new people through this program, and can probably have fun hanging out in the summer.)",
    "I would summarize it as a good course to expose yourself to different scientific fields but at the cost of having to do too much of hte learning yourself. Some of hte lectureres can be pretty bad whle some can be spectacular. All in all, though, I do recommend this course to another student. It is a terrific to understand cutting edge science ocurring in the world today. It also helps you understand and read scientific papers.",
    "Perspectives on Science and Engineering is a course that attempts to expand student's scientific horizons and expose students to what all is out there in the scientific world. Definitely a must-take class for students having a passion for science and interested in pursuing the sciences in the future. Even if you are thinking about pursuing the sciences, this class was throughly expose to you what science has to offer. My only problem with this course was that the lecturers too often assumed that the students knew what they were talking about and jumped straight into their research. Apart from that however, a great class that must be taken for all prospective science majors.",
    "The lectures were interesting, but a little too biology-centric, on the whole. I would have liked to see some CS or math lectures. More work (writing) than I expected.",
    "Most people will say to take this class mostly for the great summer research opportunity, but I took the class knowing that I would most likely not be staying at Yale over the summer, and it was enjoyable nonetheless. It is a great opportunity to expand your horizons a bit and see what new and exciting steps are being taken in a variety of fields!",
    "Every other week is a presentation by a leading Yale scientist, followed by small-group discussions in the intermittent weeks. Be prepared for very very very in-depth presentations, and it will take a lot of outside reading and research to actually understand it all. Discussion sections are hit or miss as far as professors - you either have professors who say nothing during the entire discussion and so you have no idea as a group whether you are going in the right direction, or you have professors who totally dominate the discussion and you don't get to speak at all. The students really make the discussion sections - you have the opportunity to become close as a group. Good news (or bad news, depending on how your starting group was) is that all of thegroups and professor leaders are shuffled at the semester mark, so you get a whole new group the second half of the year. The paper at the end stinks.",
    "If you get into this program, take it. It's interesting and hardly any work (until that final paper sneaks up on you). The class also offers research opportunities over the summer that any student would be lucky to have.",
    "It's a bunch of stuff in one; yes, it's interesting.",
    "Perspectives is a decent course. Some parts are great, others are not so great. The final paper was surprisingly rewarding. If you think you may want to do something in the sciences it won't hurt to take.",
    "Overall gives a good overview of many different branches of science. Also gives a great opportunity to do research on campus the summer after freshman year, so you don't have to worry about applying to scholarships in the spring. Do NOT procrastinate on the paper.",
    "This was a great way to learn science. Even though the lectures were not intentionally connected, themes emerged, like taking advantage of nature\u0092s trial-and-error. Through this class I developed an appreciation for scientific truths and their applications. I was exposed to quantum physics and particle physics for the first time. I made great friends in the class. The fact that I would have to lead two presentations motivated me to learn the relevant material in more depth. I have always been more of a generalist than a specialist, but the research paper taught me that when you focus on one thing, even seemingly mundane details become more pressing.",
    "YES! Great course! I really enjoyed the lectures and the end-of-term paper was very valuable for research and learning, in general!!!!",
    "Great course that gives your a tour of the different areas of science. I wouldhave not known about many of the accomplishments across the board had I not taken this course. The summer internship also provides an excellent opportunity. I would defiantly recommend taking it.",
    "An interesting class, but if you are generally interested in the physical sciences you may find the lectures fairly skewed towards biology. It's a decent class if you're unsure whether or not you want to be a science major and want the opportunity to see what different researchers at Yale do. If you're sure you want to major inthe sciences, I probably wouldn't recommend perspectives because the class itself can be dull at times and meets at a really inconvenient time (Friday afternoon). Also, the exploration paper you must write at the end of the class is not fun. However, all in all, the class proved helpful for me as a person who was on the fence about being a science major.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student hoping to do lab research at Yale. The topics covered in the weekly lectures are very specialized and can be challenging, but every student finds at least a few lectures very exciting. Also, PSE helps students get summer jobs in labs after freshman year, so that they can pursue those fields that excite them."
