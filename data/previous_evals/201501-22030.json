   "comments": [
    "The reading list for this course is amazing, but the class itself can be kind of lackluster, especially in discussion. But the syllabus really makes up for it, I think. It's not just children's literature, it's also theory and psychology about why children like reading what they do. Plus you get to revisit great childhood heroes.",
    "Take it if you're interested in the books and in thinking about literature in new ways!",
    "Great class, great books! Lots of space for creative projects, if you like that kind of thing (writing, acting, etc.). Not too much reading, but enough, and the readings that go along with each children's book are fantastic and absolutely worth reading. Would definitely recommend!",
    "One creative project, one critical paper, a theatrical performance, and a final paper or project. I would recommend to any English major looking for a junior seminar--pretty manageable work load and comprehendible subject matter.",
    "Not a gut or a cakewalk, but a class that you can look forward to going to each week, and with reading that will teach you more about young folks and about yourself than most other classes in the English department. Furthermore, you'll be proud of the work that comes out of it, and have a great time seeing what other people come up with. This class really pushes you to make good things. How many classes actually do that?",
    "Yes, I would recommend the course for a fellow student. Through revisiting the tales that we grew up reading, the course allows us to rediscover the magic of books while discovering the intricate details that we never associated with childhood and young adult tales.",
    "More reading than you think and Professor Stepto has some strong opinions but a really fun class! Don't be afraid of the creative projects; they turn out to be really fun and low stress."
