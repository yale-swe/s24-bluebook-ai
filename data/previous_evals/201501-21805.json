    "Chinese L2 is just as well-taught as L1. A lot of work, but you really get a lot out of it.",
    "One of the most elite Chinese departments in the world. Comes with hours of work nightly, a quiz or oral test every single day of the year, meetings Monday through Friday, and mandatory tutorials. Felt a little like high school, but higher stakes. That said, the teachers are caring, qualified, and very occasionally fun. Many of us are heading on full rides to Beijing with the Light Fellowship, soon to be fluent, and none of us regret it. Not for the faint of heart.",
    "If you are at all interested in learning Chinese, 110 and 120 will ensure that you learn a lot and learn well. It is a big time commitment and extremely demanding, but if you put in the effort it is also a fun and rewarding experience.",
    "Chinese is really hard, you have to be willing to sacrifice a lot of time for this class. The only thing I can really complain about is the language itself. Otherwise the class is taught well and the teachers are relatively great. However they are really not forgiving about absences.",
    "It was a great course to take after L1 and my Chinese definitely improved as a whole! It made me excited to continue on to L3."
