   "comments": [
    "It's a basic writing course (not sure how much my writing improved), but the topic-based approach is great. I'd definitely recommend it if you're looking for a WR credit or to make sure writing skills are on the college level.",
    "Do you have an enthusiastic and enduring interest in anything agriculture related? Take this class. If not, don't bother because the material is somewhat tedious and monotonous. In the first few weeks, there is a lot of reading each week and two essays. You will become an expert on farm politics, believe me. Then, toward the middle of the semester you switch gears and focus on a big research paper on a specific topic in agricultural policy. The paper is due before Thanksgiving break, which is nice because you get it out of the way early. The last project is a short TED talk on some aspect of your research topic. Overall, I liked this class. I came in with no knowledge of farms\/agriculture and left with a comprehensive understanding of the system.",
    "I would. There may be a lot of reading material, but it is very interesting.",
    "Food policy is a topic unfamiliar to many even though it influences everyone's lives. Professor Stuart is an amazing teacher and your writing will definitely improve if you take this class.",
    "I highly recommend this class to all students, no matter what their academic pursuits are. It is a course that covers a topic that is highly relevant to the world today.",
    "I would summarize the class as an introduction to college writing that takes the skills learned in high school and brings them into the context of college in a very manageable way. I would recommend the course to someone eager to build confidence in writing in other humanities classes, especially if that person is interested in food policy.",
    "As the section title suggests, we learn about the farm bill and food in America. Really interesting information, and the structure of the class allows one's writing to improve greatly as the semester progresses. There is a lot of work and a lot of reading for this class, so be careful."
