   "comments": [
    "I know this class tends to change every year, but I think generally you end up getting close with your classmates which was really nice. If Myra is teaching again, definitely take it!",
    "TAKE IT! It's an awesome class.",
    "I would totally recommend this to another student. It introduces you to a new genere of scholarship that is interesting and engaging. Furthermore, it challenges you to view the current state of poverty in ways you never considered. It is also no more work than any other seminar I have taken.",
    "One of the best, most enjoyable classes I've taken at Yale! However, I attribute much of that great experience to Myra Jone-Taylor, who will be leaving Yale.",
    "You learn so much about why poverty exists and continues. Myra had a lot to do with how great the class was, but the information is riveting on its own.",
    "Yes it was one of the best courses I have taken at Yale!",
    "This is a great class to take if you want to learn more about ethnography, poverty, and their relationship to American society and politics in the past fifty years. I recommend this class to anyone who is interested in ethnographies or learning about American policy on poverty since the 1960s. Even without any previous knowledge on these two topics this class would be great to take and with Myra as an instructor you'll end up loving it.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course because it allows for a cool exchange between other Junior American Studies majors who are pursuing different interests but all find themselves drawn to the intricacy of American culture and people."
