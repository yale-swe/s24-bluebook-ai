   "comments": [
    "This class didn't really make any sense. Every lecture felt like an introduction to something new; the material did not build on itself and the written assignments, sections, lectures, and even sometimes readings felt like they had nothing to do with one another. Furthermore, the multiple-teacher model was confusing and distracting (Dale's lectures were entertaining but inconsistent; Sonja's were consistently low-level and uninteresting).",
    "I would not take this class if it is team-taught or if it has a syllabus that makes as little sense as this one. If Martin is teaching it alone, and if its syllabus actually concerns the NT rather than randomly-selected articles, I think this could be a very good class.",
    "Very interesting class, but with a lot of smart people in it. I did all the readings and still felt lost in some discussions.",
    "I would not recommend it to a student who is interested in an introductory to Christianity class. I would specify that the class focuses on interpretation and covers a bit of contemporary issues.",
    "Yes, I would recommend it. Stil not quite sure how to summarize the class, as the overall themes were not very clear.",
    "The readings are really interesting. I would love the class to be a little higher-level- it can assume that we know more and go deeper.",
    "A class that anyone with an interest in the New Testament or early Christianity would be interested in. I recommend it without reservations. I was never \"uncomfortable\" as some other reviewers have suggested, despite being a practicing Christian. No prior knowledge required. Dale's lectures are lively and engaging, and you'll definitely have a good time. Our class was pretty small this semester (don't think there were more than 20 students) so the sections were a good size and there were opportunities for interaction in lectures.",
    "If you are a Christian or interested in learning about Christianity, this is NOT a good class to take. Many of this course's topics are heretical and misrepresentative of Christian teachings. The information presented is very biased and the beliefs of many people ridiculed. The class made me and many of my Christian friends uncomfortable and targeted.",
    "Detractors and supporters constantly throw around the documents of the New Testament, misusing and abusing its words. Take this course if you want to have a real idea of what the texts' limitations are, how to go about interpreting it, and what its history is. Have patience with seeming disparate topics (it's necessary by the nature of the document) and do as much of the reading as you can, and you will really get a lot out of a both interesting and relevant area.",
    "Interesting course on the New Testament. Very manageable workload (a few short writing assignments for section, a few papers but they're all super fun to write). A lot of emphasis on biblical interpretation and how it has changed over the course of Christian history...I think I expected a bit more of content related to modern popular culture, but the material that was covered was very interesting. The lectures weren't super structured, and the papers didn't necessarily relate directly to the readings or material covered in class. Weekly readings also weren't usually tied in to lectures, which was sometimes frustrating, and also usually wasn't covered in section. These things combined to give me a serious lack of motivation as far as doing the readings\/attending lectures was concerned. But when I did go to class (which was, for the record, almost all sessions!), it was very rewarding.",
    "A comprehensive look at everything New Testament you've ever wondered about."
