   "comments": [
    "I truly became a much better actress. I learned how to understand and really listen to my character as well as my scene partner. I also learned how to stay in the scene.",
    "I definitely improved my acting ability and developed a set of tools with which I can approach any theatrical work I participate in in the future.",
    "We learned mostly about Uta Hagen's theory and practice of acting through short solo exercises and scene work. While all of the solo exercises at the beginning initially frustrated or confused me a bit, I really appreciate the way they made me take time as an actor to be immersed in each moment and to provide clear objectives and inner objects for myself when working on anything. I became a much more observant and detail oriented actor and audience member. It was also just a treat to be in the room with Toni and all of her insight and wisdom.",
    "I learned a lot about performance concepts.",
    "I gained a foundation in acting technique, especially the principles and theories of Uta Hagen.",
    "I learned a tremendous amount about both myself and the world in Tonis class. She taught me how to observe and learn from the world around me and to apply that knowledge into the world of theatre.",
    "This course provides you with fundamental acting exercises and techniques. We begin with solo exercises and move into monologues and scene work."

   "comments": [
    "I just wish we got actual grades and that we got grades sooner so I could track how I am doing in the course rather than guessing.",
    "This class was very time intensive, and if you were partnered with someone who was very busy the week of a presentation, sometimes it could be challenging to schedule enough time to properly prepare. Other than that, the class was organized well so that skills we learned at the beginning through solo presentations were used and further developed in scenes at the end of the semester.",
    "I loved Toni's 210, but I think it is problematic that the three sections of 210 give students such a wildly different experience, especially when it is supposed to be a foundational performance class. Perhaps in future years, there could be either more unity among the three courses or sections divided by how performance focused the students want to be.",
    "The difficulty levels of scene assignments sometimes felt inconsistent, and we received very few grades over the course of the semester.",
    "This class is a great balance between theory and practice and really helps an actor to form a good toolkit with which to approach their scene work.",
    "Strengths: Plenty of time to work AND observe Makes you a better observer in daily life Well organized and positive environment Weaknesses: Sometimes grading expectations are unclear (what is graded, etc)"

    "Yes, and if you can, take it with Toni!",
    "If you want to get better at acting, definitely take this course. Acting is something that can be improved in a classroom setting, and I have already applied the skills I learned in class to my artistic life at Yale.",
    "Yes, absolutely. Toni is such a caring, insightful professor, and you will learn how to develop your own rehearsal practice and take time with a scene in a way that a lot of Yale theater cannot allow.",
    "yes! If you are a THST major focused on acting, this is a great course for you!"
