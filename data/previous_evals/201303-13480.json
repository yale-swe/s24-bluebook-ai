    "I would recommend this class to anyone interested in learning how to write better who might be interested in going into policy later in life.",
    "90% social science about agriculture politics and environmental science; 10% english class. Interesting if you like the topic--otherwise don't take it. Professor is nice but grading is not very transparent. Nevertheless, my favorite class this semester.",
    "Writing class with plenty of discussion on farm and food politics in the US. Highly recommended for students seeking help with argumentative writing",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. It was by far my favorite class this semester. Barbara Stuart is so so great. To be fair, I think agricultural politics are interesting, but there's so much more to it and so many fields it impacts far beyond farms that I think anyone will find something in it. It also truly improves your writing.",
    "Only take the class if you are truly interested in the subject, otherwise, it can be pretty boring. It does walk you through the steps of how to write a research paper, nonetheless."
