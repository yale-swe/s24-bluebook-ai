    "This class was great, I loved getting to work in the field and not a grungy lab every week.",
    "If you like to be in nature, and would like to learn more about New England forestry, take this class. You are in the field every week, studying forested landscapes or doing experiments on local farms. You will learn about sustainability, but not in the ways you might expect.",
    "Without having a science background or having taken a science lab at Yale, I really struggled with the lab reports. The class is really interesting, and the field trips are awesome. I recommend this for people who are interested in Environmental Studies and have experience. If you don't know how to write a lab report\/use excel--I still recommend the class, but seekout help early and often for the assignment\/grade end of the class. Overall, it was a really fun and informative science credit."
