   "comments": [
    "Survey course on energy issues.",
    "Yes I would recommend it.",
    "Take the seminar. It's not too much work, Tom is a great professor, and the subject material is a breath of fresh air - it's really interesting and not as academic as every other class at Yale is.",
    "Yes recommend - no other class covers energy topics so broadly and comprehensively - especially focusing on business and logistics side, instead of just environmental side. Gives very realistic view on energy instead of just idealistic pro-environment view .. and I say this as a pro-environmentalist!",
    "If you don't know anything about energy, definitely consider this course. It is an excellent, approachable introduction. If you have already taken energy-related coursework, aspects of this course might feel a bit repetitive, but it is still interesting to get the perspective of someone who has worked in the energy and comes from a non-academia non-technical perspective. The reading is interesting and not at all challenging, and there is not very much of it. Mr. Weil is very friendly and really cares about making the class enjoyable.",
    "One of the best classes I took at Yale. Manageable work load, great professor, and interesting, real world topics. Anyone interested in energy should take this class.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to someone, especially if they are interested in energy. Tom is a great lecturer and very knowledgeable. At times though, you get how much you put in the class, since there is no midterm of final to keep you accountable of the material. Also, the midterm and final are pretty open-ended so you have a chance to explore an energy topic of your choice. Overall, if you have a chance to take this class, take it.",
    "definitely recommended, very interesting class to understand the world of energy and that it is really complex.",
    "yes take it, its great",
    "Yes, I would absolutely recommend this course. An engaging lecturer with real world experience, a fascinating overarching look at the Energy Sector, and low workload. Perfect combination.",
    "Very nice guy, and knows alot about the more financial side of energy agreements. Focusing on more conventional resources like oil\/coal in a non-environmental perspective was very refreshing. We do discuss environment\/conservation towards the latter half the class, but the first part is very heavy on financial agreements. Def take this course if you have the chance. The workload is very manageable and thinking about energy is a really important issue regardless of if you're planning on going into energy industry or not."
