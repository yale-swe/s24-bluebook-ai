    "Take this class if you are looking for some quality novels\/poems to read and interesting discussion about them. Do not take it if you don't have the time to commit to reading ~0.5-1 book a week. Papers are not so bad, and no final!",
    "Excellent english class. Diverse course material and interesting paper prompts. More reading than writing - would recommend for people who would prefer the former.",
    "This is a broad survey coarse of American Literature. You don't really get into the detail of each work, but rather you touch on themes that connect across many of them. It's great for the reading list, but I didn't think class discussions were particularly life changing or inspiring.",
    "ENGL 127 is an excellent intro course for freshman, regardless of intended major. The work is fair and reasonable! I would definitely recommend, especially with Professor Carr.",
    "You could just think of this class as a literature class where each of the works happens to be American. There's enough diversity in the selections for everyone to really engage with a couple of the authors, and you'll come away from the class having read and thought deeply about some more pieces of good writing. That will be the worst case scenario if your experience in the class. Ideally, you'll also leave the course understanding what exactly is \"American\" about the writings themselves, beyond the author's own nationality. You definitely have the opportunity to think in new ways about what America means in this class, but you might have to work hard to gain those insights. It'll depend on what frame of reference your instructor provides \/ how much your peers care about answering those questions. But like I said, worst case, this will just be a survey of good lit by authors who happen to be American. I took the class with Ryan Carr, and thought he was pretty good at making class discussion productive. If you make an actually good point, he will recognize it and try to develop it into a point of discussion. If it's not as well developed, he might rephrase it for others' clarity \/ connect with someone else. If it's bad\/off topic, he's at least nice about kind of dismissing it, but might challenge you a bit to think harder (which is good!). He cares about teaching well! The reading is a little hard to keep up with, I fell behind a few times but it wasn't crazy. The papers are manageable and I felt like I got to really synthesize some cool ideas on them with enough effort. Grading is fair. One of the paper's will engage with another scholar's criticism of some literature, which is more academic in nature. I had never done anything like it, but felt like I was sufficiently prepared to write it and it was one of my favorite things to write!",
    "I'd absolutely recommend this, and I'd recommend Professor Carr as an instructor.",
    "I came into this class looking to explore works in American Literature. I also wanted to have interesting, enjoyable reading for homework. I felt that this class definitely accomplished both of those. The discussions in class were definitely the most valuable part of it for me. It is really nice to get the perspectives of other students and of the professor on a piece of literature. I think that the class depends a lot on the other students in the section. I think we sort of lucked out because we generally had pretty good discussions in this section. There is definitely a danger that the discussion could become pretty sophomoric and weak, especially if people just get excited about wanted to sound really clever or smart or something. (There are usually a lot of freshmen in the class). But that didn't happen in our section at least, so that was nice."
