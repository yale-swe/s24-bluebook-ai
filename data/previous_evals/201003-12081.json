   "comments": [
    "absolutely - knowledge you get is valuable for not only for econ major but for anyone interested at understanding the rise of the modernity. Most importatnly learned how to think in a better more nuanced and sophisticated way, imporved my econ knowledge and analytical and writing skill. Prof Guinnane is amamzing and he is a really good and helpful guy even if he pretends to be the opposite. absolutely",
    "I would definitely recommend this course, it has been my favorite economics course I've taken at Yale. It does a great job of applying economic theory to explain European history, something I found to be very interesting and stimulating. It's a decent amount of work, but everything is interesting along the way.",
    "I took this because I'm an econ major that's also interested in history. Basically an overview of the British industrial revolution. I'm not sure how helpful the knowledge is going to be unless you're going into the field of economic history but still very interesting stuff.",
    "If you're interested in understanding this part of Europe's economic development, an excellent course.",
    "Take it if you're interested in economics and its relevance in everyday life (here looking at Europe 1700-1815).Prof. Guinnane is one of the best teachers at Yale: Lucid in his explanations, clear in the structure of the course, approachable, funny (even though he will repeatedly say that this is not the case) and undoubtedly an expert in the field.Students pointing out that Prof. Guinnane is very strict in his enforcement of rules, deadlines, punctuality etc. should reconsider their own standpoint on these issues. All he asks for is some common sense and normal mature behaviour.Feedback on problem sets is also excellent, especially when compared to the coarse grading seen in most other econ classes offered.",
    "I'd recommend the class. It's a very reasonable workload, an interesting--albeit obscure--topic, and Professor Guinnane makes the material fun. Also, the graded assessments are extremely reasonable, as long as you pay attention in class and do the work assigned.",
    "Definitely take this course. The workload is manageable and each lecture is interesting in its own way. One my favorite econ courses I've taken at Yale thus far.",
    "YES. AN ECON CLASS THAT ISN'T DRY AND TAUGHT BY A MACHINE FOR ONCE!",
    "Prof. Guinnane is relatively strict compared with other professors. He has rules about being punctual and coming to lecture (etc.) but he is a great lecturer and his course is worth it if you actually want to learn something about what economic history is. It's not terribly hard but there are a lotof assignments including three papers (but only four problem sets). A definite must take for people interested in economic history and for students who want to meet a professor who cares about how much you learn in his course.",
    "Really interesting and fun. Professor guinnane is a great lecturer. Read his syllabus for a good sense of the material\/ his unusual expectations.",
    "Fascinating class for the history buffs and Anglophiles out there."
