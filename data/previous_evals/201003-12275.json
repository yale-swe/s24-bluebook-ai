    "If you can take a higher level course please do. Otherwise this course is a very good intro to topics in biology.",
    "The course wasn't too bad. I devoted most of my time to this course because I ended up loving it so much. It really made me want to do well. The curve was fine, always brought down by those people who don't study, but for the most part you'll be fine. In past years, pepole have said the curve is a nightmare but (at least on the first two exams, haven't gotten the third back yet) it's been fine. Overall, definitely take this course, especially if you're thinking about some kind of science major, it's just so important for every single science field.",
    "I would definitely not recommend this class to a non-science-inclined student- it is not the easiest way to fulfill the science requirements. People with a good basis on Biology should do well, but still there is a lot of workload. My advice is to try the course during the shopping period - if you like it, stick with it. If you don't enjoy it, drop it as soon as possible, because it's just going to get more and more complicated. I wish sb. had told me this before!",
    "It is a good course but calls for a lot of work when it comes to midterms and the final.",
    "The class is not difficult, but the exams are really hard. I would recommend the class because I love biology and even though it was hard, I still enjoyed lecture.",
    "The class starts off boring, but it is a necessary foundation for those looking to move forward in biology or the sciences.The readings, by the way, are COMPLETELY optional. But I did best in the class when I skimmed through the readings the day before lecture.",
    "If you don't have to, just DO NOT. There will be a TON of people in this class who have taken AP Biology before and are taking the course to just get that easy A. Then there will be people like me who have to work 10 times harder than anyone in there to get an A. Aside from the Exams being INCREDIBLY hard, and the averages being ridiculously high, the class is full of a ton of pre-meds who are as competitive as any class of students can be. Overall, I'd say the course was somewhat interesting, a good survey of Biology, but is definitely unfair in the sense that the exams are HARD and don't test your knowledge of the material as much as they test how carefully you read questions. Also, do NOT miss one of the exams. The make-up exam date is december third, and the last exam date is december first. You will totally screw yourself if you do that.",
    "If you've taken AP Bio, you'll be good. take if you must. if you don't, take something else",
    "MCDB120 is a run through basic molecular, cellular, and developmental biology. There's a massive amount of information (so you need to prepare for the tests somewhat in advance) but they're not too challenging. Textbook reading isn't required. It can be helpful as a reference but I never got into the habit of reading it and I don't think it has adversely affected me.The class is pretty easy if you've had a fair amount of exposure to biology before. Taking the lab alongside this class is helpful, as they are pretty well lined up (unlike Orgo, for instance). The Molecular and Cellular part of the course is fairly standard stuff (DNA, proteins, basic genetics, organelles, etc.). I found the developmental part of the course interesting in that it was something to which I had never been previously exposed. That being said, this section is by far the easiest as only an understanding of concepts was required rather than actually learning the names of genes.The professors left us in the dark about how the course is graded. I know that grades are not the end all be all of our existence but it would have been nice for them to tell us how A's, B's, etc. are distributed.",
    "MCDB 120 is an introductory biology course that touches on a lot of topics in a relatively short amount of time. The instructors do a great job of this. I would definitely recommend this course to another student, with thefollowing conditions: they definitely should attend every lecture, since all the exam questions are on topics covered in the lecture; they definitely should read all the readings, since it makes the lectures 10x easier to understand; and they should try out different TAs to find which one fits. It also doesn't hurt to take the MCDB 121 lab course.",
    "This is an absolutely terrible class. I am a junior and this is the worst class I've taken. Terribly run. The exams are so stupidly worded, and they don't ask you about what they're actually testing. The workload is low, but the class sucks. Overall though, this review probably doesn't matter to you because you have to take this class. If you don't, then save yourself while you still can.Avoid this at all costs until they change the priorities of this class from distributing grades and intimidating freshman pre-meds to actually teaching biology.",
    "Not much work, interesting topic. As a non-science major, I was completely comfortable in this class. It's great!",
    "This course fulfills requirements for majors and the pre-med track, but overall is kind of dreary. The material is worth learning, but not in the current medium of which it is taught. Be prepared to study hard for the exams, which seemingly put questions haphazardly on paper.",
    "MCDB 120 is a basic biology course. I never took a thorough biology course in high school, so I really learned a lot and found the course very satisfying. You really don't need to read the text book along with lecture (though it is helpful for reference). I recommend you study a LOT for the tests since they tend to challenging, though fair. Another piece of advice: attend a couple different sections until you find a good TA. Some TAs are really great and go out of their way to make practice questions (that are very similar to those on the exam). The test review sessions were not helpful. Carlson is wonderful!!!!!",
    "Take it if you have to, but it's probably better to place out of it and take a higher level bio class.",
    "poorly organized.the text book may be a good supplement to the course but essentially all test material is from the lectures. carlson is a good lecturer but the other lecturers are difficult to comprehend at times. some students with bio backgrounds do very well on the test while some people get stuck getting 50s on the exams. overall adifficult course.take it if you have to.",
    "Absolutely. Although for people who don't generally tend towards sciences this may be a lot of memorization, a very detail-oriented class, the subject matter is very interesting and relates directly to daily life. Class is team taught (in three sections) which makes some weeks better than others, but the material makes up for all of that and Prof Carlson is absolutely wonderful. Everyone should take bio!",
    "I am actually not doing to well in this course but I have to say I like biology and the material was interesting so if you want to get the basics of bio I would recommend this course",
    "LEARN TONS! INTERESTING MATERIAL! YAY BIO!",
    "Solid intro to different aspects of biology.",
    "Basic introductory biology lecture. Easy to slough off due to lack of assignments.",
    "MCDB 120 is the epitome of an introductory class. Most of the lecturers (2\/3) are really boring, and the class covers such a broad range of topics it's hard to get a grasp of most of the material. I was probably one of the few who enjoyed the class, but it was probably because of the material more than the lecturers. Prof. Carlson is great, his lectures are really enjoyable. One thing you have to realize is that because it's an intro class, you just have to know the basics of each topic. Don't stress out about knowing the minute steps of translation - just know 2 or 3 things that happens during it or its purpose.",
    "I'm never sure what to say in an evaluation of an introductory course. Of course you're going to take it. Go lecture, take notes, read the book. Really just read the the book. The exams are manageable, but because there are no problem sets, THEY ARE MORE IMPORTANT THAN YOU'LL EVER KNOW. Your grade is literally your exam grades.",
    "The course covers the basics of cellular biology, from cancer to the formation of a fat. It was a general course, yet very informative. I would recommend this to another student, even if biology will not be your intended major.",
    "It's a basic biology course that can be interesting at times. It's nothing mind-blowing but if you enjoy learning biology, it is a good overview of concepts you have heard before.",
    "if you want to learn about bio take it",
    "Good introductory bio course.",
    "dont take it",
    "I would say that overall, MCDB 120 is an okay class. If you're pre-med, I guess you'll have to take it. But if you're looking for an introduction to bio, this really isn't that helpful, unless Dr. Carlson taught the entire class.",
    "Take it if you need an intro bio course. It's not very hard.Do the readings, especially for the Molecular and Development parts. Cellular it is not so necessary; just go to class.",
    "MCDB 120 is a pretty good class overall. Professor Carlson is the best lecturer by far. I was most engaged in the class when he was teaching. Professor Bascom-Slack is the weakest professor. There is a lot of information covered in this class, so be careful of that. The reading in the book is actually not necessary, because you will only be tested on concepts discussed in class. It is good if you didn't understand something in lecture, and would like a clear explanation.",
    "DO NOT TAKE THIS COURSE. If you can find any way to avoid it. Please, I beg you.Two of the three professors do not seem to care about what they are teaching, and assessments are poorly designed and do not test your actual knowledge of the material.This is one of those strange courses which somehow manages to be both extremely boring and very difficult at the same time.Save yourselves.",
    "MCDB 120 is a comprehensive and very interesting introduction to bio. If you do the reading in the textbook, it's an easy A. It's not too much work since there's no homework except reading. All of the professors were pretty good, but Professor Carlson was the most clear and also hilarious!",
    "Again, if you have too",
    "It's a very boring class, in which 2\/3 of the lecturers are also boring. The second lecturer, John Carlson, was amazing though.Make sure you keep up with each new concept learned or it will make cramming for each midterm horrible. I learned that the hard way.Also, at first I did all of the readings, taking extensive notes...but soon found that wasn't working for me. It worked much better for me to simply look up the specific things talked about in lecture, adding more detailed notes to my notes from class.",
    "Most people taking the class are doing so because it's a pre-req. It's a lot of memorization, but if you go to lecture and take good notes, the exams are very manageable. No homework\/psets, which is nice.",
    "No, I would not recommend this course.",
    "If you didn't take AP Biology in high school, this class will be very challenging because it covers a very wide breadth of topics at varying degrees of depth. Each professor has a different teaching style as well, so that can be a bit difficult. Overall, I would recommend this class to another student if they wanted to learn more about Biology, but unless it's for your major I would probably avoid it.P.S: If you've taken AP Biology, don't bother with this class.",
    "A good intro to bio! Do the reading-- it is a good textbook, and has a lot of fascinating material and good visuals. A good complement to the lectures.Look forward to Carlson!I recommend the course. It's good stuff to know as a human being, even if it glosses over it because its a --how hormones and the brain work, how plants and people develop, all that good stuff.",
    "I would definitely take this class if you have any interest in biology. It really gives you a firm understanding of the basics, and provides you with a better understanding of some of the processes happening in our bodies right now. The lectures are enjoyable, and the tests are fair.",
    "Yes, take the class. It's a pretty good science class.",
    "I would recommend it if you like bio or have taken it before. The material is pretty interesting and the lecturers are pretty engaging, for the most part.",
    "Good in the end to know the stuff. Stay on top of the material and it is fine.",
    "MCDB 120 is essentially a very large intro bio lecture. I thought the course material was really interesting, but the lectures themselves were extremely boring. It was very repetitive taking notes on powerpoint slides class after class. Of the three instructors for the course, John Carlson is the best; he did not lecture from powerpoints, and I think he seemed a bit more interested in his subject. The class doesn't require much work, though. There are 3 midterms and a final, with no other assignments. The tests definitely require studying, but they're not too difficult. The lectures do not directly follow information in thetextbook, but I would recommend reading the sections that do parallel the lectures as a way to reinforce what is being taught. I would not recommend taking this particular bio course unless you need it as a prerequisite.",
    "Not bad. You'll learn the essentials of biology. No lecturers are bad - John Carlson is great. You'll have to master lots of material for exams, but there are no problem sets, and section is mandatory. It probably won't be your favorite class, but it's not bad.",
    "only take if you need for premed or bio major. otherwise it was a terrible class",
    "Necessary evil. Carol's lectures are not worth going to, but Carlson's lectures and Frank's lectures are worth sitting through.",
    "It's an okay course, if you're willing to sit through terribly boring lectures three times a week.",
    "The material is extremely interesting, if you want to learn about topics like how the cell works, how development happens, and how cancer begins, and don't expect it to be anything like AP Biology--the last lecture was the only one that I could draw on my knowledge from high school for. I'm really glad I took the class because now I feel like I have a really good grasp on some of the key things that make us human, which is super cool, but the class was pretty frustrating to take. The 3 professors all have VERY different teaching styles, so it's hit or miss. I happened to like Slack, the last lecturer, the best, but some of my friends said he was the worst in their opinion. Use the online book resources (I didn't buy the book, and still don't think it really woudld've helped). At the end of the course, you'll see that a lot of things from the first lectures are explained a lot better by the last lectures, so the material is a bit disorganized, but there's no real way around that. The only workload is studying, and the biggest lesson I learned was that you do really need to study, because there is no other way to reinforce what you're learning.",
    "This class is easy and, if you have't taken AP Bio, the material is interesting.",
    "Only take this if you have to as a prerequisite.",
    "Good overview of biology. Lectures can be boring. Concepts not always beautifully explained.",
    "MCDB 120 was a great intro course for students that are or aren't interested in majoring in the Biosciences. It sums up most of the important concepts that a person should know about Biology and since it contains a lot of general knowledge, it is a very interesting class for any student. I would definitely recommend this course. It is nice because it is split in three parts, each being taught by a different professor and this prevents it from being monotonous.",
    "Take it only if you have to. Poor class",
    "I am not the biggest fan of this course. If you are into memorizing 2\/3 a semesters worth of slides, then this is the class for you. I thought that the reliance of powerpoint slides did not facilitate true learning, while the lectures provided by Carlson were wonderful. All the teachers are highly knowledgeable and a great help, but I was not tantalized by Carol and Frank. The tests for Carol and Frank can be passed by memorizing most of the thing on their powerpoint slides. Just understand the main concepts and be sure to memorize everything else. As far as the reading goes, some may say it isn't necessary but it helps. If you are confused definitely do it. But it isn't necessary to read everything. With Carlson, take good notes and you'll be fine. Also be sure to find a good TA. If you could place out, I'd recommend it, if not just for the testing style. They are very very very picky graders as well. The professors are amazing, but the transmittance of their intelligence can be lacking.",
    "It is a basic overview of biology in different areas. I had never taken bio before so I found the material interesting, but I'm not sure the same is true of people who had heard it before. I think it's kind of average -- take it if you're interested in the topics or need it for pre-med or major stuff.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class if you are interested in biology and want to know if it is for you.",
    "I would recommend the course to a fellow student only if the student was very interested in taking an intense science course.",
    "Yes, I would recommend it to anyone looking to take an intro bio course. It is a demanding class, but the material is very interesting.",
    "I would recommend the course to another student.",
    "MCDB 120 is fairly rigorous course. I would recommend it to students who stay on top of their work. Not understanding a topic can set you back since topics really build on previous ones.",
    "Take this class if you need it, but if you're just trying to fulfill a science requirement please take chemistry or physics.",
    "I liked this class, I would recommend for anyone looking to fulfill premed requirements or those just interested in learning a broad scope of biology.",
    "Three teachers, three \"trimesters\". First trimester - Bascom-Slack talks about basic chem stuff, but don't be fooled - the material picks up quickly. Then Carlson comes in the second trimester, and doesn't give handouts (beware!), finally, Slack teaches the third trimester and the stuff finally gets really interesting!! Even though they tell you the tests are based only off the lectures, definitely read the book - it helps A LOT. Overall recommend.",
    "Bio 120 is really for someone who'se had no bio since a 9th grade high school course. That being said, the course does go into more detailed cell mechanisms and gives and introduction to physiology and development that is considerably beyond a high school class, although probably comparable to what you'd learn in AP bio.I got a lot out of the course, as I had not had any bio since 9th grade. However, the lectures were sometimes disorganized and unclear - it really is essential to read the textbook.The tests were also a bit too long and very specific.",
    "It is difficult to get a good grade, but it's a very interesting course.",
    "This class is great. I love Bio and I still love Bio after taking it. Three professors, the first and third are okay but the second professor is amazing! Material is very interesting. Use your TA!",
    "MCDB 120 was a great introduction to biology. All the basics are covered, and in an interesting manner. I would definitely recommend it.",
    "If you haven't taken AP Bio, take it. If you have, don't. Pretty simple; the class is fairly easy.",
    "This course is a pre-req for BME and a lot of sciences and pre-med, and it's very difficult if you haven't had a good bio class before. It's essentially 3 different classes, so sometimes it is difficult to figure out where to get help, but shop sections and find a good TA that really works for you. Honestly, take the time to do this, because it's the only way to succeed in this class unless you had good bio in high school.",
    "I would recommend it. Not too hard but not easy either. A fair amount of work, but the material is interesting and well delievered.",
    "MCDB 120 is a great intro class. If you've taken AP Bio, it shouldn't be too difficult. John Carlson is definitely the best professor out of the three. The other professors are extremely boring and don't seem to make much effort to make the material more interesting. The workload isn't very much at all--3 tests and a final. Section definitely helped because there is an enormous amount of material to know.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone needing the requirement or just generally interested in biology. For a large science lecture, the course was well-taught in general and covered a great range of material in remarkable depth. However, the division of the semester between three professors was difficult. Just you adjust to the teaching style and expectations of one professor, you find yourself having to re-adjust. Because each midterm covered material taught by a different professor, they were all unpredictable. Moreover, all tests were application-based. The choice of TAs however was fabulous and, although section is voluntary, the TAs are very good teachers themselves. There are only 3 midterms and 1 final.",
    "If you are premed or an MCDB major than you might have to. Don't take it just to fill a science credit.",
    "It is what it is, 2 nice, but bland professors, and one super nerdy awesome one. The class is really not that bad, and at times even enjoyable. Final was way harder than expected, but that's my only caveat. DON'T TAKE THE LAB. It is sooooo not worth it.",
    "Yes, it was a pretty easy course, you just have to memorize and ALLOW ENOUGH TIME FOR STUDYING, that is the only part that gets challenging because there is a lot of material and if you don't leave enough time then it gets hard, but the material itself is not difficult.",
    "This class is pretty much what you would expect -- a big lecture survey course covering the basic nuts and bolts of biology. While there are no homework assignments -- just optional readings -- the tests (three plus a final) are hard and cover a lot of information, and since they make up the entirety of your grade, it's a good idea to keep on top of the material so you don't have to cram. The class itself ranges from interesting and entertaining (most of Prof. Carlson's lectures) to somewhat dry and sleep-inducing (most other lectures) -- but then again, if you're genuinely interested in the material, and haven't heard it all before (i.e. haven't taken AP Bio), then you will probably enjoy the lectures at least to some extent. In any case, don't take this class expecting a cut-and-dry SC credit -- take it only if you're willing to invest the requisite energy and time into really learning and understanding the material.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who is interested in the fundamentals of biology. It is a pretty decent intro course, with a scope broad enough for anyone to pick parts that they particularly enjoy and perhaps run with in a more intensive course. The workload is manageable (just three midterms and a final) -- however, just know that you should know the material inside and out, not just surface facts. All in all, a nice course.",
    "This class will be extremely difficult if you don't have any biology background. You will need to seek out extra help.",
    "This course was neither spectacular nor bad. If you've taken biology before, a lot of the concepts you've already learned will be introduced with more details that are often scattered all over the place. Because there are no problem sets or weekly work that you have to do, it's easy to not do anything for that class but you should review your notes, do the readings so that you won't suffer when it's midterm time (or finals especially). A lot of people have to take it for major\/premed but if you're interested in the subject it might not be a bad idea to take it, but see if you can find some other options and compare it to those first.",
    "Good class to take if you want to soldify your knowledge of biology",
    "Great course. Gives a good overview of what you did or did not learn in highschool. Also provides excellent introduction ot fundamental research methods in biology and more in depth look at development",
    "This class is an introductory biology class. The class is mostly pre-med students, so if you're looking for a science credit only, don't take it. Doing the reading isn't necessary, but going to lecture is to get the most out of the class. If you go to class and study for the exams the class isn't difficult, and can be interesting, especially Dr. Carlson's lectures.",
    "This is a good introductory biology class. It is well structured, even with three professors, and all three are amazing. The class doesn't involve much work, but I would recommend doing the reading before the lectures. It makes the concepts in class more clear and studying much easier before the exams.",
    "Obviously you shouldn't take it unless you have some interest in biology, but I have to say that as intro science classes go at Yale, this one really has its stuff together. The material is very well presented--clear and understandable, not overly complex or confusing, and yet not dumbed down. All three lecturers are worth your time, and there's literally no work besides studying for three exams and a final. If you have to take this as a premed requirement or for your major, have no fear, and even people who just need a science credit should consider it seriously. It's not a gut though.",
    "To take on the entirety of molecular, cellular and developmental biology in one class is obviously a huge task, and this class certainly made it feel that way. The information conveyed is fascinating, but often felt scattered and it was hard to make sense of the method by which it was taught until I was studying for the final. Perhaps more transparency as to the thought behind the class would be useful. As a non-premed, I felt pretty ignored throughout. My interest is in plants, which we spent exactly one day on. I realize that many of the things we studied are applicable to plants, but even these connections felt ignored.The teaching is spotty, though Dr. Carlson's lectures (the only ones that mostly forgo Power Points) might be worth it. Expect spontaneous applause.The tests for the most part cherry-picked knowledge, though did an okay job of asking for analysis rather than just regurgitation. Make flashcards early and often. You are competing against premeds.",
    "Horrible class. Arbitrary grading.",
    "Survey course in molecular, cellular, and developmental bio. Not highly engaging, but interesting. Use toward the major or pre-med, otherwise not necessarily worth sitting through.",
    "It is a fairly good course, but nothing extraordinary or revelatory.Gets the job done.",
    "The class is very good and the three professors that teach it are also very good. Professor Carlson is very amiable. He's kept a child-like interest in biology, even to the point of bringing in toy viruses. His test tended to be more specific than the other two professors'. Professor Bascom-Slack and Professor Slack print out their powerpoints for the class, which is very helpful because you can take notes on the printouts and know what the point of each slide was. All three are happy to have conversations with students outside of class and they're all very nice. As always, never listen to professors when they say the exam won't cover the details. You will have to know everything. There were even some things on the exams that wasn't even in the texts or the lectures, so use wikipedia. All in all, it was a fun class and I learned a lot about biology, which is helpful since my future will involve a lot of biology.",
    "MCDB is a challenging class, do not take it lightly. Do all the reading during the time they give you, do not let it sneak up on you. It may seem like a light class, but the tests are not simple.",
    "MCDB 120 is a pretty good intro bio course. It is not too much work. Most of the test material comes from the lectures rather than the readings, so study the lectures in preparing for tests!",
    "It's the basic intro biology course, only you focus A LOT on the molecular, cellular, and developmental aspects of biology. Expect the cell cycle, trascription and translation, and also egg and sperm."
