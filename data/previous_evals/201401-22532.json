    "This a great introductory course to Cryo EM, especially for someone who hasn't learned about it before.",
    "I would recommend it - it's a nice introduction to a technique that's definitely going to be important going forward.",
    "I would recommend this course to other students -- it fulfills a biophysics requirement, the subject of the course is growing in importance, and it is very well taught, so I think you have a good starting place if you need to use cryo-EM in the future.",
    "You'll learn more than you think, which is actually a good thing. It's a small enough class, so stay engaged and interested in what you're learning."

    "This helped me continue to understand Fourier transforms and how they are applied to the modeling of biological models, which will be helpful in my lab.",
    "This course gave me a nice introduction to electron microscopy, which may or may not be relevant to my research but is definitely important to know going forward as a structural biologist.",
    "I may need to use EM in my research and if that is the case, this course will be very useful. We also covered mathematical operations used in other techniques, which improved my knowledge of the field of structural biology overall.",
    "It gave me a better appreciation of the theory of cryo-EM, which may be helpful when I think about it in the future. I'm never so great about remembering technical details - like what different numbers mean in a table - but understanding the theory - that's what sticks."
