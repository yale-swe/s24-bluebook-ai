   "comments": [
    "Yes. It is a lot of work, so you have to be prepared, but we have really learned so much.",
    "I will definitely recommend this course. You will learn so much!",
    "Hard class. A lot of work, you need to dedicate your life to learning chinese. I would recommend it if you want to learn chinese, but be warned that you need to be disciplined.",
    "If you really want to learn Chinese, this is the best time and situation to do it. The Chinese teachers are very enthusiastic and just plain amazing at what they do. Just be prepared to spend a couple of hours each day studying and doing homework.",
    "If you have an honest desire to learn a new language, take this course. It requires a lot of work and studying, but it really pays off, and you will be astounded at how quickly you will learn a language in just a semester. The class is very well-designed and the workload is definitely worth it.",
    "Wonderful class. Chinese is the most useful language of the 21st century and you would have to be foolish not to pass up this, what may be, the only opportunity to study such a beautiful language. Your improvement is dramatic and what comes out of it is a foundation which will help you perhaps converse with others, get directions to a location, make a phone call, treat someone out for food, or what to say when you visit someone's house. These basics are the most common things used in everyday Chinese speech and lay a powerful foundation. The teachers are incredibly helpful and challenge you to push your limits. I've never enjoyed a class with this much work, but it was definitely which kept me up late at night and forced me to get up early. You will go into your first Chinese course with the notion that you need a language credit, and leave realizing that it has changed your life.",
    "I would recommend this class because it is really a lot of fun and totally worth it if you are willing to put in the few extra necessary hours to study every day.",
    "Favorite class this semester hands down, while definitely the class where I spent the most amount of time studying. Having class every day is a great way to get to know your teacher and the people in your section (who you will feel close to by the end of the semester) and ultimately leads to a very comfortable and fun learning environment.",
    "This course is a great introduction through Chinese. With a variety of in class activities that promote use of this language, as well as close interaction with fellow students, teachers, and TA's, this class definitely helps prepare one to use this language in everyday life. The course covers a range of topics that someone just starting to learn Chinese might come across, from introducing yourself and your family, to hobbies, to asking directions. I would strongly recommend this class for anyone who is looking to start Chinese as a language.",
    "If you really want to learn Chinese, take it. I've learned so much Chinese this semester - it's astounding what the team of teachers can teach you in a semester. That said, I do more work for this class than for the rest of my classes combined. Expect 2+ hours a night, minimum, to really succeed.Also: Light Fellowship",
    "If you are unsure what language to take, I would defintely tell you to take this course. I've always considered myself to be very poor with languages, yet I feel quite confident and fluid with Chinese after 3 months! It's a lot of work, but if you budget 3 hours a day to do Chinese, you'll do very well and learn a lot of Chinese. Make sure you throw away all assumptions about language before taking this course, as Chonese is wildly different to other languages.",
    "I would recommend this course if one want a useful language. It should be noted that this is not a class that can simply be brushed aside. One must stay on top of the workload. However, the workload is very manageable once you get in the pattern.",
    "Strong department, take it definitely if you're slightly interested in Chinese, your Chinese language skill will improve very fast with Yale!",
    "I would definitely recommend it as the teachers are outstanding. Just realize that it is a heavy courseload.",
    "Do you want to learn Chinese? If so, take CHNS 110. The curriculum is useful, the teachers are amazing and you will learn so much. Everyday there is class, a quiz, and homework. Every week there is a oral dictation and every two weeks a chapter test. You will work hard, and Wang Peng is imaginary so unfortunately he cannot help you. But it's a lot of fun, and if you put the effort into to keep up, you will be incredibly satisfied with the progress you make in such a small amount of time.The course incorporates reading, writing, and speaking, though you will focus mainly on speaking, tones and pinyin. Personally I found this be an appropriate focus because it means you can at least speak the language, which will eventually help you write and read sentences as well. I found the daily drills engaging enough to keep me awake even after a night of no sleep, and after a lot of practice, speaking became more organic. Chinese also opens up a lot of cool opportunities like the Light Fellowship and other study abroad options.There are five teachers that rotate every week, but you will get to know them well after having class every day. Each student is given the right amount of attention and the teachers will push you to pronounce correctly, no matter how long it takes. There is an individual tutorial section every week, which is kind of like a nice personalized tutor which also helps a lot.If you wanted to learn Chinese, than Yale is the perfect place to do it. I cannot recommend this course enough; this is how language is meant to be taught."
