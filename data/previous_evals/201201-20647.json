    "Great course to both be exposed to experimental techniques in social science and also to \"get your feet wet\" by actually conducting an experiment",
    "Yes, even with its easiness, Prof. Gerber still provide much relevant insight.",
    "As currently structured, not a whole lot that graduate students with some advanced training in quantitative methods will learn, though reading some interesting experiments and having to run one yourself can be helpful for those with less hands-on experience doing their own experiments."

    "I intend to continue to conduct social scientific and public policy experiments going forward",
    "Mostly, the course was useful in that it gave me the opportunity to design and run an experiment, which I hadn't done before. It was also sometimes useful to read innovative experiments to use as examples fo possible future research. Didn't take away much knowledge on experimental methods that I hadn't had before, though."
