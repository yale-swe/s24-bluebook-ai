   "comments": [
    "Material amount of work, but completely outweighed by the learning experience. Fun class, with tons of solid skills at stake, and a level of difficulty absolutely surmountable. Spanish was my favorite class this whole year - by far.",
    "I would recommend SPAN 120 for a student who is somewhat familiar with Spanish and wants to work on becoming fluent in it. This course is for those who already know a lot of verbs in Spanish and how to conjugate.",
    "Be aware -- the material of this class isn't very difficult and can be grasped with a little bit of practice, but there is so much homework. Be prepared to spend 1.5-2 hours a day completing assignments either online or in your workbook. Despite the quantity of work, I think that the work doesn't prepare you well for the exams which are pretty difficult. The instructors tend to be very good which is a redeeming feature.",
    "If you'd like to learn a language in an effective yet not overly stressful environment, SPAN 120 is a perfect fit. The course never assigned too much or too little work, and the material presented was incredibly relevant to what you would want to learn when approaching a new language. I took the course for fun - not to fulfill a distributional requirement - and I'm really glad that I did, as I'm incredibly pleased with the level of Spanish that it allowed me to achieve in such a short period of time.",
    "It is a very good class. Although some weekends the workload can be quite a lot due to the Videos and activities you need to do.",
    "Great class, great professor. Quizzes and exams are fair but some are definitely harder than others",
    "Like any other intro level language course, this class requires a lot of busy work, but you will be rewarded in the end. By the end of the year you'll be surprised at how far you've come, and (hopefully) will realize that all the Supersite homework was mostly worth it! David's the nicest guy and I would definitely recommend taking the class with him.",
    "I would definitely recommend Spanish 120 for a fellow student. My speaking and listening skills have significantly improved since taking this class, and I have learned a lot more about Latin American cinema, literature, and art. I would recommend taking this class with Mr. Ortega if possible."
