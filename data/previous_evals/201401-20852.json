    "It's a wonderful class and learned a lot.",
    "Excellent experience. This class gives you the opportunity to work and interact with people who have Autism Spectrum Disorder.",
    "I definitely would recommend the class to another student! It's rewarding, you learn a lot both in and out of the classroom setting, and you're exposed to two of the most foremost autism researchers in the world.",
    "Great course if you're considering a future career in psychiatric or medical work. It's a good learning experience too because you work with people with neuropsychiatric disorders personally.",
    "It's all about the placement, Debra lane was great!",
    "Great and unique course. I would absolutely recommend.",
    "Yes I enjoyed the class",
    "DEFINITELY take this class if you can get in. Very relaxed classroom setting and the best part is the practicum. The term paper may seem scary, it's not. They really guide you through it.",
    "Whoever you are, take this class! Take it even if you know nothing about autism. Take it especially if you know nothing about autism. Take it. You will have such a valuable experience. I thoroughly enjoyed this class, which was a comprehensive overview of autism through several different lenses presented by guest speakers. The class was engaging and professor Volkmar is so knowledgable and kind. The practicum component was an especially fulfilling part of this course.",
    "Very different from an average Yale course! A comprehensive overview of autism spectrum disorders, moving very logically through diagnosis and symptoms, research, and social impact and policy. Dr. Volkmar and Dr. McPartland are fantastic professors and I definitely recommend it to every student at Yale.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. It was such a unique experience to get to learn from Professor Volkmar, who is so prominent in the field, and to get to go to the placements each week. I was hesitant about the fact that there are guest lecturers each week, but they're actually very interesting and each speaker has a unique perspective on the topic, from that of a researcher to that of a brother. I don't think you'd get as deep an understanding and as great an appreciation for the complexity of issues involved without all of those different voices. It's important to know going in that the class is in many ways what you make of it, since there's not much work on a weekly basis other than the 3 hour placement and the seminar itself (which is actually lecture-style, though you can ask questions).",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student!",
    "Take this class if you think that you will enjoy the format. The real benefit of this class is the practicum, so only take it if you think that you will find working at a facility for autistic individuals fulfilling and if you have the time to go to the 3hr\/wk shift. I found it incredibly rewarding to work with the students at Chapel Haven and I learned so much about autism spectrum disorders from participating in this placement. The lectures are interesting, but sometimes it seems like they don't fit together and some speakers are much better than others. I loved my experience in PSYC 350, but I can understanding how it might not be the best class for everyone.",
    "An amazing class that teaches you so much! A definite \"must take\" course!!",
    "Great course. Required alot of time and dedication but well worth it. Would definitely recommend to others"
