   "comments": [
    "It's a course that allows reflective thinking and deep exploration of global justice matters.Globalization has a variety of topics to explore and the class allows to research them.",
    "This class was not all that I had hoped it to be. While Professor Pogge is clearly brilliant, he made very few contributions to the class. Professor Acharya was very genial but altogether I felt that the class was poorly structured. The conversations in class were aimless, and it appeared as if the professors put little thought into each week's classes. The readings were interesting but they were not all that well fleshed out during class.",
    "Lots of interesting case studies, but no introductory material and very little in the way of underlying frameworks. Probably best taken if: a) you have taken classes or done reading on global justice and\/or b) you have done significant work in an NGO or multinational organziation and you're looking for some context for your own experiences. Not good if you are expecting a detailed introduction to the idea of global justice, and not great if you really want to talk normatively about the global situation. For a \"philosophy\" class it was startlingly policy-oriented.",
    "The subject matter of this course and all of the readings are excellent. This class addresses a number of extremely important global justice issues from different philosophical perspectives, and I think that everyone interested in international affairs in any respect ought to take a class like this one. However, class discussions could have been better-- it would be helpful if the Professors asked prompting questions to help facilitate discussion, because otherwise the class tends to descend into some prolonged and sometimes awkward silences. Class discussions could definitely use improvement, but overall I still think this class is enlightening and worth taking, and professors Pogge and Acharya are brilliant."
