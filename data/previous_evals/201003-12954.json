    "I would recommend the course because of the professor and the students, but only take it if you like Kant a lot already. Basically, the class is about one of Kant's worse texts. (Worse because it's much more confusing and not as mind-blowing as some of his other work. But it's still Kant, so it's still interesting. It's kind of funny actually. Not \"ha ha\" funny but \"ohh this is sooo Kantian funny.\") That said, it was a really cool group of people and professor. It felt like the class was just made up of all 15 people at Yale (undergrads, grad students, law students) who are obsessed with Kant, and so it was really cool to get to read this text and interpret this text with them. It's a class about really difficult ideas, some of which are probably just irresolvable. Sometimes the ideas are interesting---other times they trend towards the mundane (justifications for traffic law??) and are only interesting because the class and professor made them interesting. Basically you should just take the course if you LOVE political philosophy or LOVE Kant and have already taken all the other Kant courses at Yale--or at least intro ethics and the Critique of Pure Reason. Also Darwall's great.",
    "I'm sure it depends upon the group, but my year it was a demanding seminar, high-level both in terms of the readings assigned and the pace of in-class discussion. It's an opportunity to read things you won't likely have read in detail before: Hobbes, and Kant's political philosophy.Read the Groundwork, if you haven't yet, before starting Kant.",
    "very very challenging, but also rewarding if you're willing to put in the mental effort- how badly do you want to understand this stuff?",
    "Take this class. Prof. Darwall is both a great discussion leader and a serious ethicist in his own right. At times, we got a little off track, but the passion was always there, and the students really had a chance to participate. We had some really sharp kids in the class, and some kant devotees, so discussion was generally very interesting. At times, it can get a little tedious to keep drawing these distinctions between these abstract ethical concepts, particularly in the kant section, but that's the name of the game, and it teaches you to think.",
    "A good class, which covers a bit more material than we can really do fully.",
    "This course is an in-depth reading of two major texts: Hobbes' Leviathan and Kant's Doctrine of Right. We also read Grotius, Pufendorf, and a modern interpretation of Kant's Doctrine of Right by Arthur Ripstein. The issues discussed in this course have to do with the grounding of moral obligation, the concept of rights, and the meta-ethical foundations of political authority. Both as a course in the history of philosophy, and as a course in meta-ethics, ethics, and political philosophy, I highly recommend this course to other students.",
    "If you are a big fan of Kant and want to apply to grad school in philosophy, this course is for you. You'll get great exposure to Kant's moral philosophy, and the grad students who are also taking the course will elevate the discussion to a level you don't get in many other courses. That said, as an undergraduate it can be hard to get a word in edgewise, as the grad students will have a much stronger background in philosophy (and especially Kant). If you can play hardball, you'll get a lot out of it.",
    "This is a difficult course that is worthwhile if you would like to focus on a close reading of Kant and understand his basis and theory of rights."
