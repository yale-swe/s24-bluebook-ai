   "comments": [
    "Interesting overview of non standard economic approach. I would not recommend it to someone interested in quantitative or purely theoretical studies.",
    "I would strongly recommend it, even if you don't categorize yourself as a 'behavioral' person, any graduate student in Economics or Financial Economics program should take it.",
    "Econ 672 is a great course for any student in the Econ department, whether they are interested in Behavioral Finance or not. In addition to receiving an overview of Behavioral Finance, the class also teaches you how to approach and evaluate literature, and how to conduct research on your own.",
    "I would recommend it because you get a very thorough introduction to the field and a good idea of current research topics.",
    "I would recommend this to another student. This is a more advanced course so I do think it would be difficult to do well without a strong background in finance\/econ.",
    "I would recommend the course to anybody interested in Economics from an academic point of view. Especially, anybody interested in finance and or behavioral economics really should take the course."

   "comments": [
    "It gave me a broad based review of the field, got me up to speed on the essentials, allowing me to better choose a particular areas to focus on for my dissertation, or to follow and appreciate current research in the Economics and Finance.",
    "This course increased my knowledge of the field of behavioral finance significantly, but more importantly, also taught me how to evaluate an conduct research. It will contribute signficant to both the topic and methodology of my research.",
    "The class was a very effective way to gain awareness of relevant research in the field of BF. Even if my own research is not directly related, I find this knowledge very valuable. I also found the extensive use of models quite helpful. More broadly, Nick did an excellent job in terms of conveying how to think about research questions and results.",
    "I found the content of this course very helpful in approaching the behavioural aspects of financial access in developing countries.",
    "It was my first course in behavioral economics, and I really enjoyed it. It provided me with a very good overview of what is out there in behavioral finance, and it stimulated my interest in the field."
