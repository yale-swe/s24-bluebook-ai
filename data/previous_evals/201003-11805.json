   "comments": [
    "If you are interested in the subject, take it. Mikhail is very good and discussion flowed well. However, the reading load huge, but the final and midterm papers are shorter than your average junior history seminar.",
    "this class is really great. as a history class, it is really exceptional in the way that part of its purpose is too expand the way you think.",
    "Oh, awesome class!Prof. Mikhail is great! So approachable, so friendly. challenges you to think, but does it in such a comfortable way.He's also a great seminar leader.The readings are very cool. Definitely take it.whether you're majoring in history or mmes or evst or none of the above, it's a great class.",
    "Class is very interesting as a way to understand Middle Eastern history, though students would definitely benefit from already having a base knowledge of that history. Great variety of topics and readings (despite being a small field), and Professor Mikhail is accessible, though generally let discussions arise organically\/based on student questions and direction.",
    "A good class-very interesting! A lot of reading, but most of it is skimmable and still meaningful. Two papers, and one day of leading discussion. On the whole, I really liked it!",
    "Wonderful class, you'll read a good portion of the literature on the Environmental History of the Middle East. Lots of reading, but the writing load is very, very sensible. Mikhail is the best seminar leader I've had at Yale, he knows how to keep the discussion flowing and ideas coming, without ever dominating. I guarantee you'll learn a lot. Take if you are interested in the Middle East, a historian willing to branch out, an anthropologist or archeologist, or into environmental studies.",
    "Yes! This course is really interesting from a lot of angles. Good alternative\/deep history background to the Middle East, interesting intellectual discourse about the meanings of technology, development, progress, civilization, and a unique opportunity to engage a small but growing and important field - environmental history.",
    "I definitely recommend it. To me, it was an incredibly interesting, new way to look at and understand some of the history of the Middle East, adding nuance and complexity to my understanding. Sometimes the reading is a little dry, but all of the information is still incredibly worthwhile."
