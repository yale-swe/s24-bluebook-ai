    "DS Philosophy is one of the more difficult components of the DS program. Given that most students have not written philosophy papers during their high school careers, the essays can present a bit of a challenge. Professor Sattler is really great at making sure everyone understands all of the arguments, so if you read all the material, she can elucidate the more difficult points for you. DS teaches you to read at lightning-fast speed, and if you finish all the reading, you will feel extremely accomplished. The only downside is that you really have to be the DS-type person to appreciate the material at all. If you don't really have a passion for it, don't bother.",
    "I highly recommend it.",
    "In terms of DS, I think Sattler is one of the better options and I definitely recommend her course.",
    "Directed Studies Philosophy is more a history of philosophy class than a philosophy class, in that it deals not so much with issues, but with important philosophers in a chronological order. Certain themes (the soul, the nature of being, the highest end of humanity) are constant throughout these philosophers, but they are not pursued inthemselves, they are only selected in a secondary sense (or so a Stoic might put it). If you're into DS for the philosophy, think long and hard about that, and shop some other philosophy classes for comparison.Barbara Sattler's section isn't the most exciting, but it is one of the most useful. She is very faithful and methodical about the texts, and she can be enormously clarifiying. She's also a very endearing and approachable professor, which helps when the subject is as intimidating as Philosophy.",
    "A lot of material is covered in this course, beginning with Plato and ending with Anselm. There is definitely a lot of text, but it is interesting and the discussions make the material easy to understand.",
    "I would recommend this class with great enthusiasm to anyone who is REALLY interested in the readings and in philosophy in general. If you like to talk about arguments, what makes an argument valid or sound, and if you want to REALLY understand Aristotle, Plato, the Stoics and the Skeptics, take this class. Be aware that there are three papers, each 4-6 pages (it's really flexible), and that there are no midterms, but that there is a pretty difficult final examination. Also, there is a LOT of reading, and it's philosophy too, so be aware that half of the time you will feel frustrated and confused. But if you get Professor Barbara Sattler, you will actually be able to say that you know philosophy. Basically, if you stay on top of your work (as in, DO THE READINGS), you'll be fine. You'll walk out of each discussion feeling inspired. Take this class - you'll feel so rewarded.",
    "If you want to know the great arguments of Western Civilization, take DS. It's a quick speed through everything, but you will end up with a good foundation!",
    "If you get Prof Sattler, do all the reading, you can't bullshit your way around like in Lit or HP. It's a great opportunity to learn the texts from an amazing and accessible Professor.",
    "Yes! A rewarding sweep of incredible ideas; exciting in itself and immensely valuable (perhaps even necessary) for almost any other future discipline one pursues.",
    "I would say that it was a great overview of philosophy. I would certainly recommend it to another student because it really allows you to gain a perspective on what a philosophy course would be like at the university level.",
    "Great class. Different way of thinking, and for that reason probably the most interesting section of Directed Studies. Reading material I would never really grasp on my own.",
    "Philosophy was the hardest course of the DS trio; I struggled often to understand the reading. Yet it was worth it. While you may never return to some of the books you read, other thinkers' works - specifically Aristotle's and Plato's, and even, to an extent, Augustine's - will pop up again and again as you go about the world. That is, these thinkers' thoughts have had repercussions that echo continually today. And take this course with Sattler, if you can. She is brilliant; an excellent professor.",
    "I would definitely recommend it--it's a great philosophy course and it has helped me in all of my other courses (even the non-DS course)."
