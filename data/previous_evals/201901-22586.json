    "Learned a lot about laplace\/fourier transforms, convolutions, image processing, and cardiac and EMG models.",
    "I gained insight about image processing as well as signal acquisition and filtering. The course complimented what I learned in physiological systems lab very well.",
    "Linear systems applied to modeling biological systems and diagnostic tools",
    "I learned that I have the inner strength to learn and apply information that have absolutely no interest in. I do not understand why this class is REQUIRED.",
    "I learned about signal processing and filtering, and the math that goes into doing that.",
    "Lot about modeling the cardiovascular system using physics principles. How to manipulaye images. Tbh really not what Im into. So... ya know",
    "Learned about convolution and circuits",
    "I learned about the mathematics and physics behind medical applications like ekg, mri, etc.",
    "I learned more about biomedical signals."

   "comments": [
    "Both Duncan and Staib seem to be very interested in the topic, which makes the course more interesting although Prof Staib's lectures can be a bit monotonous. There were some inconsistencies\/confusion with which transform tables to use, but this was a minor problem. Psets were appropriately challenging and about only once every other week. Stopped going to TA sessions once they seemed to be unprepared or not that helpful. They also did not give any feedback on psets.",
    "The subject matter had potential to be interesting but the presentation was a little dry. The best parts were the intro to machine learning and the modeling of the cardiovascular system.",
    "Once you get a grasp on some of the basic course concepts, it feels interesting and useful course for modeling. Until then, though, you're gonna feel pretty lost and frustrated",
    "This course. Every time I walk into the classroom with just a basket of happiness that is slowly but surely drained from my body as the class continues for an unbearable 75 minutes. Professor Duncan and Professor Staib seem like kind people, but they do not know how to teach an engaging course. Staib is the worse of the two as he just reads slides that are copy\/pasted directly from the reading material in a soul sucking monotone. At least Duncan will growl sometimes when he makes a mistake which is fun. I won't say I didn't learn anything, but I'm not sure these people helped me learn it. The TAs were helpful. This is only because they have to just hand out answers because they don't really have a strong grasp on the specific information taught in class. Honestly, the BME department is in desperate need of women of color. I can't take another class like this. This is the worst class I have taken at Yale. I am a STEM major so that is saying something.",
    "Strengths: TAs were very available by email to answer questions. Weaknesses: class was not at all interactive, lectures were often boring. The material that was on the problem sets often did not follow from the material from class, or, occasionally, even from the textbook. The class was co-taught by two professors but I felt that the material that each one taught did not follow from the other's.",
    "Personally not interested in material and feel most of it I wont use sgain",
    "Lecturing for Staib was very difficult to pay attention too",
    "This course is very clear in lecture and in problem sets with what it expects you to know, which is very helpful. I think the course could be improved if we got to observe more applications in class (like the Fourier imaging app)",
    "This course was very boring at times and I think it could have been taught better."

   "comments": [
    "BME requirement. But interesting if you really want to learn about how your instagram filters work.",
    "Eh, if you're taking it its likely as a BME requirement. if you're actually interested in linear systems and their applications, probably take a better taught math or EE course",
    "You got to put the killing thing in your mouth (this is a required class in BME), but don't let the killing thin kill you or whatever. If you are not BME, run for the hill geez.",
    "Not particularly - this class was boring and focused a lot on foundational math skills which are important but not at all what I was expecting going in. it is required for the BME major though. it got a bit more interesting towards the end of the class where we actually started to learn about images.",
    "Just not my thing so not into it",
    "Nah",
    "I would recommend this course because you come out of it with tangible knowledge of Laplace and Fourier applications, but the class itself is not overly stressful.",
    "I would not recommend it for non-BME majors.",
    "Not unless they are required to take it for their major, if not I would say to stay away from it."
