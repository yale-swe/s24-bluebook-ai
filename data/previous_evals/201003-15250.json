    "It is a continuation of French study, nothing special.",
    "It was hard to keep up with this class. Too much reading, which is not realistic since everyone has other classes. I DO like how organized the class was -- it's clearly the product of many years of FREN 140. The tests were fair. I wish we did more speaking in class, because that is my weakest point. However -- I DID feel like my French improved. I would recommend it, for sure.",
    "I would recommend the class. It's a daily amount of homework, but if you spend your time wisely, especially over the weekend, you can do most of the homework for the week in a few hours. That way, you don't have to do the homework over the week. The readings are usually interesting, and most of them, with the exception of Un Sac de Billes, are fairly short.",
    "I would, the workload and tests seemed pretty reasonable with some tougher and some easier periods in the course.",
    "This class is really helpful for really cementing an understanding of the details of French grammar, and the readings and movies are pretty cool. Just don't get a morning class.",
    "I would absolutely recommend it - I found it fun yet challenging. It hits major points of grammar and then underlines them with readings in French while building vocab and speaking ability. I think that's the perfect way to teach a foreign language."
