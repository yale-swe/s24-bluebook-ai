   "comments": [
    "Yes. Everything about my French has improved: my speaking, reading comprehension, listening and grammar skills. What is most important is that I now am confident in my French abilities. I credit French 140 05 for this.",
    "I highly recommend it, especially if you plan to continue French. Or only if you sincerely want to increase your French exposure... it is a lot in terms of homework.",
    "It is easy to absorb soo much information from this class due to its small size and daily meetings. If you are interested in french in any way, it is a wonderful class to take.",
    "Highly recommended! Madam Skorupa is passionate, personable, and fun to take French with!",
    "Definitely, but have the time to dedicate to it, as there's a steady stream of work that's a shame to skimp on as its very well designed to make you learn French well. Mme. Skorupa's great though; the reading is decent and you do learn a lot with a diversity of work from the packet to papers and projects.",
    "The material of 140 is a continuation of 130, with a slightly heavier emphasis on literature and a little less grammar. It was a nice balance of practical linguistic information and literary themes (i.e. French in different cultures: Vietnam, Algiers, Senegal). I particularly appreciated Mme Skorupa and my classmates. It was a wonderful environment in which to learn and participate. Mme S. has a wonderful and encouraging style; she is superb! Definitely take a class with Mme Skorupa, if you have the opportunity.",
    "It's a good course. Fairly easy and not too much work. Especially if you can get your hands on an English translation of Un Sac de Billes it is a breeze. You have to take it to get to the next level so it's a necessary class but if you can test higher that would be much more efficient.",
    "I would recommend the French program and French 140 to another student for many of the reasons I mentioned above. I think the French Program is wonderfully structured. Theon-line listening activities are very helpful and the regular assignments have always made me feel well prepared for the exams. I feel that my French has definitely improved through taking this course and that I have had opportunities for improving my speaking and grammar equally. The course has a very regular schedule, but the final presentations for level 4 added a great variety of information and encouraged engaging class discussions. I really enjoyed the course and felt the assignments were appropriate and helpful for my learning the French language.",
    "Just a regular language class. Take it if you must, and then keep on taking French! It's fantastic!"
