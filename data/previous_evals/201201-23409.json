    "I really enjoyed the condensed format of the course. I would even recommend trying to do the course in 1 week if possible. I would prefer having the course take place earlier in the semester, though, to give more time for working on the paper. As it is currently structured, the class ends right before spring break, meaning that students have only 6 weeks or so after spring break to get all of the research and writing done--which can be a challenge if one needs to send emails to people working in the field and wait for responses.",

    "The schedule",
    "More structured lectures",
    "It would be great to be able to learn more from classmates - it would be great to maybe have presentations or informal chats about all of our projects. It might also be good to set up a law librarian coming to class to give a little tutorial on how to use law library resources optimally.",
    "This law course is supposed to compare the legal issues of utmost importance and finally one should know that where and what is better and where and is the best."
