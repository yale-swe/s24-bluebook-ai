    "This class provided an excellent entry into the topics of language death and language revitalization, which I had never encountered before. I think the time made it difficult to fully engage with the material, which was a sad fact for everyone in the class. Professor Errington did what he could with that understanding, though it felt painful at times for him to try to tap dance through 2 hours. Maybe dividing the class into two 1-hour periods, or moving it to a different time slot, would help.Professor Errington did everything he could to make this class as exciting as possible. Sometimes the readings were extremely heavy and particularly dense,a combination that he would be wary of and justify for the first 20-25 minutes of the class before we participated in the discussion. At that point, it felt like there was nothing more to discuss. I think having ONE theory and ONE conflicting theory and ONE ethnographic example to depict it would make each week seem more manageable...",
    "I'd recommend this as a 5th or 6th class. It wasn't especially academically rigorous, but you can have a lot of fun with the final paper if you pick a topic you're interested in. Be ready to participate often in discussion. It's a small class, so if there are lots of quiet people, there will be lots of awkward silences.",
    "Yes!",
    "There's no surprises about workload and its not a heavy workload class as long as you keep up with your research throughout the semester. You learn a lot about different cultures via studying their language situation and gain a realistic view of what can be done to save a language, and just as importantly, what can't be done. For anyone interested in foreign languages or cultures, linguistics, or doing their own anthropologic research, I'd say take the class. It's very small so it's easy to develop a relationship with the professor and pursue individual interests as a class if you choose to.",
    "This is a good anthropology class about endangered languages. I'd takena course on endangered languages in the linguistics department, and it was good to get a critical perspective on the way language endangerment and revitalization are usually talked about. There is not a lot of work: readings and an independent research project at the end of the semester - If you are interested in endangered languages, definitely take it!",
    "The class is kind of interesting; after a while though I didn't have much interest in the readings, and the class discussion is often not very useful in explaining them. It's nice to have a final project that's open ended that you work on near the end of the course, though basically the second half of the whole semester just involved coming to class and listening to student presentations."
