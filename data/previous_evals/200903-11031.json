    "I would strongly recommend this class to anyone who is interested in both modeling and comparative politics.",
    "I would recommend it to any student interested in comparative politics, modeling or political economy.",
    "I would definitely recommend it to a student. It provides a deep introduction into a number of commonly used models in comparative politics.",
    "I would recommend the class to those interested in comparative politics. It is a helpful tool for thinking systematically about the relationship between complex political processes and generally contributes to one's ability to responsibly consume and engage contemporary comparative political material.",
    "See description in response to Question 1.I would highly recommend this course to another student (and have been recommending it throughout the semester).",
    "Yes.",
    "This course won't teach you how to create formal models but it will help you to be familiar with and understand the basics of several of the most well-known formal models in political science. If you want to be comfortable with Acemoglu and Robinson, Persson and Tabellini, or alpha, tau and omega, this is a good course for you. If you can't stand hearing about democracy, regimes, or taxes, then its probably not."

    "It helped me deepen my knowledge of modeling and comparative politics. I believe it will contribute to my research topic as well.",
    "It contributed a lot in showing how formal models are useful forconveying comparative insights and increasing my confidence to have a formal model in my dissertation.",
    "I hope to develop a model for my dissertation so this class provided useful examples.",
    "This course enabled me to read and understand papers with formal models, which were before now inaccessible. I am not sure yet how the course will contribute to my research, but I would now considering building a formal model as part of my dissertation.",
    "After taking this course I feel like (with time and effort) I could read through and mostly understand just about any political science paper using formal models. Before, my approach to a modeling paper was to read the conclusion, skip the math, and see whether other people believed the paper or not before forming my own opinion. It's pretty empowering to be able to make my own judgments but it's too early to know whether this will play out in my dissertation. I highly doubt it will apply."
