   "comments": [
    "Giving very practical and useful tools for community program evaluation!",
    "This class was perfect in the amount of real world application that it allowed.",
    "Strength -The lecture material is well organized and the notes are helpful.I - The critique was a good opportunity for us to develop some skills Weaknesses -The case studies in class were not very helpful and I wasn't sure what I was suppose to be taking away from it. - There was too much lecturing and not enough time to work with our groups or to do more practical work. - The relationships with the Health Department were not that strong and it didn't feel like our project would be particularly useful for them. - Perhaps it would be better if after teaching about a topic (ie. logic model), we should get time to work on our logic model in class with our groups and the professors can give feedback. Make the logic model due as an assignment for the next week, instead of in a large chunk at the half-way point. This would keep groups on track and we can think about how the topic relates back to the project. - The mid-term test felt unnecessary for such an \"applied\" class. - Group sizes should all be equal.",
    "Strengths: Allows for engagement with real-life situations. Weakness: The structure of the material is not great as it does not coincide with the timeline for when materials need to be turned in. This needs to be reorganized. In addition, there is no group work time included in class time; this could be a great time for both instructors to provide feedback and guidance. I suggest looking into Debbie Humphries class structure, as her structure is great.",
    "A good course with room to become better. Strengths: covers several useful topics for program evaluation; introduced the case studies early; had opportunity to work with real programs; reasonable project\/assignment deadlines. Weaknesses: Lectures were not always very engaging or covered at well. Certain topics could have been covered with less detail (the ethics lecture and the stakeholder lecture).",
    "The course provided an introduction to the use of program evaluation in public health practice. Although a lot was learned in this course, I feel that too much was covered in too short amount a time. It would have been more useful to spend an adequate amount of time on each topic, even if we covered half of the topics.",
    "Working on a real world program evaluation for the New Haven Department of Public Health was such a wonderful experience!",
    "The course has a lot of potential. The material is incredibly important, and I think receives for little attention elsewhere at YSPH. The partnership the professors established with the New Haven DOH is really cool, and I think could be really good with more time and trust. Unfortunately, the lectures are not very engaging at all - they scratch at the surface and don't really ask for much from students. The group work in class doesn't really supplement the material well\/is not very interesting.",
    "The tutors are very experienced and knowledgeable about the course, and the applied evaluation project allowed me to consolidate course material and learn to work with my colleagues and stakeholders on such a project.",
    "Great course, lot of work",
    "This course provided an informative overview of program evaluation. However, It would have been helpful to have smaller parts of the evaluation plan due throughout the semester in order to receive more feedback on our plans. It also would have been helpful to see more examples of finished evaluation plans.",
    "I thought it was very valuable to gain experience with a real health program. My main critique of the course is that I think the lectures could be more practical, perhaps functioning as workshops for each team's evaluation project, rather than focusing so much on more general concepts. But overall, I valued the experience this course offered.",
    "The focus of classes should be more clear each time. Sometimes lectures were vague and hard to implement.",
    "Great opportunity to learn skills that can be utilized in community health programs. Great opportunity to work with local organizations and the health department."

    "Instructor: Kathleen O'Connor Duffany \u00a0I appreciated Dr. Duffany's attention to detail in the feedback she offered. My only suggestion is for more prompt feedback, or perhaps to provide feedback more comprehensively, since it sometimes felt my team was receiving feedback in bits and pieces and sometimes after long waits.",
    "Instructor: Kathleen O'Connor Duffany \u00a0She was always very helpful and responsive with any questions. Very approachable and helped us think critically while designing the course programs."

   "comments": [
    "The two teachers took turns to present in the class and looks very interesting, like a kind of folk dance. However, they are super nice and excellent teacher. Their course design was towards practical and offer you direct opportunity to work with New Have Health Department.",
    "I would definitely recommend it",
    "I was disappointed by this class and how little I got out of it. I thought that it would be much more applied and that the course could really benefit from having stronger relationships with the Health Department and giving us projects that would be useful. This would make us more accountable for the work we do for them. Lectures are unnecessarily long",
    "Good for some basic skills in program evaluation. A useful exercise in understanding how to engage the process of evaluation.",
    "Great course. A comprehensive introduction to program evaluation with a great project which applies course material.",
    "A course that will help in any field",
    "This course provides an overview of the steps needed to conduct a successful program evaluation. I would recommend this course to another student, though it is a more theory-based than practice-based course.",
    "Nice course to understand fundamentals of evaluation",
    "Great class if you want to get the skills involved in program evaluation. We are also introduced to other topics that are related in the field. Some programs we had to evaluate were not running and barely existed which can be a bit difficult to work with but it will be a great learning experience in the end."
