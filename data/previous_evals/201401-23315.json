    "Yes!",
    "You read and write essays. There are workshops and reading responses and simple projects. The discussion is good and the people in the class really care about the topic so there is good conversation. 4 essays of about 5 pages, spaced out well, is pretty minimal for a fun writing credit. If the topic interests you, absolutely take it.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class.",
    "A lot of class time is spent organizing things - assignments, schedules, etc. instead of discussing the readings. That's too bad because the readings are readings are really good and a lot of fun. It also makes you feel like a lot of what happens in class could have been communicated via email, which is a silly use of time. That being said, the assignments are varied and really fun. You get a sense of different kinds of food writing - memoirs, research, restaurant reviews. Overall I really liked the class, but be prepared to enjoy out of class time more than class time, unless some changes are made. But when else can you go out to eat and watch a movie and call it work?",
    "ENGL121 07 is a solid and interesting writing credit. Take it if you're genuinely interested and not for the novelty of \"ooh look a class about food!\"--that will grow old quickly. In general, though, it was roughly what I expected, and I would recommend it.",
    "Don't take it even if you enjoy food. It is not a productive use of precious Yale credits.",
    "I would recommend this class if you need a writing credit or enjoy personal writing. You must be interested in food topics or at least interested in giving it a try!",
    "Take it. Enjoyable class, not too much work.",
    "This was a really fun class. It feels very similar to ENGL120, but with a more specific focus. Also, we did other activities that are definitely more food-based, which was engaging and exciting. Moderately high amount of reading and at least some form of writing or a project due every week, though."
