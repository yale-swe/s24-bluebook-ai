   "comments": [
    "You'll learn a lot. Lecture is sometimes engaging. Can feel a bit long at times. Not incredibly difficult, though the lectures don't really prepare for the homeworks which don't really prepare you for the quizzes. The TAs are solid. Take if you're actually interested, otherwise it'll be painful.",
    "This class is great for learning the basics of linguistics; I recommend this class if linguistics really interests you. The professor was a good lecturer and pretty funny. Overall, the class is not too much work, and the problem sets aren't too difficult. I'm glad I took this class.",
    "Professor Bennett was awesome and he made the class enjoyable. The material is already really interesting, and he added little asides about random linguistic errata that truly made the class. Take it!",
    "It's a great introduction to linguistics as a field, and all the pieces within it. If you're interested in linguistics and want to learn more, this is the class to take.",
    "Absolutely. Great survey course of an interesting topic that you don't really get to learn in high school. Workload is very light. Not a gut class, but definitely a minimal effort class. Only 8 or so short homeworks, 3 medium length quizzes, and a cumulative final. I got good grades without reading any of the book, too. Lecture is pretty good and the TAs (at least this year...) were awesome.",
    "Certain aspects are quite scientific\/theoretical, which I enjoyed but could be dry for some people; others are less well-defined\/scientific and more philosophical. Covers a wide range of topics and gives a good taste of the many different fields of linguistic.",
    "I would recommend it. It's a pretty easy class with some homeworks and a few quizzes. I found it very interesting and did well on all the assignments. Definitely my favorite class this semester.",
    "I would recommend this class if you want to explore a totally new discipline (not many people learn this stuff in high school) or if you've always been interested in linguistics. Otherwise, you might get bored of it halfway through.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who thinks they might be interested in linguistics. It's pretty interesting usually, but it can be tedious at times. Take it with Ryan Bennett.",
    "I took this course because I needed a social science cr. I didn't love the class because during the course I realized that I really did not like studying linguistics, but other people in the class who really liked linguistics seemed to enjoy the class. Prof. Bennet and both TAs were very helpful and approachable if you had any questions. If you need a SO credit, I recommend shopping this course.",
    "Unless you are a linguistics major, this is interesting class, if you take it credit D\/fail.",
    "This is a solid survey of the major sub-fields of linguistics, including phonetics, phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics, and pragmatics. If you are at all interested in any of those areas, take this course. Prof. Bennet's lectures are engaging even when the material isn't exactly riveting.",
    "LING 101 was my favorite class this semester and if you are at all considering a major in linguistics or just want to know what it is TAKE THIS CLASS. The workload is light. We had a problem set due every two weeks or so and you can work withother students on them and they're actually kind of fun and amusing at times. I always did linguistics homework first because it was something I looked forward to. Ryan is an amazing professor and so dedicated to his topic and to making you love it, and his lectures will make you walk out of class with a smile on your face and fascinating facts to tell your friends. The final exam was straightforward and Ryan didn't test us on obscure facts that were only talked about once, as some of my other professors did. I so enjoyed taking this class and would take it again if I could receive credit again. Highly recommended to any and every student. Whether you're interested in science and need a social science credit or you're a social science kid looking for something new and intriguing. Take it with Ryan. You won't regret this at all. Best part of the semester and made me decide to major in Linguistics.",
    "Ling 110 is a standard overview of the basic topics in linguistics: phonetics, phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics, pragmatics, and dialect\/multilingualism. You'll learn the IPA for English sounds and how to do linguistic analysis in all of those categories. If you're interested in getting a solid foundation in linguistics, take this class.I'd especially recommend this class to QR-oriented students looking for a solid So class. Linguistics is a very analytical discipline and the problems should be approachable for people who are used to dealing with hard math and science.",
    "TAKE IT! Such a good intro class, and a really good social science course, especially if you're a science major looking for something with psets (like me). Also take it with Professor Bennett if you can, he was great!",
    "Don't expect to go too much in-depth on any one area of linguistics; that's not the goal of the class. As a broad survey of the whole field, it's great and is filled with interesting curiosities from languages around the world. Take if you don't know a lot about the field and you'll see the kind of work you could be doing more of in other classes in the department.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to students who are considering majoring in Linguistics (obviously), but also to students who are just curious about linguistics and would like to learn more about it."
