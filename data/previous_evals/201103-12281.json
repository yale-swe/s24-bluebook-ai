   "comments": [
    "Yes, but only if you're interested in Spinoza or heavy-duty metaphysics. Otherwise, it's difficult to get a grasp on the material even though Professor Della Rocca is amazing.",
    "Highly recommended. Philosophy 404 is not just a course about Spinoza, it is an innovative interpretation that challenges you to see Spinoza and yourself in a different light.",
    "Honestly, unless you know you like The Ethics (and please look at the book first!!) I would not recommend taking this course. God Bless MDR though, and if you want the Ethics - he is the person to do it with.",
    "Yes. Although there's not a whole lot of Spinoza's material, especially in the first part of the class, you go very deep into The Ethics. You obviously have to have an interest in Spinoza, but if you have any interest in philosopher's around that time (like Descartes, Leibniz or Hume) this class is wonderful. It's actually fine whatever level you're at, and the class provides both an introduction to and deep analysis of contemporary debates about Spinoza (which also shed light on other topics in Philosophy and about other thinkers around Spinoza). Professor Della Rocca is also fantastic. Go to office hours and hang out with him. I suppose in short, I would recommend the course to someone somewhat or very interested in the material."
