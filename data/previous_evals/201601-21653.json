    "ENGL 010 01 is a great class for any student (Janeite or not) who is interested in reading some of literature's greatest novels. It does require a lot of reading, but it is an amazing feeling to know you have read all of Jane Austen's canon by the end of the semester. The essays a great practice for literary analysis and it is always great to be in a small seminar setting.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. Even if you don't think you'll like Jane Austen, Markovits is so brilliant, and the class is sort of inherently infused with this literary feminism that I love. It was so amazing to be in a class of mostly women (though that will change from semester to semester). Markovits is brilliant and kind. I can't say enough about this class.",
    "If you are someone who enjoys reading Jane Austen, you should definitely take this class! Professor Markovits goes really in depth with the books and many of the students around you are potential English majors, so they are able to contribute and improve your own sense of the novels. However, I know there were some people who were intimidated by the fact that there were many English majors who were very knowledgeable and very skilled in both writing and critical reading.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. Reading all of these books was an great intellectual challenge, and I'm pleased to have accomplished it. I really learned a great deal--about Austen, about English literature, about the human condition.",
    "The Jane Austen seminar is a semester-long exploration of all of Austen's works, from her early writings through her final novel. The course's format emphasizes the common themes and plot structures that pervade Austen's work, leading to a deep understanding of what her literary project really attempts to do. I would wholeheartedly recommend this course to any student interested in literature, not just in Austen herself. I hadn't read any of her works before taking the course.",
    "This freshman seminar on Jane Austen was my favorite class this year. I would definitely recommend it to another student, but be aware that it is quite a lot of reading!",
    "You read all of Jane Austen and really do comparison between her novels. Would definitely recommend.",
    "I would recommend this class, but you have to know what you are getting yourself into. It's a lot of reading. A lot. But the discussion in class is great and you hear things that you may have never thought of yourself. Also, if you are a STEM major who needs a writing credit, this is probably not the class for you. If you love Austen but do not have the time because of a heavy course load, you may want to credit\/D the class because you get all the perks of the discussion without the pressure of having to fully commit to it, same for a STEM person. In this course, you basically read one Jane Austen book a week, have to do a one page analysis per book that you post to classesv2, and then there's a short 2 page essay, a 5-6 page midterm, and a 10-12 page final. Prepare well.",
    "Definitely apply for the class, and if you get in, take it. You will not regret it. I am an Austen fan coming into the class, but I would say as long as you enjoy literature, or simply want to become a better writer and a better (close) reader, this class will be the perfect match. This class made my freshman year and I will highly recommend it to anyone."
