   "comments": [
    "Readings and workload were manageable. The course presents histories of Los Angeles that are rarely covered in other courses (unless you're an ER&M major). I highly recommend this course to anyone from Los Angeles and any others who may be interested in getting to know more than the glorified b.s. that you see in movies.",
    "It was a real interesting class and I loved learning about this time period in LA. There is a lot to learn and it isn't a topic that is often discussed.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student interested in the material. The topic is interesting in itself and the kind of media archaeology involved is interesting and a valuable skill, but it would be easy to disengage during seminars without a desire to learn to about the material.",
    "It's okay. The class seems to go over the same basic ideas again and again.",
    "This is one of the coolest classes at Yale, for sure. I love courses in which I'm engaging with material that doesn't get taught in traditional courses - in which we learn to value activists, musicians, artists, and other cultural workers who don't make it to the history books. This class combines readings in urban history, social movements, community organizations, and cultural expression to help students engage with questions about what truly defines a city. It definitely pushed me to think about how media and history has shaped our concepts of space, place, and belonging. The films were also all incredibly fascinating and I wouldn't have explored them otherwise. Another plus is that the workload wasn't overwhelming, which allowed me to have more time to engage the material at my own pace. I'm really glad I ended up taking this class!",
    "Absolutely. Los Angeles is a really interesting city, and there's a lot that I think the general public doesn't know about it. I'm from Los Angeles, and I learned SO much. This is the time when Los Angeles really rose to prominence on a national and international scale, and so reflects a lot of what was going on in the country. It's really a great class and delves in to a lot of how the media represents Los Angeles, who controls the media, who owns the media, how can the production of media be political, etc. Fantastic class, I recommend it."
