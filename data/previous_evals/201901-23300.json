   "comments": [
    "The guest lectures and discussions were great",
    "I learned a lot about myself. There was a lot of time for reflection on my personal leadership style, my role and behaviors in teams, and the strategy involved in network thinking.",
    "Nothing really. It is all common sense and should be a half semester course at max.",
    "I get to know myself better and team dynamics",
    "Improved self-awareness, better communication, frameworks for working with and modeling teams, plus a survey of SOM faculty that made me interested in taking additional management classes!",
    "I learned about how to think more critically about my interactions with others by looking first at myself.",
    "I learned some cool things about myself. I learned some of my strengths and some new perspectives on how to apply them in group situations. I got some new perspectives on my weaknesses and now have more productive ways to analyze and work with them.",
    "Lots of practice of some interpersonal skills, and some new knowledge around the science behind many psychological, network and team based components",
    "I gained knowledge on network building and learned more about how to reflect on my own interests and the ways I operate in professional settings.",
    "Worst class ever!!!",
    "I really got a good sense of learning about myself and working as a team. I'd say the last segment was a little bit more vague, but on the whole I learned quite a bit. Interesting experience.",
    "I learned a number of enjoyable lessons in this class, among them, \"Just ASK!\"",
    "Skills to better understand myself, myself in the context of groups\/teams and how to take advantage of new and existing networks.",
    "This course was insightful on many levels: individual, group, and network building. I enjoyed learning more about myself and my teammates. The group exercises that were conducted during the semester were engaging.",
    "This class has helped me identify more clearly what particular interpersonal dynamics make me feel safe to particpiate and when I pull back. During the course of this semester and particularly in the Hurricane exercise I have learned a lot about my role in a team. For as long as I can remember, I have been struggling with feelings of inadequacy and social anxiety. I sensor myself and dont always speak up due to fear of being judged by others. To me the Hurricane exercise was such an eye-opening experience as it made me think about how I would have acted in a situation that was life-threatening",
    "I learned SO MUCH about working with people - skills I'll take with me into my career. How to listen, give feedback, think about building teams, approach problem-solving, learning about myself and how to work with others.",
    "I learned much about my own strengths as a person. I also gained fascinating insight into how problems are approached and how to best solve them with people, from team dynamics to networks to relationships to listening.",
    "The course helped me gain a deeper insight into my own strengths\/weaknesses in a team setting and it made me reflect deeply about how I can improve my team work skills\/emotional intelligence in the future.",
    "This course teaches you how to master the most difficult skill - people skill. The class has added significant value to my career. Some of the main themes of the class are knowing yourself, defining purpose, improving group dynamics, change management, giving and receiving feedback, power & influence etc.",
    "A lot of skills relating to working with others, and most importantly, skills for understanding my own self and why I am perceived the way I am.",
    "Deeper dive of how to evaluate and understand myself, teams, and networks. Insights into skills like persuasion, difficult conversations, working across differences, network based leadership, etc.",
    "Learned about professional relationships and my own personal strengths and weaknesses interacting with others",
    "The first half of the course was especially helpful because it gave me a better sense of my own work and communication style. I learned a lot from my pod-mates because we were, by design, all very different from one another. The course segments about multi-level listening, unconscious bias, and team structure are all concepts that will be useful to me in my future work.",
    "I was expecting to learn interpersonal skills to better enable my ability to work with others.",
    "Network mapping, best-self insights, knowledge of group behavior, new friends in the FES\/SOM\/Yale College community",
    "This class taught me a lot about myself and how I engage with other people, as well as how to set up teams for success and cultivate a network.",
    "The power profile was very insightful and useful.",
    "Th first module was incredibly helpful in getting to know my working style. the insights and power profiles will be key as I develop in my professional career."

   "question_text": "How well did the knowledge, skills, and insights gained in this class align with your expectations?",
   "comments": [
    "Not really that much, but I learned a lot",
    "I think just reading the name I had zero expectations. When I sat in the class, I got excited and read through the syllabus and I think my expectations aligned pretty well from there.",
    "Low. I was expecting way more than I got from this course.",
    "Yes somewhat",
    "The class did not meet my expectations; I had heard good things about it from previous students and last year's course reviews, but upon taking it, I don't feel that I gained as much as I was expecting.",
    "Met expectations",
    "This class was pretty much what I expected. It's a really valuable topic that doesn't get enough attention elsewhere at FES.",
    "Pretty well.",
    "I didn't have that many expectations so well",
    "Unfortunately, I feel as if this class did not live up to my expectations. The first module of the course was very interactive, however, the rest of the modules did not feel as helpful.",
    "Didn't learn anything useful, total waste of time. Inviting Dow without giving a context on their negative impact to the world was an insult to the class. They are not preparing students for the real world. Rodrigo Canales needs to not be invited ever back to the class, he was disrespectful to the class.",
    "I got what I expected out of the course and a bit more. Really positive efforts by Stu and the TA team during a tough semester.",
    "More or less the same.",
    "They exceeded my expectations",
    "I had a lot higher expectations for this class. It was marketed like a few of the professional and personal development courses at SOM, but fell short due to the number of topics that were covered in the course in such a short timeframe.",
    "Extremely well. Even better than I had expected because what I learned is so directly applicable to my career and personal life.",
    "Great.",
    "They align pretty well with my expectation.",
    "The first third of the class was great and all I hoped for. The second half was close to useless. I thought most of the lectures after the hurricane exercise were not particularly relevant or helpful.",
    "Very well! There aren't a lot of specific classes, or sections of existing courses, dedicated to personal development, leadership, team building, etc. I really crave those soft skills and think they're crucially important for those of us entering the environmental field, no matter how far along we are in our careers. This course is really one of those that you get out of it what you put in.",
    "A lot of the speakers were from SOM and I was a little surprised that there wasn't more diversity in that regard. Yale has a ton of professors at the college, at the Divinity School, the School of Public Health, the Law School, etc. who I thought would have had a lot to offer for some of the course modules, but we just kept hearing the SOM viewpoint repeatedly. This was okay in some situations, but in others, it felt rather poorly aligned with the interests of most of the people in the room. Zoe Chance gave a talk on influencing without authority and most of the examples she gave seemed to be about selling things. That's all well and good, but most of the folks in the class were from F&ES, where sales is not a primary interest. A talk from someone like Katherine Hollins or Julie Vance about communicating\/influencing environmental change would have aligned better with what most of us actually want to do.",
    "I think that the skills gained in this class generally aligned with my expectations. I would have like a deeper dive into certain sections like the lecture on power while I could have done without the lecture on public health. The first half of the class was better organized and gave me more actionable skills than did the second half.",
    "Poorly--I think for a class on working with people, opportunities should be sought (every class?) to operate as a group under some kind of stress\/pressure. This is where groups are tested most, and one often doesn't recognize how group dynamics play out until these moments. Ultimately, I will remember much more about the interpersonal moments between peers in the class than I will about content of lecturer's presentations. Take that as you will.",
    "very well",
    "Not very much. I did not learn much about persuasion and how to influence a team.",
    "The first module surpassed my expectations. The subsequent modules were not as powerful."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of the course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "There needs to be MUCH better communication on what the instructors expect from assignments and much better feedback on assignments",
    "Strengths: It's a relatively low lift that you end up getting a lot out of. Because there isn't too much actual work to do, there's time to reflect and work through the things you learn in class. The teaching team was also just awesome and modeled everything they were teaching. And being in a pod (a group of students) was also a lovely experience from which I learned a lot. Weaknesses: It was heavily focused on business, so if that is not your area of interest, you may lose interest during some lectures. Also, the lecturers were a little hit or miss depending on the week. Finally, the reflections were graded weirdly. I received marks a little lower than I was expecting from a reflection that I put a lot of thought into. I also didn't receive any comments that told me why I received low marks.",
    "There is no strength of this course as such. The weaknesses are plenty.",
    "The first half of the class is better, and the second half lacks meaningful content",
    "More continuity between guest speakers; more prep with guest speakers to have their lectures be clearly tied in to the course material and building on previous lectures. Some lectures I felt I got nothing out of, and were only tangentially relevant to our class or felt like new information (e.g. the Michelle Bell one, the public health one). I enjoyed the first part of the course with the self-assessments of the Insights and power profiles - those were really helpful in guiding my thinking. However, the course content seriously declined after those first few sessions. I was hoping for more specific and concrete discussions or workshops on examples of issues that have come up in working with people and how to resolve them; the concepts shared felt too nebulous to be effective without digging deeper into how to ACTUALLY apply them. The pod breakouts grew on me but I initially was not a fan; I enjoyed getting to know my podmates but felt that the frequency of breakout discussions in pods wasn't very effective and the questions posed weren't always meaningful enough to make me feel that I should put effort into discussing them. It felt a bit forced.",
    "Strengths: the first two modules of the course seemed the strongest. Got a lot out of the deep dive into self, and enjoyed the work with pods, but could have used additional time to dive further into others' self assessments and learnings from personality types that were not my own. Weakness: module 3 felt less useful and seemed to taper off. Wish the precedent had not been set that readings were optional - engagement with the material seemed to fall off collectively when that became a norm, and made for less useful pod discussions. Wish there was greater clarity on expectations for the pods both inside and outside of class.",
    "I really liked the pod organization of this class. It was cool to be placed with a group of people I didn't know at all and then spend most of the semester with them.",
    "This course has a lot of great ideas. The biggest strength is by far all of the module 1 stuff, which deals with getting to know yourself. Module 2, which deals with groups, was ok, and module 3, networks, was a waste of time. The format of this class was really hard for me to engage with. The instructors and presenters expected everyone in the class to go from deep personal insight and reflection to small group sharing to large group synthesis in rapid succession; I just couldn't do it. I think the presenters need to slow down and stick to a few key points and concepts. Even though I felt uncomfortable, out of place, devalued, and disengaged in class, I still got a lot out of this experience.",
    "I wish we could have spent more time discussing with our pods on topics we were reviewing. There were two or three too many speakers that were just not that engaging (the two male SOM speakers for example) and the material was either not that relevant for the course or not valuable enough to take up an entire class. The topics at the beginning with the personality tests we could've talked about more in our pods or with a partner. Overall, it just never felt like we really got a chance to dig into any topics well enough to cement them or practice them. The pod system is wonderful, podcast were a great idea, the stranded island game was good, so was escape the room, any opportunity that gave a chance to practice and reflect worked really well. Stu and Brad are wonderful people to be teaching this course. The TA team was good. Class discussion on a wide scale worked well.",
    "The Insights Profile was incredibly insightful and helpful. More clear instructions on assignments and pod expectations could help improve the overall atmosphere of the course.",
    "Weaknesses, the papers were too long and completely unnecessary. People did not enjoy writing any paper, it was a waste of time because we caoulcn't reflect on anything learned in class.",
    "Maybe the third module, I'd say that it felt a little more disjointed and some of the focusing on networks felt very abstract versus the concrete discussions of the first two modules.",
    "Strengths: very interesting and often overlooked topics were covered in this course. The entire teaching staff was very kind and approachable. Weaknesses: Could have used more variety in the means for class discussion and the readings for each week were rather redundant and could be cut down.",
    "Strengths: group exercises (hurricane challenge, escape the room, pods for pods) Weaknesses: too much material covered and too many speakers; sometimes group exercises during class were not productive",
    "I think a great strength is the speakers the course brings in. I wish we had had more time for questions in each class. I know most students were often curious about a few things, but it felt that we never had time to pursue those curiosities. Additionally, I felt that Piazza as a tool was not used well. If a post on Piazza is listed on as a pre-class to-do, having that thread already started would be great. Alternatively, if it's not working, my opinion would be just drop it, rather than paying it lip-service alone.",
    "Strengths: I have learned a lot from this class and appreciated the diversity of perspectives that were brought in thanks to the lecturers. There was a good balance between theory and hands-on\/practical application. Weakness: The feedback we received on our papers could have been more speedy.",
    "Strengths: The structure and content of the class is its strength. It's incredibly thoughtful and its work.",
    "Again, I loved the personal best self exercise, the hurricane exercise, and the escape room trip. Those were all fantastic. Everything after spring break I thought was just irrelevant to the course. I think the class should be a half-semester class in the future and the unnecessary lectures should be taken out. The network exercise is interesting, but does not merit that much class time.",
    "I know there's probably not much that can be done... but the 8:30 start time is rough :) Pods should definitely be kept and encouraged to get to know eachother much sooner in the semester with dinners or group assignments. It was a real pleasure getting to know my podmates, and I appreciated that we all had different power profiles and leadership styles. Guest lecturers were good, but some were much more standout than others (ex: Amy Wrzesniewski, Peter Boyd, etc.) Try to relate speakers\/materials back to environmental\/social work as much as possible. Sometimes readings aren't very well integrated into course lectures or activities. Keep them actively part of class somehow, or cut them. The Network Map assignment needs to be rethought. I realize it was changed in response to student feedback that they wanted more pod team assignments, however the execution and clarity of the assignment was really tricky and wasn't as valuable for every team member as it could've been.",
    "There should be less reflection and more application to real-world experiences",
    "The speakers were hit or miss. Again, the first half of the semester was awesome. Once we started getting into network mapping, I got less interested. I understand the value behind the concept of growing your network and understanding the scope and connectivity of your network, but something about the way that was communicated and the assignment we were given to explore that idea just didn't land for me.",
    "The strengths of the class were seen in the guest lectures of the first half of the class. The weakness was the lack of solid assignments. The papers that we were asked to write felt like busy work and did not really have much use beyond simply synthesizing what we had been presented in class.",
    "Strengths--diversity of speakers and interests, breaking into pods, hurricane simulation, escape the room. Weaknesses--Lack of applied knowledge, shaky lecturing, failure to connect ideas to \"common threads\" in the course. T.A.s were underutilized as well, I think (could they sit in on more discussions and identify themselves as objective \"neutral observers\"--i.e. \"what I've noticed in this conversation is that student A has spoken most, and student B has spoken least--are there any reasons for that dynamic?\" Build in opportunities for direct feedback in pods based on challenges (e.g. a class period where the group alternates between designated leaders to take on challenges and then each leader is offered feedback on their leadership style)",
    "Strengths: The topics were all really interesting and salient! Weaknesses: Expectations for assignments were not well set up in advance, office hours were limited, and we didn't actually have a lot of time to engage in our pods.",
    "S: the power profile is definitively the best part of the class! Very useful and straightforward! W: I believe that discussing every detail of the class with the pod was not necessarily useful. I wish that instead of using most of the class to discuss with our pods, we could have had more time to learn from the faculty and the guest speakers. Discussing is good but to a certain point and I believe that it should be used more carefully because if everything has to be talked, things start to be repetitive and dont create value.",
    "The class brought excellent speakers, but we spent most of the time discussing small prompts that didn't add much value to the pods. I think we would benefit from hearing more from the speakers and only use group discussions when they add value to the class. The pods provide continuity to the class, that is great. That said, I think the pods would benefit from having a clear task or raison d'tre. As it stands, we were unclear at times of the point of having pods.",
    "It would be very helpful if the invited guest speakers adapted their examples to environmental issues. For example, Zoe Chance gave great corporate examples of marketing strategies to sell products, but it would have been great to see innovative examples of how as environmentalists we can actually change behaviour regarding consumption patterns and personal choices. The feedback on the assignments could be improved, it was difficult to understand how the assignments were being graded and how one could improve."

    "You will get a lot out of this class no matter what you're interested in or how well you already work with people.",
    "Don't take this course unless you need a super light waste of time course on your shopping list. This course will not teach you anything that you cannot learn at the job.",
    "Great teaching team, interesting material. Less academically rigorous, but personally valuable. Worth taking, but perhaps as a 5th class?",
    "Take this class! It's such a good way to help frame everything else you do at FES.",
    "Yeah, might as well.",

    "Engage with your pod and set clear expectations from the beginning.",
    "Not take it.",
    "It's a good course to take before heading back into the real world. Don't do it during the first year. Not a heavy lift.",
    "NA",
    "There is something for anyone to get out of this course",
    "It is a great course to take if you are looking to learn more about yourself personally and how to improve interactions with individuals personally and professionally.",
    "TAKE IT! The things you learn are directly applicable to literally anything - any personal or professional experience can benefit from people who are deeper listeners, better at giving feedback, know themselves, and understand how to work with and build teams. The structure of the class is great, the professors and guests are awesome, and the class itself is not super stressful.",
    "Take it. Do the readings to keep you engaged. Set more rigorous norms with your team about how well you will all come prepared to class - it is too likely that without this, your group's general engagement will slip over time.",
    "I would recommend taking this class, as it gives you skills that will be useful for the rest of your professional\/personal life.",
    "Please take this course, one of the best courses offered at F&ES.",
    "Take the first half of the semester, then audit or drop. The lectures and exercises start out great, then become increasingly unfocused and irrelevant. Take the class for the personal best self and hurricane exercises, then decide for yourself if it's worth your time to keep going...",
    "This is going to be one of those classes you feel like you can skip because it's not \"hard skills\" or \"you already know this stuff.\" I strongly encourage you to rethink those assumptions and come into this with an open mind and vulnerability. There are very few structured opportunities in grad school to do self-reflection, get honest feedback from peers, and practice your soft skills. Take advantage of it while you can! One of the best parts of this course are the discussions you will have with your classmates outside the classroom - I found myself discussing lecturers or assignments all the time with friends over dinner or when we ran into eachother.",
    "The readings are great and I got the sense that a lot of people don't do them, especially after the first few weeks. Try to keep up with them though - they're worth it! Also, learn as much as you can from the other people in your pod. Spending time with the people in mine was easily my favorite part of the course.",
    "Email the instructors well in advance of the assignments to go over what is expected.",
    "Is a very discussion-based class, with not very much hands-on projects. However, the power profile is an amazing tool.",
    "The insights profile is worth taking this class."
