   "comments": [
    "Its an interesting course and the thing is while at the end you'll have a really thorough understanding of genius and what causes it, you'll also learn volumes about art, music,and science as well as history.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who prefers thought based papers with a minimum of research, the readings are numerous but enjoyable.",
    "This is such an interesting course. Although Craig Wright's dialectic can feel a bit tedious at times and I definitely did not succeed in gaining a true understanding of genius, I really enjoyed the readings and the guest speakers. \"Exploring the Nature of Genius\" gave me a fuller understanding of cities, the human memory, hard work, being average, and the lives of many historical figures.",
    "For a writing credit, there are much better options. The topics are extremely vague and broad.",
    "It's a class with a lot of reading and a short paper about every two to three weeks. You learn a lot but never the actual answer the class is searching for. This can turn out to be frustrating at times but there just isn't an answer out there. All in all, it is an interesting and engaging course.",
    "No. This course was interesting and didn't require deep thinking, but not in that easy, fun sort of way. Each time I received an essay prompt I would look at it and think, \"Ha! That's barely a prompt at all! Everybody knows that topic is too large and vague to be covered in such a short (and ill-informed, based on the readings) paper.\" But then it wasn't funny anymore, because I had to write it. BS is not particularly difficult, but it is distinctly sad. I would like to take courses in the future that make me proud of what I have written. I didn't make a single argument in that class that I wouldn't have been fully prepared to refute. Concise criticism would be: waste of a credit.",
    "Oy Gevalt. Where to start? Genius may be a tough subject to tackle, but \"Exploring the Nature of Genius\" is significantly tougher.You may not learn much of academic depth in this class, but you will learn some important life lessons. Especially if the next time this class is offered, a 60-something-year-old auditor who was the former chair of a branch of Citibank gets kicked out for being unruly again. This is just one of the many shenanigans Craig Wright got us into this semester, and I think I'm a better person for these shenanigans. You too will probably be a better person if you take this class. Read all of the reviews very thoroughly before deciding. When you shop this class, if you have the tiniest hunch that it or the professor might not suit you, don't take the class.",
    "This course has a lot of potential to be really interesting, and there are times when it lives up to the potential, but much of the course feels like you're doing the same thing over and over. I would not recommend this course to another student.",
    "I am sorry to say this, but don't bother. As interesting as this class title sounds, what it really is is a survey of a small handful of geniuses. For example, you will study Mozart for two weeks, reading a handful of biographies\/other readings about his music and then you will write a paper about why he is a genius. Fast forward 2 weeks and you will have rinse-and-repeated the exactly same thing with Leonardo da Vinci. You might be better off just heading to Wikipedia.The main problem with this course is that Prof. Wright's grading policy will frustrate you and make you question your self-worth. I promise you I am not a whiney student, and I am not a grade grubber, but the comments on my papers were sometimes just plain mean. He is a genuine nice guy and he means really well, but he can be extremely harsh in grading papers. Not to mention, predicting how you will do is actually a shot in the pitch black dark. It is not uncommon to get a high A on one paper and then nearly fail the next.The only way I would consider this class is if somehow you hear that there plan on being more guest lecturers next year because they were intriguing. However we only had 3, which didn't exactly make up for the rest of the course.If you do end up taking this course, THIS ADVICE WILL SAVE YOU, I PROMISE: In deciding between a.) writing an interesting paper that makes a unique argument and b.) writing a more boring, very linear paper that is perfectly organized, CHOOSE B!!! I learned late in the semester that Prof. Wright cares more about how you say something than what you say. He's a very nice man like I said, but just keep this in mind."
