    "I think this class had the potential to be great, but honestly I was a bit disappointed. The lectures were interesting, but the problem sets and exams were particularly tedious and I don't feel like they really tested our knowledge of the class material. Instead, the problem sets turned out to be a game of how well you can search the Internet for information to find certain data sets and the exam was how fast you could look through your notes to find very specific details, instead of holistic\/systematic questions for what we learned in class. I just really felt like there was a huge disparity between what we learned in class and what we were tested\/graded on.",
    "This course has a lot of potential and the instructor is clearly very knowledgeable, but I do not think the material is presented in an organized way that facilitates learning.",
    "The problem sets are little bit overloaded to me.The course content is very impressive.",
    "The instructor seemed to dislike students' questions.",
    "Grubler is really one of a kind. Just an amazing lecturer + brilliant guy. He really approaches energy from such a unique\/interesting perspective. Really feel privileged to take his course. The guy has a big ego and can be condescending but that actually makes me like him more. Fits the Austrian \"tough love\" mentality. Such a nice\/helpful guy if you talk to him after class.",
    "The content of the course is exactly what I am interested in, but, the lecture style and format made it very difficult to really get a lot from them. Bowers is not a good room for a 3 hour lecture, especially when the professor refuses to wear a microphone. It was often very dark in the room and hard to hear him if you were not sitting in the front couple of rows (which filled up very quickly). It would have been much easier to learn if this was a 2 day per week class, rather than 1 time 3 hour class. The style of the lectures also made it hard to really learn because it was not structured in an easy to follow manner. The timing of when and how things were presented in lecture, did not follow with when and how they were asked on the homework. It was also often very hard to discern which pieces of information were the professor's opinion and which were facts.",
    "For question 1, the Energy Primer was extremely useful. The others were not.Question 12 - Arnulf has a wealth of knowledge related to the energy sector that is likely unrivaled pretty much anywhere. That said, I found that sometimes the tangents he would go on were a bit disengaging, and I found the problem sets to be quite disorganized at times. More on that below. I did appreciate his honesty and the strength of the perspective he brought to the class. That said, I wish he had had a little more objectivity in some of the comments he made, recognizing a bit more that there are multiple sides to certain topics.",
    "no comment",
    "N\/A",
    "The professor was neither encouraging or helpful to a majority of the students and was difficult to approach.",
    "Arnulf is awesome. He provided a framework for the world's energy systems, including a sense of magnitude. I'd been trying to learn this for years, but gotten nowhere as the information was difficult for me to assimilate from the wide array of sources that exist. He's also pretty damn funny when he wants to be. He's not for the faint of heart though. I'm confident that some people took his teaching style the wrong way, but that wasn't me. I loved his class and think he's a great teacher.",

    "Meet more often, please!",
    "The problem sets and exams definitely need improvement. They do not seem to correlate well with the class material at the moment.",
    "Delivery of information and the problem sets",
    "Hard to determine which points were most important during lectures. Also, majority of work was very detailed, specific problem sets that didn't reinforce concepts tested on the midterm and final, which made up 50% of the grade.",
    "More clarification on the expectations for the exam",
    "too much work load",
    "too focused on problem sets.",
    "Grubler's lecture slides are not as helpful as they could be. They sort of follow the minimalist\/engineering format. The problem sets should be a little easier + not rely so much on data mining. I loved this course but it did take up too much of my time this semester.",
    "Room change\/class size. Splitting the class into 2 sessions per week. The TAs should have office hours to assist with questions - they were only available via email, and it was often hard to communicate questions this way.",
    "The problem sets and the time commitment. I thought that the modules were a bit overkill, especially for someone who is often committed during the evenings, and I didn't feel like I missed out on a lot when I wasn't able to attend all of certain modules. In terms of the problem sets, I found them to be TOO overwhelming and unnecessarily vague and disorganized. There were frequently errors in the spreadsheets, and many of the questions were worded in ways that i simply couldn't understand.It shouldn't require asking the TA for an explanation of what the question is asking as frequently as I had to. I think the problem sets could have been shortened by a question or two and still had a significant impact on our learning.I also felt that the final exam wasn't an accurate representation of what I learned in the course. Unlike the midterm, it was TOO challenging for the limited time we had in which to complete it, and it left me asking myself how much I really did learn in the course. I'm not asking for a piece of cake test, but one in which I can at least feel somewhat proud of how i did, which I found not to be the case at all from the many people I talked to afterwards.Finally, I do feel that while there is something to be said for decoupling the assignments from the lectures in terms of allowing more time to cover more ground, i thought that spending at least SOME time during the lecture portion discussing conversions and other key concepts that relate to the problem sets would be helpful and would solidify our understanding that much more.",
    "The one-long-lecture-per-week format is too much information to learn effectively. Also I understand the point of the problem sets is to practice skills but some of the data research is unnecessary to teach the equations.",
    "The three hour lecture format is not conducive to learning. Nobody can pay attention the whole time! Grubler's condescending way of addressing students is also detrimental to our learning. He literally would have slides up about important concepts (e.g. modeling) and tell us we weren't smart enough to understand them, so he wouldn't explain. Additionally, the problem set instructions were often very unclear and on material that we hadn't always seen before. It's ok to add material to the course by first introducing things in a problem set, but if that's what you're doing, more clear instructions would help!",
    "My only critique is that Climate Change got wrapped into both the environment section and two lectures of its own, making it taught a little haphazardly while discussing transitions may have been more interesting and novel.",
    "The third Professional Module was not very helpful. Peter's and Arnulf's sections were good. The other two not so much.Professor Grubler can occasionally be a little bit mean. I know that's just his style, but I think it rubs some students the wrong way.The final exam is so difficult that it makes you feel as if you didn't learn anything. Having us all get 30%s doesn't prove anything other than that Professor Grubler can put together a nasty test. It would benefit the students' learning more to have a (slightly) easier test.",
    "would be nice to have clearer instructions for the homework",
    "Lectures too long and sometimes too complicated. Assignement difficult, time-consuming and not oftentimes clearly explained (point was missing).",
    "The class size was too big and sometimes questions from students went far off topic.",
    "The material needs to be more organized, the problem sets should focus more on critical thinking rather than just searching for data.",
    "I found the problem sets to be helpful in understanding the material to a point, though most of my time spent on the problem sets was spent deciphering the vague wording and mining documents and sources for just the right number\/ piece of information.I also didn't appreciate the poor and inconsistent communication about changes in the midterm schedule (I bought a plane ticket after the syllabus was handed out that I ended up having to lose because the midterm's date was changed) and a lack of description about what was allowed in the midterm. Sometimes all class materials were allowed, other times only notes--no lectures. I spent a lot of time summarizing graphs from the lectures to my notes that other people interpreted as allowed. Clearer communication would have helped with this.These problems were remedied during the final.",
    "Sometimes it was difficult to read a question in a problem set and be able to get started on identifying the proper data source. But I think that was part of the goal... locating information.",
    "the clarity of the questions on the problem sets and tests (it was often unclear) and the lectures on modeling (they were over the heads of most students, very technical).",

    "i was hoping for more in the modeling section. i would have loved to do some kind of hands-on project with that material (to the extent possible given my background).",
    "class scheduling",
    "The course should not be held in Bowers auditorium if possible. The dim lighting makes it difficult to focus on Dr. Grubler, especially from the back half of the room. It's also very drafty and uncomfortably cold. These two together can make it difficult to concentrate on the lecture.Also, though the problem sets were useful they did not directly reinforce the concepts taught in lecture. Working an explicit review of the broader concepts (as opposed to the status quo of all application) into the assignments for the course would be helpful.",
    "The integration of lectures with all other aspects of the course.",
    "The different modeling tools presented I think were a bit to abstract for most of us. They should be presented as an optional module for people truly interested in using them for future work.",
    "Classes should not be 3 hours long. Class should be twice a week for 1.5 hours each. Slides should be better organized and better explain material. Professional modules should be better managed\/run.",
    "The problem sets could focus more on analyzing results than on finding data.",
    "Quality of guest lectures is somewhat variable.Later problem sets could have slightly reduced emphasis on finding data, conversion factors, etc., which while instructive for the earlier problem sets, becomes merely time-consuming in the later ones with relatively little pedagogical value gained.",
    "The tests were terrible. The midterm especially was disappointing because we were tested on statistics rather then concepts or mathematical analysis. I think being tested on statistical facts was uncalled for when there were more important things to learn in the class. Further, the wording on the problem sets are very confusing and difficult to understand. This really needs to improve.",

    "Again, a bit disappointed that this is the only basic energy course taught at FES. It certainly does touch on the basics and I realize there wasn't enough time to go into every detail, but I really felt like I didn't learn a whole lot. That compounded with the fact that I didn't feel like the problem sets or exams accurately tested us on the material taught in class.",
    "useful",
    "I am very glad to find out that I am not interested in energy-related field.",
    "Studying energy, so yeah, had to take the course + really wanted to.",
    "This course provided a good foundation in knowledge about energy supply and demand.",
    "This course was definitely material to my academic and professional background (energy efficiency, primarily) and to what I want to do going forward (corporate environmental management.) I thought that it expanded my knowledge of the energy space considerably and provided me with some solid skills related to energy conversions and calculations that I know I will use in the future.",
    "One of the FES classes on energy - there needs to be more!",
    "It is absolutely essential for anyone studying energy. That's why it's so frustrating that thecourse if often disorganized, and that Grubler is disrespectful to his students. We have to take the class anyway!",
    "I'm an undergrad, but those of us who took it felt comfortable and it was certainly a great opportunity to learn about energy from an excellent professor and perspective, one that will shape my thinking going forward.",
    "I want to work on energy efficiency and energy policy. This course is absolutelyessential. If it didn't exist, I wouldn't have come to FES.",
    "It's an excellent foundation for my concentration in Energy and Environment.",
    "N\/A",
    "It will help me understand basic energy systems for future advocacy work.",
    "Not related to my academic background",
    "This course was very helpful in me getting my hands around the big picture... something I need to understand before I get involved in the details... that's simply how I work best.",
    "I want to study energy and this was a comprehensive introduction to energy. I wish there was better treatment of energy policy, however.",
    "More energy classes would be awesome.",
    "foundational material for the rest of my time here.",
    "This is a foundation course for me that I hoped would provide a broad introduction to energy studies and help me determine the focus of my MESc research. It has fulfilled these expectations.",
    "I planned to take one energy-related course per semester, and this course serves this purpose this semester.",
    "I think this should be a core course for anyone going through FES, simply to understand the basic drivers behind any energy issue, be it policy, extraction, or distribution.",
    "I am interested in energy management, so this course was a very good introduction to basic energy concepts.",
    "I am interested in Energy. This course provided solid bases to continue building during the rest of the program.",
    "Energy and energy systems are deeply linked with both the causes and the potential solutions to most of the world's major problems. Gaining a strong, comprehensive, and integrated understanding of energy systemsis therefore practically a requirement for addressing any kind of complex developmental or environmental issue.",
    "This is a foundation course for my energy concentration.",
    "Energy and the Environment is a focus area."

    "Collaborative nature of problem sets was very beneficial to my learning",
    "Advantages: the problem sets were much more manageable when tackled as a group",
    "Group work = critical to getting problem sets done. I probably would have bombed every problem set if I did them solo.",
    "Not a formal work group, but for most of the problem sets I worked with others, which was essential in being able to accomplish it in a timely manner.",

    "Data mining and discussing work together",
    "share and discuss work and be able to work more efficiently",
    "N\/A",
    "n\/a",
    "Groupwork was necessary to complete problem sets, yet some students would contribute more to the group than others, which ultimately was bad for the students who had less to contribute, and they fell further behind. ideally the problem sets would be manageable for a student working alone.",
    "Good for working out presentation material, invaluable for discussing problem sets.",
    "n\/a",
    "I worked with an informal group of students on all the problem sets. This was extremely helpful, but it's most productive if you've worked on the problem sets by yourself for a while first. That way you understand other students' questions questions and can use your group time more efficiently.",
    "Helpful to work in small groups.",
    "There were many advantages; I couldn't find all the data online on my own and it helped to confer with other students while deciphering what the problem sets were asking and figuring out how to solve them.",
    "Shared learning and understanding.",
    "Participating in group helps clarify and reinforce concepts. It also reduces work load of assignments."

   "comments": [
    "Get started on the PS early",
    "I think Arnulf really needs to reconsider the problem sets and exams for the course.",
    "Although the problem sets are tough, the course is worth taking.",
    "If you are really into Energy, this course is for you.But you need to deal with tons of raw data and data mining which will eventually and ironically get rid of all your excitement for this course.",
    "It's a hard course. The problem sets are daunting. You will hate Grubler a few times over the course of the year. You will love him at other times. Enjoy the ride. Take it.",
    "I would recommend this course.",
    "Not an easy class, but definitely a must if you have any interest in working in the energy sector. Yes, you can learn some of the conversions on your own, but unless you force yourself to practice them it ain't gonna happen! Arnulf's perspective is also quite entertaining and worth being exposed to, as he is legendary here at Yale!",
    "Be prepared to devote a lot of time, but you will learn more about a subject that you need to know about and probably don't than any other FES class.",
    "Work with your peers on problem sets and in preparing exam study materials, such as a summary of the Primer. Memorize the important numbers. Read the primer many times. Go to Grubler's office hours, as he's actually quite helpful and nice when he's one-on-one with a student. Apparently you're supposed to put formulas in the cells on the answer tab of problem sets (they don't tell you this...). Get super detailed in the \"assumptions\" boxes on problem sets.",
    "I think this class is excellent. It's a survey of energy, covering far more than you new existed, while also going into detail and really just giving you exposure to different ways of thinking. Whether it is modeling, examining why and how we use energy and how that may change, or just hearing excellent analogies, this class is great.",
    "If you care at all about energy or climate, you need to take ESA. It is fantastic. Grubler is an evil genius. The problem sets are horrific. The final exam is impossible. The moonshine hit the spot. I learned a ton.",
    "be prepared for all the work",
    "Take it. A lot of work but worth it. Learn to ignore Grubler and his attitude.",
    "Make sure you have the time and energy for the course, otherwise it will take away from your schedule elsewhere.",
    "Take it. Especially if you're looking for a broad survey of energy topics as opposed to skills development or basic principles.While I learned a lot in this class, if you are not planning on doing your own research, it would really help to have other classes in Energy offered so that Arnulf's perspective is not the only perspective you get. He can't possibly cover everything needed in the depth it is needed in order to knowledgeably work in the energy field.",
    "It depends somewhat on your personality (Arnulf jokes a lot). If you're too serious and sensitive, the class may not work for you. But if you want to get a solid understanding of the world's energy systems, this class is for you!",
    "Be prepared for a lot or work. Much of the work on the problem sets is simply finding the data you need to complete the mathematical problems. also the tests in this class are unconventional--they are very difficult (especially the final) and you will not finish the problems and you will be graded on a curve.",
    "Not worth it, don't take this class. Just read the energy primer. Energy systems analysis was a poorly organized class and the professor did not do a good job of teaching his students anything beyond a regurgitation of the reading material. I learned more from reading the assigned readings.",
    "Budget enough time for problem sets.",
    "take it! it's worth the effort!",
    "start the problem sets right after class. material is fresh and you will mae substantial gains right away. stay to talk to the class speakers as much as you can",
    "Start the problem sets early and work with other students! Don't underestimate the exams, because they are extremely difficult. And go to Dr. Grubler's office hours, becausehe's very willing to talk further about anything related (or not so related) to energy. Great course! Hard but totally worth it.",
    "This course gives you a great foundation for energy. So if you don't have it, take it!",
    "Get started early on the problem sets, read the primer thoroughly within the first three weeks of the course. Sign up for one of the Mory dinners, and give a presentation.",
    "Take it, and make sure to take good notes and get started and the problem sets well before they are due. Also, be sure to ask questions about the homework.",
    "Defitively take it. It is a very comprehensive overview which will provide better understanding of energy related topics.",
    "ESA is a great course; there's a reason it remains popular despite the heavy workload. The material is not just technical, but conceptual as well, and the systems perspective underlying the course really helps challenge pre-conceptions and provide a useful integrative view. Overall an excellent course.Do be prepared for the heavy workload. Listen to Arnulf's advice regarding the problem sets and exams, and take it seriously, or risk finding yourself getting swamped and doing a terrible job on them. That said, workload is not unreasonable if you start early.",
    "Work in groups and know the mathematical concepts very well",
    "Expect a lot of work.",
    "Sitting in the front row is highly recommended, otherwise you sometimes may not hear a thing. The class is usually large. Read the energy primer before the classes begin and before the mid term. revise before the final. Focus on the second half readings of the semester too for the final. Take advantage of the professional modules and participate in the presentations for extra credit. DO NOT leave the assignments to the last day. They will most definitely kill you if you do."
