    "You don't need to be a Hist. major to take it because the class is very small. If you're interests lie in any aspect of the world wars, then this class is for you. Its not that difficult and overall pretty stress-free.",
    "I really liked this class. There was a lot reading to do every week, but it was mostly always interesting. A couple short presentations in class and a term paper, but he gives you plenty of time to do it and has you write an outline and find sources early.",
    "Cultural History of WWI was by and large an excellent course. The readings were always engaging, were never too long, and were assigned as presentations to students, allowing one to read texts less closely if need be during rough weeks. Professor Cabanes clearly enjoys teaching the course, and he is invested in each of his students. I would strongly recommend taking the class for a differing approach to the Great War.",
    "Definitely. Take this course if you are interested in learning more about what actual life was like during WW1 in an infromal yet deeply stimulating seeting"
