   "comments": [
    "No no no no. This class was awful and the gading was biased and terrible. I came into this class excited to learn about the subject matter, and I even attended master's teas on it. After their biased grading and unhelpful rude digs at students not in the lab, I am neve taking another geology course again.",
    "An excellent choice for an survey-level intro to geology. Professors Evans& Rye both lecture pretty well, and you get an overview of the Earth inside out, from the iron core to the glacial moraines. Also, geology's awesome in that it's an integrated sort of science, so you get a wide spread of chemistry\/physics going on. I love nature and hiking (but not the hard sciences), and I thoroughly enjoyed this class.My only complaint would be that the exams were a brutal test of memorization, and the 4 problem sets don't give you a chance to redeem yourself grade-wise, either.Besides the grading, though, I'm so happy I took this class. I'll never look at granite the same way again.",
    "A broad survey of geology that does not go in depth in any topic. Lectures are incredibly compressed (not always interesting but sometimes could be depending on how much you like and know about geology), problem sets are few and easy, tests are pure memorization.",
    "I mean, I took this because it was a prereq for the major I'm interested in. It's basically a course on various Earth processes, from rock formation to like rivers and glaciers, but has very little focus on the non-purely-geological aspects of natural history. We ignored very large aspects of natural aspects either because the professors weren't interested or didn't know about the topics - for whatever reason the past ~500-700 million years of Earth history was \"not relevant\" simply because timewise they're a much smaller fraction of Earth history, but like lifewise it's pretty much everything. So the professors are kinda niche and I acknowledge I'm pretty niche in what I like too and it was unfortunate that our niches didn't coincide.Would only recommend if the student is really interested in geology or just in learning about rocks and stuff, not if they're just looking to fulfill a science credit.",
    "If you are considering Geology as a major, you will have to take this class. If you are simply looking for a science credit, keep in mind that this is not a gut. You will need to put in considerable effort and the material is not always very easy to understand. The workload is not too bad (4 easy psets, 1 midterm and 1 final) but because of the lack of regular assignments it is very easy to fall behind. Going to lecture is not required, but it really helps if you are serious about understanding the (quite hard) concepts taught in this class. As for the exams, they're very straightforward but you will have to spend a lot of time studying if you want to do well.",
    "Only if you have to.",
    "A good survey class for intro Geo, you'll learn about the basics of how the Earth works and other things everyone should know. The course followed the textbook fairly closely and felt fair in grading (only a midterm and a final, with 3 psets for the whole term), they basically give you a list of possible test questions at the end. Professor Evans' lectures were usually pretty interesting.",
    "A great class that I completely recommend. Brief but detailed overview of the world we live in and how science interacts with that world. Taught be remarkable professors. Take it for the major, for the science credit, or just because you're interested!"
