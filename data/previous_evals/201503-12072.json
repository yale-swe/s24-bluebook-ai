   "comments": [
    "This is an incredibly interesting class that actually teaches a science that you see every single day talked about in the news. I thoroughly enjoyed the interesting lectures . Overall the Psets were incredibly tough and only could do them if you went to the 2 hour sections once a week which taught you how to do them. They were super quantitative and none of that was taught in class. The overall themes that were tested on exams were very fair and really the main points of the course. NOT A GUT. But doesnt feel taxing if you are actually interested in the subject.",
    "I would highly recommend this class. As a Poli Sci major, I was looking for an easier science credit that was actually interesting. I was scared at first given that the Psets can be kind of intimidating, but if you go to section (Maureen is the best), they will practically do them for you. The tests are super straightforward (just two manageable unit tests), and they only ask broad short answer questions so that there are no surprises. Class can be overly technical at times, but it is interesting and feels applicable. Study and go to review for the tests, but overall low stress class. Not a gut because of weekly section, but well worth the work. You will do well in this class and your grade will reflect your effort. TAKE IT!",
    "Great class, but actually go to class. It makes it so much easier.",
    "A great science credit!!!! Actually super interesting topic, well-designed for non-majors, but not a silly gut. A great combination of fun teaching, interesting material, and worthwhile work. A wonderful option, and a perfect introduction to geoscience!",
    "Natty D is a good science credit. Definitely interesting, not too much work, and not challenging. If you think natural disasters are cool, take this class. Also, you'll learn about fairly important stuff, from disasters to climate change and fossil fuels. Weekly psets (not hard) and optional sections that are pretty much homework help, two midterms, and a final. All manageable. If you put in some effort, you should be fine.",
    "This is a great course for non-science majors. As a Humanities major, I appreciated it. It's accessible, actually interesting, and not too difficult. It's by no means a gut: two midterms, 9 problem sets, and a 3 hr final. It's worth taking though, because you learn some interesting topics. If you go to section, you can get your PSET done there in 2 hours. Not bad.",
    "Natural Disasters is a fun and engaging course in which you will learn all about real world phenomena such as hurricanes, earthquakes, and volcanoes. After the course, you will be able to speak intelligently on a plethora of geological matters, and have a better understanding of the world around you. Definitely a class worth taking.",
    "Natural Disasters is a great course for anyone looking to earn a science credit. The material is interesting and easy to understand, and Professor Bercovici and Professor Long are reasons enough to take the course. They are both extremely entertaining and passionate.",
    "This is a great survey course in geology, and it teaches you the basics of all major types of natural disasters. A prospective geology major or not, you will find that a lot of this information is really useful to know. Some people in previous years have warned that this class is superhard, but that's probably just because they're lazy. As with any science credit you cant bullshit your way through an exam, so you need to put in the hours needed to actually learn the material, but anyone who is willing to put some time can get an A in this class.",
    "Not that easy - difficult weekly psets but fair exams. Interesting material and engaging lectures",
    "I really loved the material in this class. I didn't realize how fascinating all of these natural disasters are. I also now fear a lot of things because I know all the different ways you can die from volcanic eruption, etc. But hey, at least I know how all these disasters occur and what to do if I'm stuck in one! Also, this class is not as much of a gut as I was hoping for. The physics side was hard for me because I have zero physics background, even though I have an advanced math back ground. The psets were rather difficult, and I always had to go to section for help. But having said that, it was worth it because the class was really fun and I learned a lot of cool stuff!",
    "A good science credit for those mathematically inclined.",
    "If you are interested in any aspect of natural disasters and what goes on around our world take this course! Yes I would recommend this course!",
    "Fun class, only a gut if you take it seriously from day 1. A very good option if you're trying to fulfill your science credits.",
    "",
    "I would fully recommend this course to all students. I find myself talking about things I have learned from this course in day to day life.",
    "Not an easy science.",
    "Problem sets are tough but tests are very fair and the information is interesting. Professor B is awesome.",
    "If you show up to class and go to the review sections for the homework the class is fairly easy, most of it is just memorization. I found the class interesting and it was taught in a way that I will retain the material for years to come.",
    "NOT a gut science",
    "I would absolutely recommend it.",
    "Definitely take this course!!! Professor Bercovici and Professor Long are the most amazing duo. The problem sets are often math heavy, but if you are someone who enjoys math then you will have no problem figuring out the answers. And even if you are horrible at math, just go to section at night and the professors WALK THROUGH the answers to the problems! Great class -- take it and go to lecture because the professors are super entertaining and tell you what you will be tested on!",
    "Not too challenging if you put in the work and I recommend it if science isn't your best subject",
    "A good survey course for someone not necessarily intending to major in STEM. Quantitative problems on the homework sets and more qualitative problems on the exams.",
    "The name is a misnomer. Do not be fooled. It's basically Rocks 101, or Introduction or Geology. Do not take this class if you are interested in learning about the human elements of natural disasters (i.e. their effect on human life, economics, prevention methods, etc.). I would only recommend this class to another humanities major like myself who is looking for a relatively easy science course and has taken AP Chem and at least Conceptual Physics in high school. Otherwise the concepts and math will be too frustrating to be bothered with.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class. I wouldn't say it's a gut class, because there's a lot of material covered in the class and psets are pretty tough unless you go to the sections. Sections basically walks you through every step of the problem sets so you're totally set if you go.",
    "It is a good science credit, especially if you aren't a science major"
