    "Professor Oliver tends to ramble a bit in his lectures. I think there also lacks a central theme that pulls the course together. Often, it felt like an overview of ecology, geology, and ecological anthropology. I wish each lecture tied into a greater unified theme.",
    "Greater emphasis on integrating the knowledge and information covered in the course, as opposed to simply presenting the information, would be helpful. This was the instructor's intention but the pacing of the course prevented going into much depth; future structural changes may rectify it.Also, some facts\/definitions\/concepts used are slightly out of date.",
    "The assignments essentially involved data mining that took more time than actually answering the questions in the assignments themselves. While I appreciate the understanding of Professor Oliver in giving more leeway in answering the questions, I feel that more clarity in how the we were suppose to answer the questions will have helped and how much data mining was really necessary in coming up with the answers he wanted.Also, I feel that the instructions for the last class exercise on trading could have been improved and better given. Until the day when we held the exercise, I believe majority, if not everyone, in class were unsure of how we were suppose to go about it despite time spent in class presenting aspects of the exercise beforehand."

    "Workload of groupwork not actually much lighter than simply doing work individually.",
    "The amount of data mining affected the amount of time that we could've spent discussing in more detail the answers that we had to the questions in the exercises. As a result of the number and the broadness of questions for each assignment, we decided that we would divide the work as a group. While division of labor is practical, I feel very strongly that the degree of detail that was needed in cleaning up and truly appreciating the contents of the different sheets that contained the tables tended to distract from truly appreciating the responses to the questions."

    "The lectures were very informative but basic. I feel strongly that this could pass or serve as a foundations course that would be very useful for all MEMs. I would advice a student who plans to take this course to fully ask the questions that would provide the information he or she needs from Professor Oliver."
