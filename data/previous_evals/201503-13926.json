    "If you want to learn about what really goes on at the UN, you should take this course. I would recommend it to all Jackson students interested in working for or with their government, or in general if they are interested in global issues.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class! I already have to other students in the School of Public Health! I hope that Ambassador DiCarlo will teach the course again!",
    "This course outlines the functions, responsibilities and history of the United Nations with respect to the greatest challenges facing the world today. From climate change to WMD, students will examine the most daunting dilemmas in international relations by examining and evaluating the role of the UN in formulating solutions for them. I would whole-heartedly recommend the course - and instructor - to another student.",

    "This course provided a first-hand look at UN relations with emerging powers like Russia and Brazil through the NY trip, which was really eye-opening. It also provided a glimpse into U.S. challenges and failures through the visit to the U.S. mission. The course also broadened by knowledge of multilateral affairs by looking at different conflicts in regions I have not studied previously, such as Africa. The final paper helped me to focus on a topic that I would like to pursue further research on, or build on for a potential thesis, project, or article for publishing.",
    "Very much so! I feel much more knowledgable about multilateral institutions and US foreign policy after taking this course!"
