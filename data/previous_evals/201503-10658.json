    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student, as it was my favorite course this semester. This course examined important canonical and new work in the field of Early American history. It introduced students to the major topics, events, authors, and conceptualizations of the region, while also questioning and problematizing these as foundational.",
    "This readings seminar examines the historiography of early America during the centuries prior to the American Revolution. The syllabus includes a diverse and balanced range of scholarly works. In general, I would recommend this course because the readings were engaging, the assignments were useful, and I enjoyed learning from Alejandra. In particular, I would recommend this course to a) students studying other regions, especially in the Western hemisphere, during this time period b) Americanists studying other time periods. I think that the debates and themes this course illuminates might encourage students in these two groups to reevaluate their assumptions about their own fields of interest."

   "comments": [
    "This course absolutely deepened my knowledge of my discipline by introducing me to important scholarship that I had not previously considered. Additionally, the professor integrated discussion about the historical profession in our analysis of the books, the research and publishing process, the transitions scholars make in a first book or a post-tenure book, those produced for academic and scholarly audiences, etc. It contributed to my dissertation research by cultivating an interest in areas that I previously had not explored. I believe it may also change the comparative framework that I hope to explore in my dissertation, because of the ways that it importantly destabilized my previous conceptions of how we think about regions historically versus how they are organized in doctoral programs. Additionally, the bibliography was helpful for drafting a part of my exam list, and also for understanding how much time and effort that would take. It was helpful to start this ahead of time, to receive feedback, and to have that work count for and be in conversation with this course."
