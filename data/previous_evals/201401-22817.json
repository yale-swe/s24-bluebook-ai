   "comments": [
    "Highly recommend to those interested in theory aspect of international relations. Not for those interested in practition.",
    "I have recommended the course very highly to many students of different disciplines and at different educational stages.",
    "A good, if occasionally opaque, overview of current IR theory. Be ready to digest complicated readings and be willing to bring yourself up to speed if you are not already familiar with the material to an extent.",
    "This class covers the fundamental theory and some application of core IR concepts. I would recommend this class and think most people would find it interesting.",
    "Introduction to IR theory and its application to policy problems.Highly recommended for the reasons mentioned in Q 1.",
    "Yes. It's a great opportunity to think about how theory can be applied to real world situations, through the policy memo writing exercises.",
    "A good introduction to IR theory. Would like a bit more of the -isms given most folks in the outside world would expect students to be familiar with them. Reasonable workload that is not concentrated at the end and an engaging professor. Would recommend.",
    "A good graduate-level overview of state-centric IR theory with a practical focus.Yes, I would recommend the course.",
    "I would highly recommend this class to any student in the Global Affairs program. It allowed me to understand the workings of international relations at a much deeper level and I gained insight into how the different facets of IR (economics and trade, national security, domestic politics, democracy, etc) are interrelated."

   "comments": [
    "Integral to my concentration as well as my future research interest. Indispensable.",
    "I knew very little before this class and so it greatly deepened my knowledge of the discipline.",
    "The course helped me deepen my knowledge about IR theory. Moreover, it helped me see the connection between the theory and policy worlds in a more clear way. Finally, the course gave me a great opportunity to improve my writing skills about IR.",
    "As before, a nice survey. Perhaps a bit more structure is needed but still glad I took it.",
    "This course was essential for extending the knowledge of my discipline and for my professional development. It also allowed me to explore more thoroughly some of the topics that I have been hoping to focus on more.Thank you very much!"
