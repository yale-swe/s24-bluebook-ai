    "Professor Skiba is definitely the best physics professor I have had at Yale and one of the best teachers I have ever had. Skiba is extremely good at answering questions from students, as he is very approachable and will explain a concept in several different ways until you understand the topic. In addition to being a skilled teacher, Skiba also has a great sense of humor, which he incorporated smoothly into the lectures, making them both clear and enjoyable without distracting from the material. The class would frequently burst out laughing during class, which is saying something because they were physics lectures. His sense of humor also helped minimize the general level of anxiety about the course and made me feel more comfortable asking questions and going to office hours. I would say Skiba's one weakness is that he can be disorganized on the board and a bit sloppy with notation (dropping occasional vector signs, etc...), which was a bit difficult for the E\/M portion of the course, but on the whole I learned a tremendous amount from this class and would love to take another course with him.",
    "Phys 402 is the continuation of Phys 401 which has relatively the same difficulty. The teaching quality is good; take it if you are in the Phys 401\/402 track.",
    "Do it for Skiba.",
    "A solid treatment of topics in statistical mechanics and E&M. Skiba is extremely caring of his students. His wit is capable of sharpening even the dullest blade to the exacting standards of a sushi chef. His devious exams will test you to the limits -- you will make mistakes, many mistakes, and learn tons. The aspect of the course that left the most to be desired were the lectures -- Skiba is by nature quite fast and, as you'd expect of a theorist, does not often show intermediate steps rigorously on the board. For E&M this can be a nightmare...ask him to slow down and he will be more happy to do so, although you may find yourself wanting him to more often than you feel you should. Don't worry. Others are in the exact same boat.",
    "A good course in thermo and e &m. Skiba is extremely impressive in that he seems never to look at notes and is a very good lecturer. He's funny and nerdy and always on the ball. The tests were too hard. Trying to make the averag a 50 is statistically nice for the professor but makes for a very stressful test taking experience.",
    "A comprehensive overview of thermodynamics and statistical mechanics, with a deeper journey into electricity and magnetism. I would absolutely recommend it, as you will learn a lot but never be overwhelmed.",
    "Because the course covers both statistical mechanics and electricity & magnetism, you don't have enough time to go into too much depth with either of the topics. The two sections are completely unrelated, and when you have a cumulative final, it's just a lot of very diverse material to understand and review. For anyone who wants a broad, and more advanced-than-intro-level, understanding of physics, though, this course summarizes two otherwise very dense subject matters in a way that you are able to grasp the main concepts. Because it is fast-paced, however, you also need to put in a lot of effort on your own (if your physics background is not too strong, that is), so don't get dissuaded by the relatively easy psets into thinking that the exams will be easy too! Other than that, Professor Skiba is one of the best professors that I have had at Yale so far -- he makes physics interesting by cracking a lot of relevant jokes (at least one per class) so he ensures that everyone is enjoying the class. He also a genius! He would come to class with a few equations written for his lecture notes and he would derive everything right in front of us on the blackboard. If you don't understand any of the concepts\/get stuck on the psets\/want general advice on life in terms of physics, he is easy to approach and he is willing to share his sage words!",
    "Basically just a continuation of 401. About the same difficulty ad workload.",
    "Probably more fun to take the 401\/402 non intensive route. Reasonable workload, not too difficult material.",
    "Material is a little dry. I would not recommend if not required.",
    "I took this class with Prof Witold Skiba and it was a blast - that might have been mostly because it was my first time learning about a new field of physics in years, but really, statistical mechanics is the shit. After taking this class, I finally feel like I know enough math to understand entropy and thermodynamics. Though the derivations can get pretty extended and abstract, Prof Skiba is always willing to respond questions and clarify doubts, giving a good conceptual grounding as to what's going on behind all the math. Problem sets are sometimes challenging but always do-able, and really helped me consolidate my mathematical understanding of the concepts. Tests and exams are no joke either - there's probably going to be at least one question you don't really know how to do - but for that reason, they're fun too (at least, if you're into that sorta thing). I switched to this class after shopping PHYS 261 for a week and have no regrets - I much prefer the solid (i.e. mathematical) understanding of statistical mechanics I now have over the surface level knowledge of quantum mechanics and general relativity I would have had from 261."
