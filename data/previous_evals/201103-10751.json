   "comments": [
    "This is an excellent course. It gives the opportunity to review primary literature in the field of cancer biology. It forces students to read scientific papers very carefully. The presentation skills gained in this course are valuable. It would have been better if more class discussion had been fostered.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student who is more interesting in honing their presentation and critical reading skills. I would not recommend this course to a student who wants to receive a good background in cancer biology.",
    "A great seminar course - the topic was interesting, the papers were well-selected to coincide with subject matter and focused areas within each subject matter, it was a good mix of student background\/knowledge which enabled frank discussion and varying areas of expertise. The workload was spot on and it was a comfortable, friendly environmentto not only enhance your knowledge of a subject area but to understand current limitations\/areas for development within that area and to improve upon your own ability to write a paper critique and assimilate data into an effective presentation. It was really helpful to understand how to present a topic to an audience effectively.",
    "i would recommend the course to a fellow student and describe it as an intense, but informative overview into the biology of cancer, including epigenetic factors and metastasis using current literature.",
    "Yes. It was helpful to learn how to present papers, and how to critique a paper, and to identify which parts are weak. I also liked the diversity of the papers and subjects that were discussed.",
    "If you need to work on public speaking and presentation skills, would recommend it. Also helped to show how to critically examine papers.",
    "I would certainly recommend PATH 680 to other students. I learned a lot and the class size was perfect (~11)"

   "comments": [
    "It definitely helped me improve my critical reading skills and presentation skills. It also helped me critically read literature better that is outside of my field. My knowledge of cancer biology was slightly improved.",
    "It increased my awareness of current issues in cancer biology and in treating cancer. As a student interested in drug development, understanding current biological limitations is key for thinking about new strategies for drug targeting. It also really advanced my understanding of current techniques and methods used in biological assays.",
    "i am interested in the biology of cancer, so this was a perfect course for me to take in my first semester.",
    "It helped me to be able to discuss and present papers or concepts that I am unfamiliar with at first, and how to approach a subject that I have little knowledge of. It was also good to identify weaknesses of papers and to discuss alternative methods.",
    "Seminal papers were chosen to read\/present\/review. This course definitely gave me a solid background in cancer immunology, which will be relevant to my area of research. I was also introduced to new topics and concepts that have expanded my understanding of the complexities of cancer."
