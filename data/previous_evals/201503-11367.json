    "Yes I would! It was a great course to have a basis for any future history class.",
    "I would definitely recommend the DS H&P class. Prof. Semmel is very encouraging and open to other people's opinions.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student, as well as Professor Semmel's section on it. I learned a lot and felt very prepared for the final.",
    "The course was often my favorite part of the day, and I would certainly recommend it to another student. I felt that it allowed me to explore texts without feeling intimidated in discussion.",
    "You read a lot. Yes, do it if you like to read about political philosophy.",
    "DS H&P is a class that teaches you how to think historically and politically. The historians and theorists you read ask invaluable questions that, of the three DS courses, bear the most relevance to modern society--what is the best constitution? Why should we study history? How do we act virtuously under a tyrannical government? Indeed, government today would not exist without these authors--George Washington is the American Cincinnatus; republican government was devised by Aristotle and Polybius. Before you consider DS, you should know that the workload for this class is much greater than the average Yale course--most of your time outside of class will be spent doing the readings, and your Thursday nights are sacrosanct hours in the library. That said, DS has been one of the most intellectually stimulating experience of my life. The sheer amount of information I've processed, on top of the essays I've written this term, has helped me mature as a historian, a philosopher, and a writer. Moreover, DS is a community. Every DSer instantly identifies with one another, sharing ideas both inside and outside of class. As far as H&P goes, it was the most accessible of the three tracks; you don't have to spend hours doing close reading, nor is your head about to explode after 5 minutes of philosophy reading. Last piece of advice--do DS! You won't regret it."
