    "Synthesizing arguments from diverse historical and conceptual sources. Distilling large and complex narratives to their essential arguments. The impact of methodological choices on historical narratives.",
    "I learned the history of capitalism (mostly in the American context) in relation to socio-cultural issues such as ethnic\/gender\/class identity, social norm regarding value, and so forth. Especially I developed some understandings of the trend of abstraction in the process of financialization of society since the early 19th century.",
    "Re-emphasized the utility of close reading and interdisiciplinarity as necessary for the analysis of capitalism and culture.",
    "insights into conducting historical research. connection to body of literature that would otherwise have passed me by.",
    "Good for giving a grounding in some of the language and key names in studies of capitalism. Gained a stronger idea of how to converse in economic sub-disciplines. Helpful in thinking about the ways in which economic systems and ideas influence much of the American culture."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The course discussion took a few weeks to really find its feet and develop a mutual set of terms for discussion. This could be facilitated through a more structured discussion format in the early weeks that then falls off as students gain comfort with the course material and with each other. The interdisciplinary nature of the course was very positive and brought a variety of perspectives on the course content. However, this could be better leveraged through the construction of a more dynamic reading list, in which students might submit relevant journal articles to accompany the texts they are assigned to present.",
    "This course was very well-designed, with a balanced reading list that appealed to (and drew from) a wide range of disciplines. Class discussion partly, I imagine, because of this disciplinary mix was also excellent. Overall I found it very enriching.",
    "One strength is the setting that one student will represent the reading and lead the discussion each week, making the class discussion can centralize on certain topics. One point that could be improved is that instead of reading one whole book (that is what we did for many weeks), I prefer reading some essential parts of a major monograph, accompanied by some other papers engaging the same topic from different angles or having a more abstract theoretical concern.",
    "Strengths were the variety of disciplines represented by the readings; presentations allowed students to share in-depth critical takes of the texts; weekly summaries provided a useful thread for developing thoughts throughout the weeks. I wish there had been more discussion of prisons and the global. What would the course look like if Ruth Gilmore's Golden Gulag were included as a text about culture and capitalism? Also, would've been nice if readings explicitly about gender weren't limited to the weeks about enclosure.",
    "course was incredibly well-conceived. interesting selection of texts, rigorous and useful discussion in class.",
    "The readings were excellent. I sometimes found it difficult to follow class conversation. Students often seemed to talk past one another, or to abruptly and regularly change the topic of conversation. The result was that it often felt like we did not get anywhere in our discussion. But again, the readings themselves were both interesting and useful.",
    "Strong inter-disciplinary course: good for engaging with many ideas and conversations, but sometimes tricky for some students to follow certain readings or class conversations.",
    "Reading and discussion intensive, brings to the forefront valuable texts, well-designed course, inter-disciplinary. Could be more theoretical texts for those interested"

   "comments": [
    "Yes. The course required a large amount of work and was conceptually challenging, but well worth it in terms of exposure to a variety of methodologies, disciplines, and historical content. It would provide a good background to any number of broader studies that wish to connect historical developments of capitalism to a wide array of cultural developments.",
    "Yes, this was an excellent course.",
    "Yes, I will recommend. The course has a great selection of reading and the instructor has a comprehensive understanding of those topics.",
    "Yes- it was an interesting course.",
    "Yes, course was fantastic, as was quality of class discussion.",
    "Good course for students who want to engage with ideas about economics in American history and culture. May be helpful to have some background in economics or history of economics first.",
    "I would recommend this course to someone who is interested in more recent historical times and particularly fascinated by the ever-growing capitalism. It allows one to unpack the sociology, history, politics of capital accumulation in a wonderfully inter-disciplinary fashion. Would recommend this course to people outside history also."
