    "This course increased my knowledge of the ins and outs of elections in the U.S. and current related research. This course also gave me the opportunity to learn how to conduct my own quantitative research and present it in writing with graphics.",
    "Got better at reading social science papers, and critiquing both methodology and presentation of results.",
    "I learned so much from this course about elections, campaign messaging and management, and U.S politics in general. It was really the first time I was ever required to read so many political science papers, and I found that incredibly valuable for understanding the depth of political science questions.",
    "I learned a lot about how to organize and conduct major research. I also picked up many interesting facts about how elections run.",
    "I learned a lot about the research and data behind national elections. Taking this course in this year was especially beneficial to understanding the election. The readings were helpful and informative. I liked the blog posts."

   "comments": [
    "The portion of this course focused on the final paper was particularly valuable. Discussions of readings were interesting, but the parts of class were Professor Hersh focused on paper writing and research were by far more valuable for me. I still came away from the course with a greater understanding of U.S. elections, but in addition, I came away with a greater understanding of quantitative research methods. The focus in this course on a final paper was definitely a strength. In fact, I would have appreciated if part of one class was dedicated to collecting data and creating a dataset efficiently.",
    "We could have spent a bit more time discussing data collection and how to deal with imperfect data sets. We spent a lot of time discussing writing and data presentation, but the analysis and methodology is important it too!",
    "The strengths were the readings-- very thought provoking and useful. Class discussion, while at times a little haphazard were also very thought provoking and Hersh is great at probing students.",
    "Professor Hersh ran a great class. I have no objections.",
    "I think we could have talked more about the readings and had mandatory meetings with the professor for our papers."

   "comments": [
    "This course is great for students who want to really learn how to write a quality quantitative research paper. Even if you don't plan to pursue a career in research, the paper focus of this course is valuable for any political science student. You will also come away from this course with a greater knowledge of U.S. elections and current research. The course is very current, and information regarding upcoming elections in the House and Senate will be included.",
    "Great course, Hersh is a young, engaged and super fun professor. Waking up at 9am was worthwhile for the discussions in class, and the final paper was honestly not that bad and while it was a lot of work, if you're focused and organized you'll be fine. The discussions of politics are great, Hersh makes sure to try to value all opinions, liberal and conservative, which makes for much better discussion than it could have devolved into during a contentious election year.",
    "If you are prepared to do a lot of reading and writing, then you should take this course. But be prepared for a lot of weekly reading in addition to a hefty term paper. That said, I learned so much about political science, research methods, and campaigns that I definitely think it was worth it.",
    "Definitely take this course if you want a taste of serious research and are thinking about graduate school in the social sciences.",
    "Yes! Definitely a great course to take to learn how to write like a researcher."
