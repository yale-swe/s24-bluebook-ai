    "Great! Take it! A seminar all about applying what you learn--a format I feel is the best way to learn from.",
    "This course is really just a good way to get out into the community and actually learn about mental health in a real way. You aren't providing to therapy to anyone. You are simply there to try and use the helping skills you learn in class. I would say this class made me a better person. The weekly lectures are sometimes helpful and sometimes not. The real value is in the field placements. The class is really relaxed and not that much work, which really allows you to jump into your field placement and focus on that. There are weekly thought questions and journal entries, but they really don't take too much time at all.",
    "TAKE CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGY! It's truly a wonderful course. For one, it's well-taught. Prof. Lockhart really cares about her students and about the field and does her best to present you with all the information you could ever want about it. She also incorporates a lot of different media, so in addition to lecture, she assigns pertinent, interesting books and articles, and also shows you videos in class of different therapists with their clients. She has a lot of experience in the field, so she also has educational anecdotes from her time as a therapist.Outside of class, there's also the field placement, which is a great way to apply what you're learning and get off campus for a while. It seems like all the placements were enjoyable and rewarding this year. A year-long commitment really is ideal, as it allows you to form a relationship with the people you are working with.Overall, I would highly recommend this course. While it does take up a good amount of time (my field placement took up four hours, weekly meetings with your group take an hour, and reading\/reading responses take a couple of hours a week), it is not especially challenging and is engaging and interesting. The final paper is also fun to write, as you getto reflect on your time in the course. You learn so much about yourself and about the state of mental health in the US. Take it, regardless of whether you're interested in the helping profession or law school or anything else!",
    "Take it! My placement for this class was amazing (teaching a class at a children's psychiatric hospital\/school), the triad was fun and useful for learning different kinds of therapy, and the seminar is alright too.",
    "awesome class; one of the few classes at Yale that allows you to translate theory into practice; weekly response papers, weekly journal entries, final presentation, and final paper (but all worth it)",
    "In PSYC 356, you focus on a different type of therapy every class. Two students present the therapy and outside of class, your triad (you and 2 other students) meets to practice that therapy. You also continue the fieldwork placement you started in PSYC 355. Throughout the semester, you write nine thought questions (essentially reading responses) and weekly journal responses. There's a final research paper (6-8 pages) and a final experiential paper (6-8 pages). Overall, it's not too demanding. Would recommend only if you are VERY interested in a career in clinical psychology.",
    "Take it if you are committed to forming a bond with your match at your placement. However, if this becomes only a semester long class it might still be interesting to know types of therapies, and triad was definitely one of my favorite parts of the semester.",
    "If you're interested in a future career in any helping profession, I think it would benefit you in some way to take this class.",
    "This was a great course. It offers a very unique opportunity to study and implement many psychological treatments and tactics. It was truly enlightening to have the possibility to interact with real patients and to make an impact as a non professional. There is a great balance and correlation in the course between experiences inside and outside the classroom. Highly recommend it.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course, it was one of the most practical courses I have ever taken at Yale. The field placement is an amazing learning opportunity, so definitely don't take it lightly. Prof. Lockhart is great and really engaging , even though it was a long class I never checked my watch!"
