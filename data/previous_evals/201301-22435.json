   "comments": [
    "It's a math class that at times is shockingly easy and at times very difficult. Half algebra and half multivariable calculus, so the wide range of material makes it difficult to remember everything.",
    "I would only take it if you are interested in it. It doesn't really fulfill any major requirement, and is definitely not an easy class. problem sets take awhile, and exams are tough",
    "Very solid class--essentially an overview of both multivariable calc and linear algebra. A good option if you need to brush up on math but aren't really into it. Rolf is absolutely excellent--a really clear lecturer and a good guy. If he is teaching 118 (or any other class), take it.",
    "Prof. Rolf is new to Yale. And this was his first time to teach this class. Perhaps because of this, his lectures were somewhat disoriented in the beginning. But he got much better towards the second half of the class, and I really enjoyed the class from then on. Overall, I recommend this class.",
    "Yes! Professor Rolf brings great energy to the classroom and to the material. The math you learn in this class, particularly the multivariable calculus, is applicable to so many different subjects, from engineering to economics to sociology.",
    "I would recommend this course. It was a great introduction to two very important topics in math: linear algebra and mutli-variable calc. Consider it a foundation on which to build more in-depth knowledge on those two subjects. Be aware of the difficulty of the tests and some of the problem sets.",
    "With Prof. Rolf, I found it to be really difficult. Then again, I don't consider myself to be a \"math\" person. Overall, probably good if you are considering an econ major. Otherwise, I don't see why you would take it.",
    "This class is hard, do not take it unless you absolutely need it.",
    "This is a great class. It is hard and sometimes a bit abstract, but it is a good class to get a QR and understand logically what it is about. The midterms and final are more conceptual than one expects!",
    "Econ Math--not too difficult, but annoying.",
    "It's a good math class to fulfill the math requirement in the Econ major. The stuff you learn at the end of the class is pretty relevant to many of the econ classes.Professor Rolf is a good instructor. However, this was his first year teaching at Yale so there were a few areas he could improve on. For the first midterm, he gave us 3 practice midterms of which none of them were even slightly similar to the actual midterm. They were incredibly easy, yet the actual midterm was pretty tricky with a large portion of the questions being true or false. He gave very little indication that this would be the case. I was prepared for the next exams but was caught very off-guard by the first midterm. He then proceeded to tell the class that he doesn't agree with the policy that some of the math classes do whereby if you do well on the final, a bad midterm score won't detract from your grade. This policy would seem quite fair in this particular circumstance.Even still, I would recommend taking a math class with Professor Rolf. He is very nice, very fair (contrary to what my description above may suggest), and very engaging. I was expecting this class to be slightly uninteresting but think Professor Rolf did a great job of keeping the class engaged. Basically, if you take a class with Rolf, be careful about the mid-terms\/exams.",
    "This course is a great introduction to both Linear Algebra and Multivariable Calculus. I would definitely recommend it for someone who does not like integration and isn't interested in 120, but wants to continue with math, or for someone interested in the Economics major.",
    "This class is an enjoyable, manageable exploration of basic linear algebra and multi-variable calculus. It covers a lot of ground, but never feels too rushed or unbearable. Professor Rolf made the class great - his teaching style was very effective, and he welcomed questions and comments from all students. If you want to take a math class that introduces you to many different concepts, definitely consider this one.",
    "It was a fine class. Take it with Rolf because he's energetic and helpful. If you have to take it, then go ahead, just put in the time to do the reading and try to understand the material very well, because oftentimes there are problems on the homework and on exams that differ greatly from the types of problems presented as examples in class or in the reading, which is difficult to deal with the night before psets are due. Go to problem sessions; I hear they're helpful even though I could never go. I would recommend it as a pre-req for Intermediate Micro (which was my reason for taking it) as opposed to Math 115 or 120 because it is targeted at people who don't plan to necessarily continue with math. It luckily doesn't depend too heavily on your remembering Calculus from high school, as long as you can still take derivatives. No integrals, no series, which is wonderful. It's fine.",
    "It is great if you plan not to take more advanced math class but want to know some important math concepts needed for econ. You don't have to worry to much about having forgotten a lot of materials from high school calculus. The course does not go into the integrals part of multivariable calculus so it is not as demanding as math 120. Overall I recommend this course.",
    "Math 118 is a challenging but fair course, and if you take it with Rolf you'll really get to know the material.",
    "It is a good math course and can be challenging at times. I can't compare it to taking 120 and linear separately but I definitely learned a lot. I'd recommend it but probably would have shopped Marketa In the fall if I could do it again."
