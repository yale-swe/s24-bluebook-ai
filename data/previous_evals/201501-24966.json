    "Yes!! Professor Camacho is a sweetheart, and the material itself will push you to think about migrant-centered topics in more nuanced ways. Take it!!",
    "This was by far my favorite class at Yale so far. We covered a broad range of topics and got to talk in depth about each one. The readings were super interesting and the documentaries we watched were extremely insightful. I wouldn't change a thing. I definitely recommend it.",
    "Yes! More people need to learn about migrants and their struggles and why migration is so prevalent now.",
    "YES, please take it if you can.",
    "The class is split into two components: class readings and individual projects. Each week, there are a few sources tied to a central theme about Central American migration. We discuss the sources in class, and Professor Camacho spends 1\/3 to 1\/4 of the class time elucidating details in the sources, tying previous sources and ideas together, and just straight up blowing your mind. The second part of the class is the final project. You are to come up with some culminating product (paper, website, movie, digital media piece, work of art) that incorporates both in-class readings and research done for the weekly blogs the blogs are weekly updates on your project to show deep understanding of migrant-centered issues in one specific realm of migrant life; e.g. music, food, education for undocumented people, detention center reform, queer migrant life, etc. It is well worth the work (often times, the readings were so engaging that I chose to study up on the rise of gang culture in Central America rather than watch Netflix, sleep, or hang out with friends).",
    "I would definitely recommend this course for anyone who is interested in the question of immigration to the United States from Mexico and Central America. The course also presents a unique opportunity for people to pursue their own research questions or get involved in the community. I would also recommend taking any class with Professor Camacho. Overall, a wonderful course.",
    "This is a great class. I would definitely recommend it. You'll learn a lot about a very important topic. There are two papers--one short one and one final project. You will work on the project the whole semester. There are readings and reading responses. The readings are really good and you'll watch several interesting movies. Professor Camacho is excellent and cares a lot about students."
