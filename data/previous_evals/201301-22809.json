    "Take the class! Laguna brings a great energy to the class and makes it fun. The subject matter is cool and you get to read books you would never read in English\/Lit classes.",
    "The Latino\/a Novel is a great course. Reading intensive--about 1 novel a week and 1 reading response. It exposes its students to many new genres of literature and the books are very informative and often entertaining. I would definitely recommend this course to another student.",
    "You get to read a lot of the best and widely known Latina\/o novels as well as reading some others that you may not have heard of. Since it is a seminar, you really get the opportunity to discuss a lot with your classmates. One reading response per week, one presentation, and two papers - this class isn't very demanding with its work, but there is a lot of reading. The list of books are absolutely great, however, so it's definitely worth it.",
    "Great class!! Take it. Take anything with Professor Laguna!",
    "I would recommend this class for anyone who is interested in reading a variety of novels written by Latino authors. This is a great class for anyone who is interested in discussing different facets of latinidad and how these books and authors interact with the western cannon."
