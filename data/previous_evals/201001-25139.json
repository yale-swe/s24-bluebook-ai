   "comments": [
    "This class is pretty good, but also very challenging. Professor Horan expects a lot from her students, especially in the essays. Week to week it's not too much work for a seminar, though sometimes the discusssions can get monotonous. Overall I would recommend it if you are really interested in the topic.",
    "If you can handle dense and jargon-filled poli sci papers, you may find this class very rewarding. Cynthia Horan is a good professor and though the class is a poli sci seminar the requirements really aren't that hard (two ten page papers). The material is relevant and interesting if you work hard enough to understand it.",
    "Cynthia Horan is the best seminar professor I have had at Yale. She assigns manageable amounts of reading combined with graded reading responses so that you actually want to and feel compelled to do them. She leads discussion in a seminar (!) which is far more helpful than letting students present each week. She also clearly knows a great deal and her methods are rigorous in a non-intimidating way. She's also delightful and accessible in office hours. Papers are not that bad, and really encourage you to have a firm grasp on the material. Take her if you're interested in Urban Studies or City Politics (which are two different things!)",
    "Definitely take this class if you want a detailed look of how cities operate. Avoid this class if you think it's just going to be a cool history-like course on the politics of these three cities.",
    "Take it if you are at all interested in the material. Just know that it will be a fair amount of work.",
    "Take it.",
    "Comprehensive overview of impacts of neoliberalism and globalization on the politics of New York, L.A. and Chicago. A mix of discussion of individuals and institutions. A really nice follow-up to PLSC 245."
