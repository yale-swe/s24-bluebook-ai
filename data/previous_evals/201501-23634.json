I think the syllabus has just the right amount of Old Comedy on it. I find the Old Comedy very hard to get through in translation, much more so than the tragedies, and I think the way they Old Comedies are paired with the Euripides are very illuminating.",

   "comments": [
    "The papers helped us expand on some of the topics that we dealt with during the sessions",
    "The style and rhetorical occasion of the one-to-two-page papers we wrote throughout the semester could have been more clearly articulated. Originally, we were encouraged to \"think out loud\" about plays for a few pages, but this seems to me less formal than the papers were really supposed to be. More successful papers seemed to make a clear, persuasive argument. The final project, while conceived with the utmost consideration of the professional work dramaturgs will later do, needs sharpening. The expectations for and aims of the assignment were not well-defined, which is evident given the extreme variety of work that was submitted. Were they production notes? Were they ideas for a modern-day adaptation of the play? Should they include potential doubling charts for a play? Should the assignment be written with a specific theater or director in mind? Should we imagine we are directing the production ourselves? It was very difficult to submit satisfactory work.",
    "The project at the end of the year, to create production notes for a possible contemporary production, was a great end to the year, and I gained a lot of insight into the play that I chose to work on (The Bacchae) by doing it.",
    "The biweekly responses kept us focused in our reading and helped our class discussions considerably."

He is virtuosically fluent in the material in this class, able to answer any and all questions on the spot and to elaborate on any concepts that students might not know about. He is also good at drawing out the most interesting and provocative and challenging conversation about the texts from the students in the class, making them engaged, active learners and co-leaders n their own educational experience. I cannot overstate how important this class was to me and to my education in theater. It was also a joy.",
