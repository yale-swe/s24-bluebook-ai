    "Overall, an excellent course. It only meets once a week, which is nice, and it's a lot of fun to make music in the small colligium. There are two concerts a semester, which to me is the perfect amount.",
    "Take it if you want an easy fifth credit. You don't have to be good at singing, but you definitely have to be patient enough to sit through the rehearsals and endure the pain of hearing people singing out of tune. The concerts are fun.",
    "I would recommend it to someone who wants a fun, not-that-straining music course.",
    "It's a relatively chill course, but do show up and put in the time. It's worth it. The music is beautiful.",
    "This course is extremely fun, and Grant is amazing - he always has very interesting things to say about the music, and he's also just a great, really nice guy.",
    "This was one of the funnest classes I have taken. You get to do music that you'd never get to do otherwise. Especially fun if you get to play a weird old instrument. Also, besides learning music there is absolutely no assigned work.",
    "This class involves learning, rehearsing and playing a few concerts' worth of medieval or renaissance repertoire, and learning about the music's history. I absolutely loved this course.",
    "MUSI 334 is an awesome course! Most of the class time is spent playing music. If you haven't played much early music, you'll find the melodies, rhythms, ad ornamentation to be a delightful mind-stretcher. If you play an instrument, you'll probably be able to borrow an early version of your instrument to play."
