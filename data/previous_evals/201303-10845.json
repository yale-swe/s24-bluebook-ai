   "comments": [
    "STAT 102 is an introductory course to statistics. It will teach you how to use basic software (Minitab), although it will not teach you Stata. If you require an attention-grabbing professor, I would take STAT for Social Science rather than Political Science.",
    "Take the social science section if you need stats for poli sci or EP&E! Professor Reuning-Scherer is brilliant and hilarious.",
    "Great introduction to statistics for data analysis knowledge in future",
    "I recommend the Poli Sci section, even if you've taken AP Stats. The first half is with JRS: his jokes get old and he lectures really quickly, so you might as well just read the lecture notes. Prof. Gerber is better: he explains concepts clearly, and you will understand the logic behind stats. Hopefully, he'll spend more time on regression next year.",
    "I would recommend this course simply because of its utility. I think everyone should have an intro statistics course after taking this one. It's useful for so many different reasons, and isn't too \"mathy\" for those who, like me, aren't very mathematically-minded.",
    "A course that, despite the reviews from last year, was a fairly solid, if scattered, introduction to statistics. Professor Reuning-Scherer's half of the course was very fast-paced and engaging. Professor Gerber's unit, while far from the most interesting course at Yale, was not nearly as bad as others had made it out to be. In fact, probably because of past bad reviews, the section was very small, allowing for an almost seminar-style atmosphere. Professor Gerber is very nice and well-schooled in the field of political statistics, though his teaching style can get confusing and repetitive, especially in comparison to Professor Reuning-Scherer. Not as much political science content as I would have liked.",
    "I would only recommend it if you are ready to put a lot of effort in.",
    "yes. I actually had fun and am considering taking more stat classes.",
    "Don't take the poli sci section of this class. Professor Gerber is very nice, but what he teaches in class doesn't help at all on the problem sets and doing them is almost impossible. Very stressful section and you dont get much out of it. Otherwise the rest of the class is great.",
    "I would not recommend the course to another student. I would suggest the take the stats for social science course instead."
