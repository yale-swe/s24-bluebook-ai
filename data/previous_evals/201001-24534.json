   "comments": [
    "I would recommend Enviro Studies 255 to a fellow student; if they want to be a Enviro Studies major they have to take it anyway. Its not a bad class, and a lot of the books we have to read and the case studies are interesting, it just gets hard to find a reason to attend lecture during the course of the semester.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this class. It is essential that you leave Yale having taken some sort of environmental issues class.",
    "good classtake it for environmental interest or a political science one",
    "Not quite what you'd expect, but still worth taking if you're really interested in the subject. Disproportionally focused on chemicals (pesticides, plastics, nuclear fallout, etc.) and human health, since those seem to be Wargo's main interests, but you'll definitely learn a lot. Wargo isn't always the most engaging lecturer, but he really cares about his students and the material.",
    "YES! Absolutely take this course. It is one of a kind. Professor Wargo's EPL class is so unique that you will never get the opportunity to take anything like it anywhere else.",
    "I would definitely recommend it if this is something in which the student is interested.",
    "This class is not worth your time.",
    "Yes! The course teaches information about our world and country of which everyone who interacts with the environment should be aware.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course. I am not an environmental studies major, and just took this class for fun. It was very fulfilling.",
    "loved this class, even though it made me feel like i will die if i eat food, drink water, touch water, touch plastic, wear clothing, breathe, or do basically anything. good overview of both policy and law, and it was my first experience reading material with lots of legal jargon, so that taught me a lot. the slides in class go too fast, but most of the information you need is in the readings and Wargo's book.",
    "Yes I would, although the midterm and final are tough because they require 2200 words in 48 hours.",
    "Take home mid-term and final are not that hard. You don't really have to read in order to be able to participate in section. Great 5th class or C\/D",
    "good intro to env law although it was a little skimpy on the law aspect.",
    "Environmental laws. Topics include plastics, land use, tobacco, air quality, drinking water, pesticides, nuclear weapons, hazardous sites, and more. I would recommend this class to a fellow student. There are lots of environmental studies majors in the course as it's required for their major.",
    "It is a very useful class for people planning to go into science or into law or study the environment. At times it could be a little boring, but then again, law can be a bit boring (sorry, I'm a science major!) Environmental issues are interesting, though. Slash frustrating. SAVE THE WHALES! AND THE PLANET!!!!!",
    "A decent course. Overview of wide range of environmental topics, usually with the same theme (\"regulation has failed in this area, what can we do to improve it?\"). Wargo is a somewhat disorganized lecturer, many of his powerpoints are just long lists and pictures. Take home midterm and final, which make attendance and readings largely unnecessary.",
    "I would definitely recommend it. It is important knowledge about our environment that will force you to think about the way you live, if not change it.",
    "A great overview of how environmental laws are formulated and enforced at the federal level.Yes.You may know a fair amount about environmental issues, but you need to understand how things work at the federal level.",
    "Take the class. Really interesting material. An athlete friendly class, the workload is very manageable and you end up doing all of it because it's so interesting.",
    "A great course that anyone interested in public policy should take.",
    "Good chill course and a definite must for a well rounded education. Wargo is great. Also in class midterm is the way to go.",
    "Good if you want an interesting course.",
    "Environmental politics with a legal slant. A little history, but a decent amount of relevant up to date discussion \/ information.",
    "The only evaluations for this class are a take-home midterm and a take-home final. Since you can't spend more than two days on either, this means you will actually spend four days doing work for this class. Neither exam is very hard either, as long as you stay on top of the reading, which is very interesting and easy for the most part. Wargo is boring, but he really knows what he's talking about, and you don't really need to pay much attention in lecture anyway. If you're an EVST major, you'll enjoy it. If you're looking for a gut, this has potential too.",
    "I wouldn't really recommend it, but it's not a bad class. Some of the reading is cool (Omnivore's Dilemna, A Question of Intent), and some of it's pretty dull. Section was pretty good, although often dominated by people with a lot of specific scientific\/environmental knowledge. Lectures can be kind of dull. The workload is okay, but you do have a 400 page book to read over spring break (an interesting one, though). Since the class is about both the environment and law, I never really knew how much legal detail or environmental detail to learn - the details get boring kind of fast, so I feel like I left having learned only kind of vague things without a solid basis for them. Also, you'll start realizing how many parts of your daily routine are going to kill you, and how much class injustice there in terms of environmental risk. Wargo's ultimate message is positive - he trusts that everyone in his class\/at Yale has the capacity to change the world for the better. Sadly, I ended up not caring enough about the class for it to prepare me to do so. I ended up with an okay grasp of what legal strategies don't work, but without any ideas for how to change things - kind of a downer for spring semester.",
    "This is clearly an introductory survey course, though a spectacular one. It is really interesting, but it covers a lot of ground quickly. If someone takes this course after having taken a more advanced course, it may take some time to get used to the pace. That said I highly recommend this class to anyone who plans on being a voter in the United States.",
    "I think everyone should take this class. The goal is to learn how to use law to design a more sustainable future where everyone is protected from harm by analyzing what worked and didn't work in past laws. You don't have to be an environmentalist to appreciate this course- it is applicable to anyone who lives on this planet.",
    "great, if terrifying overview of urgent problems facing humankind",
    "Yes. Very insightful course. Take it credit\/d.",
    "Great introduction to the problems of environmental law.",
    "Political Science 215 was a survey of major environmental problems and the laws meant to control and mitigate those problems. Also, the course had a heavy focus on critically analyzing the laws and seeing how to improve environmental law to better protect the environment and human health. I would recommend this course to another student with a passion for the environment; it isn't too much work and the topics are very interesting.",
    "Beware, apart from a few sections later in the term, this is really more of a public health course than an environment-for-environment's-sake course. This is likely a product of the anthropocentric nature of US environmental law, but stay clear of this course if public health isn't really your thing.",
    "This is a pretty broad overview of Env. Law. It's interesting, but disorganized. We went over a lot of material, but I was still left with the feeling that I didn't learn as much as I should have (and I did all the readings and attended most of the lectures). Only take it if you are really interested in env. law or if you need it for the EVST major.",
    "Take it if you need it, take it for fun too. It's interesting stuff. Not too heavy on readings. Take home midterm and final or a paper to replace the midterm.",
    "A must take class. Course really isn't that hard but still learn a whole lot that are very beneficial to see how the world is run today in terms of environmental issues. The class isn't just about trying to make you think like an environmentalist, but rather a governor who must weigh all the cost-benefits and such when an environmental issues are considered.",
    "Absolutely take it. It's a great class!",
    "A good overview of environmental problems of the past 100 years in the United States and select other countries. Looking at some of the general means by which they are manageed and handled. A very broad, abstract course that covers a lot of material, not a lot of specific information about how cases are handled.",
    "I would highly recommend taking this course. I am inspired to go to law school and help change these major structural problems that really do not account for human health. Environmental problems are inextricably linked to quality of life and this course makes it very evident that a clean environment is important for all people.",
    "Highly recommended. Course gives you a good understanding of thechallenges in creating environmental law. Also a good overview of major environmental legislation- its successes and shortcomings. Because every week is a different topic, your interest may wax and wane, but if there is a certain topic you want to study more intensely you can choose to write a paper on it for the midterm- this was a really great experience. Check out the syllabus to see if the topics are areas you'd like to learn about. This course is much more about Environmental Law than it is about Politics (don't expect to study Congress).",
    "Take it, it's interesting and engaging. Wargo isn't the best speaker but the material itself is fascinating enough to warrant study."
