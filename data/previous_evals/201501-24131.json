    "Professor Jaffe's course needs much more structure. The lessons were all over the place, and often devolved into irrelevant discussions sparked by students with very niche interests.",
    "The professor is a fantastic professor. She is very knowledgeable in her field, petroleum geopolitics.",
    "Begging part of the class was well prepared, however, as the course goes by, the lecture was disorganized and I was not able to gain comprehensive knowledge about the U.S energy policy.",
    "Question 3. Work for the midterm, in-class activity, and final were extremely time consuming and\/or required a lot of preparation relative to the material covered in class. Concepts from the readings were not often covered, so we were left to work through new material on our own. Question 10. Professor Jaffe was very engaging and personable, but class time was not structured well, and very little material was covered in a meaningful way. It was disappointing to have so much class time spent watching film clips, or going over the requirements for assignments due. It also often felt like we were simply trying to take up time until the end of class.",
    "the expectation for the class was high but the instructor did not meet it. Her teaching are unclear, not well taught out - not Yale graduate standard",
    "I loved how Professor Jaffe used a lot of her own extensive experience in the energy industry to highlight the changing policies and circumstances of the energy industry. She would tell us these amazing stories of what happened during OPEC meetings, etc. that really made me much more interested in understanding the energy industry. While some people may have saw this as distracting--it gave us a first hand look at how some energy decision are made, which is critical to know.",
    "Re: the pace of the course: The amount of material the course sought to cover was ambitious given that this was only a 2 credit course, but then the pace of discussion in class was too slow to actually cover most of it. Out of class assignments were extensive, but in-class time was informal and not always very informative. A student would have had to do a lot of self-teaching and extra learning outside of class readings in not very much time to build up the background needed to really get a lot out of the class assignments. The title is somewhat misleading. The course was less about emerging energy issues and more about the history of Middle East geopolitics, with the focus almost exclusively on petrol."

Conversations were often only between a few people without much direction to increase participation from other students. Classroom time management was lacking."

So if you're interested in climate change, it's relevant because these things will determine the use of alternative energies in the future. Also, it will impact environmental stewardship in the energy industry.",

While it did in that my other courses did not have an explicit focus on Oil, I think I learned just as much from other students in the class as I did from the instructor and I'm not sure I am equipped to do anything with the knowledge I gained."
