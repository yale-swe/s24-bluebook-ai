    "Independent study courses are a wonderful way to learn. I'd definitely recommend that you take at least one independent study class before graduating. You'll learn a lot, and you'll probably have fun. Professors are usually willing. You just have to ask.",
    "YES. If she teaches something like this again...This course could be blandly entitled \"Indian Philosophy Tutorial\" but that would do an incredible disservice to the course. Suffice it to say, this class went through a vast amount of material but in depth for an engaging class every week. I'll be honest -- when the class first started, and we were given a basic reading on logical fallacies in the realm of Indian Philosophy, I was worried about the imminent works. Though the readings were difficult and often very abstruse, the course immediately lifted the veil and Professor Granoff showed us the Way. Now that I have taken the course, I think I have to take the same course at least one more time -- the exact one -- and I'll have a wonderful hold on a little bit of the material!If she ever offers this course --be it survey or focused-- you'd be a fool not to take it and refuse a guide like her. We discussed this many times in class, but there are simply too many unreliable translations (both text and commentary), and that without (or even with) an expert guide who not only has the obviously tremendous background but possible on-site translation capability, taking up the cause of understanding the big schools of philosophy on your own\/without her would be fruitless. As for the material -- if you are not acquainted with it (as I was) and especially if you are only versed in traditional Western philosophy, then you MUST BE EXPOSED to this material. I can't tell you why. But take such a course, and you'd know.",
    "If you are interested in the material then you'll enjoy it. Prof. Granoff is amazing, but if philosophy isn't your interest then this class could really frustrate you.",
    "Insofar as this is an individual tutorial, it obviously differs with each iteration - but my seminar on Hegel's Phenomenology was excellent!",
    "I would most definitely recommend Professor Granoff's course on Indian Philosophy for anyone who has taken her other course on Traditional Literature of India, China and Japan. It was a great experience to be exposed to the different Indian schools that offer the philosophical basis for such seminal works ast he Mahabharata and the Ramayana, and informs the Jain tradition and the many branches of Buddhism throughout Asia. It is essential for anyone who would like to have a better grasp of what the shape non-western thought is like in the Indian subcontinent and beyond."
