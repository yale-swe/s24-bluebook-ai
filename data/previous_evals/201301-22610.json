    "You'll know the first day if it's for you. That's all I can say.",
    "Fun but not rigorous class. Never about the texts, always about mark oppenheimers big ideas and musings. Snack club book club with Oppenheimer.",
    "I really enjoyed this course. It felt like a book club more than a course. Mr. Oppenheimer is a great teacher and guides the conversation in a way that is helpful but not overbearing; the students get to speak but be also provides helpful commentary. I would really recommend this course. If felt like more of an English course than a political science course which may be good or bad depending on what you want. For a non-English major it felt like a great way to be able to experience an English course without it being overwhelming. Overall a great course.",
    "Reading intensive. Weekly reading response. Intense seminar dynamic. Scary final paper.",
    "The course is a good survey of various forms of political journalism. There is not much of an overarching thesis surrounding the whole syllabus, but it proves useful nonetheless to see on which major works writers of today are building and how the relationship between writers and politicians has evolved.",
    "ENGL 279 is a smorgasbord of political journalism, which can really include anything. It was not an extremely cohesive course. Most discussions didn't really seem like they had a goal, and the syllabus as a whole did not seem like it was leading to anything. I'd recommend Oppenheimer for sure, but I don't know if I'd recommend the course.",
    "There's a definite divide in the class between the hardcore YDN kids and then everyone else. I felt intimidated in class a lot of the time but you'll get some great friends out of it when you complain about the workload after class. I really enjoyed the syllabus and Oppenheimer is one of my favorite professors here at Yale. Hilarious, and really cares about his students. I would definitely recommend taking the class\/",
    "Yes! Take it. If you like political journalism, which really means great books written by smart and curious people, then you'll love the reading list and enjoy the discussions.",
    "Definitely recommend this class.",
    "A strong discussion-based survey of recent American political journalism. A bit scattered at times, but the discussions can be rigorous, and the final paper can be fun."
