    "A cozy seminar focusing mainly on the ancient texts, but then tracing their reverberations through time up until the present. Prof. Slanski is wonderful and this class is well worth taking if you're interested in the material.",
    "Yes! It was a great course that I enjoyed a lot while also learning a great deal, and gaining a new appreciation for classic works. Professor Slanski is a fantastic professor, and the course readings are enjoyable. The course consists of weekly reading responses (one page), and three papers. This year, we got to do a poetry reading in the YUAG which was a lot of fun!",
    "Ignore the syllabus. Not to say that you won't read all those works but that first paragraph will not happen. There will be little to no study of what defines a hero or what other cultures say about that. Take this course if you want a great seminar on reception, because that's where the real subject matter lies. There's a lot of cool stuff you'll check out--modern movies, plays, novels--to relate to the older stuff. And the trip to the Babylonian collection in sterling is amazing. Yeah, there's a lot of reading but it's not hard to get through and there are clear spots of focus. All in all, it's a really great course--the only problem is that it advertises itself as a different really great course.",
    "This class was a bright spot in my week. The small class setting allowed for genuine, thoughtful discussion of the text. The texts built upon each other, so that each week was a reflection on what a hero really means, throughout the history of the Western world. The assignments were appropriate and really very fun to work on. The material was so interesting that the weekly reading responses were entirely useful because they gave me a way to articulate what I found most interesting and be ready for class discussion the next day. The papers again were fun, especially the creative assignment: I found myself thinking of them and wanting to work on them even when I was doing work for other classes. Overall, this class is a gem.",
    "I would definitely recommend CLCV 312 to another student interested in the subject matter."
