    "Best class I have taken at Yale so far.",
    "The pluses: Fascinating reading selections (examples of social documentary in contexts like Hurricane Katrina, Rwanda, and Gaza). Prof. Camacho is incomparably nice and will work with you individually to refine your project.The minuses: Lack of structure, both in terms of reading discussion throughout the semester and in terms of the final project. Prof Camacho gave us a lot of freedom as to the format and content of our social documentaries, but this led to confusion as to what we were supposed to be doing. I do think that she is aware of this problem, however, and is going to modify the syllabus for next year.I think this course would be a good choice if you have a social movement in mind that you want to document. The class would allow you the freedom to use text, video, and music in your analysis. However, if you're looking to learn a concrete narrative or even a concrete discipline, there might not be enough structure here for you.",
    "YES. I would recommend this course to students who are interested in studying processes of social documentation, particularly ethnographies. The student should be flexible and open to changes in course requirements along the way since the course is new.",
    "yes. great material and the opportunity to flesh out a project of your own choosing. choose a topic that interests you and follow it for a semester. great project.",
    "A great class to take if you are interested in American Studies or Ethnicity, Race and Migration. It gives an in-depth view of current or recent events and movements and what those movements mean for people in the present. Take this class if you are interested in why and how disadvantage exists for so many people in the world but be prepared to challenge your own notions and beliefs as well.",
    "A pretty self-directed study of a current issue alongside relevant material on other social issues of the day.Great if you'er interested in the real meat of american studies."
