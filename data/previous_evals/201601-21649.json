   "comments": [
    "KREN 120, compared to KREN 110, is, I would say, easier in terms of both grading and learning material. However, although Professor Choi is very knowledgable in the subject, she is not as experienced as Professor Lee in terms of teaching and explanations. This means that there is a lot less hand-holding involved. However, if you have retained enough of the information from KREN 110 and make good use of section, this should not be a problem at all. And of course as always, Korean is in general a very enjoyable, stress-free class.",
    "If you want to learn Korean, definitely! It's a very learnable language.",
    "Will teach you to express more complex and nuanced thoughts. Be prepared to work if you don't have a heritage background in Korean.",
    "At first, L2 seems daunting. But the step up from L1 to L2 really improves your Korean. More is required of you, but you are more than capable of reaching the new bar set for you in Korean. I would highly recommend this class.",
    "A very good class to take if you're serious about learning Korean -- yes, I would recommend Korean 120 to another student but only if you have the time to really invest in the class. It's kind of confusing at times, but definitely very do-able. Just stick out the first month or so. It's annoying because there are lots of fluent speakers in the class, but it's still a good class to take to improve\/learn Korean.",
    "yes",
    "I really feel that my Korean has improved this semester. We learn more grammar structures. I actually feel that L2 is overall easier than L1 because once you get the basics of how the grammar works in L1, you can just build off of it. Strengths: a good continuation of L1. Great attention from the professor and TA. Being close to your classmates. Weaknesses: sometimes the class can be a bit \"dry\", I know some students find it slightly boring sometimes. Maybe if we could have more regular fun in class activities, students would remain more engaged. Also the structure of the class was very confusing in the beginning. It took a while to work out how to use the schedules. The different abbreviations and when things were due were a little confusing at first, but then it was fine as the semester went along.",
    "Highly Recommend.",
    "A solid continuation of the Korean sequence. Class can get a little repetitive at times, but it's clear Professor Choi cares about her students and their progress in learning Korean. Perhaps mixing up the assignments a little more (introducing some more \"fun\"\/creative-type assignments, perhaps) would improve the course."
