    "Take this class if you want to learn a lot about urban poverty. You will walk out with a wealth of knowledge and much improved critical thinking skills. Know that this is a challenging class and Horan don't play. BUT if you have the time to dedicate to 1 particularly challenging class during the course of your semester, please take this class. You will be so happy with how much you've learned and for having the opportunity to explore this complex issue.",
    "Big investment. Big reward. The class is demanding--you have to read a lot and read well--but it's worth is because of what you learn. Whereas many classes on poverty scratch the surface of certain issues, professor Horan helps you get to the root of these problems.",
    "I would recommend this course if you're interested in poverty policy. The reading list is really interesting and varied (ethnographies, quantitative papers, policy papers). The two papers are based on challenging prompts but just be sure to keep up with the readings (and take notes on them) and you'll be fine.",
    "If you'd like to gain insight into the world of poverty and policy, it's a great class for you!",
    "There's no doubt Professor Horan is tough - she frankly won't take any crap during class. But you'll walk away much more knowledgeable about poverty policy in general and urban poverty in particular. The course requires a 2 page reading response every week and two 12-page essays, so it is quite a bit of writing. Do the readings and you'll get a lot out of this class.",
    "This was a tough, but interesting and worthwhile class for me. I hadn't known much about urban poverty before, and this helped me learn more about the nuances of urban poverty. The material is broad and diverse, from ethnography to policy. There is a lot of reading, but most of them are interesting and straightforward. There are few dense readings, but Professor Horan will help you get through them. Professor Horan is tough, but you will learn a lot from her. She is also very approachable and you should definitely email her or talk to her outside of class. She really wants to help you understand the material.",
    "Great class, horan is truly the best.",
    "I would recommend it. However, it's not a ton of work, but it's more work than the typical poli sci class.",
    "If you're interested in anything to do with social justice, urban policy, and\/or poverty, this is a great seminar to take. Prof. Horan runs a tight ship -- if you haven't done the reading or make stupid comments, she will call you out. That being said, it means discussion is excellent, and she's wonderful in office hours. Strongly recommend it.",
    "This seminar was excellent. I would highly recommend it to anyone who's interested in policy-oriented understanding of poverty in the US. The course is heavy towards looking at urban poverty. The readings are really great (and you should plan to do them all! If not, as many as you can!). This is certainly not a class where you can get by completing just some of the reading.",
    "If you have any interest in urban poverty, or urban studies, or poverty, or policy making, take this class. discussing any of these issues with Professor Horan will give you a better understanding of the topic, and make you a better person.",
    "Yes! Take it! You learn so much, and the class forces you to think critically in new ways."
