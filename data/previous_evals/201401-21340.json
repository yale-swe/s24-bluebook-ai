   "comments": [
    "I ended up liking this class much more than I expected to. The beginning lectures are a little dry and sometimes hard to understand but as the semester went on we really learned a lot. The final project is actually a really fun assignment. I would recommend this course.",
    "Sometimes lectures get boring, but generally some interesting take-aways from the class if you are interested in learning about the subject. more applicable than i would've thought, and i learned more than i thought i did.",
    "I would recommend this class to someone interested in micro\/nano tech. You cover a lot of topics without too much extra work. You have to be ready for the midterms, but they are very reasonable. The final project was also interesting.",
    "This was a great elective. I am a mechanical engineer and I took this class as my last elective and found it to be very interesting. There is no homework, just 2 midterms and 2 labs (he even let the second one be optional). The final project is a design project, but it is more of how you would design something and a business model for it, but you dont actually build it. The workload is manageable and yet you still learn a lot so this is a great class.",
    "I really enjoyed this class. The material that is covered is fascinating, cutting edge research. Sometimes it's easy to get a little lost in lecture, as Professor Fan goes through the material at a fast pace. But he creates very helpful study guides for the two midterms, composed of a few dozen questions that cover the material we should focus on. The end of term project is comprised of a presentation and a long paper. It was a lot of work, but it was easier because it was a partner project. There are also two lab sessions that were interesting, but sort of boring because they were not very hands-on. Overall, I would recommend this class. It's easy (no homework!) and interesting!",
    "Really good survey of important cutting edge tech. Not too much work at all.",
    "411 is agreat class and prof fan does a good job keeping up with the most recent technological advancements. He places an emphasis on the commercial viability of biomedical innovations.",
    "BENG 411 is an introduction to micro\/nanotech applications in medicine and biomedical engineering. The lectures are interesting, but you definitely have to want to be there. It would be easy to get bored with the class if you don't have an interest in the field or are too busy worrying about other classes. Lecture slides are available, but you need to be in class to get any useful information from them. No psets - 2 midterms, a final presentation and a final report."
