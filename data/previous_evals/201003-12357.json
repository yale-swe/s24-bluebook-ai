   "comments": [
    "Music 205 is the perfect class if you've never had music theory in high school but you can read it and understand it. You will become a better musician and performer from what you learn in this class as well; a deeper understanding of music theory is immensely helpful when analyzing new pieces.Professor McCreless is fantastic, and you should make every effort to take this class from him. He is a master of music and a phenomenal and caring teacher.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. It's perfect for musicians who may not have extensive theory knowledge and want to understand counterpoint, chord theory analysis, and begin musical part-writing. The approach is methodical, and although I didn't ace most assignments, I felt confident about them usually by the following day. The small seminar format is much appreciated. Professor McCreless is great! Take it with him if you can.",
    "It was a great course that introduced students who had perhaps performed a lot of music or were otherwise well acquainted with it to some basic theoretical concepts. I personally learned a lot that has broadened the way I learned music.",
    "Yes, if you have any interest in Music, or if you need a cool Humanities credit that doesn't involve a ton of reading, take this class. Professor McCreless is an awesome professor and the material is very cool. You end the semester feeling like you really understand how to write four part harmonies and analyze basic music forms. Great class.",
    "The class is described as an introduction to music theory. However, if you aren't a singer or some sort of instrumentalist, it will be hard (but not impossible). You are expected to do at least some simple dictations without any sort of instruction.",
    "This course is great if you want to learn intermediate music theory, but I would recommend this course only if you're dying to learn theory or need it for credit. The class isn't exactly very interesting or highly thought-provoking.",
    "I really enjoyed and would certainly recommend this course to other students. I would also say that it helps enormously to have taken\/take concurrently Music 218 (makes everything more feasible).",
    "Great class, I would recommend this class to anyone with informal theory experience that is interested in learning the rules behind what they already know from singing or playing an instrument. The class is not too much work and is a lot of fun so definitely take it.In addition, if you have the choice, try to take it with Professor McCreless if you can. He is an awesome guy, an amazing musician, and I think he is the only tenured professor that teaches any lower level theory class (the rest are taught by grad students).",
    "This was a great class for someone who has extensive practical experience with music who wants a better (or any) foundation in theory. It covers all the major bases in rudiments, counterpoint, harmony and voice-leading. It was also a very well taught and well organized class.",
    "I had no previous experience in music theory, but had played an instrument for much of my life, and I think everything I learned in this course was fundamental knowledge I wish I had known my whole life. Take it, and though it might be a bit of a stretch the first few weeks as you get up to speed, it's worth it."
