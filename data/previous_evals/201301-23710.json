    "Constantly learning new verb tenses, pretty challenging to learn and remember everything, especially because the textbook is crap. Overall though, it's a great language to know; but you won't learn it in this classroom, you have to go to Brazil and speak.",
    "Very easy. Useful language. Do it.",
    "Yes! Great course and language that is a low-stress language at Yale. Very useful language considering Brazil's rise (and the 2014 world cup, 2016 Olympic!!). It is a small department so you get personalized treatment from the professors.",
    "Next step in the sequence, if you have to take it, you have to take it. I would still recommend it because Thiago and Ana are good professors.",
    "Only take Portuguese if you know Spanish. Before I started taking the language, I read all the positive reviews of people saying it was easy. What I did not know at the time was that nearly everyone in the class had some prior Spanish experience (Spanish and Portuguese are VERY similar). If you have taken Spanish and want an easy way to fulfill the Foreign language requirement, take Portuguese. If not, stay away form this class.",
    "It's a great class, but it is a big step up from L1. I would recommend it to anyone.",
    "Good intro course."
