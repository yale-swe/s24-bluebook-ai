    "How to ethically conduct research. Very appropriate.",
    "Some interesting facts and stories, did learn some things but overall most of it just boiled down to basic ethical principles we've learned before.",
    "It helped me to think more about chemistry ethics issues that I hadn't before considered in chemistry, in particular ones that aren't clear cut, and what I would do in those situations.",
    "I was well-versed in current events in scientific ethics before the class already, but still I found out a lot of interesting history and how to avoid doing anything nefarious. It has taught me that my research is about the science, not my ego.",

    "This course enlarge my knowledge quite a lot. It definitely will help my research in the future.",
    "There were several interesting cases of ethical misconduct that I hadn't heard about previously, so it did contribute to my knowledge about what has occurred in the field(and in other fields). The example about the person who hid fossils and artifacts was particularly fascinating.",
    "Very helpful in learning about what will come up in ethics in research.",
    "help a lot.",
    "It helped me substantially",
    "This class provides a platform for how to conduct research in a serious manner. It provided me with information on how to better myself as a scientist",
    "Ethics is a very important subject and I think it is our responsibility to bear this in mind. This course successfully highlighted this point and is helpful to my future research."
