    "It's a pretty interesting proof based linear algebra class (if you're into math, that is, which I fortunately am). It's a sample of what mathematics is really about (proofs, reasoning, intuition, not brainless computation). The exams for this class were easy (too easy to be honest) and the workload was pretty light. However, the material is kind of difficult (and it should be this way, given the subject of the class), and the instructor did not make it any prettier. The class would definitely be better if Prof. Fresen developed his lecturing skills. I unfortunately feel as if I didn't gain too much by taking this class. I would only recommend it to people who have to take it (i.e. Math majors) and to those who have a genuine interest in linear algebra. Otherwise it will be tedious and boring (unless Prof. Fresen becomes better at teaching, which I hope he will).",
    "This was without question the worst course I have taken in two years of Yale. I used to think I wanted to major in math; after this, not so much.I did alright in the class, because Professor Fresen told us exactly what would be on the tests before we took them, but I don't feel like I've actually learned linear algebra after having taken the class, and I know many of my classmates feel the same way.Professor Fresen is a nice guy, but he's extremely unorganized. Instead of following the logical course of our textbook, he randomly jumped around through the chapters \"because it makes more sense to him that way\" and used different terminology in class than the book, making the book pretty useless. Like, we learned Gauss-Jordan elimination (the first topic in any normal linear algebra class) on the LAST DAY of class. Like, he only assigned 4 30-minute problem sets the whole term because he didn't want to grade them, making it nearly impossible to stay caught up. Like, he only graded about 1\/3 of the questions on each problem set, \"to make things easier on the TA.\" Like, he scheduled review sessions once a week and never showed up to them. Like, I went to his office hours and was told that he was too busy with his research to help me at the moment.I thought I should take this class because it seemed more mathy than 222. I wish I would have just taken 222, because then maybe I would have actually learned something.",
    "Really depends on the instructor you get. If you get Fresen...don't expect ot learn anything, but you'll pass the class if you put effort in.",
    "Don't take MATH 225 unless you love proofs, want to do a lot more work than in 222.Especially, don't take 225 with Fresen. In the first half of the semester he thought that he was teaching an advanced linear algebra course and that we would all have taken linear algebra before. The course is completely unstructured and he neither wrote out the full proofs we had to know on the tests, nor did he stick to the textbook. The TA didn't show up to most sections.Even though I like mathematics, this class was a pain in the ass and I feel like I haven't really learned a lot in it.",
    "Good introduction to theory. I'm sure some students will say \"don't take this class with Fresen!\" But he's actually a solid teacher, this semester's material was just a bit disorganized, which I'm sure will improve in later years.",
    "Take it if you have to. You will learn a lot about proof based math but it's not worth the stress and you don't actually gain any problem solving skills. If you're interested in theory take it, if not take 222 (it's much easier I hear).",
    "I would not recommend Math 225 to another student, unless the organization of the class was drastically improved. First off, Professor Fresen is a cool guy. He's very helpful in class and is humble enough to introduce himself as Daniel. Unfortunately, this was his first year teaching, so he really had no idea what he was doing. We were only assigned 4 problem sets all semester and had no real exposure to proving things on our own, which is inexcusable for a proof-based course. The midterms and finals were too easy, so practically everyone's grade was bunched together in the 90s, which made the curve awful. Also, our TA (whoever this guy was) was lazy. He frequently skipped the review sessions he was assigned to lead, only graded a third of our homework problems, and couldn't even add the scores correctly on our problem sets. Don't get me wrong; the material in this class is extremely interesting and fundamental to any real mathematics, but this year the class was just a disaster. I wanted to like this class. I really did.",
    "A terrible class - but one you have to take for the major. If you don't want to be a math major, don't take this class. It isn't even remotely interesting or well-taught.",
    "I would recommend this course. It's probably the first proof-based course you've encountered -- don't fall into the notion that proofs are hard. In fact, after a proof-based course, you actually feel you understand the topic, instead of having spent a semester doing calculations using strange, devine formula. Proof-based courses can be bad if they're poorly taught -- not the case with Professor Fresen, who is very good at explaining things, really care about you, and is willing to answer all your questions (in class AND during office hours).",
    "I would not recommend Math 225 if Professor Fresen is teaching it. He was unhelpful and unclear. Studying for tests often consisted of memorizing the proofs Professor Fresen emailed to us two days in advance.The theory of linear algebra is interesting, however. Most of the class is proof-based, which is different, and I think preferable, to Math 120. I would definitely consider the class if someone else is teaching it.",
    "Yes, if you need it or are interested in proof based math. Algebra is really cool, and applicable to things like Mathematical Logic.",
    "Tough course. Worthwhile I feel like it was a good way to learn about proofs.",
    "As a non-math major, this class mostly confused the crap out of me. But this was largely my own fault. Lectures were purely note-taking sessions and I hardly absorbed anything I was writing while writing it. It was only until I spent some time on it later that it made sense. Exams are about a third computation (freebies for the most part) and two-thirds proofs. But almost all of the proof are ones covered in lecture and Professor Fresen posts exam guides that are somewhat helpful in letting students know what to study. If you feel comfortable with theoretical math, this class should be straightforward as an entry-level theory class. But if you can't keep up with the pace, it might be best to take Cr\/D\/F or not at all.",
    "Take it only if you're really interested in Maths. The material is interesting, but challenging. Plus, it's disorganized and badly taught. Exams are fair though.",
    "A fabulous, but rigorous course. Take with Daniel Fresen if you possibly can. He is truly fabulous!Do the things he says are exercises and then ask about them if you have questions.",
    "I would say it is a class where you have to teach yourself linear algebra, but you have a teacher that you can go to and ask questions to before the exam. I would recommend it in the end, though, because I didn't feel like it was too difficult and it was kind of rewarding to teach oneself.",
    "The class is a lot of work. Take it if you really like math. Make sure to go to the professor's office hours.",
    "Yes. Good course.",
    "Math 225 is a heavily proof based class through which you grow greatly as a mathematician. It is hard but recommended if you want to put in the effort!",
    "A tough class, but fun and a good intro to proofs in general. Highly theoretical and abstract- I'd recommend it!",
    "This is a class for people who are very interesting in a major in mathematics. It is a challenging course, but it could be fun for those willing to put in a lot of work."
