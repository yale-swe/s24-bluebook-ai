   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this class; we read interesting material and had meaningful and eye-opening discussions.",
    "interesting topic but beware of boring seminar sessions. i do feel like i got something out of the class that i'll take with me for life though, which is not typical i think of most classes. i definitely have gained some perspective on disability and i'm grateful for that.",
    "Awesome class-there's a lot of reading and film watching for homework, four papers and then a final paper--all in all not a bad workload, and the material you read is really thought-provoking and interesting. It really makes you rethink what it means to be \"disabled\" in our society. If you care about disability studies or know anyone who is disabled in any way, this class will definitely be interesting. If you don't want to spend the entire semester writing about disability, then don't take it; otherwise I recommend it!",
    "Spectacle of Disability is an interesting class. Professor Berger is very friendly and approachable, and tends to lead effective discussions (though of course this mostly depends on the other students in the class). The workload is manageable in terms of written assignments; a couple response papers, a midterm paper and a final paper. There is a substantial amount of assigned reading each week. Although you can get by without doing all the readings, to get a lot out of class you really need to keep up as much as possible. As for the material itself, I thought there was a really interesting mix between literature and social theory. I haven't taken a class quite like it, and I'm a big fan of interdisciplinary approaches so I enjoyed the reading list. You'll come to appreciate how disability can be a lens to examine some deep social assumptions, and you'll definitely come away from the class with a new perspective. We really cover a wide variety of topics, even though a class just about disability seems like it could be limiting; in fact it provides an interesting jumping off point for some great discussions. Overall I would recommend the class.",
    "Yes! This is a great opportunity to explore disability and disability studies through some really great books and plays, ranging from Ancient Greece to Elizabethan England to the modern day. Something for everyone through a lens that's really important to everyone."
