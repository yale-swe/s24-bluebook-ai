   "comments": [
    "It was so wonderful to be able to look at plants, and to see in person the things we'd talked about in lecture!",
    "I learned about many plant families in context of everyday life, knowledge that I will use regularly.",
    "Plant identification skills based on inference, plant drawing skills, plant dissection techniques.",
    "I developed a truly remarkable set of skills around botany from this lab course, including familiarity with major plant lineages and the gory details of plant anatomy, as well as a fluency in the scientific vocabulary of botany. I learned how to draw and annotate plant species, how to collect specimens for the herbarium, and had an amazing time while learned so much about a new topic.",
    "I learned how to draw plants and identify intricate parts.",
    "This course was taken alongside EEB 246. In this lab we walked through the phylogeny of plants and applied concepts learned during lecture.",
    "I learned how to understand and identify plant structures, to think more critically about the plants I see and the foods I consume, and how different plant groups relate to one another.",
    "I was extremely glad that this lab was a required accompaniment to the course, because I strongly believe that each course complemented and reinforced the other. It was also great to have so much food at each lab session, because it made the terms learned in the course - types of placentation, types of fruits, types of growth forms - more interesting and applicable. Allowing students to take their time to learn and process the vast diversity of plants was a great way to apply the botanist skills taught in the lecture component."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I loved this course! A little more direction, especially towards the beginning, might've been nice.",
    "This class is great. Hands on interaction with so many different plant lineages, with opportunities for sensory immersion (sight, touch, taste, smell) were hugely helpful in making the lecture material feel real.",
    "The strengths of this course are endless. First and foremost, the access to the incredible diversity of plants in the Marsh greenhouses makes this class very different from typical classroom style learning. The first hand engagement with plants, facilitated by tireless effort from Michael, Sarah, and Maddy paid off by the bucketful when it came to my learning about plants. Plus, the food and the atmosphere make this the most enjoyable lab course at Yale.",
    "The lab is great it was one thing I could look forward to every week for its relaxed and stress free environment. One thing I would improve is to do lab notebook check ins at least after 5 weeks to make sure that students are meeting the requirements. My grade on my lab notebook was not one I expected even though I felt that I had labelled every relevant concept, it would have been nice to know the amount of detail that was expected of me before turning the notebook in at the end.",
    "I thought the lab was wonderful! Coming to lab was always relaxing and enjoyable. I wouldn't change anything about it!",
    "It was great that each lab session was started off with a mini-lecture on the phylogeny of the plants being studied, as well as the relevant traits, but I do wish that there was a more official outline of what features needed to be labeled. Other than that, I liked how each lab session covered related plant groups, and reiterated the important features that were covered in the lecture. I also really enjoyed the inclusion of the plants and plant products that are commonly consumed within each pertinent plant group - it helped reinforce what I was learning, and made staying at lab for an extended period of time enjoyable."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Definitely take this course, especially if you are taking the lab. It's super chill, you pretty much just draw pictures and eat food the whole time. This was always the highlight of my week.",
    "Yes it is a delight",
    "Don't let the lab be a reason you don't take the course! It's phenomenal and really reinforces what's learned in the lecture.",
    "This is a good class and you have to take it anyway if youre taking EEB246. I was a bit confused at first, because each lab is just, \"here draw some plants and plant structures\" which is not at all what I was used to with other science labs. It was pretty good though since lab solidified what we had learned in class each week with examples, making it all easier to remember. So you have weekly labs, you have to make a couple plant collections, and there's a practical. Otherwise no lab reports or anything",
    "Take this course if you get a chance to, honestly best experience of the semester",
    "Absolutely.",
    "Absolutely! It's basically mandatory if you're taking the lecture (which you should do!) but this is the chillest lab class I've taken here, and you learn a TON. If you're worried that you can't draw to save your life, don't be! I can't draw to save mine, but you aren't evaluated on your drawing skills - just the accuracy of your labels, which is honestly a lifesaver. Take this class.",
    "Two thumbs up for the absolute best lab class at Yale. You draw plants and eat tons of plant themed food with your friends - what could be better?",
    "This course is a ton of fun! I would definitely recommend it to another student. You get to draw plants and eat plants!",
    "Of course! This lab is one of the best things that you can do in your week. It taps into your artistic side and really helps you learn the material. The field trip to the Botanical Garden in NY is great, I definitely recommend making it a priority to go.",
    "I would highly recommend taking the lab alongside the lecture. The lab really enriched and reinforced what we learning about in the lecture course. Lab was always enjoyable, never stressful, and always really illuminating.",
    "Yes yes yes take this course! It's a 3 hour lab, where you don't have to stay the entire duration. I also highly recommend doing so regardless because it's literally 3 hours of drawing plants and eating food made from the plant groups in focus (and you'll probably see and eat fruit that you normally have to go to the tropics to see). It is supposed to be taken concurrent with the lecture course, and this is with good reason - the classes complement and reinforce each other nicely."
