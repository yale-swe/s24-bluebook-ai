    "Just continues where physics 180 left off. Covers electricity and magnetism. Same class structure as last semester, but the material was a fair bit more abstract and difficult.",
    "I was able to build on my prior knowledge of E&M from AP Physics. This course applied further principles of calculus and challenged my problem-solving ability.",

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The strength is Professor Steinacker, who is absolutely lovely. She puts so much effort into the class and cares about her students, holding office hours four times a week for multiple hours at a time. She is patient, engaging, and a wonderful person. She also is a great lecturer and teacher, clearly explaining concepts. The weakness is the TF's, I never engaged with one once!",
    "Strengths: covered most of the basics of E&M. Lectures were engaging and online material (lecture notes) were very helpful -- much better than the textbook. Weaknesses: Wish we had more time to cover alternating currents, which are very important in today's technology, etc.",
    "Professor Steinacker is fantastic. I cannot stress this enough. She hosts office hours daily for multiple hours at a time, and even stays overtime to answer our left-over questions. She truly cares for the students, far past their physics abilities alone, and genuinely wishes to see her students succeed in every facet of life. Professor Steinacker could be considered the best addition to Yale's campus over the past few years. No exaggeration.",
    "The problem sets are overly complicated so people collaborate and don't learn as much. The course relies way too much on integral calculus for a course that is not supposed to require previous knowledge of the subject. The problem sets take way too long to complete. The same concepts could be taught and practiced in a less arduous way. I went into the final with almost 100% in the other grading categories. I did great on the first two midterms (near 100%) and the homeworks and in-class participation were all fine. Then I absolutely collapsed on the final. I think I got a 25% at best. Now I am worried I will get a C in the course. I don't know how this can be fixed, but maybe the questions on the final can be less \"creative.\" It seemed to be testing your ability to think in crazy ways, instead of testing how well you can do the sort of problems we had been doing all semester. I have never failed a final so terribly. It was a terrible experience.",
    "This course is way too difficult for an introductory physics course. I feel like I learned a lot but the second midterm and the final were incredibly hard... Additionally the turn around time on getting feedback on the problem sets is way too long. I had one of the five problem sets back with a graded and feedback when I took the final and while looking over the problem sets that contain the material the exam is over isn't essential for studying it would have been helpful and much more helpful to look at my own work and thought processes instead of trying to understand a solutions set that isn't always easy to understand or that answers all of the questions that were on the homework set.",
    "This class was well structured to build on previous material and material from PHYS 180. It followed a logical progression. Professor Steinacker also did a really good job of bringing in interesting examples or connections that made what sometimes seems to be a daunting subject a bit more engaging.",
    "The strength was Prof. Steinacker who put in so many hours and was so helpful and enthusiastic throughout the entire semester. The weaknesses involve the psets which were quite long and required at least some guidance to understand them--I couldn't really do any of them on my own without asking for help from Prof. Steinacker.",
    "It's a fairly fast-paced class, but even so, the professor was fantastic.",
    "Strengths: -Prof. Steinacker is AMAZING!!!! She makes this class SO much better than if we just had any other professor. -plenty of practice problems -weekly HW makes us review the concepts Weaknesses: -If there's a way to make participation more involved in a lecture class then that would be great. I found it really hard to focus in class because I'm really not a huge fan of physics and it was my 3rd class of the day. -still spent way too long on homeworks per week. It's definitely miles better than in PHYS180 but it's still way more work than any other class I was in combined. Maybe make it so that if we get 85% correct or above on HW then it's full points. Or maybe have homework corrections so that students go back to their mistakes? -TAs were so slow at grading homework literally what the heck. I have more ungraded HW than graded HW. It's been more than a month since I've received any grade from my HW. This makes it really hard to see how I'm doing in the class.",
    "I liked that the problem sets required a thorough understanding of the class material and ensured that we really mastered the concepts. However, I think they were unnecessarily tedious at times. Although it was sometimes satisfying to come up with clean numeric answers at the end of a very complicated problem, this was often frustrating and detracted from my enjoyment of the problem sets. I don't think it was necessary to have such difficult numbers to work with, since the concepts should be the most important part of every problem.",
    "The course is organized by topic, making it very easy to follow. Problem sets are challenging but do a good job of reinforcing material from class.",
    "This course was set up so that students who put in the time are able to succeed - I really recommend.",
    "Course was very good overall. I wish Prof. Steinacker would use the projector to write notes as it is difficult to see the blackboard in the back.",
    "While the material in introductory physics can be boring, Professor Steinackers enthusiasm made the class. She always made an effort to keep the class engaged. While the problem sets often included very difficult problems, Steinacker was extremely approachable and helpful. I believe the lecture and problem sets should have focused more on topics that we would actually be tested on (rather than abstract problems and derivations).",
    "Problem Sets are way too hard- I didn't learn anything from them because I could not understand them.",
    "This course expects a lot for an introductory course. The psets still take way too long. It's as if they don't understand we all have many other courses we are taking. However, the grade break down for this course was way better than last semester, and it seemed like they listened to our evaluations from last semester. I am pleased in that respect.",
    "It might be difficult to make the material exciting because electricity and magnetism is pretty dry to begin with. As far as the teaching goes, there's not much that could be improved, the problem sets are simply very difficult. Perhaps there could be a mix of having much more simple problems on the psets in order to get the fundamental ideas down, followed by 2-3 difficult questions that require some mathematical manipulation or critical thinking so that we can apply the easier topics in order to solve more complex problems.",
    "Course was well designed to facilitate learning.",
    "Solid pre-req",
    "This class did a good job of being accessible and forgiving. I really enjoyed having corrections on the midterms and having so much of our grade come from psets, because it made the class feel more \"graded by effort\"- i knew I wasn't going to do badly if I put in the time to correct my tests and complete he psets. However, i think this course could be improved by doing a bit more conceptually especially on a microscopic scale and maybe a bit less of calculating fields from differently shaped objects. I really liked the lecture on Maxwell's equations at the end, but magnetism was first introduced as \"a thing that happen when current flows through a wire\" which seems helpful for solving problems but maybe not for understanding how physics works on a more fundamental level. As a biochem major, This class didn't seem particularly applicable to my field of study, even though it's required. I know there are other physics classes I could have taken but 170 doesn't have the mathematical depth I wanted and I didn't have the physics background for 200 or 260. Essentially, this was a good class but it wasn't particularly well aligned with my interests or major for a required class.",
    "PHYS 181 is an unfortunate class because it is one that few people really want to take (they're all in 200 or 260) but nonetheless must exist. I thought that Professor Steinacker had a remarkable (and inspiring!) love for the material, but this love for the material was not reflected by the class, and I thought that this was partly because it spent so much time in-depth with a small subset of old-fashioned physics that were not very relevant to many of the students. I honestly think that this stemmed from the fact that the class contained both future engineers and future chemists\/biologists\/pre-meds who wanted to take this class instead of 170 because it was better organized and actually used math. I thought that the best way to remedy this would be simply to have two separate classes (physics for engineers and physics for chemists, or at least separate sections of 181 with applications in engineering and chemistry), because these fields require different core knowledge; while problems involving circuits and conducting rods might be relevant for electrical engineers, they are useless and frustrating for chemists, who would rather see more details with electrons\/atoms\/modern physics. Since I doubt that will ever happen, is to try and cover slightly more conceptual territory and not to do as many problems with annoying math; I felt that my main experience in this class was doing annoying problems rather than learning new physics. My favorite part was the last lecture, with Maxwell's Equations, and I wish that we did more like this; high-level conceptually and deeply fundamental, but not extrapolated to useless problems. I really wish that this class had given a deeper understanding of the complex and fascinating underlying principles of electromagnetism (and maybe a quick conceptual intro to modern E&M?) rather than simply making us solve lots of irrelevant problems.",
    "Overall, I think Professor Steinacker's class structure was designed to challenge students but also help students learn to the best of their ability. I was initially not used to the weekly workload and the math involved in the problem sets, but I grew to appreciate the rigor and care with which Prof. Steinacker crafts her homeworks, and I learned to utilize her office hours. I feel that this class has made me a better critical thinker and I feel much more confident in my quantitative reasoning skills. I found the midterms and finals always challenging and sometimes frustrating, but always doable and very rewarding in the end.",
    "I thought that the derivations of different formulas was really cool and helpful in understanding how different equations, even basic ones, are derived. The lecture notes were also incredibly helpful. In terms of weaknesses, some of the proofs could be pretty quick, and they'd be hard to recreate.",
    "lectures could have gone more in-depth",
    "- Problems sets were tough which I didn't appreciate as I was doing them, but looking back, I think, may be beneficial in the long run as I take more advanced physics and math classes. - Lectures were not helpful and I had trouble staying focused during them. - I think a flipped classroom model where we work out problems in class and read lecture notes beforehand would be more useful, because this class is essentially a problem solving class",
    "It covered a lot of content in a way that suited people with hugely varying backgrounds. The psets parts were challenging, but more reasonable than in 180.",
    "The class is a good introductory class. The homework sometimes seems very distant from the concepts learned in class and seemingly impossible to do, and sometimes the test questions seemed the same way.",
    "Steinacker is amazing. She is so caring and so engaged, and she holds so many office hours. Despite that, the lecture was sometimes a challenge to remain engaged in. This may be a me problem rather than a course problem. However, if you do and understand the problem sets, you learn all of the material, and Steinacker's lecture notes are just as good if not better than her lectures, so you don't miss out on much. You get the psets back quickly, and Steinacker is very fair when it comes to what she expects on tests. You also have the opportunity to do test corrections, a policy I love, because that means you don't remain ignorant when you don't understand something.",
    "Although I appreciated the challenging problem sets I really think Professor Steinacker should make an effort to establish a strong foundation in basic concepts and understanding before throwing students to complete extremely difficult problems. I think the problem sets should still contain some difficult problems but also some exercises designed to build the foundational understanding required for the more challenging ones. Eight very hard problems per pset were not conducive to profound or consistent understanding of the material. If some students are forced to go to office hours many days a week to complete the problem set then perhaps there is something that could be improved. I feel that having at least some exercises that are possible for many students to do on their own would be challenging in a different way, promote independent thinking, and be helpful overall. I am not saying the class should get rid of the hard problems, but merely make an effort to promote basic understanding. Even physicists need a strong foundation in the basics before moving on to solve harder problems. I think Professor Steinacker was an extremely dedicated professor. Yale is lucky to have her.",
    "I really liked Steinacker's lectures. Her teaching skills are really phenomenal, and she was very helpful during office hours. The psets were challenging, but not out of grasp. My only suggestion is that if lectures could be recorded and posted online, that would be amazing.",
    "Dr. Steinacker is a good lecturer that genuinely cares about the material and her students. I understand that this is a large lecture class, but I wish that the TAs were faster at grading homework and giving feedback. By the end of the semester, my TA was about a month behind on grading.",
    "The course's strengths are the quality of teaching and the content provided. Its weaknesses are a somewhat unevenly distributed load of coursework over the course of the semester as some topics are significantly more challenging than others.",
    "This class is very hostile towards students with no prior experience with physics. There was no buildup to difficult questions, but just a straight jump, and if you don't know the underlying purpose and reasoning you are just lost in the problem sets. You have to be able to do simple problems before you can do difficult ones.",
    "Weaknesses: This course broadly covered the topics of electromagnetism, magnetic forces, and circuits. The course was designed to teach these broad concepts to a broad audience. This was it's fatal flaw. In such a large lecture, the course seemed dry and unfeeling. The material, while presented well, felt robotic and distant. The general structure of physics at Yale should be reevaluated. The psets of the course were often difficult and did not reflect the material as it was taught or as it was tested. This lead to confusion about the best way to prepare for exams. The grading of assignments was slow but feedback was clear and helpful. I felt it was hard to prevent repeating errors if I didn't know what I did wrong on the previous pset. The psets should all be graded before the next is due. Strengths: The prof loves the material. Prof. Steinacker is your single greatest advocate in this course. She will help you with all aspects of the material, including going above and beyond the course description and holding an grossly excessive number of office hours. The material is useful and cool, and she presents great examples of the applications.",
    "I think the material was very engaging, and it was taught and tested in a way that really fostered learning. However, I do think that the pacing could be improved a bit. A lot of time was spent on some simpler, more intuitive concepts, while key, difficult concepts were sometimes not covered in as much detail as I would have liked. But, great introductory course!",
    "I felt this course focused a little too much on derivatives of physical theories and esoteric situations more than actual applicable scenarios. Still, it gave a good introduction to important foundational concepts.",
    "Professor Steinacker remains the strength of this course. Her lectures, lectures notes, and office hours made this class as engaging as it was. The class is challenging of course, but manageable if you put the time and effort in.",
    "I thought the course was incredibly well-organized and conducive to the students' learning. I felt like I got a lot out of this course, and even though I wasn't a huge fan of physics going into the course, I came to really enjoy the course material and have a really significant appreciation for the topics we were learning about. I don't really feel like the course had any weaknesses - I thought Professor Steinacker did an excellent job at making herself accessible, so at the end of the day, everyone had an opportunity to truly internalize and understand the material.",
    "The professor is AMAZING!! Very dedicated clear and inspired. Lots of work but very worth it",
    "The course is very well taught, and professor steinacker teaches the material in a clear and coherent way! The homework assignments were difficult, but I definitely enjoyed them because those were the key to understanding what we learned in class. My only issue sometimes was the amount of algebra or tedium in certain problems, but I also understand that creating problems is very difficult.",
    "PHYS 181 is a wonderful course to finish learning the fundamentals of physics. Psets are definitely difficult and time consuming, but the questions on the exams are often of a similar format, so doing the homework well is very beneficial for exam preparation. Lecture notes are incredibly thorough and lectures themselves are very engaging overall.",
    "I liked the lectures, I thought the problems we went over were very helpful. One critique I had would be with the homework. It felt like sometimes the skills necessary to complete problems on the homework went far beyond what we learned in class, or even from reading the book. I often found myself going online to find formulas and explain concepts on psets.",
    "Strengths include the lectures and notes. Weaknesses include lack of personal interaction with professor or TAs.",
    "Lecture notes were well-organized and greatly facilitated learning. Homework problems were always relevant to lecture topics and exams were fair.",
    "Really challeing. But you actually learn some great things",
    "I felt that the homework assignments were unnecessarily difficult, particularly as someone who did not have a strong physics background.",
    "weaknesses: long psets, hard and unfair exams, disorganized lectures, grades are very slow strengths: great online notes",
    "Professor Steinacker is the biggest strength this course has.",
    "I think that, even though the time is short, maybe we could include a small section on Optics and its applications. I know that it is covered in the lab (PHYS166L), but I think it would also be really useful to see it in the lecture.",
    "Sometimes lectures seem a bit disorganized or hard to follow",
    "I think Professor Steinacker's lecture notes and office hours were great, and I like her lecturing style, but I had a hard time focusing for the entire class period during lecture. I think the class would be improved if it were to meet 3 times a week for 50 minutes each.",
    "strengths: homework was much more reasonable than last semester, office hours are incredibly helpful\/accessible weaknesses: class felt much less unified across sections this semester, and study hall became far less helpful",
    "This class was very well taught and had hard exams and assessments but generally fair grading. I think it could be improved by having exams that were more representative of the material covered in class.",
    "The psets could be shortened, everyone in the class appreciated when she would make 2 out the 10 questions on the pset optional.",
    "I liked that each new topic we were learning always built on upon previous topics, knowledge, and skills. However I just think that there was so much to learn that it was very hard to stay on top of studying everything. The weekly problem sets can be a bit overwhelming and usually take 6-8 hours."

    "I strongly recommend this course for anyone in a STEM field. Although it seems like physics isn't applicable to fields like biology, medicine, even chemistry, it turns out that it is. Physics affects every part of our lives, so it is very interesting to understand the way the world works. You also gain the important skills of problem-solving and perseverance through difficulty.",
    "Absolutely. Professor Steinacker is the best physics professor I have ever had during my lifetime. Any student would be grateful to have her teach them.",
    "I would only recommend it if they need to take it as a requirement. And even then I would encourage them to consider 200-201 or 170-171.",
    "I would recommend 181, especially because Professor Steinacker did a good job of presenting the information clearly and providing so much help to the class throughout the semester. This class is good if you are looking for a straightforward approach to electricity and magnetism (as opposed to some of the more biological applications that appear in 171).",
    "Yes--even if you're not required to take it, the class was enriching. Of course, it's not a light courseload, but it's a good experience -- coming from someone who didn't even like the subject of physics at first. Prof. Steinacker is incredible and the class is interesting, when taught by someone as excellent as Prof. Steinacker.",
    "Only take if you have to. The Problem Sets were quite difficult and time consuming",

    "If you like physics, you should take this course.",
    "If a student needs to learn fundamental physics, I would recommend 180. While the class is less interesting on its own, Steinacker did a good job helping students understand fundamental topics.",
    "Take it with Prof. Steinacker if you can. She is so passionate about physics and so caring towards her students. I've never touched E&M in high school but she made the learning process a breeze.",
    "Unless you have this course as a requirement or have a general interest in physics, I would stay away from this course. The problem sets are very time consuming and stressful, and the material is very dry for the average person not interested in physics.

    "This class would have been great for an engineer, but for a biochemist I learned very little that was applicable. its not too hard though, so for other MBB majors for whom physics is required I would still probably recommend this class over another physics class because its more mathematically rigorous than 170 and not as hard as 200 or 260.",
    "PHYS 181 is not a class that many people enjoy. As an MB&B major who took it over 170 because I wanted a serious physics class that used math and instead of 200 over that class's poor reputation for its flipped classroom, I found this class unbearably boring. This wasn't because I don't like physics - I often procrastinated my homework by reading about more interesting physics - but because it focused on annoying problems in a very specific subset of early nineteenth century physics instead of fostering a fundamental understanding of underlying physical concepts. It's not the worst class in the world, but I can't really recommend it because it consumed so much of my time without really teaching me very much.",
    "I think even if you are afraid of E&M, Professor Steinacker makes the class painless and even fun! She is a wonderful professor and is so amenable to helping students in whatever way she can. If you are taking Physics 181, she is the professor to take it with!",
    "If you're considering this class, it's probably a requirement of some sort. It's a decent class that gives you a nice intro to E\/M with a fair amount of math (but not too much). Homework tends to be harder than the exams.",
    "Yes, it's a good physics class, and even though its hard and the problem sets are a lot of work, it gives you a great understanding of how different theories",
    "necessary for understanding basic physics",
    "- Interesting, often challenging class if you haven't taken AP Physics E\/M before - Not too much work, but can be stressful if you wait until the last minute to do the problem sets - Would recommend, but can't compare to other intro physics courses.",
    "I would recommend taking PHYS 181 with Professor Steinacker, especially if it is the only lecture class available. The class is interesting and all the material is very useful.",
    "Take this class with Steinacker: she's an amazing teacher and is really helpful during her office hours. If you're taking this class for premed like me, then it'll teach you a lot in terms of quantitative problem solving. The psets are challenging, but all doable with office hours and study hall help. Go to office hours and study hall! Btw, you can take this class without ever taking multivariable calc, definitely doable.",
    "As an engineering major, it is my assumption that most people who take this course are doing so because it is required of them. However, I would recommend it if you must fulfill a physics requirement and have a solid foundation in calculus, as it builds valuable problem-solving skills and conceptual knowledge of physics.",
    "While the course isn't not easy by any means, there are a plethora of resources to ensure that every student can do well. Between Professor Steinacker's office hours, the study hall hours, and individual peer tutor sessions, there is so much help available to get through the difficult psets. In addition, Professor Steinacker's grading system is lenient and is focused on the student's understanding and proficiency of the material over time, as opposed to a difficult grading system that sets the student up for disappointment.",
    "This course, however tedious, is required for many majors and tracks at Yale. It is doable. It is useful. However, it requires constant attention and diligence or you will quickly become lost in the physics. The greatest strength of the course is Prof. Steinacker. She will help you with all aspects of the material, including going above and beyond the course description and holding an grossly excessive number of office hours. The material is useful and cool, and she presents great examples of the applications. If you don't like physics, you won't like this course.",
    "Physics 181 is really difficult, but I would definitely recommend taking it with Professor Steinacker. Her section is probably a little harder because she makes a lot of her own homework problems (or adds on to existing problems) instead of taking directly from the book, and she likes to derive equations\/relationships and use multiple methods of solution in a lot of her problems. She's a great professor though, and really commits to helping everyone learn the material. She has office hours 4 days a week for several hours, and will help group people up who are working on the same part of the homework as well as individually helping people who are having trouble with the homework or with concepts presented in class. She is super kind and understanding, and on more than one occasion granted extensions to the entire class after finding out that a few people had upcoming exams or projects with the same due dates as her own. Really, if you have any kind of conflict (or are just particularly stressed\/overwhelmed or having trouble with the work), she will do whatever she can to find a solution for you. The homework can definitely take a while, and the material is tough, but she provides tons of opportunities to get additional help, and her lectures are great on their own, so I would definitely take it with Professor Steinacker!",
    "Yes, take it if you're interested in physics. If you're looking for a challenging physics class\/you've had a background in physics, then I'd suggest looking at higher level class. But this can be challenging otherwise!",
    "Decent introductory physics course, take it if you are STEM.",
    "Yes, take it!! If you're looking for a physics intro sequence to take, 180\/181 is the way to go. I can't speak too much for the other classes, but I found the 180\/181 sequence to be really rewarding. The problem sets take a decent amount of time, but Professor Steinacker works really hard to make sure everyone is understanding everything and that students aren't falling behind. Professor Steinacker always makes herself available for a TON of office hours throughout the week, so she's really accessible if you ever need help (and she's an incredible instructor, so as long as you go to class and office hours, there's a really good chance you'll know what's going on in the course, even when things get hard). Professor Steinacker is the main reason why this course is so great - she really REALLY cares about her students. I'm amazed that she was able to learn so many students' names (keep in mind, there was way over 100 people in our class), and whenever I'd go to office hours, she would ask me about life and took a genuine interest in the things I was pursuing outside of our physics class. So if you're looking for a fulfilling and rewarding way to learn the necessary physics for your major, I'd definitely recommend this class.",
    "Yes the prof is amazing",
    "I would definitely recommend this course! Few people truly understand e&m from high school so taking this course will really help you build your engineering rigour and capacity for abstract thought.",
    "Yes! Although I definitely spent much more time on work for this class, the material was very interesting and the classes themselves were very engaging.",
    "Yes, this was a great class that I would recommend to anyone interested in not only STEM fields, but learning more about how the world works in general. I would recommend this class over PHYS 200\/201, which I took first semester.",
    "Only take this course if you have to! While Professor Steinacker is amazing (she is extremely helpful and enthusiastic about what she is teaching), the problem sets are made unnecessarily difficult so if you haven't taken AP physics before this class is going to be very challenging - it will be hard to keep up with the material when it is taught at such a fast pace and the homework assignments will be very difficult to do on your own. Overall, this course takes up much more time than an introductory STEM class should.",
    "I would only recommend this for those interested in the subjects and those who must take this course. It is very challenging, and if you don't really enjoy it or spend a ton of time on it you will do poorly.",
    "This is a standard calculus-based E&M course. If you like math, physics, or science in general, you'll probably enjoy learning the material. Professor Steinacker is generous, considerate, and helpful.",
    "Take it with adriane she is wonderful.",
    "Absolutely.",
    "If you have to chose between 171 and 181 take this one because you actually learn something valuable",
    "only take this if you need to. i reccomend 170\/171 instead unless the profesor changes. exams are very hard and psets are harder. the textbook does not help since the homework is so advanced.",
    "Yes, but only if you're considering physics as a basis for mech e, physics major, etc. but it's a lot for pre meds. Take this with Steinacker. You will be so glad you did -- she's the reason I got through the class. A lot of work, but GO TO OFFICE HOURS!",
    "I would for sure recommend this course. It was really useful to better understand some physics concepts after taking PHYS180 and, since the homework is quite challenging, it makes you learn and engage much more throughout the semester.",
    "Yes! If Steinacker is teaching then yes! She is a gem. I imagine the course really depends on the Professor but I would recommend the class in general",
    "I think this course is a good intro physics course. I had the option of taking phys 260\/261, 200\/201, or 180\/181. I chose 180\/181 because the material is useful and applicable to my major, and the workload is manageable. I am not a fan of the 200\/201 flipped classroom format (because the format is not actually flipped classroom-- flipped classroom classes should not have homework other than watching lectures!!!). Professor Steinacker is an amazing teacher who cares about every single one of her students, which is impressive considering she has ~200 of them. Throughout this course and 180, I felt that Professor Steinacker was personally invested in my success, which made me extra-motivated and decreased my stress over this course. I think 181 is conceptually more difficult than 180, but with the help of Professor Steinacker during her endless office hours, I never felt like I was struggling.",
    "I would recommend this to someone who is good at physics and is looking for a challenge. It was well taught in my opinion, and I felt like if you do the work you can get a lot out of this class.",
    "I took this class because I was premed. This class was A LOT of work. I spent about 10 hours on the pset a week, and that was always with help from other classmates and the professor. What makes this class worth it is that Steinacker is so incredibly passionate and excited about teaching physics. GO TO OFFICE HOURS!!!!",
    "I would recommend this class to engineers. Understanding of electromagnetism is very important to an engineer as this class starts with the basics and builds upon that. The class has 2 midterms and a final which are honestly pretty tough, and to do well, you must go to lectures, do the homework, and study. There is a problem set due every week which helps you solidfy your understanding of the chapters by having you work through a wide range of problems."
