    "This was my favorite class of the year. However, I can easily see how people may not gain very much from the class. It is hard to keep track of everything we are reading sometimes, and I felt like the lectures differed from the readings pretty often. I enjoyed sections, but I know that is luck of the draw depending on your TA. The readings were interesting and manageable. The workload was never too heavy, and the midterm was fair. If you complete most of the readings, I think you will definitely gain some perspective from the course.",
    "Great introduction into political thought. Provides a background to build off of, I recommend this class to anyone interested in political science and law.",
    "Not unless you are seriously considering majoring in Political Science",
    "The ideas are tough and the readings can be pretty dry, but the grading is not so bad and the class makes you think.",
    "It is a great foundation of politics and understanding of moral philosophies and how they in fluency politics and it's process",
    "Definitely. The subject material can be pretty dull at times, but if you stick with it, you'll be glad you did, and you'll learn a lot more than you ever expected. Take the WR section!",
    "Definitely take it.",
    "Yes absolutely take it. Not a gut. Take it if you love philosophy and you love thinking about how psychology\/philosophy relate.",
    "Do NOT TAKE THIS CLASS. I'm an A student, and I can tell you that this class is incredibly hard for the following reasons. First, Shapiro made the final exam way too hard. Second, the grade you got is 101% contingent upon your TF, and they are strict about letting you switch later on. Third, the material is boring, comes in a waves, and is difficult to keep up on. Fourth, there are about 1000 other classes that are a better investment than this one. Avoid at all costs.",
    "Solid political philosophy course. You get out of it what you put into it. There is a lot of work if you try to do it all, but most people seem not to. Still, it's what you make of it.",
    "Reading is very interesting, can't say the same for the lectures.",
    "It is a general survey of the history of political science and it's connection to morality. Study utilitarianism, marxism, antiutilitarianism, social contract theory, and democracy. Wonderful at connecting them all together. I highly recommend.",
    "If you take the class writing intensive, it's only a part of your life for about two weeks of the semester, and if you don't, both the exams are open note, open book. The professor is great, and if you get a good TA you won't have any trouble. I'd recommend it highly to anyone who wants to get a distributional requirement out of the way, or if you want a very simple course with moderately engaging lectures.",
    "I would definitely say take this course. It is a very very good way to get a WR credit. Only two ten pagers for the whole semester. Also, it is a pretty interesting course. You learn a lot about the big names in political theory.",
    "Firstly, this class is not a gut. The TA's grade the essays very harshly and the essays you will have to write are long and challenging. Secondly, the lectures are also very boring, and apparently what we are supposed to learn from the class are just what Prof. Shapiro's opinions are on each political philosopher. The readings are actually interesting and give you a great background on political theory and thought, but being forced to stick to Prof. Shapiro's opinions is frustrating and disappointing.",
    "The lectures in PLSC are actually interesting, and Professor Shapiro is a pretty funny guy. The book he wrote is super helpful; it practically outlines the class, and the grading seems to be quite fair. The WR credit is manageable as well; I ended up writing significantly more this semester for my other non-WR seminar in the PLSC department. Overall, this is a huge class, but shrinks considerably since not many come to class, and is typically labeled a gut, but it is a really interesting class if you're engaged and interested in the material.",
    "Good",
    "Take it with writing!",
    "This course is absolutely brilliant. It provides a wonderful foundation for some of the most important and insightful political thinkers of the three centuries. It will cause you to look at politics in an entirely new way. Professor Shapiro is a wonderful lecturer, and the readings are entirely manageable. The essays allow you to think about the issues in a real-world context, and youhave a fair amount of freedom in what you choose to focus on. Excellent class. Take it WR credit so as not to have to do a midterm.",
    "do not forget to read the shapiros book. if not its hard to understand what u need to know for the test given that the readings are not explained that well in class.",
    "If you're thinking of EP&E, this meets the pre-reqs and is a great option. Also a very easy writing credit and an opportunity to become more familiar with some big thinkers who will definitely come up in future courses if this is your field of interest.",
    "It's an overview of a handful of major political philosophers from the Enlightenment to the present. It provides a good overview of different political philosophies' strengths and weaknesses. This is a course for someone interested in getting an overview of political philosophers and who is interested in the question of what makes government legitimate.",
    "I mean, its MoFoPo.. you've heard enough about it from every other student at Yale who has taken it. its straightforward. you can get an A without doing a single reading. and its minimal work\/effort",
    "Okay intro poli-sci class. It might seem like a gut, but it's not. There is a ton of reading, but all you really need to read is Shapiro's book.",
    "Really interesting course material, pretty good lecture and not a lot of work. If you're at all interested in political science, you're probably taking it anyway. If you want to try some poli sci, this is the place to start.",
    "This is a good class to take if you want to get a basic handle on political philosophy and major moral thinkers since the Enlightenment. Not as classical a focus as some of the Into PolySci courses offered, but I think the questions asked here are more interesting and more exploratory.",
    "Yes, this is the foundation for PLSC, EPE, PHIL etc.",
    "Lectures are interesting and definitely worth your time. The course material is very interesting and you are forced to wrestle with legitimacy in government.",
    "It's an okay class, good for a writing credit. Absolutely take it writing intensive, but was not intellectually challenging or interesting for me specifically.",
    "Good class. Unlike most people I took it to do the reading, but if you're in it because you heard it's a gut or get a req out of the way, then you'll also get what you want. Lectures are great and clear, although people would say they can also be very dry. Also if you read his book, it follows the lectures pretty closely although covers slightly more material I think, so seriously just go to lecture and take notes and you'll be fine. I took it non-writing, and I personally think this is the better option as the take-home midterm is over three days and you only have to do that once. The midterm is also more concept stuff, while the papers are more apply these ideas to this situation, etc, so might be more straightforwardly helpful for exams.",
    "If you're interested in political philosophy but don't know much about it, this course is for you. I did not really enjoy lectures (too big), but sections are good and really helpful. I would also take it writing intensive.",
    "A very solid overview of the basic philosophical foundations of modern politics. I highly recommend it, but urge students to actually attend lecture and do the readings.",
    "Though bland at times, Mofopo is a great course and I highly recommend it to any political science major in need of a writing credit.",
    "Its a solid amount of work, but in the end it is worth it. I would definitely recommend it.",
    "This class is filled with a mix of people genuinely looking for an introduction to the foundations of politics (forge the moral aspect, its role is really irrelevant to the class as a whole), jocks and the like looking for a gut class, and poly-sci majors that actually know the material but are looking for a writing credit and they are taking a intro class.",
    "Absolutely recommend. Especially if you are interested in political philosophy, but do not have much prior background in it, this would be a great place to start.",
    "I have some qualms about taking this class, but I suppose I'm still glad I took it, because I now know (a) that political philosophy isn't exactly my thing and (b) what the heck Bentham, John Stuart Mill, Marx, Nozick, and Rawls were arguing about. I would have really liked some more real-world application, as the syllabus said there would be, but that mostly only happened in our papers--Shapiro's lectures dealt almost completely with theory. There is a ton of reading for this class, but you'll be fine if you only do part of it. If you're looking for a good freshman spring poli sci class to take, just make sure you're genuinely interested in the material, since I found Shapiro's lectures dry sometimes, even though he's a very decent lecturer. If you do take MoFoPo, take it writing intensive, since writing two papers forces you to really engage with some of the readings, and the people I talked to who didn't take it writing intensive all said they wish they had.",
    "Great class. Even as a polisci major I enjoyed it since I had never read the classic texts of Western political thought.",
    "For a gut, this class is really interesting, and the material will serve you well in other Yale classes and in life. WR might actually be easier than non-WR, so keep that in mind even if you don't need the requirement.",
    "Good WR credit about things that are worth knowing.",
    "Take it. Great WR credit.",
    "I would recommend this class to other students",
    "This is a good introductory class, so I would recommend it for that reason. It depends on what you're looking for in a class though. The lectures were good, but not mind blowing. I got a lot out of the class because I did the readings and enjoyed thinking about them. It's also important that you get a good section where the discussion will be useful and you will contribute. If you take this as a writing credit, your writing can definitely improve if you want it to. Overall, it was a worthwhile class for me.",
    "Moral Foundations of Politics is a good intro to recent political philosophy. Professor Shapiro's book (also titled Moral Foundations of Politics) is incredibly useful, both summarizing and supplementing his lectures. The reading is occasionally incredibly dense, but Shapiro's book is a helpful tool.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class. It's fantastic and provides such a good foundation for poli sci. It really presents a lot of the moral issues and philosophies that you would never ever think about. It also shows how our government is structured morally, which was extremely interesting. I would also recommend this to any athletes in poli sci who don't want to take a gut but also can't handle a large workload (if they're in season or something). You can pace yourself as you want. Make sure you take good notes as Shapiro is lecturing. They were extremely useful for the final. Definitely take it writing credit. The grading distribution is better and you really understand the philosophers that way. I've also heard that the writing section TAs are better. Overall, I would absolutely recommend this course.",
    "MoFoPo was a good intro to political philosophy, and definitely not a lot of work. Having a great tf for section helped make the class much better.",
    "I would recommend this class to someone who wants to have a broad idea of how political philosophy has developed since the beginning of utilitarianism era. Although we do not really go in-depth into each of the writers, I learned a lot about the intellectual development of the ideas throughout history.",
    "Yes, especially as a writing credit",
    "I thought it was a great class. I had not taken a political science class before in my time at Yale and I feel that this was a great place for me to start. My section leader was very engaging and helped us to obtain a deeper understanding of the text and concepts that were presented in class. I appreciated how the class got me to question my own prejudices and beliefs that I have about government and I liked the progression that Professor Shapiro took in teaching us the foundations of government. This isn't necessarily a gut, but there isn't too much work. Definitely not a class to take lightly though.",
    "Great class. Only take it if you're really interested in it.",
    "This class was a great overview of political philosophy; the reading wasn't difficult and is explained really well in class. Shapiro is for the most part a good lecturer. Take it.",
    "Really good class, especially if it's still an open course. Definitely recommend taking it. Readings are usually worthwhile at least looking at, but lectures were pretty dry, so I just read the transcripts online. But section was great, and there's not too much work at all, especially for the WR credit. A good course for an introduction to political philosophy, and since I had never taken either a poly sci or philosophy class, it really piqued my interest in both topics.",
    "The Moral Foundations of Politics is a very good class that gives students an overview of political thought and how it relates to government legitimacy. It is also, probably, the closest course offered at Yale to a course in history of economic thought. Professor Shapiro teaches this course very well. Shapiro clearly cares about the material, his students, and explaining the concepts to the students in the best manner possible considering the course is an introductory course. I would recommend taking this course to fulfill the Yale College writing skills requirement (WR) since it is low in workload compared to other writing intensive courses, offers detailed instruction and feedback on writing, and allows students to see that every argument can be defended or attacked and that it is necessary to address such concerns in one\u0092s writing. Although it may seem like a lot of material is presented in this class, the structure of the course prevents the student from becoming overwhelmed. Students have enough time to think through the different ideologies, consider counterexamples and criticisms, discuss these with classmates in section, and then synthesize these ideas when writing papers and exams to form coherent responses to valid social criticisms or moral dilemmas facing society. As someone without much exposure to political thought or philosophy, I can say that this course is truly taught at the introductory level and is appropriate for a wide range of students, including those with no political science background. This leads me to the recommendation that anyone in Yale College with even the slightest interest in history of political or economic thought, particularly students seeking a course with a WR designation, take this class.",
    "There's a lot of reading and it's pretty necessary to do all of it and understand what it means for the final and midterm. Not a lot of written work but definitely not easy to succeed without reading carefully. The readings are also pretty tough to get through. I wouldn't recommend it unless necessary.",
    "I would summarize PLSC 118 as a class that teaches you all of the old guy names and theories in light of modern day; while philosophy might seem intimidating before taking it, this class definitely makes it accessible and relevant.",
    "Take it if you are interested in Political Philosophy. Will be easier for you if you've studied some of the philosophers before and are familiar with their work (Locke, Rousseau, Hobbes, Marx etc). Take home midterm is intense but otherwise the course is not unmanageable. Reasonable, open-note final.",
    "Definitely! These are the philosophers you have been meaning to read. The concepts are interesting and lectures are great. Take it writing intensive if you can.",
    "I would recommend this course for anyone who wants a survey course of contemporary political philosophy. You might find this course dry if you're not interested in the subject matter, but I was, so I really enjoyed the course.",
    "If you can get a good section leader, definitely take it.",
    "It's a great course which gives a good understanding of the foundations of political science, how governments operate, what makes them legitimate,etc. The authors included in the readings are all crucial for understanding the class and it is sometimes enough to read a few good summaries and extract the main points, instead of doing the tedious readings every week. The workload is very manageable and it was a graet way to earn a WR (2x3000word essays for a writing credit!!!), which worked very well with my engineering major."
