    "English 125 provides a great overview of the authors included, but isn't easily accessible for those who aren't interested in the English major. Good introduction to close analysis. Most people have a post-romantic view of poetry, and 125 is obviously pre-romantic. The course can disappoint you if you have unreasonable expectations.",
    "It is an extremely consistent course, expecting a steady commitment to reading and class participation. If you like poetry and respect the English tradition, it's a refreshing, demanding course. If you're being forced to take this course because it's a prerequisite for the English major, try to start liking this material or you'll probably be miserable haha.",
    "This is an old-school course, a dinosaur of the department. Not much has been changed since the 1960's. If this intrigues you, perhaps you should take it. You will learn the essentials of close reading and the fundamentals of analyzing poetry. Prof. Brantley's section, in particular, often has assigned readings from Fussel's Poetic Meter and Poetic Form, especially at the beginning of the year. The format of the course may be frustrating for upperclassmen.Prof. Brantley is a pretty good discussion leader, but be aware that she will not intervene in discussion very often. Thus, where the class goes is very much dependent on the other students in the class-- be aware of this when choosing a section. If the students do not succeed at making the discussion interesting, you may leave class feeling as though little has been accomplished.Expect serious but thoughtful and constructive comments on essays.",
    "Take it if you have to.",
    "It takes a certain kind of dedication to enjoy this class. The readings are very dense, and you must be prepared to take the time to read them properly to make the most of the course. Discussion is mostly class led, which can lead to extensive time spent on somewhat random topics, but Professor Brantley is an expert in this field and will help you whenever you ask."
