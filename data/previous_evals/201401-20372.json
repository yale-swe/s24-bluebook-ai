   "comments": [
    "This class is an excellent introduction to mathematical philosophy. It deals with paradoxes on a variety of subjects and can be very interesting. Both the professor and TA are engaging and helpful. If you enjoy abstract, logical puzzles, you will enjoy this class.",
    "I can't speak to how this compares to other philosophy courses, but as a non-major fulfilling a QR credit, I thought it was wonderful. It was challenging, but really fun to think about, and it certainly wasn't too \"mathy\" at all.",
    "PHIL 281 is a class that challenged me, definitely. I felt that over the course of the semester I made a little bit of progress, but, for the most part, I was just lost. I think that there should definitely be some sort of math requirement for this class, as there was a huge range of experience\/understanding with some of the mathematical concepts that were relevant to the class, and maybe if there was some sort of standard that would have made it better.",
    "Definitely a great experience. Really enjoyed the class as well as the topic, It gave me a new perspective to look at the world. We explored really cool concepts involving infinity, but there were other interesting metaphysical concepts as well",
    "This class is pretty much Zeno's paradox for a semester. There is some fun philosophical writing, a bunch of the easiest set theory you'll ever be presented with, and a lot of other students who want a non-math QR credit. Prepare to be annoyed beyond disbelief by the other students. There's some interesting reading though.",
    "An excellent class that combines philosophy and math. Minimal work and life changing. Definitely recommend it!",
    "This class focuses on some very interesting topics, and isn't the worst class if you need either a humanities, or a QR credit. The paradoxes are interesting, but they can get repetitive within each unit."
