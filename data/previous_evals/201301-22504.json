   "comments": [
    "Take it if you have any interest at all in Confucian thought. The material is dense so get ready to have difficulties with the readings, but Professor Chin is unbelievably knowledgeable about the topics.",
    "This was an amazing course overall. Amazing. Professor Chin is so well versed in the literature and she's so passionate about the topic. As someone with a Chinese heritage, I've always wanted to learn about the Confucian tradition since it's such an integral part of our culture, and I feel like I've actually gotten a decent exposure through this class. I think the course is absolutely perfect, please, if you are interested in the subject matter, TAKE IT.",
    "Yes, if you're interested in Chinese history and willing to spend much time figuring out ancient Chinese philosophy.",
    "It is an excellent course for anyone interested in Chinese intellectual history, especially if you have taken a course on Chinese literature\/culture before. Professor Chin is simply amazing and, even though it is a seminar, it is great to hear her talk about the subject. For one class, we had Professor Spence come and talk about his own book 'Treason by the Book', from which we were supposed to read some sections. The material is very challenging but absolutely fascinating, and there is a good balance between understanding historical background and doing a close of the texts on their own. I would highly recommend it to anyone who is interested in learning more about the very heterogeneous 'Confucian tradition'. Some previous knowledge of Chinese might come in handy if you want to try and have a look at the originals, but it is not a requirement.",
    "If you have any interest at all in Chinese history, culture or even the language, TAKE THIS CLASS. It reads like an all-in-one course in history, philosophy and literature, the workload is very reasonable for a junior seminar, and Prof. Chin is one of the most inspiring professors you'll ever get to work with at Yale. She loves her work, and she will make it impossible for you not to love it too.",
    "This class is interesting if you want to know more about Confucian philosophy. Quite a bit of work for a credit\/D class, especially with an 18pg paper at the end.",
    "A really interesting seminar about Confucianism through the years. You don't need any prior knowledge and the readings are fascinating"
