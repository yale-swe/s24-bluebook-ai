   "question_id": "YC403",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I think the course was very good at getting everyone comfortable speaking German and trying to incorporate new grammar concepts and vocab into speech. I think this course could be improved by providing comprehensive lists of all the vocabulary we learn in each chapter at the beginning of every new chapter. In addition, if there were handouts with the main grammar concepts, that would be super helpful as well.",
    "(i) The course incorporates too much group work, especially with the final project. While it is obviously important that students interact with one another in the classroom, so that they can practice using the language, I don't see why pretty much every in-class exercise has to be a group\/partner exercise. Not all students learn best in this way, so some variety would be welcome! Further, the final project is one, extremely involved group project, and this poses numerous challenges that have nothing to do with learning German (e.g., coordinating schedules, which can be especially tricky when not all students are undergraduates; delegating tasks; depending on others to perform the agreed-upon functions; having a large portion of one's grade depend on others' performing those functions well; etc.). (ii) I would add that the final project, in addition to posing group-work-related challenges, is also extremely time-consuming, which would be fine, if it weren't for the fact that it is time-consuming for all of the wrong reasons, which again have nothing to do with learning German, or learning about German culture, etc. Too much time ends up getting spent trying to be creative or funny (e.g., in coming up with the concept), putting together costumes, planning, filming, etc. (iii) While I found the email component of the course to be great, as my email partner was reliable and extremely helpful, I know that other students in the class didn't have this experience. I don't think that this is a reason to remove this component, though I do think that instructors and students should be clear from the outset on how to proceed in the event of less-than-ideal circumstances. (iv) It would be great to have more opportunity to converse with, and be individually corrected by, proficient German speakers, where this doesn't happen in front of the rest of the class, since this can be stressful. (v) The speaking component on the exams became increasingly difficult throughout the semester; this is, of course, as it should be: as the semester progresses, students improve and it's good to challenge them. However, I thought it become too difficult, to the point that it was discouraging. Find better ways to improve students' listening skills more quickly, so that they have the tools to rise to the challenge, or -- absent such changes in curriculum -- make the challenge one that students can meet, given the skills that they can reasonably be expected to have. Doing so will avoid unnecessarily discouraging students and increasing their anxiety in (or dislike of) speaking\/listening situations.",
    "It's a very interactive course where you will participate and speak German every day. You feel very involved in the class and collaborate with other students. The pace is quite quick, but not too fast that you're left completely behind. However, there will be students of varying skill levels, something that becomes very apparent as the course goes on. If you are on the worse end of the spectrum, you might need to put extra work to keep up or seek help outside the normal class capacity since the instructor has to teach to all students."
