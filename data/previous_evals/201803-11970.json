   "comments": [
    "I became better at the nuances of the Spanish language and learned new grammar rules and tenses that I had never even thought about before. My reading, writing (especially with the opportunities for revision), and speaking all improved.",
    "Grammar and writing",
    "Although I had already learned much of the grammar covered in 130, I gained a lot more confidence and fluency, especially when it came to speaking.",
    "I really improved my speaking in grammar during the course of this class. Since the course was conducted all in Spanish, I feel more confident in my listening skills, and can now answer using the Spanish I learned. The many timed compositions that we did in class helps to improve vocabulary and grammar.",
    "My ability to read, write, speak and listen all improved. The constant use of Spanish in class ensured that I only thought in Spanish, which is exactly what I needed in a Spanish class.",
    "I became a much better spanish speaker as well as fine tuning my grammatical and writing skills.",
    "A continuation of introduction Spanish",
    "I learned many tenses and their proper usage such as preterite, imperfect, conditional, future, and more. I learned the use of superlatives and commands, and how to use \"if\" clauses and the proper verb tenses that correspond to those clauses. I learned how to be organized and diligent in preparing for class every day."

   "comments": [
    "You definitely learn a lot in this class, whether or not you realize it. The amount of practice and sheer content you are exposed to helps so much (especially if your class is small). I reached the point in Spanish that I'd never thought I'd get to -- where things just \"sound right\" because I've been exposed to them so much. I enjoyed the work I did for this class and liked the alternation between types of assignments. The readings were also all really interesting -- except I had issues with Relato de un nufrago. I wish we had been given twice the amount of time to read Relato de un nufrago. We had only ever read stories of a few pages before that all had vocab lists, and, in the last week, we were given 40 pages nightly of full novel at a 9th grade reading ability with no vocab list.",
    "Pacing was the biggest issue, and I think nearly everyone would agree. The book we read at the end was too fast, and it was hard to keep up. Also, the VHL assignments were often unnecessary and fruitless.",
    "The online homework was helpful but so expensive! I'm still salty that the course materials cost almost $300 for a class that I took as a graduation requirement, and I wish the department would be more mindful of that. After all, we could have done assignments very similar to the supersite on paper and then self-graded them based off a key on canvas. The syllabus also got pretty packed during the last few weeks of the semester, which made for a stressful end. Overall, though, assignments were pretty thoughtful and helpful, and I especially liked the emphasis on speaking.",
    "The strengths of this course that it has a high level of engagement. Since the class has about 10 students, everyone has the chance to participate and stay engaged in the material. It was also well-structured, following the content in the Enfoques book and on the SuperSite website. A weakness of this course is that towards the end of the semester, you will need to read a whole book in one week. I would suggest that the book be split up so each day you read one chapter, rather than three to four chapters in one day.",
    "The class focused on the Spanish syntax, and it helped improved my understanding of the language. Everyone had to speak Spanish in class, and it ensured that we practiced what we had learned.",
    "It is a lot of work every single night but you do become much better at spanish very quickly. The level of engagement required was pretty high.",
    "This course was incredibly fast paced. I felt like I could not keep up. I spent several hours a day studying, going to office hours, and learning the material, but every time I felt I sort of understood something, I was met with another brand new set of rules to learn. The class is unfairly given 1.5 credits. It should be more, for the sheer amount of time outside of class it takes to even stay afloat.",
    "The amount of review for each topic facilitated my learning. I think that the short stories were the most difficult part of the course and more time could be spent on those parts of the lessons."

    "At first, I was reluctant to take this course. I just saw it as something I had to get out of the way for a language requirement. But, after shopping it, my mind completely changed. For me, it was nothing like my Spanish classes in high school. Yes, it was hard to speak Spanish all the time and read such advanced texts, but I have grown more than I ever thought I could in my Spanish ability. I would recommend this course with this instructor to any student who's looking for a class that they'll learn a lot in -- and also enjoy. Though the workload is heavy, it's definitely balanced in the types of work assigned, which feels refreshing.",
    "Yes! L3 was great in helping my speaking, writing, and grammar improve.",
    "Even though it's a graduation requirement for anyone who takes Spanish, I actually would recommend it!",
    "Yes.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student who is looking to improve their Spanish speaking and comprehension skills. It does a good job in teaching you the different tenses: past, present, and future. You will definitely come out from this class with better Spanish skills.",
    "If that person was interested in Spanish, sure. I took this class because Spanish is a language commonly used in the US, and it would be good to know. But after taking this class, in retrospect, I would not take Span 130. It made me very unhappy. My teacher was lovely, but the content of the course (which she did not create) was overwhelming, exhausting, and didn't allow for us to sink in and absorb what we know. This class has drawn me away from exploring languages in the future.",
    "Yes I would recommend this course to another student. I feel that the fast-paced learning style and strategy used by our instructor improved my Spanish comprehension tremendously."
