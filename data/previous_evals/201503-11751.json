   "comments": [
    "Get the basics of Korean in a very pleasant atmosphere and without excessive work. I would totally recommend the class to another student.",
    "Yes! The language itself is not difficult so with practice you'll do fine.",
    "KREN 110 01 is a great class if you want to learn another language, and I would definitely recommend it to another student. It was overall a great and fun learning experience.",
    "Absolutely! You will definitely enjoy the class with Professor Lee.",
    "It was a great course. Prof. Lee-Smith was very helpful and she put a lot of effort into this class. She graded our homework and tests very carefully and she corrected grammars and pronunciations in class. The cultural presentation was a great way to learn about Korean cultures.",
    "It's not a hard as you think. Seriously. It's not easy but it's not as hard as everyone makes it out to be. You have nearly-daily quizzes but they aren't super hard unless you have a bad memory, then your in for a hard time. The tests aren't too hard but they are different than other language tests I've taken at Yale so that took some time to get used to. If you don't mind a crap-ton of memorization then take it.",
    "Basic entry level course to a pretty straightforward language.",
    "This is the best introductory language course I have ever taken--and I've taken six.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. TAKE KOREAN. DO IT FOR PROFESSOR LEE-SMITH. She is about as good as foreign language instructors get. She knows Korean, loves Korean, and both knows how to and loves to support her students in their learning of Korean. Beyond that, she is also one of the kindest, funniest people you're likely to meet (in your life). She is the reason I shopped Korean, the reason I took KREN 110, and the reason I plan to take Korean through L5 and continue studying it after Yale. There probably isn't a single person at Yale you'd be better off spending five mornings a week with. Take her class.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class because it has a balanced pace and won't overwhelm your life. In addition, you'll always have people to practice with while maintaining an intimate class setting that's so valuable for learning languages."
