    "Great ENVE course. Take it, especially if Meny is teaching.",
    "You're only taking this if you're an ENVE major. Hopefully Meny will continue to teach this course, because he's great. Can be disorganized at times, but he really knows what he's talking about and makes a genuine effort to make sure the students understand the material. Also, he's one of the leading scientists in the world on novel forward osmosis technology, and the last few weeks of the class are spent learning about that technology, which was interesting. If Beza is the TA, go to her office hours!! She's extremely nice and helpful. Weekly problem sets that aren't usually too bad -- a couple of them were pretty tough. Easier ones range from 2-4 hours, harder ones 6-8. Both the midterm and final had an in-class portion and a take-home portion. In class exams were pretty easy, and the take-homes had a couple straightforward questions and then a very challenging question that barely anyone answered correctly. Getting that problem right will set you apart from the rest of the class.",
    "Sometimes could be boring but Meny keeps it interesting--Do not take it unless if it is with Meny. It's required for the major if you're ENVE so not too much to say. Don't worry if you're not a senior, it's totally doable if you're a sophomore or junior. Just make sure you have taken multivariable calculus (and having taken fluid mechanics wouldn't hurt). The class is a very reasonable amount of work, but be prepared to dedicate your week to the class during the week of the midterm (there is an in-class and a take-home exam for the midterm and final.)",
    "You're probably taking it for the ENVE major -- it makes a lot more sense if you've taken Fluid Dynamics already. Will also be a little repetitive to Water Quality Control so I wouldn't take the two in the same semester. Take it with Meny if you can. If you're another major looking for credit and an interesting elective, this is a solid choice.",
    "If you're interested in water issues or environmental engineering, definitely take this course.",
    "You most likely have to take this class for Environmental Engineering, and to be honest it's not the worst class in the major. It's not easy - Prof. Meny leaves much for you to figure out on your own, but you can always get help. My advice would be to make the time to understand every part of the lecture and the most time-efficient way to do this is just go into office hours with Meny of the TF (do this each week or you'll fall behind!), and you'll be golden. The assignments and midterm\/final are fair, and Meny grades generously. Not a bad class at all if you put the time in.",
    "Environmental Transport was a hard but reasonable class. It definitely required a lot of work - especially on the weekly problem sets - and the material was very challenging, but in the end the exams were fair. That being said, I really have no idea what my grade is about to be.",
    "Transport is takes an in depth look at mass transfer and applies it to environmental engineering issues. The material is very challenging and a bit dry but the applications are extremely relevant and I know that I am going to use the knowledge I have gained.",
    "Overall good class, not too hard, learned a lot. Meny is great!",
    "I would recommend this class. The first portion of the class is pretty challenging and I helps if you know fluid mechanics. Meny is an amazing professor. He is really organized and conducts his lessons in a very clear manner. The qualitative material was really interesting.",
    "Chances are, if you are taking the class it is because you have to. It is a good class, and not too difficult. Although not necessary, it helps to have a strong fluid mechanics background, especially at first, because sometimes it felt like we were just applying a bunch of equations to different problems without understanding completely what those equations meant. Overall though, very good and enjoyable class I felt. Definitely pay attention in class.",
    "This was my favorite class of the semester. Meny is a great professor -- incredibly organized, really enthusiastic, and an inspiration in the field! It is taught really well and spans both quantitative and qualitative material. I wish I had paid more attention in class because if you're lost one day, you'll definitely be lost the next. The psets are really fair and actually pretty interesting sometimes.",
    "A great class - weekly psets, midterm (1 take home and 1 in class), final (1 take home and 1 in class). the take home is quantitative and the in class is conceptual. you get a cheat sheet for the in classs. very reasonable workload, but the take home exams are so difficult. he's a pretty reasonable grader for those. psets are fine - go to office hours if needed."
