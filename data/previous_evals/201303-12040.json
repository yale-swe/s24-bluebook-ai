   "comments": [
    "A very good class. Obviously, this course changes every semester, but it's usually thought-provoking and well-done. Especially, I think, because the grad student who wins the right to teach it has to be head and shoulders above the others and have the entire course planned out. This course, \"Policing and Protest in Urban America,\" was enjoyable and interesting. Through journalism, academic books, academic articles, popular books, a little fiction, and movies, we learned about, well, policing and protest. It was a good class, though Prof. Pearlman could get a little too focused on the theoretical, jargony aspects of things...",
    "Take this class for a junior seminar! It is a great way to begin to really engage with some of the difficult topics that are very prevalent in current American Studies. It also was a great way to get to know some fellow junior American Studies majors.",
    "I would ABSOLUTELY recommend this course. It is highly interdisciplinary and the material is outstanding - the books Pearlman exposes you too are so amazing that most of my class is excited to start reading more of certain authors' works. Great class and the workload was appropriate for a junior seminar.",
    "I think it really depends on the people in the class.",
    "This is an amazing look into policing and protest os spaces across the United States. The course and its reading apply to everyone, so I do not see a reason to not take it.",
    "I would recommend this seminar to another student if you are interested in exploring social movements. For the most part we got the perspective of protestors and not necessarily of those who are policing so that is one thing to keep in mind when taking the course. If you would like to hear more from the perspective of those who police, you will only have that opportunity once throughout the entire semester. With that said, I still felt like all the texts we read were worthwhile because they gave voice to actors you don't usually hear from. I would not recommend this to anyone who wants to delve deeper into spatial theory because this seminar does not really focus on unpacking and using theory."
