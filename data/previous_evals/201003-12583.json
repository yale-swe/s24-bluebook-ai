   "comments": [
    "Great class, but very theoretical. Know what you get into when you sign up. This is a class for people with open minds who are looking for a new type of analysis.",
    "I would only recommend this course to those who really like architecture and are very interested in great firms, globalization and stuff like that.",
    "This course was great. More people need to take it. Anyone from any of the social science fields would find it interesting and valuable. Its a critical study of contemporary issues that most courses at Yale don't get to.",
    "This is an alternative class that I found to be interesting.",
    "Um, AWESOME. The lectures make basically no sense, but that makes them totally hilarious. You don't do any work in this course until the end paper. It's a lot of fun, especially if you have a great TA.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS!!!!!! The material is absolutely fascinating. Nobody else teaches globalization like Easterling. She will completely revamp your way of thinking about the world.",
    "looking at how\u0097specifically through infrastructure\u0097capitalism functions above the state level and its implications. I would recommend the course.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student. I think it gives a new perspective on the worlds functions and develops a richer awareness to global affairs.",
    "Take it! The readings are hard but Keller's course and vocabulary are her own which is impressive in itself. Good mix of real-world descriptions of global infrastructure and theoretical considerations of its implications. One of the most unique courses I've taken so far, with exceptionally attractive slides. If you're intimidated by the difficulty of the materials, it's a great Cr\/D\/F class."
