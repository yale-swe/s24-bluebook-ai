   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This course is very well constructed. I believe a primary goal of the course is to improve language skills, which it does well through class translation, analysis, and examinations, which require the student to review (and therefore internalize constructions and phrases). We covered at least Aeolic, Attic, Homeric, Ionic, and a couple synthetic dialects, amounting to somewhere in the ballpark of 2000 lines. Besides this, I learned as much about how to approach textual consideration from the diverse styles of the students as I did from the professor. Several times Professor LeVen came to class with an impressive handout for our learning\/edification that she seemed to have made in the time since the previous class, and I have accumulated many resources that I will take with me to future courses. The only things leaving me wanting more were (first) that we had to drop the final work of the syllabus (a minor but interesting dialogue) due to time, which I would have liked to discuss and hear Professor LeVen's insights on, and (second) that the assigned secondary literature did not feature in class discussion.",
    "The main strength of the course was its selection of readings and unity of theme, which allowed it to stay very coherent and on topic while covering hundreds of years of literature in very different genres. One improvement I would suggest would be to find a better way to integrate secondary literature, as it didn't feel like it really contributed to discussions."

   "comments": [
    "Absolutely. Your Greek will improve significantly if you do the reading, you will gain a specialized knowledge of the Helen tradition from primary reading, class discussion, and scholarship, and your writing and speaking ability will be put to the test by an oral presentation and associated research paper.",
    "This course is a great L5 offering, with interesting and diverse readings about a fascinating topic. It is a bit difficult, merely due to its scope, but the result is well worth it."
