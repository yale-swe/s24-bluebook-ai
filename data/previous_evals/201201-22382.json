    "While the workload is probably small compared to other courses, the course itself is probably more difficult than you may believe. If you have extensive experience as a musician or singer, perhaps it won't be too difficult, but someone less fluent in music only taking it for \"fun\" like me may have trouble. Consider the Cr\/D\/Fail option like I did.",
    "If you're taking a theory course (210, especially,) then take 218! It goes along with 210 in the same way that a science lab course might go along with a science class. It gives you tangible applications of the material you learn in any theory class. It's nice to have a class that allows you to sing and listen to music in the midst of all your other academia, whatever it may be. Take it!",
    "This class is wonderful until you have to take a test, at which point it is horrible. The class is wonderful - twice a week, you get to sing and listen to music, and there's no homework other than practicing piano - but there's no homework, and it's really hard to know how to study for the tests.",
    "While the workload is never anything serious, the course is still challenging and very rewarding. You will improve your musical ear if you attempt to keep pace with the class. This class is worth taking if you have any interest in improving your musical ability. It is NOT an easy A unless you already have a very well tuned ear.",
    "i would recommend it to improve singing ability",
    "It was way too easy. I felt like I learned very little, despite quite large gaps in my skillset.",
    "Yes! It develops skills that are useful for any musician.",
    "I took this class as a senior - a percussionist and singer, I finally bit the bullet and realized that I could learn a lot from practicing these skills. And the main thing I learned? That I could do most of this best when I stopped thinking about it so hard! Take it credit\/D, practice in class, and enjoy waking up in the morning to sing!"
