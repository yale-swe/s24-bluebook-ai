    "Yes I would recommend this course to another student. I have already done that many times!!",
    "You will improve A LOT if you have no background in Art. But if you do, get ready to be faced with very harsh criticism from professor reed ALL THE TIME. I would recommend this class for newbies but not for art pros...many of the techniques learned are very basic and you do not draw the figure.",
    "An intense drawing course that advocates a structural way of seeing. If you are interested in the art major, take this course. If you are interesting in improving your drawing skills, and willing to take a little more time, I would recommend it. Don't take this section of drawing if you plan on putting this class at a lower priority than others.",
    "You never know what to expect from this course, and sometimes that is annoying and overwhelming. However, that is a feeling Professor Reed challenges you to face to overcome. The approach is unconventional. For example, you might build things instead of drawing. Just know what you are getting into, and be ready for it. I would recommend the class; it keeps you on your toes.",
    "It's worth the time.",
    "I would be very careful about signing up for this class. It is a huge amount of work--and the work isn't always related to you developing as an artist-- and the whole experience can be extremely frustrating.That being said, I learned a lot about thinking visually, and I do see the world differently than I did before. I just don't think I learned as much about actually drawing as I could have. If you sign up for this class, make sure this is the experience you want. If you just want to learn basic drawing skills, or even the opportunity to make art, this might not be the right class.",
    "Your drawing skills will be improved no matter what level you are on. Expect to work hard when you come into this course and you will not have any problem with the professor. He wants to see you improve and that is only achievable if you draw, draw and draw some more. The course is interesting and challenges a lot of peoples' preconceptions about drawing. You should definitely take this course if you are interested in taking drawing to the next level or if you are interested in being an art major.",
    "Drawing is not just a way of representing images and ideas on a paper or creating beautiful works of art; it is also a powerful tool to explore the world around you, to really see and understand the structure of things. Take this class if you want to learn how to see. Other sections may do a quicker job of teaching you to make dramatic or emotionally compelling drawings, but that is not the focus of this section.I used to take classes with Yale Swing& Blues. I remember an instructor telling us to take swing dance lessons if we want to impress people watching us dance, but to take blues dancing if we want to impress our dancing partner. Unlike the swing dance lessons\u0097which tend to focus on the sequence of movements and steps\u0097blues dancing lessons provide you with some basic vocabulary of movement, and then use that vocabulary to explore and strengthen the physical communication between partners. Once this connection is created, you and your partner are able to channel the music and\u0097with the help of the basic vocabulary of movement\u0097follow wherever it leads you.Prof. Reed's Basic Drawing section is like that. Throughout the course, you learn and practice a number of tools\u0097basic building blocks\u0097which help you to construct objects onto your page. By exercising these tools, you explore and strengthenthe connection between yourself and the physical structure. Just as blues dancing can provide you with the means and the venue to experience a profound physical communication with another person, drawing can provide you with the means and the venue to experience a profound visual understanding.The main complaint I heard with the class was Prof. Reed\u0092s refusal to tell them what they should change in their drawing to make it \u0093good.\u0094 However, creating beautiful works of art is not the point of this class. Instead, it is about exercising and strengthening the ability to see. It is about drawing as a means rather than as an end.WORKLOAD: The workload of this class is comparable to any other language course at Yale.",
    "This class is a unique opportunity to explore something in a great way.",
    "Basic Drawing with Professor Reed isdemanding, and many students may develop hostility to the course and\/or the professor, but it is rewarding, especially for potential Art majors. It shows students a new way of thinking and pushes them to work very hard and develop as artists. For these reasons, I would recommend the course to another student."
