   "comments": [
    "My understanding of the systems in the human body has increased exponentially. There was a lot of material, but it all tied together logically (ex. understanding why heart rate increases when hemorrhaging).",
    "Well, I definitely gained an inordinate amount of knowledge regarding every organ system in the body. Some was exceptionally detailed, but much of it was able to be connected to real-life conditions.",
    "I learned a lot about the connections between separate organ systems and I think I now have a detailed understanding of the way our body regulates certain functions such as water balance, glucose reabsorption and sodium reabsorption.",
    "Finally putting physics, biochemistry, biology, organic chemistry, and chemistry all in one pot and applying the skills to a physiological system. So awesome!",
    "Even with an extensive STEM background, this class was one of the hardest classes I've taken in my life - harder than multivariable calculus, harder than linear algebra, harder than complex analysis. But it was also one of the most meaningful and rewarding - yes, the material builds up and sometimes you might get overwhelmed, but if you put in the time and take advantage of the wonderful resources provided to you, you will have no problem learning the material. And you should, because understanding the different organ systems in a function-anatomy approach will change the way you think about science, about medicine, about everyday life. Like, when I breathe (and trust me, you will live and breathe physio if you take this class which you should) sometimes I think about the different pressures in my chest cavity, and when I pee sometimes I think about sodium\/water balance. Seriously this class gives you so much insight into how the human body works with its interconnected systems, and this insight is crucial for people who want to go into medicine or just understand their own bodies better. Also for premeds this is more than enough preparation you will need for the physiology material on the MCAT just saying. The professors were intelligent and approachable, the TAs worked tirelessly hard, and this overall was an excellent course. This class taught me to be a better problem solver (I've developed a \"what happens if X goes wrong\" approach to thinking about systems), a better student (if I can study for all my other classes like I studied for this class that would be really good lol), and hopefully (fingers crossed) a better doctor and scientist.",
    "Knowledge of the human body from electrophysiology of the heart and the propagation of action potentials, to the specifics of the sensory system, and eventually pituitary hormones and the working of the kidney.",
    "Physiological Systems was an awesome course - it taught me a whole different way of thinking. The way in which organ systems operate was a whole new world of thinking - the idea itself was foreign and novel to me. It gave me in depth knowledge about the human body that I'd never known and will likely not come to appreciate again in the future.",
    "I learned more about the body and how everything works. We covered many of the organ systems in the body, but not all of them due to time, and along the way discovered some of the medical applications for what we were learning in class.",
    "This was a really comprehensive and detailed course in physiological systems I learned so much about the functioning the human body from the cellular to systems level. I also gained insight into my future career goals, since I know a similar course to this is typically involved in the first year of medical school.",
    "I gained a great level of insight into multiple organ systems within the body. The course allows you to study many important systems in depth, so it's great if you are looking for a general comprehensive study of human physiology.",
    "Greatest, most comprehensive, get you excited about medical school class of all time.",
    "This course taught me an extraordinary amount of material regarding the organ systems of the body and went into a ton of detail.",
    "I learned a lot about the human body and how organ systems interact with one another.",
    "I learned a lot from this class I feel like I got a really good grasp of physiology from this course and it was really interesting to learn about the body.",
    "absolutely fantastic course. best class i have taken at yale -- learned SO much (woudl be especially useful for those taking hte MCAT) but also just a great class for anyone. ifeel that i have learned so much about the body and what goes on !!",
    "This course is a comprehensive overview of all the physiological systems in the human body, largely organized by organ system. These include cardiovascular, GI, kidney, respiratory, endocrine. The system that is not covered well is somatosensory. All the sections, apart from that one, went fairly in-depth and you will come away with an understanding of the micro-level processes, like G-protein signaling and action potential generation, that are responsible for tying together multiple parts of the systems. Even if I feel like I was struggling in the course, I have walked away with an undeniable understanding of physiology and even some anatomy. Even in my everyday life, I have a better understanding and fascination with bodily processes. I even used some of the physiological logic I learned in class to try to diagnose my own issues with acid reflux in the GI tract! Honestly, I also learned how to find resources on my own and find the best learning technique for me. I am a visual learner so I love watching videos to frame my learning. I found great physiology videos on YouTube and my experience in the course improved after that!",
    "Great introduction to physiology. There's so much material that a one-semester class won't be able to cover every interesting thing about physio, so you kind of get the feeling that what we do cover in class was chosen somewhat arbitrarily. But a great course nonetheless. Very difficult.",
    "I learned about how the human body works and how all the intricate processes fit together in some giant complex puzzle--truly fascinating and amazing.",
    "Physio was such a comprehensive overview of the major organ systems in the body - a week's passed since the final and i could probably still go in detail about how specific body parts work. The class did a really great job of showing how different systems connected to each other and having us think about how seemingly unrelated effects could come together to affect the same range of organs.",
    "A hard course, but worth it. You get a thorough overview of physiology (with anatomy too!). Instructors and TAs are top notch.",
    "I've probably learned more in this class than in my entire collective academic experience. This class was jam packed with information. I learned so much about physiological systems--many facts, but also how to understand many different types of graphs and scientific data. I also learned very valuable study techniques and how to be more involved in class.",
    "The curriculum covered a large number of topics in much greater detail than I had previously seen. I feel like I gained a significantly deeper understanding of many of the systems in our body. The knowledge and tools we learned will help my understanding for future classes in my major.",
    "How various body systems work. Using logic and physical properties and anatomy to understand how the body functions",
    "Physiological Systems was a great class. I learned a huge amount about how most of the organ systems in the body operate, and in the process strengthened my understanding of both anatomy and basic biological principles. While a lot of the course simply involved memorization, I was pleased by how much of it also involved critical thinking and understanding concepts at an abstract level - it was definitely the sort of class that forces you to think in a different way than you're used to, and I found it overall to be very intellectually stimulating.",
    "- Physiological problem analysis - Steps to follow in understanding a scientific concept",
    "Many aspects of human physiology was covered, from the cellular level to organ systems.",
    "This was one of the most valuable classes to me that I've taken at Yale. I learned a ton about the systems of the human body and I learned to think critically about how they interact, and how the body reacts to disturbances to try to maintain homeostasis. As an MCDB major and a pre-med student, I will definitely keep using this knowledge in the future.",
    "This class taught me the basic physiological functions of major systems throughout the body. I feel like I now know them at a very high level.",
    "An insane comprehension of body systems and their interactions.",
    "I learned a lot about different organ systems and how they interact with each other. There's a lot of information, but I learned how to synthesize it and put it in the context of previous information.",
    "This course was very interesting for learning about how systems interact together. Yes there was a lot of memorization, but it definitely wasn't the rote memorization of anatomy (i.e. every single muscle and location of the muscle in the arm, leg, etc). It was more memorization about how systems work together and function together. All and all very interesting but lots of information.",
    "This course provided an excellent, detailed overview of the functions of each of the body systems and was extremely informative for someone who loves biology and the workings of the human body.",
    "Definitely gained a good understanding of how organ systems work that you don't get in other premed classes, but is really important for medical school and the MCAT.",
    "I learned how to memorize great quantities of material. I also learned how to quickly analyze situations based on the knowledge I knew.",
    "Learned a ton about physiology (abd learned how to memorize a ton of material)",
    "I really learned exactly how the body systems worked in an indepth and engaging way. I also developed the skills needed to retain massive amounts of information for the culmulative final",
    "This class has by far been my favorite course at Yale as it has provided deep knowledge on how human biology manages to keep us alive and functional in our lifetime. I did not think I could understand how it all fits together but this class has directly provided me insight that I will carry on the medical school and beyond.",
    "learned so much about physiology. really interesting material!",
    "I learned a lot of valuable material in this class. So much of the human body in particular. I think all of this information will serve as useful for me in the future.",
    "This course allowed me to greater understand how the different parts of the body function independently and together.",
    "I learned how to critically think about the body as a network of systems and how to apply normal physiology to situations where there was a dysfunction (ie disease state).",
    "Learn a lot about major organ systems. Lots of memorization, but interesting material.",
    "As a pre-med student, this course was the most applicable course to medicine that I have taken at Yale. I thoroughly enjoyed learning the material.",
    "Lots of knowledge, and better studying habits for understanding that amount of content.",
    "The amount of material I learned in this course is absolutely insane. There is so much material covered that is can be very overwhelming and hard to process at times, but by the end of the course I felt really good about how much I knows about the human body. You get really in depth lessons on the major systems of the body. This class really so super cool and interesting and I absolutely loved it. It is extremely challenging because of the huge amount of material, pathways and generally details you are expected to know, but it is so rewarding. You feel so god about everything and while the final made me nervous, I was also oddly excited to take it and see how much I had learned.",
    "This course was the most in depth look at all systems of the body. It was extremely comprehensive and I felt like I gained a much greater overall understanding of the human body from a greater knowledge of the details of each of its' parts.",
    "I developed a rigorous understanding of psychological systems.",
    "The weekly psets helped me to organize the concepts we were learning during lecturesand integrate the knowledge from multiple lectures to solve problems. Since this was a very memorization-heavy class, it helped me to practice good studying skills for the exams, working multiple lectures in many chunks of time. During section, we used what we learned to pinpoint the problems of sick patients and then suggest solutions. This class also provides some exposure to Matlab. Finally, I learned how fascinating physiology as a field is."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I really enjoyed this course and the way it was structured by system. Some lecturers were better than others, but overall the course was great. Students should know ahead of time that while the course is not an anatomy course, you still need to know a decent amount to avoid getting confused.",
    "The class definitely moves very quickly, but that's by design. The strengths are the lectures, which are diverse and engaging and interesting, and do a good job of demonstrating the concepts that we're learning about. If there's a weakness, it's the size of the class, which is really too big to engage with the material as much as I'd like (even with section). In addition, as an undergraduate, I think that there should be some scale differentiation between the undergrads in the class and the graduate students--perhaps this is already being done, but I'm not totally sure. There are a lot of grad students and there should be some different set scales for each subset.",
    "I think the strength of this course are the instructors and TAs. I do think the course would be markedly improved if there was one lecturere, particulalry Professor Campbell. There were some guest speakers who truly were not as engaging when presenting the material in comparison to Campbell.",
    "I think the classes are taught to the best of their ability-- couldn't ask for it any other way. The midterms are a little too long, but after the first midterm, the professor was more than willing to cut it down to accommodate students-- it was really appreciated.",
    "Really great class. The only problem is lack of time, I don't think I would be the only one to wish there was a continuation into a second semester.",
    "AMAZING course. I wish there were a second semester.",
    "I really liked how this course invited different professors to teach different physiological systems. Even though some lecturers were unfortunately not as clear or helpful as others, I felt like there was something really special about learning from real experts who specialize in each of the different organ systems that we learned. I don't think the course had any major weaknesses or areas in need of improvement -- it was, overall, designed very well, always with students' interests and well-being in mind.",
    "It was nice to have different lecturers for the different organ systems, because we got to learn from experts in each field - though it made the course less than seamless at times because professors will inevitably have different ways of explaining things and different level of detail in lecture, so it really becomes up to the student to synthesize the material from different organ systems all together. If each professor could have summary sheets like Professor Aronson did for his renal system lectures (though I know that is a lot to ask), I think students would have a smoother time going over material and solidifying understanding. The weekly quizzes were due at 11:59pm on Saturday which kept us more or less on top of the material, and the Matlab simulations were quite helpful. Further, the poll questions at the beginning of each class were great (if you make it to lecture in time lmao). If they could be posted in the future that would help students even more.",
    "Some of the lecturers were stronger than other. A lot of information was covered in the slides and took some time to decipher. The exams were fair. A potential improvement would be to take some time to re-emphasis important concepts at the end of each lecture or give a small review, in addition to section.",
    "This course is fast paced. Like very fast paced. Extremely fast paced. It was difficult - spacing out for moments can alter the course of your entire week. Missing a lecture could be fatal. Although to an extent the pace is necessary to complete course material, if some of the denser material could be more a bit more widely spread out, the overall shape of the course would benefit. The material was amazingly interesting though.",
    "the strength is definitely the teaching team. At Yale it's hard to come across a team that has very good instructors and very good Ta's but PHYSIO is the exception. I felt supported and knew that i was learning quality material.",
    "The course's strengths were its very talented professors and its structure with weekly sections and TA review sessions before exams. Weekly section really synthesized all of the key topics from the week. It also covered a huge range of material and, for the most part, did a good job of pulling out the most key aspects of each organ system. Weaknesses were that some of the professors that rotated through teaching were better than others, and all of them taught in different styles. I would have preferred to have the sensory and endocrine lectures taught by different professors, and Professor Boulpaep was great for the circulatory lectures he taught but overwhelming for the GI lecture. Going off of that, some lectures seemed unnecessarily rushed for the sole purpose of cramming in extra facts that ended up just being rote memorization. It would have been better to leave off a couple of details and make sure students had time to do more than copy down words on the slide before it switched.",
    "This course is great, in that it teaches you all the important things you could ever want to know about the physiology of the human body. It'll prepare you well and thoroughly for many different fields of study, and for the most part the information is delivered very clearly and effectively. Although for a lot of the course the only information that was provided was what was important and essential, for a significant part of the course I still feel we were just being drowned in unnecessary detail. This also makes it more difficult to retain important information after the course is finished because, especially when the final comes around, there's almost too much information to hold in your head. In summary, it's a great course, but the main thing to improve upon is stripping down certain sections of the course to just what's important.",
    "The sections were extremely productive, and the weekly quizzes were a good way to help keep students on top of the material.",
    "The course challenged you in terms of the quantity of information you had to absorb.",
    "The endocrine lectures were very unorganized. Overall, the course was very good. Kavita, my teaching fellow, was what made this course amazing. I learned more in her 50-minute section than I did in a week of lecture. She is by far the best teaching fellow I have had here at Yale.",
    "Overall I thought the class was great and I learned a lot from the class. My only complaint would be about some of the guest lecturers. I felt like I didn't learn as much from any of the guest lecturers as I did from Campbell, and I didn't like the constantly changing style in the second semester.",
    "strengths: guest lectures, materials, and of course the TA's who are incredible weaknesses: maybe the matlab modules? you can do them without knowing anything (just following directions) so they were often not helpful\/confusing when i first did them, but the acid base one was helpful when i went back to study it,",
    "Strengths - Most of the professors are fantastic and invested! - There is no way someone can come out of that course without having learned something. - The TAs are phenomenal. - The weekly quizzes never feel like busy-work. Weaknesses - There is just way too much material covered and there should be no realistic expectation that someone will do all the reading in B&B unless they have no social life and have no extracurriculars. - There isn't enough visual learning. Videos, simulations like the ones Alex E. made, and a little more anatomy would have clarified a lot of concepts!",
    "It was great to have different instructors cover different topics, although the quality and organization of the lectures can vary widely. We only got one grade at midterm, so it was particularly difficult to assess how well you were doing in the course.",
    "Strengths include good coordination between the different professors who teach vastly different organ systems. Weaknesses include the MATLAB quiz modules: i felt they were useful but were mostly rote following instructions.",
    "I thought that for the most part the lectures were insanely well conducted. There was so much material to cover in just one semester, and Prof. Cambell did an awesome job of making the concepts accessible. In that sense, one weakness was that some of the other lecturers didn't do as good a job at explaining concepts, which, granted, there is a ton to cover but it could have been done better.",
    "This whole course was pretty well-designed and well-taught. My only criticism is that we covered too much material to really focus on any one topic. One improvement would to plan the exams better (our second midterm was the day after the election), but overall this was one of the best classes I've taken at Yale!",
    "I felt like there was a discrepancy between the material covered in lecture, discussed in sections, and tested on in exams. I think the lectures oftentimes attempted to include too much information and subsequently confused many students. Sections were more helpful because they focused on what material would be important on exams. I think the lectures would be more helpful if they covered less material and focused on the most important concepts. The textbook was far too detailed so it was often confusing to figure out what information was important for exams.",
    "The class is taught well and he material is interesting but we try to cover so much that the lectures always seem like a race to get through the material which is kind of a shame.",
    "I really liked how knowledge was reinforced in many different ways - lecture, section, and quizzes. I also appreciated when lecture slides were posted in advance so I could print them out and write on them (it would be nice if they could be consistently posted by 10pm the night before).",
    "The main strengths of the course were that it was highly informative\/dense with useful and relevant information, most of the material was clearly presented, or if not, than at least well-explained in discussion section, and the exams were fair. The weekly \"quizzes\" were quite manageable as well, and they helped me to consolidate the material we covered each week. I thought that the simulations that we did as homework were mostly helpful, though the one on water\/salt balance kind of confused me, perhaps because it was due before we even covered it in lecture - it would have made more sense to have it due a week later, after Prof. Aronson had talked about it in class. I also was confused by the CV system simulation (vascular function vs. cardiac output) until my TF went through it in section. The Davenport Diagrams simulation was my favorite - it really helped me to understand the underlying concepts. In general, I found the quality of the lectures to be a little mixed between instructors. I thought Professor Campbell was the clearest and the best at explaining concepts, while Professor Boulpaep's lectures seemed the most convoluted and hard to follow. In general, though, I was pleased that most of the instructors took the time to clearly explain things in class and made use of practice question polls at the beginning of each lecture to reinforce concepts.",
    "MCDB 310 is a well-taught class that is very thorough without seeming too bogged-down with detail. The lectures are mostly clear, and the professors make themselves available after lecture to answer questions students might have. The weekly quizzes were helpful, and the exams were fair.",
    "This course was extremely well organized and well taught. Even with the different professors switching off, I still felt a sense of continuity. I don't think there is anything that I would have changed.",
    "The strength of this class is perhaps also it's biggest weakness: it is an absurd amount of material per lecture. However, it does not feel like any lecture was unnecessary or excessive, so I think that is just the nature of the course. The teaching staff does a great job of making as many resources available for assistance in learning which is great. One improvement I could think of would be a brief list of major points from each lecture being released with the lecture so that we can look at it after each lecture and use it with our notes to review and make sure we understand the major points.",
    "The strength is that it covers a large amount of material fairly succinctly (at least for the first part of the course). When Campbell lectures, it is very clear and the essential information is highlighted. However, some of the guest lectures were a bit more disorganized and even more material was just thrown at the students.",
    "Some of the guest lecturers were very boring as in I was falling asleep. I did like how the course instructors rotated though, but some were clearly more interesting than others. Also, special shoutout to Alex who operated that fabulous Piazza page incredibly and answered questions within hours.",
    "Strengths: Professor Campbell, Professor Holt and Alex Engler are great teachers. Piazza was very helpful. Weaknesses\/recommendations: I think Professor Boulpeap should teach as if students do not know the material he is covering not as if we already know it and he is just reviewing. I think the curve should be at least slightly more generous- the MCDB department is already stricter than other departments in terms of grades and this class is on the stricter side of MCDB courses. Tests should focus more on understanding than memorizing. I think we should be able to keep our exams, at least our short answer questions, to study for the final on our own time. I understand that some teaching assistants are always going to be better than others, but if some provide theirs with with extremely helpful study guides, I think at least these should be made available to other sections who both have a less helpful TA and do not have the study guides.",
    "There is a lot of material covered - however, this is definitely not a weakness given that by studying hard for the midterms a lot of it is retained in memory.",
    "By the nature of the subject, this course was extremely challenging. I thought that, between the weekly quizzes and the sections, there were decent resources for making sure you understood the material, however I also think there could have been more out-of-class resources, like study halls.",
    "Lots of reading, but really good integration and flow of material.",
    "Great professors but since there are so many, you never really get a chance to get to know them. Very memorization heavy, which might be inevitable for such a class. There's so little incentive to work hard on the quizzes sinc egoing to section guarantees a perfect score. What's the point of assigning a textbook that's all but useless? The readings from it have basically no value-add.",
    "Way too much material. The course could easily be split into two semesters.",
    "The course was engaging and interesting as well as well taught. The weakness of the course was that some of the co-teachers were a bit more clear than others",
    "The strengths of the course relied on the separations of the bodily systems in its different components to be tied together in the end by the endocrine system. The weakness was the relatively frequent changing of instructors. Having only two or three instructors might have been more efficient.",
    "I think the lectures are very engaging and the lecture slides have a good amount of information on them without being overwhelming. I think the textbook was huge and had too much information, so I think the course would improve if there were a better textbook. I also think the class would improve greatly if it were not at 9:25 am. The class is really important for BME majors and premeds, and waking up for a class at 9:25 3 times a week sucks, and really worsened my sleep schedule as a whole. For most 18-23 year-olds, it can be hard to focus at 9:25, and hard to arrive on time, as evidenced by the fact that many people arrived between 9:25 and 9:45 every morning, and class always seemed to be way emptier on friday mornings.",
    "i wish it was less about just memorizing a lot of information and instead focussed more on the conceptual",
    "I believe the lectures although packed with information, sometimes boring and spoken too fast. The strength of this course is that the professors are at the utmost importance of their field, however, sometimes the professors spoke a bit too fast. I think this course would benefit if they were taught in seminar like environments.",
    "This course is very well taught. The lectures are okay but the TAs are incredible, so you leave section feeling like you understand the content. However, because there is so much information, it is sometimes difficult to gauge how much detail you should know for the exams. I recommend taking this course credit\/D.",
    "There is a lot of material and sometimes it is challenging to decipher what the key themes are. Overall, a really fantastic course that I learned a lot from.",
    "Sometimes the lecturer (Campbell) didn't seem prepared for the class and often wasn't able to finish the slides he prepared.",
    "I really thought it was well taught and structured.",
    "Content is interesting but there's so much of it. Honestly I'm really impressed at how all lectures covered wverything. They did a good job addressing it and I'm not sure what more they could've done.",
    "The strength lies in the topic of the course. Physiological systems is just so interesting and the way the body works is absolutely fascinating. For the most part the class was well taught and the sections were extremely helpful in consolidating the material and making things more clear. The professor really wants everyone to do well and does what he can can to help. Some of the guest lecturers were better than others. That could be a weakness that some systems were hard to follow depending on who taught it. Different lecturers also went into different amount of detail than others. This made it hard to decipher how much we really needed to know at times. I think one thing that could be imported is making it more clear what level of depth we are responsible across different systems and teaching styles.",
    "I loved the organization of the course and I think having the weekly quizzes really helped me to stay on top of the material. Discussion sections were also very very helpful.",
    "The weekly quizzes and discussion sections provided a reliable system to keep up with the material. The difficulty in the course was the quick pace and large amounts of information regarding different systems.",
    "The lectures are organized by organ systems which I found to work really well logically. I enjoyed that the class was focused on how systems work (i.e. feedback loops), so when something goes wrong, you know how to solve the issue. The psets definitely helped me to improve my problem solving skills. Some psets used Matlab simulations which I found to help solidify certain concepts, especially those that involve feedback loops."

    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. I took this credit\/d, which help reduced stress for midterms, but I still participated actively in section, did all the quizzes, and attended all lectures because I genuinely enjoyed the material. One of my favorite classes at Yale.",
    "Yes! If you have to take this for BENG, don't worry, it's a great class--it moves very fast but it's great! If you're electing to take this as an elective for another bio\/science major, it'll also be lots of fun. I don't know what I have to say about this class from the perspective of a non-STEM major but I also think that that proportion was very small. The class is fast, and dense, but it's rewarding and very engaging.",
    "I would recommend this course only if you need it as a requirment for your major or the pre-medical track.",
    "Absolutely! This class challenges you on so many levels and there is a lot of material to learn-- it's not easy by any means but the end result is so worth it.",
    "Absolutely take this class! It's so informative and so interesting if you have a passion for anatomy and physiology. Very well taught, you will learn so much!",
    "Amazing course. TAKE IT if you are a STEM major.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. Physiology is an incredibly interesting subject -- we not only learned about how different organ systems in our body work, but also studied how these complex interactions and relationships incorporate concepts from biology, chemistry and physics to create a dynamic and truly fascinating system. I do think, however, that you get out of this class what you put in, so if you want to truly internalize the concepts and be able to extend them to real-life applications, you'll have to make physio one of your top priorities. There is a ton of material, so it's unfortunately easy to fall behind and hard to catch up afterwards if you don't invest enough time in from the start.",
    "Yes, but with caution. Be sure you know what you are getting yourself into - this is not a class to take if you just want to get a distributional requirement out of the way. You have to have some degree of interest in the material and be aware of the breadth of the course - you need to stay on top of the material or you will literally endocytose. That said, this course was amazing and if there was a physiological systems 2 I would take it!",
    "Would recommend to another student but be aware of the time-intensive nature of the course and the difficulty of it. Be prepared to dedicate a lot of time reviewing lecture slides and understanding minute details of the body's system. You will learn and retain a lot of knowledge at the end of the year. The exams are also fair but a little short on time. If you put in the work it should pay off.",
    "Yeah, definitely if you're a BME major. Probably if you're premed, it'd be good to take - if you're worried, then definitely Credit D it. The material is super awesome and most of the lecturers are great",
    "Definitely Take the course. I took it for BME, but then left BME and still loved the course, The grading is fair, and for 99% of students this is all new material. It's hard to have a person who already \"knows it all\" in the class. Very equal playing field and very interesting. Confirmed my belief that I want to practice medicine one day.",
    "I would only recommend this course if you have to take it for your major, if you haven't yet taken the MCAT but are planning to soon, or if you are definitely planning to attend medical school and want a leg up on physiology to lighten the first year. This class is a lot of work and a LOT of material, so I wouldn't recommend it just for interest or fun.",
    "This class is a ton of work, but also very fulfilling. The material is fascinating. Do not fall behind and start studying for the exams early, as there is a massive amount of material covered. Highly recommended",
    "This course is excellent for people who want a comprehensive background in physiology. It's quite a good course, but just be prepared to do a lot of memorization.",
    "If you are considering medical school this is a great class.",
    "Take it! You learn so much!",
    "If you are thinking of taking this course outside of your major, the Credit\/D\/F is probably a good call.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class, but it definitely takes quite a bit of time to study for the exams. Outside from the tests, the workload is quite low (unless you decide to do the readings that is). However, the tests are very dense and it's a lot of memorization and material to get through.",
    "take this class!!! it's hard. hard in that you need to put a lot of effort into it, but its not that the material is super difficult. just takes a lot of time to study because its so much info. but nothing is like difficult to grasp as most of it is memorization. still a wonderful class could not recommend it more highly",
    "I highly recommend this course, especially coming from the perspective of a pre-med. It is truly the redeeming course of the pre-med curriculum and has made this track worthwhile for someone who isn't really crazy about biochemistry and orgo. I'll break this recommendation down into 1) what I learned from this course, 2) the workload, and 3) how to succeed. 1) This course is a comprehensive overview of all the physiological systems in the human body, largely organized by organ system. These include cardiovascular, GI, kidney, respiratory, endocrine. The system that is not covered well is somatosensory. All the sections, apart from that one, went fairly in-depth and you will come away with an understanding of the micro-level processes, like G-protein signaling and action potential generation, that are responsible for tying together multiple parts of the systems. Even if I feel like I was struggling in the course, I have walked away with an undeniable understanding of physiology and even some anatomy. 2) The workload is daunting and the course is difficult. No doubt about it. Pairing it with MBB 300 Biochemistry may also sound daunting, but actually worth taking at the same time if you have to take biochem anyway. Halfway through the courses, they start to overlap considerably and understanding of one definitely enhances understanding in the other. Here is the breakdown of the assignments: There are take-home online quizzes with about 6 short response questions each week. These take about 3 hours if you have a decent grasp on that week's material already. The assigned reading in the huge textbook is extremely detailed, interesting and helpful, but honestly it is way too much and I never actually read all of it after the first week. It is helpful to look at the figures included in lectures and find them in the textbook and just read the text around the figure. If you are in a time crunch, it may be best not to stress out about the textbook reading. Lectures at 50 minutes three days a week but you have to spend at least an additional 30 minutes for each lecture to get some grasp on the material. I highly advise looking up the subject of the lecture beforehand and watching a 15-minute YouTube video on Armando Hasudungan's channel on that topic\/ organ system before that lecture. The lecture itself will make SO MUCH MORE SENSE. Actually though, even watch those videos when studying. They are so good at visually representing concepts and processes. Finally, there are two midterm exams and a final. Going to section, where attendance is required to get full credit on quizzes, definitely helps prepare. The exams themselves are tough and you have to truly understand the systems to do well on the short responses, which focus on pathophysiology. The multiple choice necessitate more memorization but if Alex Engler is your TA you will be so much better off. 3) To do well: Watch Armando Hasudungan videos before lecture, go to lecture, spend 15 minutes reviewing each lecture immediately afterward, check out\/ buy the Costanzo Physiology book and use that instead of the assigned textbook to help with the weekly quizzes, and for the exams read up on pathophysiology to prepare for short responses. It is definitely doable.",
    "Yes! This is a super interesting class, and you'll learn a lot about yourself, but take it Credit\/D unless you need to take it for a grade.",
    "I would, especially if you have the time in semester and are not a senior (unless you still care a lot senior year) and\/or are a premed student--this makes you appreciate the human body so much more!!",
    "Absolutely. Hands down one of my two favorite classes I've taken so far. You've got to be ready for the workload because it is a lot, but you won't regret it",
    "Would recommend this course to any pre-med student.",
    "I would recommend this course, but only if they have a light courseload. I had a very heavy courseload and felt I couldn't dedicate enough time to the course as I would have liked. I would recommend credit-Ding the course if they could, if they didn't think they had the time to devote but were interested in physiology. I really loved the material, but it was a bit overwhelming, but overall would recommend the course.",
    "I would not recommend this class if they are not interested in the subject. Its a large amount of work and is meant to provide basic information on physiological systems which should be built upon in subsequent classes.",
    "If you have to take the class, or if you're interested in how the human body works and are willing to put in a good amount of time into the course",
    "This class is the first 9:25am class I've been excited to get up for. The content is all so interesting and makes you think about how amazing and interconnected the human body is. After going through the intro bio sequence I'd begun to question how much I liked bio and this class reminded me about everything I loved about it. It does go through a lot of material so be prepared for that.",
    "Take this class if you want to learn the basic principles of how all of the major organ systems in the body work. It's that simple -- it's not super hard, but hardly a cake walk either. Be ready to spend many hours studying for the exams. I wouldn't recommend taking this course alongside other highly information-dense and detail-focused classes if you can't help it (though likely you can't, if you're taking this for pre-med or for your major). The workload is one \"quiz\" per week (read: short-answer problem set that takes 2-4 hours, open-note\/untimed and never math-intensive), two midterm exams and a final. Exams are challenging but fair; definitely felt cramped for time on the midterms, but not on the final. Overall, a good amount of work, but if you find biology\/anatomy\/medical sciences at all interesting and the course material isn't too redundant with what you already know, I highly recommend the course.",
    "MCDB 310 is a fascinating class and a must-take. Even though it's a lot of work, it's very much worth it.",
    "I highly recommend this course. You will learn so much (especially if you're pre-med), and all the professors and TAs are incredible.",
    "This is the best course I have taken at Yale! Please take it even if you are remotely interested in physiology. The lecture, the professors and TAs are all superb!!",
    "I would recommend this course given that it is interesting and you will learn a ton. But if you don't have to take it, I would be sure to think really carefully if you are willing to take on the difficulty of such an intense course. The assigned workload is very manageable but if you want to keep up with the material you will have to work much harder on your own because each lecture is a ton of information. For the most part it is well taught and interesting, but just a lot of work.",
    "I wouldn't take the class if you aren't too serious about learning the material, but if you put it in the time it is REALLY worth it! Super entertaining and worth it.",
    "It's a really interesting class with a pretty low workload in terms of actual assignments (only one online, free response style quiz due each week), but there is tons of information and it is very fast paced. Lecture is pretty short but every single minute will be used, so even leaving five minutes early (or being five minutes late) can cause you to miss important information, and class does run slightly over time often. There's a ton of memorization involved and lots of little details; the tests were sometimes a little frustrating because of tricky wording on the multiple choice and true\/false questions because of this. Great lecturers though, and very interesting topics. Many of the lecturers are also practicing physicians, which made for some neat insights and applications when learning about their area of expertise, and Prof Boulpaep literally wrote the textbook so it was pretty cool to have him giving lectures, too. However, the number of lecturers also means that the slideshow\/note quality and style can vary quite a bit; some of them include everything you need to know on the slides themselves while others you definitely need to be taking active notes. Course information (notes, slideshows) is all easily accessible and posted quickly, professors and TFs use Piazza to respond to questions and make announcements (really valuable resource for this class) and are all very approachable in person or via email for questions as well.",
    "Yes, I would highly recommend this course for anyone who wants to learn more about human physiology! There is a great body of resources, including a cadaver lab (optional) at the end of the semester for any interested students.",
    "Yes it was great but challenging; only take it if you are very interested in the material or have to take it for your major.",
    "I would recommend this if you have to take it for BME or if you are definitely taking the MCAT (in which case I recommend Cr\/D\/F since the curve is not good). As a not premed MCDB major taking this because I thought it would be an enriching course on how the body functions, I do not recommend this course. If you want to know something about a particular organ, read about only that specific organ in depth and try to understand how it functions, if you want to be in the situation you will be after taking this course, memorize a medical textbook in a few months. In terms of work, this class essentially was my semester, and I still probably did better in my other courses for which I had little time for. As comparison, I really liked Cell Biology, which required a lot of work, but I came out really understanding the different pathways and being able to apply material learned in a lab setting. I don't think it is the fault of the instructors - particularly Professor Campbell, Holt and Alex Engler are great at teaching - I just think that the tests should probably be structured differently to facilitate understanding rather than memorization.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to any student interested in how the human body and the different organ systems function.",
    "Consider taking this Cr\/D if you can!",
    "Yes, I would. It was an intense class, but it really challenged you in the right ways. I pushed myself and learned a lot.",
    "Don't take it for fun, but if you have to take it, it's a good class. Expect to spend a fair bit of time on it",
    "This course is really interesting and applicable as it goes in depth on how your body works exactly at a systems level. I often find myself picturing the physiology of the kidney as I drink water and eat salt.",
    "Definitely take this course as the material is fascinating and it is the course to tie every information that you could have learned in all bio courses. It is pretty much the gateway to med school even if you do not want to take that route. You will learn so much about how the human body works which is beneficial in many levels.",
    "This class was tough and sometimes not super enjoyable during the most difficult times (especially the midterm that was at 9:25 the morning after the election). However, I'm really glad that I took it and that I now know how the major systems of the body work. It gives me a basis for understanding how diseases affect humans, and how problems in one system can affect your whole body. Super-useful information overall. For example, if I were in the wilderness and someone were to fall on a sharp rock and puncture their chest cavity and get a sucking chest wound, I would know what to do to make them not die, theoretically. At the very least I would know what caused them to die. Thanks physio!",
    "yes, but be prepared to learn A LOT of content",
    "I would only recommend this class if you are interested in the human body or if it is a requirement.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. This class requires a lot of effort and should not be taken with other difficult classes (as I did). I recommend taking this class credit\/D because you learn so much about the human body, you have to study in order to pass so you don't slack off too much, but you don't have to worry about getting everything right on the exams.",
    "Yes, you will learn a lot, but be prepared to spend a lot of time studying for this class. It is worth it in the end! Try to get Kavita as a TF, she's AMAZING.",
    "YES!! Physio is amazing. The information is really interesting.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone at Yale interested in how the human body works. It is a decent amount of work but I really enjoyed what I got to learn and it was well worth it.",
    "I took this as a biomedical engineering sophomore. It's going to be a lot of studying and a lot of new content. The class is pretty competitive and needs a lot of attention, but also has pretty interesting content.",
    "100% recommend if you are interested in the human body and medicine. This class is so so so so interesting. It goes in depth into different systems of the human body such as respiratory, digestive, cardiovascular, GI, muscular, sensory, etc. This class will cover more material than any class you will ever take at Yale, but it is so rewarding. By the end of the course you know so much information about the human body and the way it functions. Which is just really cool and interesting. This class is great for anyone who is premed. I am taking it as a BME major and I am really glad I took it. It was definitely challenging and I am not sure I did that great, but it was still worth it due to how amazing it felt at the end of the course to realize all the things I had learned. I was nervous for the final, but also oddly excited to take it and test my knowledge. TAKE THIS CLASS!!!! The workload is heavy more due to the amount of material there is so it takes a long time to process, go over things and learn it. But otherwise there are just quizzes online once a week and you only have to get half credit on them and then attend section and they bump it to full credit. There are two challenging midterms and then a final.",
    "I think this was one of the most rewarding classes I have ever taken at Yale. All the work put in felt like it paid off and was definitely worth it. If you are willing to put in the time, I would highly recommend this course.",
    "Physiology is incredibly interesting because it provides a more holistic approach of how the body functions that can't be obtained from other courses like cell biology or molecular biology which are more content specific.",
    "I had to take the class for my major; however, it is currently one of my favorite classes that I have taken at Yale. I found that physiology is very fascinating. You learn many feedback loops and how the body corrects any issues when your body strays from homeostasis. The class demands a lot of attention however and should not be taken lightly."
