    "Strengths: approachable professors, good foundation in current parasitological research on select topicsWeaknesses: feedback given too late for improvement on subsequent writing assignments (and question marks were not helpful -- more specific\/tailored, longer responses would be very helpful!); lectures on parasitic organisms could be more basic (i.e. more lifecycle explanation such as what cercariae are, etc. -- I had no idea what organisms looked like, many major symptoms of diseases, and basic types of hosts (paratenic, etc.) were from taking the course; I felt that I knew a lot about RNAi and other inducible systems\/select new research on particular parasitic systems, but very little about general interventions currently taken for parasitic organisms, which was disappointing)",
    "excellent course. i learned very valuable skills for research while studying organisms that i had never looked at through this lens. although the workload was more than most other courses, i felt it was appropriate and that i was getting exactly what i needed.",
    "The topics covered in the course were very interesting but the weekly assignments were tedious and sometimes unnecessary."

    "Instructor: Diane McMahon-Pratt \u00a0Again, approachable; good with most written feedback; can be intimidating, particularly when discussing Chemistry (as sometimes assumes that students follow particular terms like Km or dissociation constants or Balb\/c mice, without discussing what these particular terms or ideas are, especially during presentation discussions and early lectures)",
    "Instructor: Diane McMahon-Pratt \u00a0again, a wonderful instructor who loves her work. her input in discussions across other neglected tropical diseases and methodologies was also very helpful.",

    "I would recommend this to a biomedical science student looking to survey particular parasitic research systems, but not to any student in more general public health or to any student without a desire to tear apart biomedical research. So -- to a few students, the course might be helpful -- to others, its probably a combination of overwhelming, sometimes quite boring, and sometimes frustrating.",
