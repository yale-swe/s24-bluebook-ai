    "This course is WORTH waking up for at 9am every morning. Do it.... You will learn in a different way from most bio classes because in this class, WORKING TOGETHER (even on the midterm and final) is HIGHLY encouraged. It makes going through difficult material all the more manageable and fun when you can do it with your peers.",
    "Really chill, interesting class. Take it. It's a Yale gem.",
    "Its a very good course and not a lot of work at all!",
    "Molecular insights into human disease! Fascinating!",
    "No wOrk in this class at all, we did maybe five problem sets all year and take home midterm and final. Average was a 93 on the final so it was pretty easy. Recommended if you need a light upper level Mcdb. Fascinating material and lectures too",
    "Yes definitely. It was an interesting course and the work was manageable. The exams are take-homes and you're actually encouraged to work together on them.",
    "This course is the logical next step above Physiological Systems, re-examining many of the concepts covered in that course from the perspective of individual pumps, ion channels, carriers, and other proteins. Some of the material in the course may be familiar if you have taken courses in cell biology and neuroscience, but this course does a uniquely good job of tying molecular events to clinical signs. All assessments are take-home, so the course should not be too much of a problem if you have the appropriate background in biology."
