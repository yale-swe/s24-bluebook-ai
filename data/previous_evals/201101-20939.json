   "comments": [
    "Yes, I would recommend it as a worthwhile class for those interested in cancer biology. There are considerable amounts of reading, but it is interesting material.",
    "Great",
    "I would recommend it because I learned so much about such a vast and booming field. The people who gave lectures were some of the top in the field and the newest researchers on topics such as epigenetics, using biomarkers, etc.I would recommend fewer lectures on specific cancer types and more on how to analyze cancer data.",
    "A fantastic review of the field of cancer. If the student was interested in cancer research I would highly recommend it to them.",
    "I would describe it as a class that is alot of work but worth it if you were interested in cancer as a subject to study. This class is not to be taken if you are not interested in cancer.",
    "Path 650 is an excellent survey of cancer biology for anyone interested in the pathology of cancer.",
    "I would recommend the course to another student as an overview of cancer biology because of the breadth of material that it covers.",
    "I would definitely recommend the course, though I would tell them that the reading assignments are fairly time intensive. I would tell them that they would get an excellent overview of the current understanding of cancer biology and treatments. I would also tell them that giving presentations helps you learn a few topics quite extensively, so try to pick papers that they are particularly interested in.",
    "Yes I would if they are interested in cancer. Goes over a lot of topics and gives you a good idea about upcoming research in the field",
    "I would recommend it, but I would say that it was a lot of work and that you have to be willing to read 5-6 papers a week.",
    "A very current discussion of cancer biology crucial for understanding the history and future of cancer research and drug development. I would highly recommend it, as I mentioned before due to the lectures by expert guests who are commonly authorities in the field."

   "question_text": "How did this course deepen your knowledge of your discipline\/profession? To what extent did this course contribute to your dissertation\/research?",
   "comments": [
    "I was auditing so I did not get into the depth of the material fully but I learned more about molecular pathways and lab-based research in cancer that will hopefully allow me to conduct better research in the future in related fields.",
    "Great",
    "I liked the idea of writing a review. I had never done it before. I think the broad range of topics covered by the course along with details of the field were helpful in my understanding of past, current, and future endeavors in cancer biology.",
    "It furthered my knowledge of what is known in the cancer field, and the problemsthat are faced for treating various cancers including acquiring resistances to therapeutics. The course also provided the history behind cancer research, which was quite interesting.",
    "This will directly help me in my dissertation as I am going to be working in cancer biology. It allowed me to read some of the seminal papers and crystalize what has been built and what still needs to be answered.",
    "The course provided me with a broad understanding of cancer biology that I can apply to my workin cancer immunotherapy.",
    "This course gave me several ideas on what to try with my research, which is the development of targeted delivery vehicles for genetic silencing agents. I learned a lot about the potential of HDACi in cancer immunotherapy, and I gained a deeper understanding of many of the abberant genetic changes that contribute to cancer. I also learned about mouse models and bioinformatics tools that are available, which I think will be helpful in my research. I also learned strategies that other researchers are using or have tried, which will hopefully help shape my research.",
    "I think this is the most valuable course I took so far in my graduate education at Yale. Part of it is my huge interest in the topic, and part of it is excellent selection of assigned articles and guest speakers. Since I plan to conduct research in the cancer field, I would say that it has contributed vastly to my understanding of the challenges in cancer biology."
