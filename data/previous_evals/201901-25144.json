    "I learned how to read philosophy and think critically about a text. Of course, I also learned a lot about Maimonides' philosophy!",
    "The class gave an in-depth exploration of Maimonides' philosophy and provided a really good introduction to many of the ideas floating around in his intellectual milieu, from Aristotelian, Islamic, and Jewish traditions. I gained an ability to read and appreciate a single text and to engage in a singurarly difficult task of interpretation."

    "Professor Harvey gave insightful analysis of the passages we read and consistently looked behind the plain meaning (while not forgetting to cover that too).",
    "Honestly I feel maybe one more essay would have helped. I would have liked more opportunities to practice writing. However, overall amazing course!",
    "It is a great course. The professor does a good job of providing background and providing room for various interpretations, but isn't afraid to push back when he disagrees. The class is also very accessible to those who have not studied medieval philosophy before."

    "Yes",
    "Yes definitely! It's a great opportunity to learn the thought of one of the greatest Jewish thinkers.",
    "Definitely take this course if you have an interest in medieval thinking, whether Muslim, Jewish, or Christian. Maimonides brings together so many ideas floating around in the Medieval mind and takes them on. If you aren't super interested in medieval thinking, it is still an amazing class because it challenges our ability to read and interpret text. Maimonides is an amazing thinker who deals with issues of theology, philosophy, and science, and you will be enriched for having studied him."
