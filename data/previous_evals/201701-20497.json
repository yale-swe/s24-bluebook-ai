   "comments": [
    "Learned the fundamentals of microeconomics, and learned some more advanced topics.",
    "I am an economics major, so definitely a huge foundational course that will be necessary for my further studies. All very important info for my major",
    "Nothing. I really doubt I will have retained any information from this course by the end of the summer.",
    "The course helped reinforce economic principles I learned in previous courses by supplementing that knowledge with a greater mathematical framework.",
    "Expansion of topics learned in intro micro.",
    "I learned how to use calculus maximization techniques and to apply them to a variety of problems--that's really all you do, learn to use a Lagrangian and then just do it over and over again, but for preferences with time, uncertainty, insurance, monopoly, duopoly, equilibrium, and games.",
    "Microeconomic topics were covered. This course is math-like.",
    "This is a great class if you go in with the mindset of learning. It can be challenging in terms of coursework (10 problem sets, 2 midterms and 1 final) but you will be able to get through it easily if you make good use of your TAs' and professors' office hours.",
    "basic analytical stratgies",
    "To be honest, I learned nothing in this course that I hadn't already learned in introductory microeconomics. The only difference was that we did each topic with more math and less economic intuition.",
    "Intermediate microeconomics included different types of market competitions, utility maximization and cost minimization, price discriminations, labor supply curves, and more, Quite a fast-paced course! In it, I learned how to employ Lagrande functions, Bordered hessian matrices, Pareto graphs and Edgeworth boxes, as well as how to mathematically think about different economic principles.",
    "Intermediate Micro was great for learning the quantitative side of economics",
    "The course focuses heavily on how to use math in solving maximization\/minimization problems. It is more theoretical; however, Eva does make a good effort in making the lectures relevant to real-world firms and markets.",
    "Lagrangian",
    "I learned so much more than I thought I would. Intermediate micro is so much better than intro micro. You actually get a better sense of what you're doing",
    "I learned a lot about the mathematics behind microeconomics.",
    "Learned some mathematical skills, and practical applications of them in economics, as well as some basic models for individual and firm behavior.",
    "Learned about the mathematical foundations and economic micro concepts like utility & profit, different market structures. Got to understand much more of the basis behind theories and stated \"facts\" taught in previous micro classes, and was interested to see the assumptions behind models.",
    "Good mathematical and microeconomic skills.",
    "I learned how to solve very specific problems in this class, but still do not understand how they pertain to the field of economics. I learned the math, but cannot connect the concepts to anything other than the equations we learned.",
    "I learned a lot about economics and microeconomics in particular. The math and analysis skills were very useful.",
    "Good intermediate micro course. Optimization!",
    "This class is really tough, but you'll learn the material needed for higher level economics courses.",
    "The same concepts as in Intro Micro but using calculus (with partial derivatives). Lagrange method of optimization is the main skill\/concept; also isolated concepts such as lotteries, expected value stuff, and considering the firm using partial derivatives. General Equilibrium was a solid topic to learn.",
    "Developed the skills I learned in macro with a more quantitative focus.",
    "The mathematical side to economics",
    "I hoped to gain a better understanding of microeconomics, and its applications in the real world.",
    "I actually preferred this class to Introductory Microeconomics because while the math makes the material more challenging, it also makes a lot more sense. There a number of fundamental concepts covered in the class that will be useful in higher level econ courses, and Professor Chalioti does a great job of relaying the material.",
    "Microeconomics, of course, and also general problem solving, quantitative reasoning skills.",
    "I learned a slew of information about modeling maximization and minimization problems using Lagrange functions, along with information of numerous other topics. I really enjoyed the real-world scenarios put forth in this course, and Professor Chalioti did an incredible job of making the class engaging.",
    "I learned how to analyze microeconomics using advanced math (multivariable calculus), which was something I never knew how to do beforehand.",
    "In taking Intermediate Microeconomics, I was able to gain a greater understanding of microeconomics, especially from a mathematical perspective. With this course, I can now apply these concepts to other policy decisions which can be modeled by these processes.",
    "Good overview of microeconomic theory without too much focus on math",
    "It's a pretty tough course in the beginning. We covered a lot on lagrange multiplier and the third pset was especially hard. But the materials become easier once you have a better grasp of the initial concepts and the instructors and TAs are very helpful in explaining problems.",
    "I definitely gained a greater, mathematical understanding of basic economic concepts touched on in introductory courses.",
    "an understanding of intermediate economics",
    "Taking ECON 121, you get a deeper understanding of the concepts learned in the introductory class. Derivations help connect all the loose ends. Really! The last lectures on Innovation and and Externalities were one of my favorites.",
    "I developed my math skills and greater understanding of economics.",
    "Mathmatical understanding of Intro Micro Topics",
    "I learned how to maximize a profit function. And how to set up a ton of different types of profit functions.",
    "I learned optimization under various circumstances with multivariable calculus.",
    "I learned how to apply mathematics to microeconomics, new mathematical tools such as multivariable maximization (constrained and unconstrained) using Lagrange multipliers, more about monopolies, oligopolies... This class was great and I really feel like it solidified my knowledge of microeconomics!",
    "Math skills, economic intuitions, how to combine the two.",
    "Learned how to incorporate multivariable calculus with economics.",
    "A solid understanding of microeconomic concepts, no surprises here.",
    "Quantitative skills, modeling, economic thinking",
    "ECON 121 provided me with a better understanding of microeconomic theory. I now understand the basic concepts and ideas that drive choices made in economic settings. In particular, I learned how to use methods to maximize or minimize certain multi-variable equations to find the best choices by actors in a market.",
    "Most of what I learned in the class was multivaraivle calacukus and how to apply the new math to economics problems. Not a lot of Econ concepts, most of the economic theory was already something we had covered in introduction micro.",
    "Intermediate microeconomics: incorporating calculus and probability theory to intro micro concepts",
    "I learned about optimization through calculus-based computational methods, including profit maximization and cost minimization. Essentially, we revisited Intro Micro concepts with a calculus approach.",
    "I learned greater applications to the concepts of intro micro.",
    "I became more familiar with the mathematical explanations for economic concepts and with applications of basic calculus.",
    "Intermediate Microeconomics goes over the same topics from Introductory Microeconomics in more depth. The course covers oligopoly, monopoly, Cournot and Bertrand competition, etc (look at the syllabus for more info).",
    "intermediate micro is a lot of algebra"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Very hard course, and probably can't avoid that.",
    "It is super boring, and super hard. The p sets are ridiculously hard and long, making it virtually impossible to complete by yourself. The dates and spacing of the midterms is actually really good having midterms in SCL sucks",
    "Sooooo much math is unloaded on the students in the beginning that it's mildly overwhelming. I'm not sure how to improve upon that given the bulk of the material that need to be covered over the course of the semester but I figured I would point out a common complaint.",
    "No weaknesses at all. Excellent course.",
    "Professor Chalioti was a fantastic instructor and walked through analyses of problems in class which made problem sets MUCH easier (since we learned how to assess problems in class rather than trying to figure out alone how to do it in a pset which some professors do) which helped with our understanding of the material.",
    "The strength was mainly the professor Eva was a great teacher and tried to make the infamous subject of intermediate microeconomics engaging to the students. The weakness was what makes intermediate micro so infamous among students unnecessarily long and tedious problem sets.",
    "This course teaches you what it needs to I guess. Sections are hit or miss. If you do not have a strong math background you might find yourself struggling--it's not so much that the math is difficult, it's just that if you don't have a good number sense, you will probably not find it that intuitive, which could make it a struggle. The problem sets are long, especially the second one, but they weren't horrible, and I think they did help to reinforce the material. Eva is nice and really does care about her students. I don't know how the other professors are, but I'd recommend taking it with her. But there is nothing fun or thrilling about this course; it's just giving you skills you might end up using later in Econ.",
    "This course is fine, but the way the concepts are taught could be improved.",
    "Long psets that can't be well done in one evening, but honestly i couldn't imagine this class being any better.",
    "The strength was that some of the p-sets really challenged me to think and problem solve. The course was fine except for the fact that the material was boring.",
    "Strengths: teacher enthusiasm, comprehensive coursework, insightful commentary Weaknesses: discussion sections were impractical and useless, parts of the course seemed disjointed, too few connections to the real world particularly in assessments; little reliance on theory and essays, very mathematical",
    "The course was great. Professor Chalioti was an amazing professor. Learned a lot.",
    "Strengths: Eva gives clear and concise lectures. Tests are fair and based off practice problems & psets. Weaknesses: Does get repetitive at times.",
    "Cohesive course design. Fair exams. Could be improved with more transparent and timely grading, especially by TAs. For example, one TA skipped a problem when grading my bluebook. She refused to correct the error and it literally took two months for the professor to amend the mistake. I think the course could be improved by shortening lectures to 50 minutes.",
    "It's a hard class tbh. Eva is the best thing about the Economics Department at Yale",
    "Problem sets, lecture material, and exam topics line up very well in this class. I also really appreciated the real-life examples and connections to current research that Prof. Chalioti included in each lecture. I don't have any weaknesses to note.",
    "I think that the course does a very good job of teaching us what we need to know, and the problem sets are very geared towards the exams, which is extremely helpful. However, sometimes I had the impression that the lectures were more theoretical than the problem sets, so there was some confusion on those. I think the course could do better to integrate theoretical aspects with practical applications.",
    "Eva is an amazing instructor and posts all the slides on Canvas so you can review. The tests and psets correspond to what is covered in lecture, and while challenging and lengthy, are never un-doable. She is a fast-paced lecturer and gets through material efficiently, but the pace can also be difficult for some students. Overall, well-taught class. Lots of office hours and support.",
    "Shorter problem sets.",
    "The course is too math heavy. I understand that is important, but would have been much more interested if I understood why I was doing the problems, and what the math actually meant.",
    "I've read that behavioral economics is very mathematically complicated, but even if we don't learn it, maybe we could go over some of the basic ideas?",
    "The course is well planned. The only issue was that the first two weeks were very difficult compared to the rest of the class. Spreading out the work more evenly could be useful.",
    "Eva was a great lecturer, and she was interesting and passionate. Material could get dry, but it's intermediate micro. It's mostly math. Good course overall.",
    "This class has exams that are absurdly difficult and really challenge the students limits. That being said, I do then appreciate the curve that is in place to compensate for this fact. This class is pretty good. It could be improved, though, by having more relevant problems sets and transparency in material needed to know for the exam. It often felt like the lecture material was irrelevant to the material we were being tested on.",
    "Weaknesses were the explanation of some concepts, strengths were the problem sets. Consistency between problem sets and exams.",
    "I think that going over the math a little more in depth would be helpful, especially at the beginning.",
    "I felt that this course was well very well taught. Professor Chalioti really cares about her students and wants to see them succeed! I found her teaching to be very strong and for the problem sets to be fair preparation for the midterm. The only weakness I found was that class itself was really rooted in the theories that it was hard to apply without much practice to the problem sets. But there were a lot of resources to go to for help, so it was fine.",
    "In the beginning, the problem sets were incredibly long, though they were adjusted in length as the semester went on. There were other times when I felt as though lectures were rushing through the material, and some concepts did require some outside research either through the textbook readings or attending office hours held throughout the week. However, the strengths in this class lie in the accessibility of both the professor and the TA's whenever help was needed. There were always multiple office hours throughout the week, as well as Piazza as a resource 24\/7, both of which were invaluable when struggling through difficult concepts.",
    "This course was pretty close to as good as a microeconomics lecture can get. It was fairly interesting and engaging, and I felt I actually learned something by the end and understood microeconomics better. I thought section could be made more interesting\/helpful. It has the potential to add so much more to the course but the way it's currently set up I hardly felt compelled to show up every week.",
    "This course's biggest strength is Professor Chalioti. She is an incredible professor and her presentation of the course material creates an engaging intellectual environment. The examples worked out in class help with the problem sets, and the problem sets help immensely with the exams. A weakness of this course is definitely the lack of feedback given to students by the TAs; very few comments are written on problem sets or exams about why the student was answering the problem incorrectly.",
    "Weaknesses: Slides aren't as organized as they should at times and there is no textbook to rely on.",
    "I felt like the course material was overviewed much too quickly and the lectures were hard to follow for that reason. Luckily, the section material supplemented the lecture material very well and usually cleared up the confusion I had in lecture. Additionally, the problem sets were very long and hard to complete correctly.",
    "I think that this course does a good job of going over the appropriate material in a timely manner without relying too much on the textbook materials themselves. This makes it convenient for review since the slide material is essentially the material taught in class. However, what is a problem is the pacing of lecture, in that easier material that has likely already been covered takes up time in the beginning of class, leaving less time for the more complex material that is usually at the end. This is only truly covered in section.",
    "Main weakness that I'd highlight is that the professor didn't give enough practice material for the midterms and final. Though if you can get your hands on Samuelson's previous papers, you should be golden.",
    "Overall it's a very well-structured course. Professor Chalioti goes through the steps with you in class and explains the materials in a very clear and concise manner. If you need to take this course, take it with Chalioti.",
    "The course is dense out of necessity, but I think that it is organized in a way that properly incentivizes learning and really does try to give the student the benefit of the doubt in terms of grading (pset grading system, dropping lowest pset, informative weekly sections).",
    "good powerpoint problems sets reflected accurately material that was tested on exams good study guide\/materials list a lack of clear feedback on what went wrong in problem sets LOTS of grading mistakes in exams",
    "Professor Chalioti made this course one of the most pleasant required classes in the Econ Department! It is very theoretical but there is always so much support to help you understand the concepts.",
    "The course is very fast paced and everything is taught in a flash. I believe it would be better to cut out some material and better teach the other aspects, especially since a lot of the course is redundant.",
    "Very poor lectures and slides-- they taught concepts when the assessments and assignments were purely applied. Topics were clearly organized but one could skip every lecture and not be worse off for the class. Exams did not test for understanding or for problem solving, only for regurgitation memorized math problems and SPEED. There was never enough time to solve answers--one only had enough time to complete exams if the memorized the different mathematical pathways. This class aims to provide a deeper understanding of Micoreconomics. IT DOES NOT. It merely proves mathematically the curriculum of Intro micro. As it was structured the class was an absolute waste of time even for an economics student, there there was no new concepts and barely any new depth -- merely more difficult questions and math. To improve, this class should either present NEW problems on exams that depend upon real problem solving (and give us more time), or focus on deepening the conceptual themes only briefly discussed in Intro Micro. As it stands, I got next to nothing from this class because of these many flaws. Professor Chalioti did the best she could, but there's no saving such a poorly designed curriculum.",
    "The main strength of this course is how much it seems professor Chalioti cares about her students. However, there are many weaknesses. the foremost of which is that everything in the course boils down to the LaGrange function which is taught very quickly because it is assumed that people know what it is from math classes however the math teachers do not teach this with econ in mind and so it is very possible to slip through the cracks which make this class next to impossible.",
    "The class has a lot of material. The problem sets are long. It has a lot of resource of support.",
    "This is a tough class made much harder by unnecessarily long p sets that make the material seem overwhelming and impossible.",
    "Very well run course by an excellent lecturer! Professor Chalioti teaches the course with wonderful energy and a good sense of humor.",
    "Great TAs",
    "Could be more practice problems.",
    "Course was structured well to facilitate learning.",
    "Very strong, I think a non-cumulative final would be better given that there are two midterms",
    "Strengths of this course include nice, structured powerpoints, well-explained lectures, and several options for office hours for help outside the lecture hall. Weaknesses include a low rate of participation\/involvement, hard to understand p-sets, few practice tests, and a lacking TA.",
    "Strengths: -This psets were very similar to exams which I really appreciated. The psets were very thorough and often times incrementally build on the previous question to teach you how to do complex tasks. - I really enjoyed the psets. They were very challenging and required a lot of time in the begininnjng, but definitely worth it for how much I learned and the progress I made over the semester. Weaknesses: -Lecture didn't spend enough time on the mathematics part of the course, which was the majority of new material for me, someone who has only taken single variable calc. I felt like we spent a lot of time on theory I already knew from into micro and then rushed through all of the new math \/ application of math to problems, which was frustrating because psets and exams really only test our ability to solve problems anyway. -The professor's answers on piazza could be A LOT more helpful. People ask questions about material and get simple, one-sentence answers that don't clarify the details we are stuck on. It's very, very frustrating because it might seem obvious to the professor or some students with , but it's not obvious to me or other students who have the same questions. Similarly, there a Pset solutions that provide answers for questions that literally say an answer should be easily derived and just SKIP actually explaining the answer. So please, please actually answer piazza questions & write detailed pset solutions as if they're meant for people just learning the material . -The textbook really sucks. It's only vaguely related to the material we learn in class and is not helpful for learning how to do Pset problems. If anything, posting solved practice problems or just the solved problems we do in class would be helpful. Sometimes it's hard to keep up with the math we do in class, especially since its sometimes rushed through at the end of class.",
    "If the mathematical concepts were explained more clearly in the slides that would be greatly helpful. In addition, there was a lot of material that was repeated and confused students as well as extra info we didn't need. Overall, the course is a great follow up to intro micro.",
    "Strengths: CHALIOTI is an absolutely incredible professor, I wish I had her for all my other econ\/math classes. Weaknesses: The content. It's incredibly boring, but Chalioti makes it a little better.",
    "The curriculum of the course is dry despite the good teaching. It's more similar to a math class than an economics class, but the professor did try to bring in economics concepts and more fun ideas during lecture. I think approaching the course more like a math class would actually be better. Maybe this class should take the same format as Math 120, and more problems similar to the problems sets should be worked out or reviewed during lecture. For example, after the problem set is due, if the instructor could go over how to solve it in class, that could be helpful.",
    "Strengths include the thoroughness of the problem sets and the clarity of the notes. The choice of material was very cohesive. I also appreciated the additional information on the slides that related the concepts and relevant societal phenomena. Weaknesses include the lack of direct feedback on problem sets.",
    "The course is notoriously difficult especially if you have a lot of Math or Economics and Math majors in the class. While it can be a very educational experience, my biggest problem with the class is that it tries to fit all the students in the same curve as every other year."

   "comments": [
    "If you have to take it yes, if not then probably avoid.",
    "I only recommend if you are majoring in Econ. Otherwise, I feel the info is useless and the class is much too hard and time consuming to take it. But, as an Econ major, its absolutely essential to my further economic studies and a necessary course.",
    "If you gotta take it for the Econ major, then sure, go ahead, but under no circumstances should you ever taken this class if you do not have to.",
    "It's a requirement so you have to do it, but definitely take it with Professor Chalioti!",
    "If you can take this course with Eva, please take it it's by far the most pleasant intermediate micro experience you will have.",
    "It's intermediate micro, so I doubt you're taking it for fun. I think taking it with Eva is a good idea--she's really nice and cares about her students. I would be careful about taking it if you aren't confident with math--it's not so much difficult or upper-level math, just that if you don't have a good number sense it will definitely be a struggle. Exams were fair and very similar to practice material and problem sets. Problem sets were long, but I think they were generally successful in helping you to learn the material, and there were only eight of them. The slides are all online and are pretty useful, though I would still recommend that you GO TO LECTURE because she works through how to do the steps you'll need on the exam. The exam grading was a bit sketchy; sometimes they went through it pretty fast, so make sure to look over your exams carefully and make sure that the grading was fair. That's probably just a function of whatever TFs you get though. Section was perhaps slightly useful if you had a good TF (Esteban and Donghyuk were both good, I didn't have any exposure to the other two), and you can go to any section you want, so that might help. There are a lot of office hours and stuff, but it can be difficult to ask questions and get a clear answer--sometimes it's not completely clear if Eva understands what you're trying to ask.",
    "If you are not an economics major do not take this course.",
    "Yesss!!! Super easy if you're a quantitative\/math-y person, but the. analysis done with the simple math is very interesting.",
    "Yeah, it's not as hard as people say and it's interesting.",
    "No, but it is required.",
    "If you are interested in learning more about microeconomic theory, I would recommend it, especially if you are more mathematically-oriented.",
    "Yes, this course is essential to understand higher level economic concepts.",
    "Take this class with Chalioti. She is amazing.",
    "Take this course with Eva!! She's a great lecturer and made everything clearer to me.",
    "If you have to. Eva is a good teacher, though lectures feel very long.",
    "It's a challenging class but go for Eva's office hours and everything else like sections. Also go to class for crying out loud!",
    "If you have to take Intermediate Micro, I would recommend taking it with Chalioti. You might have heard nightmares about this course, but I'm here to tell you that the most challenging part about Intermediate is not the material but the people. Intermediate micro is filled with hardo sophomores who live to kill the curve because they think getting an A- means that they won't get hired by \"Bank X\" that they will probably regret working for 5 years down the road. It is filled with people who only take breaks from the lecture notes to peruse the BCG website and send networking emails. They always include their extracurricular positions in their signature too; very impressive! These people are the type who angulate their bodies in writhing pleasure when they receive a LinkedIn request from a consulting hiring manager. If you are reading this comment, you are probably one of these people, who have carefully calculated when you will take intermediate micro to better achieve your lifelong dream of working 16 hour days. To you, I say chill. Intermediate micro can actually be a good experience if you take it down a notch and just try to enjoy it.",
    "I would recommend this course. Odds are, you're taking it because you have to for a major, so this doesn't apply to you. However, I took it without having declared a major yet, and found it to be an interesting and worthwhile course on its own. It's pretty neat to understand the mathematics behind the graphs you draw in intro courses, and brings you a little bit closer to seeing what real work in economics might be like.",
    "If you have to take this for your major, I would recommend taking this course with Prof. Chalioti. Prof. Chalioti's passion for teaching made me excited to go to class. I am convinced this class would have been hell had it not been taught by her. She is kind and supportive. Class was always well-structured and instructions for the midterms and final were always clear and overall fair. However, the content is hard, and there is a lot of math involved. Also, problem sets can be overly long at times. I only recommend taking this if you absolutely have to.",
    "This class is not enjoyable at all. Only take it if you have to for your major.",
    "As a requirement, there could definitely be worse courses to take. I think it was interesting to a degree in that it showed some basic models of economics. Through these, I learned how human behavior could possibly be modeled, and how we could apply quantitative reasoning skills to learn more about our behavior.",
    "Yes - if you have to take intermediate micro, take it with Eva! She is really great at teaching what she needs to and also being a sweet and kind person who actually cares about her students. unlike some other micro classes on campus, content covered in class actually corresponded with psets and tests. it's a difficult class, in that there's a lot of material and very mathematically oriented, but not too difficult in that you can still understand what is going on and prepare effectively.",
    "If majoring in Economics.",
    "no. nothing more than a requirement. Badly taught.",
    "I mean, don't take this if you don't have to, but if you do have to, then take it with Professor Chalioti. She makes it not as bad as it could be.",
    "Yes. Absolutely take it. A good challenge, not too difficult.",
    "You're probably only going to take this if you are an econ major. It teaches you good skills that you need for the major. Not the most interesting class but important. Homeworks can be tough every week. Exams are fair.",
    "I couldn't really imagine another reason to take this class unless you need it for your major or plan on taking it Credit\/D. Otherwise, it is an unnecessarily difficult class.",
    "If you are one of three majors, you must take this course. I would suggest the course otherwise to anyone who wants to understand the math behind the intro micro concepts. Eva is a nice and forgiving teacher who wants everyone to do well.",
    "I'd recommend it if you're an econ major because then you have to take it. Otherwise I would not recommend it, the material is not intellectually stimulating and don't see it being very practical.",
    "No. Only take if you must.",
    "You should really only take this course if you need to. It's a huge amount of work with the weekly problem sets, which take about ten hours to do. I think the exams are very fair in that a lot of problems are taken directly off the problem sets. Professor Chalioti is also an outstanding teacher, so definitely take it with her if you can.",
    "I would not recommend this course to someone who does not need it for their major. If they want a understanding of microeconomics for themselves, the intro course should be sufficient. But, if one needs to take intermedicate micro, I say definitely take it with Prof. Chalioti. She is a really great professor who explains things as clearly as possible and does her best to help her students, especially in office hours (GO TO HER OFFICE HOURS).",
    "Nearly all the people in the class were taking it because it was required, so if you're in it, it's likely because you need it. That being said, people tend to hype it up as a class that is extremely difficult, but I found the course work to be both manageable and fair. Professor Chalioti is wonderful and super kindhearted, so I would definitely recommend taking it with her if you can!",
    "Yes! I wouldn't necessarily recommend it for fun, but if you have any interest in Econ it's probably an essential course to take. Also, it's not nearly as bad as everyone makes it out to be.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. Although the material can be challenging and the work load can be daunting at times, the reward of finishing this course and learning all of the material is worthwhile. The teaching staff is wonderful and always willing to help.",
    "I would only recommend this course to another student if they have to take it for a major requirement, because it is very challenging and dry. However, if you do have to take intermediate micro, I would highly recommend taking it with Prof Chalioti, because she is so caring and wants to help her students succeed.",
    "I wouldn't necessarily see the necessity in this course for a student not within the major, but if you have an interest in economics and math, this course definitely fulfills that desire.",
    "Course material isn't hugely interesting. But this is a waaay easier class than Microeconomic theory.[Not to say that it's an easy class, micro theory is just a killer]",
    "Yes, take it with Professor Chalioti.",
    "For most people taking the course, it's because it's a requirement for a major. Although t is definitely a dense, challenging course, one does come away with a much greater knowledge of economics.",
    "Eva is a cool prof, she's always willing to take extra time to help you. However, if you want to do well in 121, you have to put in effort to get those A's",
    "I would recommend this course to a student with strong foundation in mathematics and desire to learn the core microeconomic models. If you don't have either, do not take it!",
    "In short, NO. But as none take this class by choice, such a recommendation is irrelevant. Its a bad class simply put--difficult but without genuine intellectual challenge, and you don't come away with anything new after taking Intro Micro.",
    "As expected, this is one of those courses which if you have to take it for your major I am sorry but you have to take it. The best way to take this course is to learn how to optimize a profit function and then take this course.",
    "Take it with Eva if she teaches it again!",
    "Professor Chalioti is amazing!",
    "It is a requirement for economics major. I skipped intro (with AP) and came directly into this class. I recommend getting it out of the way as soon as possible because it does provide a lot of build up knowledge for the more interesting electives.",
    "If you have to take it, take it. You will survive. If not, probably not worth wasting time on.",
    "This is a great class! The first month seems very daunting and math heavy but as the course progresses it becomes much clearer and straightforward. If you liked intro micro you'll probably like this class too. The psets can be tedious and time consuming but the midterms are much more straightforward and fair, the final was hard though. Eva is a great professor and lecturer so I'd definitely recommend taking the class with her. All in all it's intermediate micro so it'll be hard and a lot of work but it's definitely not an impossible course. The curve is supposedly great, 40% A's, the next 45% gets Bs and the remaining 5% (including those who dropped the class after shopping period) get lower grades so odds are you'll be just fine :)",
    "Good course, well taught. You probably are considering it because you have to take it for your major and are deciding which semester to do. This is a good one.",
    "Yes",
    "Yes! Very well organized and I learned a ton.",
    "Only take this class if you have to, it is the hardest class in the economics major.",
    "I would recommend this course to",
    "Yes, if you are an econ major and have to, this is a great course",
    "Take this class if you wnat to understand why decisions are made the way they are in certain markets. There is a large amount of multivariable calculus, so it is a good idea to know some coming in (especially Lagrangian functions). The class is tough, but you come away from it feeling like you know more about why people make decisions the way that they do.",
    "I liked this course because the psets were a challenge and I really like doing Econ psets, but this course requires a lot of time, especially in the beginning. Be prepared to learn some multivariable calc at the beginning (they spend some time going over it, but it's used throughout the course so make sure you understand it thoroughly). Psets require a lot of time, but tests are fair and questions are just like those on psets. Would recommend if you like doing mathy Econ psets. Not a whole lot of new micro theory, mostly just adding math to what you learned in intro micro.",
    "I mean, most people don't take this class because they're interested in the material, they take it to fulfill a major requirement for Econ, Global, or EP&E. It's a course that requires a LOT of work. Psets would take me 4-5 hours, and this is having support from other students too. Section off entire days to prepare for exams. And try to get added onto study guides from other students, especially athletes. DO NOT take this course for fun (unless you're credit\/D'ing, at which point you're almost guaranteed to get credit).",
    "Take it if you are an Economics major and don't afraid! If you aren't an economics major, take another class more focused on econ and less focused on math.",
    "Do not take this class unless your major requires it",
    "I would recommend this course to any student who wishes to have a deeper mathematical understanding of economic decision making and optimization.",
    "It is a requirement for the Economics Major but I would still recommend it for the students who aren't pursuing it as well.",
    "take it if you need it, but also eva is a fine teacher. make sure to shop TA's!"
