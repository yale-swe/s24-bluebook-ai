    "If you're a singer, take this class even if you have no experience singing\/ listening to baroque opera. There's no other experience like this at yale where you get to work with professionals and leading scholars\/ musicians to put on a highly polished opera. The class is virtually no work (other than learning your music) until rehearsals start up after spring break, and it becomes hell about 2 weeks before the show, so make sure your finals schedule is reasonable..",
    "I would definitely recommend this class! I am not a music major and I'd never done opera before but it was still so much fun and I learned so much. When will you be able to be in amazing opera again in your life?",
    "The Yale Baroque Opera Project is a really wonderful experience, but it's a lot of work, especially at the second half of the semester. Make sure you plan your schedule with that in mind.",
    "DEFINITELY TAKE! Be aware that, despite students' beseeching for the timing to be changed, tech period falls just before finals, and is two weeks with rehearsals 5 or 6 hours per day. I put the workload is \"greater\" because of the time demands while you're trying to study for your other finals, there is essentially zero other work besides learning your music and staging (class even stops meeting regularly after the first few weeks).",
    "If you are a singer with any classical inclinations, you must absolutely take this class before you graduate. And even if you're not, you will learn a lot from it!"
