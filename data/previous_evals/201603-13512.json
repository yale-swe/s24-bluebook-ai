   "comments": [
    "Very informative. I feel like I have a good strong basis to now begin my career in infectious disease epidemiology.",
    "As a student with no background in infectious diseases, I took this class purely for fun and interest. I learned a lot! I love that it was structured by disease, and that we discussed current global interventions. The assignments were a little lengthy, but because there were only a few of them, I did not feel that they were excessive. The readings were also good and relevant.",
    "This course is a great overview to the epidemiology of different infectious diseases. However, I do wish that there was more disease pathogenesis included in the course.",
    "This course needs restructuring. None of the lectures were connected in any way. The grading was arbitrary and unfair.",
    "The class was fantastic. The exams were well made and portioned appropriately. It was a really great course that helped to develop a different way of analyzing complex public health problems.",
    "Overall, I enjoyed the class. I think that it did a good job of giving us an overview of multiple infectious diseases as well as insight into the various factors that can impact transmission of disease and resistance of bacteria. I would have preferred if we had taken the time to learn more about the biology of certain pathogens and if we had gone into more depth about some of the tests that can be used to identify them and the different serotypes, for example.",
    "I enjoyed this course, although I thought it was odd that we spent so much time covering STIs when there are so many other types of infectious diseases.",
    "Excellent. A great overview of major infectious diseases. It was the only one of my classes this semester where I walked out of every since class period being like \"wow I learned a lot today\"",
    "Strengths: I liked the range of topics we covered, and how we learned what the \"big issue\" with each of the pathogens we learned about was. Weaknesses: I would have enjoyed a little more consistency in the background of the pathogens, in terms of how much we would go into the epidemiology or biology. It felt like sometimes we went very molecular and other times not at all.",
    "This course is well-structured and very intuitive in describing the public health issues on microbial diseases. I wish this course could have more biological aspects of the microbes.",
    "Wonderful introductory course into infectious diseases. However, the course only briefly introduces complex biology concepts. For individuals who have not previously taken extensive courses in biology or microbiology, it may require some extra time and effort to understand and keep up with the material. However, despite my biology background I still found new and exciting material.",
    "The course is all over the place as far as where information is being pulled from. While the course aims to use cases, the way knowledge is being communicated is not consistent with homework and assessments. It is ineffective learning when students have to pull up all referenced articles (that are not listed as required reading) simply to answer questions on the homework. The instructors are also highly subjective with their delivery of academic material. The academic environment should be innovative and promote learning.",
    "At times it felt as if there was very little cohesiveness, but this might have to do more with the subject than with the course itself.",
    "Excellent course. Great material. Loved the case studies and outbreak investigations. Would also loved to have had more lectures integrating the material on different diseases. The one thing I felt concern about throughout the semester was the grading for the course. It didn't seem clear to me what sorts of errors would be penalized on the problem sets and how severely. As the semester went on I began putting more and more effort into the problem sets, eventually making my answers as comprehensive as possible. However, I found that this did not improve my grades at all, and I always got similar marks to those received by my classmates, regardless of whether one of us put a lot more time or effort into the assignment.",
    "This is a core EMD class, and as an EMD person, I was really interested in it. I thought the choice of which organisms were covered was a bit random, and I definitely preferred some lectures over others for that reason, but overall I liked the class. I thought the homework was generally useful and the tests were fair.",
    "I really liked the discussion opportunities to talk over the topics presented and would love to have more.",
    "This was my favorite course of the semester. The material was consistently interesting and Professor Pettigrew is an extremely engaging and knowledgeable lecturer. I wish she taught both semesters!",
    "Melinda is very knowledgable -- she makes the class material interesting and is clearly passionate about it!"

    "Instructor: Melinda Mary Pettigrew \u00a0Very clear and engaging in lecture, answers questions effectively",
    "Instructor: Melinda Mary Pettigrew \u00a0Dr. Pettigrew really knows her stuff and conveys her passion for the subject material very well!",
    "Instructor: Melinda Mary Pettigrew \u00a0Dr. Pettigrew is one of the greatest professors I've ever had. Her knowledge is quite vast and she is passionate about her work and the school. It was a pleasure to be in her class. I do wish the class would have been at a different time though - as engaging as Dr. Pettigrew is, having the class right after lunch makes you want to go to sleep.",
    "Instructor: Melinda Mary Pettigrew \u00a0Appears disinterested and unapproachable. Needs to be more sensitive to students, especially given her role as Associate Dean of Academic Affairs and Title IX coordinator. Sometimes is funny in a sarcastic way. She definitely has her favorites in the class.",
    "Instructor: Melinda Mary Pettigrew \u00a0While the material is challenging, and so much time has to be put in to do well in the class, it is worth it to take this class from someone who knows and cares about the material so much. The instructor was funny, knowledgeable, and always willing to answer student questions, even if they required additional research.",
    "Instructor: Melinda Mary Pettigrew \u00a0I think that the instructor did a good job of piquing my interest in the subject material and presenting it in an understandable way.",
    "Instructor: Melinda Mary Pettigrew \u00a0Very knowledgeable and approachable",
    "Instructor: Melinda Mary Pettigrew \u00a0Great at being engaging, at putting up with my various questions and at responding after class hours, via email or office hours.",
    "Instructor: Melinda Mary Pettigrew \u00a0Great lecturer, has a lot of insight, is well organized, and keeps the audience engaged. I like the way she presents information, with the learning objectives, and how she moves through the key points. However I felt thrown off every time there were slides with missing bullet points and we would have to scramble to write everything down",
    "Instructor: Melinda Mary Pettigrew \u00a0I loveeee Melinda!!! She is so great at explaining the key concepts! The class is well-taught by her! Maybe she can work on knowing the technology and how computer operates? (Just joking haha)",
    "Instructor: Melinda Mary Pettigrew \u00a0Professor Pettigrew is an amazing lecturer, by far one of the best professors I've encountered so far. She absolutely enjoys and loves to teach. She's always actively trying to engage students and encourages participation, as well as critical thinking.",
    "Instructor: Melinda Mary Pettigrew \u00a0Dr. Pettigrew was a wonderful instructor. Her excitement about certain diseases made me feel also excited. For the most part, she very clearly gave an overview of the diseases we studied and integrated both epidemiological aspects and real world examples. One critique I have is that the pace was quite fast. Students without biology backgrounds or students who may have not taken biology for some time may have trouble keeping up with what she is saying because they do not know\/do not remember the basics.",
    "Instructor: Melinda Mary Pettigrew \u00a0She is amazing! She is a wonderful professor who truly cares about her students.",
    "Instructor: Melinda Mary Pettigrew \u00a0Wonderful!",
    "Instructor: Melinda Mary Pettigrew \u00a0I thought Melinda was clear and approachable. She is a nice introduction to EMD faculty, and I thought that she made an effort to integrate the class, homework and tests. I was disappointed in lectures given by Jamie because it's really difficult to hear him and understand what is important.",
    "Instructor: Melinda Mary Pettigrew \u00a0She was my favorite instructor of the semester. She explained everything clearly and maintained a sense of humor about everything. While the material itself was interesting, she definitely elevated the class. I would like to take other courses from her in the future.",
    "Instructor: Melinda Mary Pettigrew \u00a0Great!",
    "Instructor: Melinda Mary Pettigrew \u00a0She was excellent, very detailed, very much enjoyed this course."

   "comments": [
    "Great if you are interested in EMD",
    "Even if you don't know anything about infectious diseases - take it! It's a great way to understand some basic concepts about diseases that continue to plague our world.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to other students as it is really interesting and addresses both the many issues surrounding infectious disease public health policies and the specific biological mechanisms. It is fascinating and insightful, while also helping to develop real world analytical skills for infection control and prevention.",
    "Fun course that touches on the basics of several different diseases and provides a framework for applying epi concepts to infectious disease issues. Would recommend.",
    "Excellent. A great overview of major infectious diseases. It was the only one of my classes this semester where I walked out of every since class period being like \"wow I learned a lot today\"",
    "yes",
    "I would definitely recommend this class, because it is such a wonderful class!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone who wants to understand infectious diseases along with the role public health plays in this area. Overall, a wonderful course taught by an amazing professor with a desire to shape future public health professionals and encourage an interest in infectious diseases.",
    "Disappointed in the course. Expected fundamental biological information and then go into the public health applications of the pathogens. This course has potential, but needs serious improvement with the curriculum.",
    "It is an interesting course, but I did feel that would benefit more from this class had I taken immunology prior.",
    "I think this is one of the best classes at YSPH. Lucky for all you EMD students, you have to take it! Prof. Pettigrew is excellent, cares deeply about her students, teaches in a clear and interactive manner, and makes sure to fully address all questions raised by the class. The content in the course is varied and interesting and ordered in a logical manner. You'll learn about a lot of different diseases, and you won't just skim the surface. This will entail a fair amount of work throughout the semester (and the grading on exams and homework is not easy) but you'll come away with a great understanding of the topics covered.",
    "This is a required EMD course, so most people in it will be EMD. It's a very broad overview of some pathogens. Some people complained that there was not enough molecular biology\/pathogenesis covered, but I didn't really mind. There are 5 homework assignments that are long, one midterm, and a final.",
    "This is a great intro to infectious diseases. I would definitely recommend it, even for those not in EMD or with less of a biology background.",
    "I would recommend it if you have any interest in infectious disease...it covers many different subjects and and you will learn so much"
