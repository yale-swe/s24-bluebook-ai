    "everything was great. logistically, provided enough knowledge and resources to learn how to make a qualitative research I liked guests who came to share their experience. atmosphere was always friendly. I liked everything",
    "This course was an amazing learning experience. I had the chance to take a research project from beginning to end and to learn about all of the components of qualitative research. I really appreciated that Danya broke the research process down into parts to make such a large project manageable, and I felt accomplished at the end of the semester.",
    "This is a very practical course with an excellent instructor. Perfect for students who want to do qualitative research projects for their summer internships. It was fun! Just make sure to pick a good group as the whole class is group-based assignments.",
    "High workload. A lot of group assignments. Friday afternoon class schedule is not welcomed.",
    "I really enjoyed this class. I was a nice break from the quantitative coursework and very enlightening to the core purpose and rationale behind qualitative research in the social science\/public health arena. It definitely helped prepare me for my summer internship project and provided me with a lot of skills that I hope to perfect as time goes on. As for improvements, I found the section on coding to be somewhat confusing--I am not sure how it could be better taught but more examples might be useful. I also think that having interviews completed prior to spring break and the assignment linked to them due right after spring break was highly stressful and not conducive to an enjoyable spring break or well produced product. The timeline could have been shifted to move the actual interviews closer to the PO so that the coding for both of those happens closer together and prior to spring break. Just a thought.",
    "Great course. One of the best courses I took this semester. I learned a lot of tangible skills that I can apply to my research in the future. The class structure was very well organized and class time was spent efficiently.",
    "This course integrated conceptual learning with practice and implementation incredibly well. I was able to learn through doing and through studying and found that to be very conducive to my understanding of qualitative research.",
    "In a seminar this size, I don't usually find the small group activities super useful. Would rather just discuss as a class. Otherwise I felt the format worked well. Personally I would have liked the course to be a little more challenging in terms of quality of output, but the feedback we got was still useful and I still learned a lot.",
    "This course is an excellent introduction to qualitative research. I felt well prepared for future qualitative research after taking this course.",
    "Quite a great course but the timing for some assignments were quite annoying as it did not leave you enough time to learn it all."

    "I would recommend the course is about how to conduct a qualitative research from the beging till the end.",
    "This course is a great opportunity to take ownership over a project and to learn A LOT about qualitative research in the process. Take it if you have any interest in learning about this kind of research, especially if you would love to do original qualitative research on a topic over the course of the semester. Classes were well-organized, guest lectures were interesting, and all of the assignments helped build to a final paper and presentation.",
    "A good course to learn qualitative research method.",
    "Really comprehensive course for those who are interested in qualitative research in Public Health",
    "This course involved a significant amount of group work. You work to development of a qualitative research tool set including semi-structured interview question development\/administration, participant observation, and coding\/thematic analysis, all using grounded theory. If you are interested in these types of skills, I highly recommend it! Also be prepared to be learn about a very different approach and mindset to research.",
    "Great course. I HIGHLY recommend it to students who are interested in conducting qualitative research.",
    "Choose your group wisely. You spend a lot of time working with them and that can make or break your experience.",

    "Great way to learn or practice qualitative methods as they are used in public health. Not as much work as it appears from the syllabus, and you can pick a topic you're interested in.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to other students, unless they have no interest in conducting qualitative research.",
    "Yes because quite helpful and great practice for the summer."
