    "Definitely take it. Professor Cleaver was outstanding.",
    "Take anything with Cleaver.",
    "This class was amazing. You learn so much about black history and the black panther party. It will really shock you!! I suggest this class to everyone. You learn that you really did not know as much about black history as you thought, and it goes beyond the obvious facets of black history and uncovers that truth that even the government tries to hide",
    "If it's with Kathleen Cleaver, you MUST take it. Undersubscribed my semester, for a brilliant teacher who was a former Black Panther leader. I'm a potential AfAm major, but I think most anyone can get something out of this.",
    "A really good course on the prominent female leaders of the black freedom movement. The readings are really interesting and easy to read. The conversation is great if people have done the reading. The work load is about the same as any other seminar.",
    "Take it.",
    "really good, chill class, especially if you;re interested in the subject material."
