    "Yes, I would recommend it to students interested in 19th century American history and art history",
    "A great course for those specializing in American art and for those who want to be exposed to the field",
    "This course provides an excellent opportunity to consider landscape painting from a range of perspectives and to discuss these perspectives with fellow students. It is not the ideal class to gain extensive knowledge of historical development of landscape painting over the course of the nineteenth century but it allows a more open-ended forum for exploration of the issues at stake."

   "comments": [
    "The ideas and methods we were exposed to were helpful and I will be drawing on them in the future.",
    "important syllabus for me to have read",
    "I felt like I gained good knowledge of the historiography of the subject, which is helpful for my dissertation and for my knowledge of the discipline.",
    "The course provided a concise and focused survey of the most important scholarly voices on the subject, as well as a means of reading the scholarly literature critically. It was thus an excellent way of examining the trajectory of the discipline and its current concerns and vexations. Moreover, the class and final project were structured to help us develop critical methods of close reading and close looking. These skills, and the critical position we developed on the historiography of landscape painting, will serve me very well as I develop my research on this period."
