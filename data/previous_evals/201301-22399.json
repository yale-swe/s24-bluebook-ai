    "Witchcraft in Colonial America is a great course for people who really enjoy learning about themes and contexts, rather than simply memorizing dates. I'm not a history person because I don't memorize dates well, but the limited time period and the broader themes allowed me to like history once again! Tannenbaum is knowledgeable and engaging. Definitely take this class - there's a lot of reading but the discussions are usually pretty good, although the 2 hours seems to be a bit long at times.",
    "I would recommend this I loved this course!",
    "Interesting discussion and good books. Start writing early and show her drafts",
    "I would recommend the class only if the class is large enough to offer a range of opinions and perspectives. Our class only had 7 people in and therefore often our discussions were repetitive or tended towards awkward pauses. Other than that, the material was great!"
