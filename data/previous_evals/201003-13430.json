   "comments": [
    "there is minimal reading and the midterm and 2 assignments arent that bad. the final paper is a group paper and not that bad either",
    "take it",
    "Good class that's not too econ intensive.",
    "Great econ class because it does not follow the standard format of weekly problem sets, section, final, etc. Professor Jaynes is a very likable person, and I enjoyed going to his lectures.",
    "If you're interested in why poverty exists, how we measure it, and how we've tried (and failed) as a country to erase it, take it. You'll get to explore political questions as they relate to their macroeconomic implications, pick up some new knowledge along the way, and meet a really interesting professor with great stories to tell.",
    "I would recommend this course for someone looking for an easier fifth class who has an interest in poverty. I think it's lessons can be learned independently of class just through readings, so I wouldn't necessarily take it if you are pressed for fitting classes into your schedule",
    "Take this course.",
    "In its current iteration, Economics 280 is a waste of a course. There are other courses that will teach you more material more effectively. If you don\u0092t want to be learning, why pay for a Yale education?",
    "Poverty and postindustrial capitalism focused on the story of American social change in the past fifty years or so. The topic was covered from many fronts, and I feel that you end up with a broad idea of what happened. Professor Jaynes has a lot to say about the topic (including some interesting stories). The assignments and tests were fair.",
    "Yes! If you need a fairly laid back economics course where you can learn the theory without too much math, this is the course for you! The workload is not very difficult; a midterm and a group final paper. Everything was graded fairly. This year, I thought the course was great because it had a relatively few number of students in it. I am sure it will be great in following years.",
    "ECON 280\/AFAM 282 was an excellent introduction to poverty and poverty policy in the United States. Professor Jaynes is a knowledgeable and dynamic professor, and the format of his class is relatively straightforward (he puts lecture notes online before every class and then discusses the lecture notes during class-time), and the information, for the mostpart, is interesting. By the end, it did get slightly repetitive, and there was relatively little discussion during class, but overall it's a good, a little easier, econ credit.",
    "Yes, this is a relaxed course that deals with a very pertinent topic in poverty.",
    "For the first time in my Yale career I have to say that I would not recommend this course. There was just too little information covered for it to be worthwhile. Professor Jaynes is a very interesting man, and I would suggest speaking to him outside of class, but cannot recommend you take his course.",
    "I would recommend it to anyone. I would especially recommend it to any econ major that wanted to see the practical applications and interpretation of economics"
