    "I recommend this class because it's awesome, but with several points that need to be addressed before.1. This class is based off of Peter Eisenman's studio, so read up on his teachings of building analysis if you want to have any clue what is going on.2. Emmanuel, while a great guy, spends minimal time on this class. Aside from four lectures that are an hour long, he basically just shows up to class without any work done. He is slow to answer his email, though you really should talk to him before you start any model. Don't waste any time in contacting him.3. I did not pull an all-nighter. In fact, I never went to sleep past 1 am this semester. Start in advance, don't waste too much time, work on weekend days, and you'll have no reason (and no excuse) to pull all-nighters. The amount of work is totally overhyped in this class. There are four models (and three\/four sketch models that are the week before each model, giving Emmanuel and TAs a sense of your project), but there were spans of weeks when we just had no work. The work concentrates on the weeks when there are models due (obviously).4. Like other reviews say, stop, breathe, and look around and see how amazing this class is and the program in general is. I never thought I could speak with some cogency about buildings in an analytic way. Just as we analyze literature, we analyze buildings, though there is more to it than just analysis--there is art-- and that is an amazing thing.5. Don't rely on the TAs. They don't know what's going on, though they can give you modeling and diagramming tips. Go to Emmanuel if you ever feel overwhelmed or paralyzingly confused. He often doesn't know the answer, but we had really productive sessions also.I encourage you to ask questions when Emmanuel asks the class if there are any questions. Ask him: why are we doing this? what use is there in this form of analysis? He is a very smart, very interesting guy, and he can really tell you a lot about architecture.Also--know that this is one way of practicing architecture--get a little brainwashed, but not too much. There are many schools of thought, and while this one is \"useful\", don't get too wrapped up in it.Make a list of funny things Emmanuel says, and I guess the smart things too. Have fun!",
    "I would not recommend this course unless you have to take it for the major",
    "You have to take this so listen tomy advice. It wasn't as bad as you think it is supposed to be. If you like making dainty, exact models, use computers and laser cutters and you'll get good at it eventually. If you want to have fun, use wood and eyeball things because NO ONE CAN TELL if your model is wrong because you are the only one who knows what the building should look like at that scale, within reason. All you have to do is make good looking stuff and it won't matter what you wanted to say about it. Usually what you have to say about it sounds dumb and you'll regret what you said as soon as they point at your model and ask where \"___thing you claimed about it___\" is shown on the model and you won't have an answer for that because what you said was BS. So make your model first and THEN think about what you did.",
    "It'll give you a new way of thinking, analyzing and making",
    "This is an incredible class and it opened my eyes to so many new ways of thinking about architecture. It's much more work intensive than Drawing Architecture, and the critiques can get really harsh. There's no reason why anyone should take this unless they're ready to breathe architecture 24\/7. It takes so much time to make the models, but the process of working with your hands is actually pretty therapeutic.",
    "This class should come with a footnote that reads: \"Get ready to sacrifice your sleep, eating hours, and even sanity at times. If you survive, you'll come out a whole new person, knowing far more about yourself and your classmates than you everthought possible. Pulling an all-nighter will become a habit, and the most, MOST important thing is to understand that all criticism is addressed at your work at that moment in time, and not at you as a person. As long as you don't take things personally, you'll be able to take criticism well and grow from the experience. Good luck!\"",
    "It's a lot of work. Take it if you're an architecture major, don't if you're not. Be prepared for tons of work and kind of little to show for at the end. You'll be proud, but maybe not impressed with yourself. Get ready for a semester of constant stress and exhaustion. Run away.",
    "It's an introduction to the formal analysis type of architectural thinking. Take it if you plan on majoring in architecture. You will probably have to do one all nighter a week\/ every two weeks but you get to know everyone pretty well.I would talk to the TA's a lot and learn rhino\/ laser cutter early because they are both a life saver.",
    "I would absolutely however it takes an incredible amount of time to finish anything in this class. Do it if you want to learn a new mode of thought and analysis. It will advance your overall critical theory.",
    "If you like making things with your hands, thinking and generating analyses in 3D, and can become obsessed with a project enough to not mind devoting an amount of time (and money and energy) that would be unresonable for any other class to its completion, then this class is your jam.",
    "This class is a little slow at first but picks up significantly after spring break. Although it is alot of time consuming work, the work is often enjoyable. The projects can get expensive too. I would though recommend this class to anyone with an interest in the architecture major. It is a very stimulating course, and you will learn alot.",
    "Mandatory. However, it can be fun if you stay positive. If you get a boring architect, you're going to have at least 5 times the workload and worse critiques than other people. Emmanuel can be scary, but he is really helpful and nice if you meet with him one-on-one.",
    "This course will completely change your understanding of architecture in every way you can imagine. You're forced to see more and more until you don't think there's anything left to see. And that's the moment when you realize that you're just beginning to see for the first time.The course is a HUGE time commitment, but that commitment certainly pays off. The more you work in this course, the more you learn.The course's strength is also its weakness. It drops you headfirst into into the field of analytic architecture. And it does so from a very particular point of view. The course is called \"Analytic\" model because it is highly theoretical. While this perspective may seem stubborn and even a bit close-minded at first, you will soon realize its merit and be very glad you were forced to work this way.The one real weakness is the way the critiques are run. The whole class just sits there while the Professor and TAs give an individual critique to every student. While there is certainly something to be learned from this, I don't think it is the most effective use of the 3 hour class time.Overall, clearly the best course I have taken at Yale. But not for the faint of heart. And certainly not for non-architecture majors. If you are an architecture major, this is the beginning of your real education.",
    "Emmanuel is fantastic. At the beginning of the semester, everyone found him very intimidating (probably the French accent) but he's very nice and really passionate about architecture. MAKE AN EFFORT TO GET TO KNOW HIM. I highly recommend going to see him before beginning construction on each model. He can clarify the assignment and give you specific ideas, which he's unable to do during class reviews."
