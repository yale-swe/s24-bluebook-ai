   "comments": [
    "Absolutely! You will learn so much about real-world economics, not simply formulas in a textbook.",
    "Definitely take it over the lecture.",
    "It's not a super fun class but her humor makes it more interesting. It's a required class and if you're not a lecture person (ray fair is horrible according to many) then this class isn't too bad.",
    "Good but hard class. You'll have to deal with the competitive set, and be prepared to study for the class. I would recommend it if you want to do economics and are interested in banking, finance, and the math behind the economy. If any of these trouble you, I would not take it, because that is a lot of what she teaches. If you're deciding between this and Ray Fair, or anyone else, I'd probably go with her though. She's a great teacher. Cool accent too.",
    "Curve is kinda tough, but if you put the time into it the class isn't bad.",
    "If you're interested in economics and like the smaller setting, take this class. It's more difficult than the lecture, but it's worth it.",
    "I would caution people against taking this course. The final was surprisingly difficult, and the lectures were not well-explained. The course is also strictly curved. I thought I wanted to major in economics - this course singlehandedly made me change my mind. Take the fall macro lecture instead, because I've heard it's much better.",
    "I found Econ111 considerably more difficult than micro (though I took the lecture). Sigga is very fun and engaging, and knows the subject very well. She can go through topics a bit quickly (make sure to read the text book to get the basics of topics she covers) and her exams are difficult, and very unlike the problem sets.",
    "great class if you want to be an economics major, if not don't!",
    "If you are interested in pursuing and econ major and want to go in depth on macroeconomics, take the seminar... if you are just using it to fulfill a requirement for another major, I would recommend the lecture.",
    "Econ 111 introduces you to some basic macroeconomic ideas and models.Taking the class allows you to better understand discussions of exchange rates, inflation, monetary supply, interest rates, unemployment, and stimulus packages. It seems to be important information to know.Sigga is a good teacher and presents the lessons well. However, the \"seminar\" is basically 30 lecture. While not a particularly exciting class it is an important one. It generally seems that students like the seminar better than the lecture, but the seminar does cover some different and more difficult material. Additionally, it is worth noting that a number of students in the class had taken econ in high school. I would recommend the class for someone interested in the material and who prefers small classes to larger ones.",
    "I would recommend this class because you get a seminar context in which to learn macro economics. However, I've heard the lecture is also a good class and Sigga can be hard to understand.",
    "Yes- because it's a fun class and Sigga is a fun teacher. But no if you are overly concerned about getting an A.",
    "It's a great class to take, but expect it to be difficult. Problem sets every week, two midterms, and a final. The exams are not easy, but luckily she curves it pretty well. If you want to be an economics major, it's probably better than the lecture, but I wouldn't take this unless I were really interested in economics. Otherwise, Sigga can get you very confused very fast.",
    "shop the lecture first then decide",
    "I would recommend this class to other students. Sigga is a great professor and explains well. Students will learn a lot in this class but it is difficult and requires constant work.",
    "ECON 111 is hardly ideal, the course is a bit muddled and the typical class involves reading off slides. However, Professor Sigga is probably your best bet when it comes to picking a section.",
    "I would take the seminar instead of the lecture. While the tests were hard and it was definitely alot of work, you will learn the material better.",
    "It is a great intro course, if you're interested in Economics.",
    "I took Intro Micro fall semester, and while this was significantly harder -- a lot more material, with more complex topics -- the workload was almost identical (weekly problem sets, very manageable, plus exams), and I found lectures and readings more engaging. Sigga is a lot of fun, and a great lecturer -- sometimes she moves through the material a little too quickly, but she always posts her slides online before class and gives students the opportunity to slow her down and ask questions, so lectures are pretty low-stress. A word of caution: exams (two midterms and a final) are HARD, so be prepared to study a lot when the time comes. Also, a word of advice: USE THE TEXTBOOK. It helps, even if only as a means of reviewing material at exam time. All in all, a great class -- if you're considering Intro Macro, I highly recommend Sigga's seminar.",
    "I recommend this to anyone with an interest in a rigorous introduction to macro. It is informative and engaging, but very difficult. The curve is quite steep, and the tests are full of curveballs - don't expect to be able to secure a good grade with just a basic grasp of the material and an understanding of the problem sets."
