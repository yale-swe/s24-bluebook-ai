   "comments": [
    "It's an okay survey course, but there's no time to go in depth on any of the topics, so you end up taking a cursory glace at a bunch of topics, which is a bit annoying because it's not much more in depth than if you just read the newspaper every so often.",
    "Take it to get a broad overview of current issues in education, but don't expect to have the class focus on any one topic for longer than one or two classes. You'll get a lot out of it if you invest yourself in the discussions with classmates.",
    "I would recommend this course to a fellow student, especially if he\/she has no background in education. It's a great survey course, so that you can become familiar with the basics. I would also be wary...it is not a gut. The grading was pretty harsh in my opinion for a survey course doing essentially entry level work, so make sure you're prepared for that. Course work is manageable. There are readings and 3 papers over the course of the term.",
    "It is a really broad overview of anything having to do with education studies. You'll leave knowing a lot more than you did at the beginning of the semester, but also knowing that there's still a ton you don't know because of the overview nature.",
    "A good survey into the issues in American education today. Not especially compelling or boring; I felt I knew a lot of the material but also picked up some new perspectives. I think the class would really be better as a smaller group, or perhaps with two sections. The grading was done by rubric, which was helpful in pointing out what things I could do better, and had a really high standard.",
    "If you are truly interested in education reform in any way, shape, or form, take this course. If you want to learn more about how education reform has shaped your own city, state, or country, take this course.",
    "Take it if you have no background in ed studies and want a general overview or really need it to get into higher level ed studies classes. How much you get out of the class will depend in part in how much you already know about education. If you can get into other ed studies classes without taking the course, than go ahead and do so because you most likely already have background in the material.",
    "YES TAKE IT. It is everything you want it to be. Do it.",
    "EDST is a basic introduction to the American public education system. I would not recommend it as it is, unless you actually have never learned anything about public education (which would be rare -- I assume people who are interested in education know something about it). It is very, very basic, and I found myself bored often by the simplicity and lack of depth we went into the material. It felt like a high school class -- we show up, have our attendance taken, listen to a basic lecture, and sometimes break into 5-minute discussions to talk vaguely about subjects that we don't actually know that much about... I don't know. I was disappointed.",
    "This class has the potential to be a lot better than it is. Hopefully they'll modify things as they go along because it was pretty dry for the most part, although the evaluations are straightforward papers and they're graded pretty leniently, but it's definitely worth giving it a second thought if you're not the kind of person that likes to get up early (if it's still a 9am class when you take it). I want to teach after college and potentially as a long-term profession, and I found that I wasn't interested in this class very much because we focused mainly on education in the US and it was all a little history-based and kind of dry. It would work a lot better if it was a seminar, because the material is very general and broad and I didn't really feel like I learned much. Then again I'm sure if you're really invested in the class and put a lot of effort into it you'll probably learn a good amount, but it's not the most engaging\/inspiring class. If I had to do it over I would have shopped around more for other classes, I don't regret taking it but it wasn't the best use of my time.",
    "I would recommend EDST 110 only if you are truly interested in education",
    "Fantastic syllabus, very interesting readings, and extremely invested professor. However, this class does not function well as a lecture. In order to have effective class discussions about the readings and assignments (which are a huge component of the class), you cannot be in a sea of 80 students. The class time was a waste, but the assigned work and reading was very enlightening.",
    "If you're very interested in education and want to be a teacher, this is a good class.",
    "Pretty general overview of educational studies, focusing on race and policy\/research in particular. Grading can be tough at times but readings are interesting. The assignments themselves are interesting - a policy memo, reflection on a New Haven classroom, insight into your own educational experience, and a final project of your choice.",
    "Survey course meant to introduce students to common themes and issues in the education sphere. Would be beneficial for any student to take, regardless of prior experience in the field. It was an amazing class, and I'm so, so happy that Yale is beginning to expand upon its education-related course offerings again (all thanks to Professor Carroll!). Carroll is a sweetheart and really interested in students' success and their exploration of the topic. Would definitely recommend.",
    "This is a very broad introduction to education. If you know much about education already, this material will be repetitive and boring.",
    "Ed Studies is a roller coaster ride in terms of how much you'll like it. You will LOVE it at the beginning because the readings are incredible (especially for people who want to be teachers or work with kids). In the middle, you'll kind of just be asking yourself what the point is. Policymaking, policy memos, collective bargaining... etc. All the stuff that kind of gets lost in the mix. The end is cool but work-intensive and you'll ask yourself why you enrolled in the course if it was going to be so much work. It's not exactly as straightforward as you think it will be, and the policy memo, poster presentation, and final paper will all be harder than you think. I recommend taking this Cr\/D, and only if you're actually interested in Education.",
    "Definitely take this class if you have any interest in education reform.",
    "The course is very ambitious in the amount of material it tries to cover, and as a result, ends up covering things in a deeply unsatisfying way. The professor uses a discussion based format which is absolutely not successful in a lecture with 100+ students, and was really frustrating to be a part of. The course is also taught like a high school course, which is why many of the freshmen enjoyed it and many older students felt like it was extremely elementary with elementary assignments (you have to do a trifold poster project\/presentation). I would only take this class if you have to (I had to for the Ed Studies scholars program), or if you know absolutely nothing about anything having to do with education and are really, really curious to learn.",
    "Definitely would recommend. It is interesting if you are interested in going in to education or working with youth in any capacity. I wish I couldve kept up on the readings more but tuesday and thursday nine am is lowkey brutal. Its an interesting class and the papers are cool! should be a WR credit -",
    "I think it's a good introduction to many things I did not previously know about education, and I would recommend it. Just, you know, speak up in class.",
    "Unless the professor alters the courses after spring 2014, you don't usually need to go to class to do well. The workload is light and the readings are the main source of the knowledge you'll gain from taking the course. Sometimes the lectures are interesting but don't dive very deep into the subject.",
    "The readings are quite long and there was very little info and help offered for the papers.",
    "A decent introduction to education studies. Gives you a good grasp of many topics that are important for understanding education. Perhaps not an amazing experience to take this class, but it gives you some great tools for studying education in the future.",
    "Yes and no. This class is a survey course of major issues in American public education (Common Core, Teacher's Unions, Charter Schools, etc.). There are 3 short papers and one long \"research\" paper (although it's unclear what we were supposed to be researching), paired with a poster project. This class has the potential to be awesome because the syllabus, paper topics and readings are very interesting. However, Lizzy Carroll is not a very engaging teacher and can't really control the flow of a large class. For this reason this class needs to be capped. Or a seminar. Which is sad because it's a really important\/interesting topic.",
    "As a topic, this course is so important. Unfortunately, the execution was sub-par. Prof. Carroll is very receptive to feedback, so definitely shop it to see what she has incorporated from past semesters' feedback, and hopefully she will be able to make this course better.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student planning on applying for or completing the Education Studies Scholars program. This course is a good general introduction, and provides necessary background for the program, and it makes sure everyone is on the same page for the remaining semesters.",
    "EDST 110 is a survey course that is a good introduction to the American elementary and secondary school system and current issues facing American education. The topics covered are good and you'll come out of the class with some basic knowledge that will make you think more about the state of American schools. However, the purpose and formats of the assignments are somewhat arbitrary, the lectures can be boring, and in-class discussion can be difficult for such a large class. The class still has a lot of kinks that need to be worked out, but if you want your mind to opened concerning education or want to be an Ed Studies Scholar, then you should take the class.",
    "I would recommend it as a first education class, assuming it is a smaller lecture in future iterations\/includes a section.",
    "It's a good introduction to the issues in education if you are completely new to the field. It helps expand your understanding of education even if you've had prior experience. 9am classes are tough, be prepared to wake up.",
    "Review of research, policy, and practice in American education. People either love or hate the professor's style. I personally loved it, and I think most of the class would agree. Lots of small-group discussions.",
    "Kind of boring and disorganized. But interesting material that deserves attention.",
    "Four papers. Not necessary to do the readings. In fact, I'm sure some people only showed up for the first two weeks of class and still rocked the papers. Solid fifth class.",
    "I would recommend this course if you'd like to gain a comprehensive albeit shallow understanding of the important issues in education.",
    "A lecture that acts like a seminar class; a great introduction to education in the U.S. with a brief segment on education internationally. Would recommend to anyone interested in learning about education.",
    "Foundations in Education Studies is a great course for students interested in pursuing Education. It provides a great introduction and overview to the challenges of our education system. The work is fairly light; there were four papers, and readings for every class.",
    "An underwhelming class. Wouldn't have taken it if I wasn't extremely interested in education. Definitely has a lot of potential, and I think it will evolve as Professor Carroll finds her comfort zone--it is her first year teaching the class, after all. But unless it has substantially improved since I took it or you are very interested in the field, I would hold off. I understand that this was a survey course, however, even so, far too many topics were covered for any of them to be addressed in any depth. We covered educational philosophy, history of education in America, current policy debates in education, inequality in education--each of which could be (and should be) its own semester-long course. As it is, you end up literally scraping the surface of many topics without getting into any meaningful depth so as to be very intellectually unsatisfying, even for a survey course. Because of this problem, few people are really engaged and there is little incentive to do the reading (why read a 20-page document when it will only be touched on for about 10 minutes in lecture and go on to be irrelevant after that?), and what could be a really interesting and relevant class ends up being really gutty. The grading is also very frustrating. You can end up sabotaging your grade over really arbitrary things. And it was nuts that the 1000-word policy paper was worth more towards our final grade (25%) than our 12-15-page final paper (20%). I think Professor Carroll is really smart and passionate and the class has the potential to improve. I also heard that when it was smaller (Fall 2013) it was much better than when I took it (spring 2014). I am confident that a) as professor carroll develops or b) if the class returns to its original size, it would get better. My recommendation, if you are thinking about taking it, is to wait until 2015-16 until the kinks have been worked out.",
    "Don't take it unless you have to. Bad professor and annoying classmates.",
    "The class touches on interesting topics but fails to present them in an engaging way. While the class could be a great seminar, it did not work well as a lecture. The work of the class is minimal and interesting for students interested in learning about research, policy and contemporary events related to eduction. That said, the class is an overview and does not delve deeply into any of the topics.",
    "EDST 110 is a survey course on education. I would recommend this course to another student if you are wanting to think about education and the intersection of policy, practice, and research.",
    "The class is a bit boring and basic but take it if you are interested in education. It definitely gave me enough background on topics to hold interesting conversations. Plus, it'll expose you to things that you might want to research on your own in the future. There are a couple of writing assignments and a participation grade but prof Carroll is pretty good at getting everyone involved so don't worry too much about that.",
    "I thought it was a really good introduction into the program and to teaching in general. If you have an interest in education, take it.",
    "It's a good- probably a necessary- class if you're considering pursuing education. The material can get dull or even frustrating, because there are SO many problems in our education system and you'll become very well-versed in them. You get out what you put in-- it's very easy to get by without doing the reading, and there are only 4 fairly short papers. Also Professor Carroll is wonderful.",
    "Eh, if you're really interested in education and don't have much of a background in it then yes",
    "EDST 110 was a survey course in public education in the US. It was supposed to explore the nexus between practice, policy, and research, and focused especially on policy. The course was made up of weekly lectures (9:00 am yikes), a few low-stress but interesting papers throughout the semester, and a 10-15 page final paper that was very open and encouraged students to explore a topic of special interest. Overall the course was useful in that it exposed me to very relevant issues in American public education such as the charter vs. traditional school debate, teacher's unions, and teacher preparation for example. However, on a day to day basis, the course was quite uninspiring and lectures were dry. There are probably much more engaging courses that explore education at Yale.",
    "You cover a great range of topics, and meeting with Lizzy for office hours is certainly the way to take this class. She's really incredible, and really wants to make this class as good as possible, and is therefore very much open to any suggestions you might have about how the class is running. Lectures are not the most stimulating - but the readings are very interesting and I think you get a lot out of those.",
    "I would recommend taking EDST 110 as a broad introduction to the field of education. If you are someone interested in becoming a teacher or just understanding more about the current issues in education, it's definitely worth it. Professor Carroll has some pretty cool events, a panel discussion towards the end of the semester and various guest lectures as well (one by a TF) that I felt added to the course. Outside of EDST 110, Professor Carroll runs interesting panels\/discussions focused on various facets of education studies as well and I would recommend attending some of those because it helps give a deeper understanding of some of the content covered in class. While I did not feel that it necessarily changed my views on education, the course introduced me to topics I had never really thought about before. 3 writing assignments and one final paper.",
    "This course was an absolute disaster and a waste of a Yale credit. Remedial-level work, and absolutely no meaningful input from either the instructor or the TAs. The reading was perfectly fine, though it was thematically scattered and never particularly stimulating, but even at the syllabus's best and most interesting moments, Professor Carroll seemed unable to add anything thoughtful in her lectures, making them a frustrating waste of time. I'd very much like to see Education Studies revived at Yale, and am frankly insulted by the thoughtlessness with which this course was designed and executed.",
    "Definitely an introductory level course, with very basic\/common sense material. At the same time, definitely worth taking, since it's such an interesting and important topic.",
    "Education Studies is a budding field at Yale, and still has a long way to go in developing\u2014 this class especially. If you care about education though, this is a good class to take\u2014 not just for the class itself, but for the opportunities it opens up\u2014 to get to know Lizzy, to start learning about the New Haven Schools, and to be part of the ed studies discussion at Yale.",
    "Yes, I would most definitely recommend this class. This is a great introduction to the broad field of K-12 education in the United States. It is not a focus on how to actually be a teacher, but instead on what the teaching practice is like and what challenges professionals in the field face. I would definitely recommend this course to a broad variety of students, since this is not necessarily a class for \"would be teachers\" but instead \"would be education policy makers\".",
    "PROs: - If you want to learn about education, this is the only intro class on campus - It's not just a boring intro lecture class. Lizzy takes great efforts to vary instructional styles, assignments, etc. She shows movies and brings in local teachers' union reps, etc. - It's not actually that hard to get an A. CONs: - Sometimes, the class can come off as infantilizing. In the beginning, we had to take attendance. She had us make a poster at one point to present our term paper. We often had to \"turn and share our opinions with a neighbor.\" It's clear she taught in K-12 for years before Yale."
