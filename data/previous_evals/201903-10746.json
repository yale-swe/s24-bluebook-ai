    "I learned more Chinese characters and grammar structures, as well as learned more about Chinese culture and contemporary Chinese societal topics.",
    "Learned more Chinese. Talked about more interesting topics in Chinese culture and society like AIDS, systematic gender inequality, and immigration",
    "I learned a much more formal branch of Chinese that was very different from my prior education in the language. I also felt more immersed in Chinese culture through watching films and participating in activities that were related to both traditional and contemporary culture.",
    "Much more technical and formal terms and expressions, definitely level up from the previous chinese",
    "This class mostly focused on grammar and speaking skills. It was also conducive to enhancing listening and writing skills, as many assignments required both listening and written response portion.",
    "It's an amazing class"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This course really hammers in an understanding of grammar patterns. However, I wish there was more time in class to allow students to practice their speaking skills. It's also difficult to retain all the many vocabulary words we learn in such a short period of time, and perhaps speaking activities in class would allow us to use the vocabulary and retain it better.",
    "Strengths: meets 3 times a week, Wang Laoshi is a savage queen, really interesting conversations Weaknesses: a lot of unnecessary grammar and vocab crammed in, wouldve preferred to take our time and delve more deeply into a few subjects rather than lightly touching on a broad scope and expecting us to remember them, ALSO THE EXAMS OMG WERE SO HARD WHAT!!! The final was so difficult and had so many words Id never seen before and made reading even w context really hard",
    "Some of the strengths include: an amazing instructor who cared about all of the students and our learning, the intimate size and structure of the class that allowed for participation and engagement, and the amount of out-of-class resources we could tap into. One weakness of the class I would like to point out is the limited amount of time we have per week to attend class.",
    "Classroom environment could have been better to practice more speaking",
    "I feel that the grammar could be taught with more emphasis in lecture time, many of the patterns weren't necessarily drilled so you have to learn outside of class for the structures. Besides that, everything else in the course is great, I really appreciated having a conversational lecture in a small group it was helpful for improving my Chinese skills.",
    "It's biggest weakness is that it does not emphasize colloquial speech as much.",
    "The online assignment deadlines were inconsistent, and I couldn't understand why some assignments were due at midnight and some were due at 9:30 am. I would often plan on doing Chinese assignments in the early morning, but sometimes I would be forced to submit assignments in the evening when I was very tired in order to turn it in on time."

    "YES! SO GOOD! LEARNED SO MUCH 3",

    "Yes, if you want to continue your Chinese path or need to fulfill your language req. if youre unsure about whether or not u should continue after fulfilling your req, try it out and if u dont like the paving definitely dont try to force yourself through it.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student who has already taken Chinese courses in the past and wants to expand their formal vocabulary and grammar structures.",
    "Yes! This is different than other Chinese courses because we learn more advanced vocabulary than more dialogue-based words in the past.",
    "Yes",
    "yes, but it is a lot of work"
