   "comments": [
    "A mathematical\/computational approach to biology. Came in as a physics major without biology experience interested in learning how living things compute. This is definitely a class where it is possible to learn such things, to rigorously study biological systems. There were times when I really understood it and liked it, but other times where I felt way out of my league (again, physics major without bio experience, y'all seriously have the least outsider-friendly vocabulary). On another note, Thierry is an amazing and challenging instructor.",
    "Generally a great class. Both Prof. Emonet and Prof. M-J are excellent lecturers. The class is very small (only ~8 students by the end of the semester, after some students had dropped it. Something to consider) and intimate, so it's basically a seminar in a lecture classroom. You learn a lot of cool math about biology. If you've taken physics 170\/171, it's similar to the kind of math you do with chemical rate equations and biological systems. The math is not too difficult, coming from someone who only took Math 115, but a class in differential equations may have helped. Generally I think a good math background is more useful in this class than having a good biology or programming background. The problem sets were fair and take up some time. Based on the averages everyone does really well on them so I'm not sure how grading for the class works. Also MAKE SURE YOU DO THE BONUS QUESTIONS ON THE PSETS. The first few abstracts were graded by M-J and the rest of the grades weren't given to us by the end of the semester so there's not a lot of transparency there. The class itself is not difficult. It's really important to go to class and review your notes because the material really builds on itself. Overall, an incredible class that I would call the hidden gem of the MCDB major.",
    "This was the best class I took this semester, and probably one of the best MCDB courses out there. If you have ever wondered how you could ever use everything you learned in your general chemistry, calculus, and physics classes to help you understand biology, this class will show you the way. The topics are really interesting and are applicable to literally everything you've ever learned in another MCDB class. After taking this, I feel like I can infer a lot about a signaling pathway or other dynamic system's inner workings just be reading about its observed behavior. This is not a lecture, and you'll need to learn to code in MatLab for the class. I didn't know Matlab before (only very basic Java from 5 years ago) and I did fine. Definitely shop this class because it provides a rare opportunity to study biology from a different perspective.",
    "Very cool, very unique class. Highly recommend to any MCDB major with decent quantitative skills, or physics\/math people who are interested in biology. The math isn't all that bad (really, all you need is algebra and to have a sense of what a differential equation is), but what you do with it is awesome. Pace is slow at the beginning, which allows you to get a good feel for the class before it picks up a bit towards the end. It's also nice getting to take a small science class (my semester was ~10 students) with good professors. All in all, if you've ever found yourself wondering how computational models work (or what they even are), this is the class for you. (Final note: it'd be good, but not required, to have some basic programming experience heading into the class. Prior knowledge of Matlab is absolutely NOT necessary though, as they give you the resources to learn everything you need to know when you're there.)",
    "I think that this is a great MCDB elective! It forced me to think about biology in a totally new way, and I learned to code in Matlab. It's also relatively low-stress, with a handful of problem sets and a take-home final. The difficulty of everything was reasonable and both professors were very engaging and kind people. I would absolutely recommend it!",
    "It was a small class (about ten students), and I learned a lot about using basic math to describe a simplified biological system! I would definitely recommend this class, as it is very different from most MCDB courses, which simply require you to memorize facts and spit them back out on exams.",
    "I would not necessarily recommend this class to a fellow student. It is an introduction to systems biology for those who have a good background in biology, differential equations, and statistics. The official prerequisite of intro physics is simply not accurate. There is no physics in this class. Make sure you have taken general chemistry (for reaction rates and energies) and some intermediate\/advanced MCDB class, preferably biochem, molecular bio, or even systems bio. Do not come into this class for an introductory course for bio or even programming. The explanations of programming techniques were not very thorough. On the quantitative side, make sure you are very comfortable with programming, differential equations (not necessarily how to solve nonlinear ones), and statistics (specifically Poisson distributions). In terms of the subject, systems bio is mostly about decisions and complicated behavior, so make sure you are interested in the minutia of how larger overall behavior is derived before you commit to this class. The workload is not too great, but since it is broken up into large problem sets with 1-2 weeks to do them, it can feel much greater. Prof. Miller-Jensen is pretty helpful, Prof. Emonet much less so."
