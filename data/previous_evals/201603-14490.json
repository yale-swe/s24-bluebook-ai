   "question_text": "What knowledge, skills, and insights did you develop by taking this course?",
   "comments": [
    "I came away with a very nuanced understanding of populism as a discourse, rhetoric, and loose ideology, as well as the history of how it has been used and characterized globally.",
    "Critical engagement with academic work, directed specifically at seeking arguments to debate in class, discourse analysis, articulating connections between seemingly unrelated phenomena, contextualising recent political events, constructing arguments in oral debates",
    "The course made me familiar with different definitions of populism, methods of identifying populist discourse, and populist episodes in the US, Europe, and Latin America. Thanks to the class I have developed a richer understanding of populism and its relationship with democracy. After taking the course, I am definitely more attentive to politics and more aware of how language shapes it.",
    "Definition of populism expanded from a colloquial and American sense to a formal and international sense. Great classroom discussions, one of the most fun seminars I've ever taken.",
    "In taking this course, I feel as though I significantly bettered my political science writing ability and style, learning to write in a detached voice. I also gained valuable insight into populist leadership springing up internationally.",
    "The course provides a comprehensive overview of both theoretical and empirical notions of populism. First, you read a variety of academic articles that help you to form a comprehensive and widely applicable conceptual definition of populism that you will use throughout the rest of the semester. You then spend a few weeks focusing on various regions of the world, in particular Western Europe, Latin America, and the United States. The course also gives you the opportunity to read various speeches by \"populist\" leaders and analyze their rhetoric in order to determine to what extent they are truly populist. Overall, the course provides an excellent overview of an extremely complex topic and hones your critical thinking skills in the process. Prof. Aslanidis has high expectations and expects you to oftentimes point out the weak points of the articles that you read in the course.",
    "The course offered great exposure to the academic treatment of populism and populists movements. A great combination of readings exposed us to every definition and critique of varying conceptions of populism. It taught the skill of critiquing an idea very well as we explored different definitions of populism. Also it was very good with forcing students to interrogate the boundaries between political rhetoric and political theory and ideas.",
    "This class was more empirical than I expected--far more emphasis on the mechanisms of identifying populism rather than on the particular instances of populism that arose in different geographic contexts. I have a better grasp of social science research methodology, and the way that definitions can change the results of your studies.",
    "This class really helped me think critically. As the only Freshman, it was super insightful to be able to engage more personally with other students who had more academic experience at Yale. The engagement with the professor was excellent and the course material was interesting and relevant.",
    "This course was an excellent introduction to the phenomenon and academic study of populism in politics demonstrably important in the current political climate throughout the world and in our country. And yet, it clearly is more than an occasional occurrence and potentially a long-standing phenomenon of democratic politics. In this sense, this course is a vital contribution to the course offerings at Yale.",
    "I learned a lot about a term that is used very often, but not defined very often. There was a good mix of populist cases from all over the world, as well as discussion of theoretical and empirical works."

   "question_id": "YC403",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The course really only has one main weakness -- that it contains too much material to discuss during one seminar session. That, however, is an excellent problem to have as it creates a sense of an ongoing conversation, with topics and questions flowing from one week to the next. The class's main strength is, of course, in how timely it is and also in how nuanced a perspective on populism it offers -- something we have started losing track of because of the recent populist hysteria.",
    "I found the course readings to be amazing. Additionally, I enjoyed how the course drew on current events to feed the discussion. One weakness of the course was definitely that it only met one time a week. By choosing to meet twice a week, the course would have better structured discussions around the texts assigned for each meeting.",
    "Strengths: Prof Aslanidis is a great prof and a great dude, very down-to-earth with students and good at incorporating pressing modern concerns into course material. Multimedia and news coverage was fantastic. Student presentations at the beginning of each class are also really helpful, it's nice to have a quick recap and other classmates' opinions on the readings before diving into discussion. Weaknesses: At times a bit repetitive, in that almost every reading starts with 'so what IS populism??'...not necessarily the fault of the class but a fault in the field.",
    "Professor Aslanidis brings tremendous knowledge and expertise to the course! He made it an enjoyable and rewarding experience for everyone involved. I really enjoyed each of our readings and found the class discussions to be particularly engaging and well-guided by Professor Aslanidis.",
    "I learned a lot about the subject and I felt the readings were informative. I liked the focus on multiple regions and making comparisons on those regions. I often felt that Professor Aslanidis could have improved in leading discussion.",
    "One of the major strengths of the course is that it is not supposed to lead you to any particular conclusion about populist politics. Professor Aslanidis makes it very clear that the course raises more questions than answers, and that the main goal of the course is to equip you with a basic, widely applicable knowledge that students can employ in their day-to-day lives as well as their future studies in political science. I will say that some of the weeks that focused on specific regions, especially Latin America, were a bit difficult to get through, as there is a lot of unfamiliar historical\/political context that is not always provided by the readings.",
    "The primary strength of this course is the classroom discussions, workshops, and case studies. They do a good job of making the material found in the readings more tangible. The professor does a great job conveying the ideas in a clear and concise way. The course could improve if students were prepped better for the classroom discussions in advance---that way the discussion could be more fruitful for everyone.",
    "There are a lot of classes at Yale that I feel fail to focus on an in-depth look at real-world examples over the overarching theoretical frameworks that govern these examples. As a result, while I can talk about populism theory very well, I have little understanding of the particulars of any given case (I know, for example, that economics was important to the Latin American cases, but I cannot talk about Chavez's policies in depth nor compare them against other Latin American cases). This class could have focused a little more on concrete conditions and still not sacrificed the theory, which I felt got repetitive.",
    "I mostly thought this class was excellently composed. Great introduction to the literature and the debates within it, as well as the history and different regional contexts. By the end of the course, students have a strong grasp on the content and academic field.",
    "The professor should be more clear in terms of expectations for writing assignments. He should also create a solid framework that the class can follow for studying populism, as populism is a widely applied and adaptable ideology and the span of the class can make material seem scattered or glossed over. Readings became repetitive at times, though there was a mix of media, presenting, and debate in class that was interesting."

   "comments": [
    "Absolutely! This class is a must for anyone, regardless of their interest in or experience with politics. The issues this class focuses on are becoming more and more relevant which is why being educated about them is extremely important.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who is curious about democracy and the current wave of populism in the world. The readings facilitate amazing discussions, and Professor Aslanidis keeps the conversation lively by introducing thought provoking examples throughout the debates. This class will give anyone a greater understanding and appreciation for democracy and its faults.",
    "Absolutely recommend. Strengths: Prof Aslanidis is a great prof and a great dude, very down-to-earth with students and good at incorporating pressing modern concerns into course material. Multimedia and news coverage was fantastic.

    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone who is interested in populist phenomena especially in Latin America and Europe. 2016 was a particularly apt year to take this course, but I would recommend it in any semester!",
    "If you're interested in the subject matter I would take it, but I think there are better political science seminars.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone interested in political science, as it does a wonderful job of combining theoretical and empirical discussions of populism. I came out of the course with a new outlook on politics, and I think that the material learned in the course will certainly continue to be relevant under a Trump presidency.",
    "Yes I would recommend this course. The subject matter is very interesting and the professor is clear, captivating, and motivated. Work load is doable and the assignments really help you understand the concepts clearly.",
    "This class was more empirical than I expected--far more emphasis on the mechanisms of identifying populism rather than on the particular instances of populism that arose in different geographic contexts. I have a better grasp of social science research methodology, and the way that definitions can change the results of your studies.

This class could have focused a little more on concrete conditions and still not sacrificed the theory, which I felt got repetitive. I would recommend it, especially if you want to learn about the ways to conduct social science research correctly and methodically, but be prepared for a unilateral focus on methodology over case studies. Professor Aslanidis was accessible and gave clear feedback, which is a plus.",
    "I have recommended this class to many of my friends who are in the political science\/history major. My one friend is a die-hard fan of Huey Long and sees him as a hero. Professor Aslanidis's class would open up the scope of this student's world view quite a bit, and I think that would go for most students at Yale. The course covers a variety of different populist examples geographically and historically. Because of this, it remains super relevant to students from various academic backgrounds. I also think that taking this class will help students navigate today's political environment. Donald Trump is the new president of the United States, and this class can help students understand why he's so great at rallying popular support.",
    "Absolutely",
    "This course is absolutely worthwhile to take for better understanding populism a political phenomenon that is essential for comprehending domestic and global politics. The course is well arranged and crafted and Prof. Aslanidis is an engaging and knowledgable instructor. Highly recommended.",
    "I would only recommend this course to someone who is interested in learning about populism but already has a strong political science background, as the the class does not really nurture critical thinking.",
    "I would recommend this class. It was one of the best I have taken at Yale and very relevant for the times we live in."
