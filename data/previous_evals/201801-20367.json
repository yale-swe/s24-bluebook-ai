    "How to discuss thoughtful pieces of art. Group discussion was amazing. The combination of making your own pieces and looking at slideshows given by the Professor opened my eyes (as a non-artsy person)",
    "I learned a lot about the relationship between words and pictures in art and in comics. I found it fascinating how each could impact the other and how comics and other art forms manipulate this relationship to convey a message. I also developed the skill of doing art crits and having my work be displayed and discussed by the class.",
    "Through this course I was able to gain a better insight into storytelling using the combination of the titular \"words and pictures.\" I was made to think about the connections between these things in a way I hadn't considered previously.",
    "I learned about the visual, philosophical and otherwise artistic relationship between words and pictures and how this relationship is explored by artists.",
    "Through the weekly assignments, I practiced interpreting class material creatively and working with different artistic mediums."

   "comments": [
    "Group discussions are really engaging, critique times are great, instructor feedback is great.",
    "I loved how personal this class was and how everyone really showed a piece of themselves through their art. The class was very relaxing and a great breather from the hectic, heavily academic life at Yale. Professor Rodman was extremely kind and supportive of everyone's art!",
    "The weekly projects are great--the best part of the class. If any thing could be improved, maybe the readings.",
    "I thought the assignments were a real highlight. They were always so interesting to carry out and compare. The readings and works shown were great too, although I do think the professor could have been more concise at some points during class time.",
    "Once a week, we would bring in our assignments and present them, discussing our process as well as the meaning behind our work. I enjoyed this part of the class since it exciting to see what I came up with in response to the super open assignments (e.g. represent a historical event from multiple points of view). I also liked bonding with my classmates and hearing about their projects. For our second meeting every week, we discussed the readings and were sometimes lectured about related topics. The readings were cool and discussions were nice as long as the students were engaged, but they sometimes dragged on and the lectures were not informative. The overall vibe of the class is really relaxed."

   "comments": [
    "Absolutely.",
    "YES! If you love art. even if you are not skilled in making art, I would highly recommend this course. You learn a lot about words and pictures, but also about how to express yourself through art.",
    "I would 100% recommend this to another student. You don't have to be good at art to enjoy this class. Any skill level can feel welcome and it's honestly fantastic to see other people's interpretation of assignments.",
    "If you want a good art class with fun, engaging weekly assignments to give you a creative outlet during the semester this is it!",
    "I would recommend this course if you're looking for a nice break from your other work and want to take a very low stress art\/art analysis class (definiteky no art experience necessary). If you're looking for more serious intellectual enrichment, though, I would recommend another art history class. I honestly don't think I gained that much new knowledge from class discussions. My favorite part was doing the art projects and seeing what my classmates came up with. Basically, you put in as much effort as you want to, and, as long as you can sell your projects in class presentations and participate in discussions, you're good to go."
