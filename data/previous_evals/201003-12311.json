    "Spanish 110 02 is a very intensive introduction to the study of Spanish for someone who completely has no Spanish background, like me. However, with the guidance of Professor Garcia, I have improved drastically in a mere 3 months time! It was one of the most amazing experiences that I have had at Yale.",
    "This course is a solid first semester of Spanish. It moves fast - you learn many verb tenses very quickly at the end of the semester. I enjoyed it and was able to keep up thanks to my having studied French, but if you are unfamiliar with romance languages it may be tough. There is a solid amount of homework - about 20 minutes each night, not including the near-weekly quizzes, orals, or other assignments. You will learn a lot of Spanish. If you've taken any Spanish classes before this will probably be a breeze.",
    "I thought Spanish 110 was taught exactly the way an L1 language course should be, and feel like I learned as much as I could have during a semester. I can now comfortably lead a conversation in Spanish, have a good grasp on many tenses and lots of vocab, but the class is not too much work--not at all overbearing. Great course.",
    "If you're looking for an interesting language associated with extremely attractive cultures, go for Spanish L1. If you haven't taken any Spanish at all, the first few weeks may be hard for you because the class is..in Spanish. But you get used to it after a while. Also, you start talking to people around you and realize that they've taken Spanish for a very long time. Why they're in level 1 is a good question to ask, but no need to be intimidated. As long as you do your best and do your homework, the only thing you'll realize by the end of the term is how much you have learned.",
    "I would only recommend this class if a fellow student was truly interested in the spanish language. Otherwise it is hard to do day to day work if one is uninterested.",
    "This is a good class, but hard to keep up with if you have never taken Spanish before.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student.",
    "Spanish 110 is challenging even for someone mildly familiar with the language. The lessons are a gallop through basic Spanish and if given the proper focus and study priority, one can become very proficient at basic communication in the language. I recommend this course to anyone who would like to learn Spanish.",
    "I would recommend it but its not an easy A. We learn difficult tenses and grammar elements that have many exceptions to rules. There is hw daily too so you have to keep up. Depending on teacher section you may also get a teacher who may grade harshly. Like participation.",
    "Spanish 110 is a quick way to learn the language, but it's not easy. You have to put the work in. I would recommend it to any student who is interested in doing the work to learn the language.",
    "Definitely recommend this course."
