    "Yes, I will recommend",
    "Very good course on fabrication and device physics for integrated circuits. I would recommend the course to an undergraduate, but not a graduate student as it takes too much time away from research.",

    "I definitely would. It is a lot of work (2 exams - midterm and final, 10 homework sets, and 3 lab reports). But you do learn a lot.",
