   "comments": [
    "A great survey course on Animal Behavior. Lots of interesting topics and very engaging lectures. A great writing credit for science students in which you will also learn how to write a basic research proposal. Very low workload with only two exams and the paper. Exciting course that I would highly recommend to anyone interested in ecology, evolution, and\/or animal behavior.",
    "This is a great class that I would definitely recommend to another student. If you are interested in ecology or animals at all, you should take this class. It is fun, the workload is definitely manageable, and the material is very interesting. You will learn a lot about animals.",
    "Animal Behavior covers various strategies and adaptations of organisms in order to thrive in their environment and compete with other organisms. You learn a lot about broad strategies, and then learn researched examples to illustrate these strategies. There is also a research paper where you propose and design your own experiment based on techniques you learn about in class. This paper is a lot of work, but it's also very interesting if you pick a topic that you genuinely like.",
    "Yes I would definitely recommend this class. It is a smaller-end science course. Our class had about 12 students in it. It was lecture style, but because of the numbers you could always engage in semi-discussions either in the class or with Suzanne Alonzo. The course covers the basis for many behaviors in the natural world. Involves mathematical modeling, particularly focused in on game theory problems. Very fun if you like quantitative behavior. The professor has been involved in some very famous biological studies and is pretty engaging in lecture. It makes for a great course. I highly recommend it.",
    "Take it!! Enjoyable and rewarding class. The research proposal deadlines are set up in a way that reduces stress and maximizes opportunities for bringing your writing to the best level it can be. The class is an interactive lecture, which is much better for absorbing and understanding the content presented.",
    "This class is great, but don't be fooled\u00e2\u0080\u0094 it is not easy. There is a midterm, takehome final, and a research proposal, all of which require a good amount of time if you want to do well in the class. But it is really wonderful and Professor Alonzo is great, so definitely take it! Especially EEB majors.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. The material is interesting, even for non-E&EB majors, the professor is great, and it's a great way to get a writing credit! The assignments and exams are fair, but challenging. I particularly enjoyed the grant proposal assignment, which seemed daunting at first but ended up being kind of fun to work on throughout the semester. I really felt that I learned a lot throughout the course of the semester.",
    "This course was very interesting. Not having an EEB background, I found it challenging but definitely rewarding. The project taught me a lot about doing research, and I really appreciated the fact that the final was take home."
