    "Good class if you are interested in clinical psychology. Be very aware that your fieldwork placement will bear A LOT on your class experience. Chose a good placement.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS! I've really enjoyed it so far. Prof. Lockhart is a dynamic lecturer and she really cares about her students and the field placements. The in-class exercises you get to do (like a schizophrenia simulation and case studies) are informative and really interesting. The triad meetings during which you get together with two other students to practice your therapy skills are also great. I feel like you actually learn a lot of practical information and skills from the course, which isn't the case for the majority of Yale classes.If you have any interest in mental illnesses, I wholeheartedly recommend this course. From what I've heard, all the field placements have been interesting and rewarding. Prof. Lockhart is approachable and helpful, as is Sunny, the TA. And while there are weeks when you might have three writing responses to do (which were pretty rare), it's still worth it! You get to engage with questions you may not have a chance to grapple with anywhere else, in a friendly environment. While it is a significant time commitment because of the field placements, you benefit so much from the experience.",
    "This is one of those rare classes (at Yale) that offers practical experience in an area of study. The course itself offers readings from established theory and empirical studies that cultivate a nuanced understanding of clinical psychology issues and practice. The practicum then allows students to put their skills and knowledge into action. Weekly mini-research-paper-like thought question responses and journal responses, along with a journal about fieldwork experience. Final 10-12 page paper blending theory and reflections from the practicum experience.",
    "Yes",
    "I would recommend this class if you are interested in clinical psychology. The first semester has been pretty good, though a bit light on actual class content. I have enjoyed my placement, because it is fairly different than my main area of work (autism) and I have learned a lot about a new population. Two other students and I lead a class\/group of about 5 teenage girls at a youth psychiatric hospital\/school.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to someone that is interested in going into the field of psychology as a future profession. The class provides hands on experience and tactics that might be implemented later in the field work. Great experience, definitely recommend it.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course for any student that's willing to dedicate about 2 hours a week to driving\/walking to a facility in or around New Haven.",
    "Yes, I think if you're considering a profession in the medical or clinical fields, this course will help you get a better sense of the actual nature of your potential work.",
    "It's not right for everyone. Be prepared for slow-moving and unorganized lectures. The field placements can be great, but not all of them are. Professor Lockhart holds her students to a high standard without laying out her expectations beforehand. If you are someone who likes a class that goes with the flow, interacting with the community, willing to work with different types of people\/ personality types, and are okay with realizing you did something wrong after you handed something in, then take the class. It is a year-long class but the skills you learn such as listening to others, facilitating a conversation, interacting with mentally ill or at-risk patients are invaluable and useful for life.",
    "I wanted to take a psych seminar, since I've mostly been exposed to lectures in the past. I ended up enjoying this class. Prof Lockhart is super nice, cares about her students, brings us cookies, etc. She is more interested in sharing what she knows\/having discussions than teaching a class, in my opinion. Sunny the TA was great too. Class mostly consisted of Prof Lockhart lecturing on the topic of the week (which sometimes did get boring). When we did exercises and had discussions, class was much more interesting. Prof Lockhart is trying to improve the class and asked for our input, so I think it's evolving. It is a year long course, so make sure you have the room. The placements are cool, and think carefully about what you want to do before you choose your placement. CMHC is working with groups and\/or individuals in New Haven. New Haven Academy was just working with students (not necessarily mentally ill). Adelbrook is being paired up with a buddy who is mentally ill. Solnit is working with small groups in a school setting (mentally ill). I might be forgetting some, but either way, they may change. The placements are what you make of them. Some you have to drive, some you don't. The triads were interesting and useful, I thought. Weekly reading responses on the subjects. Final paper. Final presentation. My thoughts on the class are still changing, as we are only half way through.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to anyone! It has been the most enjoyable course I have ever taken at Yale. I have learned so much and have been able to apply the work we do in the classroom in a variety of ways. Definitely take it, you won't regret it!",
    "It's an interesting course that covers a great overview of what the field of clinical psychology is like."
