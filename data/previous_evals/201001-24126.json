   "comments": [
    "Oh my gosh, this class is THE BEST. It's anything and everything to do with the idea of disability. You actually focus on three different categories of disability - deafness (which is, at times, not considered a disability), physical disabilities (MURDERBALL!), and psychological disabilities (schizophrenia, autism). Along the way there's a lot of discussion of gender, identity, discrimination, theory... you get the idea.Karen is AMAZING. Sweet, kind, funny, totally in love with what she's talking about. You won't regret meeting her. TAKE THIS CLASS BEFORE YOU LEAVE YALE.",
    "My favorite class this semester. It was very eye-opening and made me reconsider many of my views on disability. THIS CLASS IS A MUST TAKE. The readings are easy and interesting and the movies are great too.",
    "If you want to re-evaluate the way you think about ideal bodies, politics, and identity definitely take this course.",
    "Definitely recommended. I learned so much about disabilities that I had no idea about. There are so many types of disabilities that it's impossible to cover it all in a semester. But this class was definitely an in-depth look at some areas of disabilities studies.",
    "Really good class! Most of the material we covered was very engaging and opened my mind to a wealth of knowledge about the disabled as well as the field of anthropology, something i was new to before i took this course",
    "An AWESOME AWESOME AWESOME anthro course that looks at disability froom the social side. I think everyone at Yale should seek to take a course that they never would have thought of taking...if that's why you're reading this evaluation, then you should take it. Moreover it's an AWESOME class!",
    "fun",
    "I'm hesitant to recommend the class to others because there were really only a few readings that I thought were amazing, and there were only a few classes that I thought were great. I think it forces you to think about interesting issues, sometimes to the point that you want to cry, but I thought the class could be a lot better.",
    "Yes, absolutely take it! Disability Studies added to my academic knowledge tremendously (about so many things - American\/world history, literary analysis, feminist and queer theory, law, medicine), and it also lead me to rethink a lot of assumptions I had made about the world generally without even realizing I had made them, about what constitutes a good life, what \"normal\" is, what responsibilities we have to each other as people, and so on. Karen's lectures were great and the readings\/movies were all incredibly fascinating - this was the homework I did to procrastinate on my other homework, these are the anthologies I look forward to reading the non-assigned chapters of over break. And this was the class I couldn't stop discussing with my friends - it was that fascinating and paradigm-altering, throughout the semester. Seriously. Take it. Do not pass go. Do not worry about balancing it with the workload of your other classes. It will add so much to your understanding of the world, it is totally worth it.",
    "Great class! Karen is crazy, but extremely cool (she even brings her dog to class sometimes) and nice. Discussions in class were very interesting, but the reading every week was a lot.",
    "For sure.",
    "This is a great class. Take it!",
    "Disability and Culture is an excellent course for anybody interested in gaining a basic understanding of the extremely varied meanings of disability worldwide. Covering three major categories of disability (deafness, physical disability, and psychiatric disability), the course introduces not only medical definitions of impairment, but also fluid culturalconcepts of what it means to be disabled, from society's perspective and through the words of disabled advocates.",
    "Yes - a great class for people interested in a multitude of topics from medicine, law, politics, etc.",
    "This class is SO GOOD. I'd recommend it to anyone interested in politics, law, medicine, ethics, whatever. Karen is crazy, but in the best way possible, and she will challenge you throughout the semester, in your discussions, in your writings, and so on. I emerged from the class with much stronger opinions about disability rights, and much more sensitive about the issues associated with them as well. TAKE THIS CLASS, you will love doing all the work.",
    "YES. Amazing class introducing you to the study of disability. The class is split into 3 sections: deafness, physical disability, and mental disability. Weekly reading responses, 3 short papers, and one final research paper which wasn't very bad at all. This class really opened my mind to new concepts\/ideas, and I HIGHLY recommend it.",
    "A great introduction to disabilities studies. Professor Nakamura provides a great space to explore and share opinions."
