   "comments": [
    "I had a bit of a background in Spanish, but the course was still challenging. Do not expect the course to be easy. That being said, I learned a lot and am glad I took the course.",
    "Yes, learned a lot in a short period of time.",
    "L1 was hard because I was a TRUE beginner. I had never taken Spanish, and I belonged in the lowest, most basic class. Everyone around me in L1 seemed to have at least some knowledge of Spanish. Spanish 110 took a lot of effort so that I could stay afloat, and unfortunately, I felt like my professor wanted me to have come in the first day knowing Spanish. I would recommend this class ONLY if you have a good professor.",
    "Yes, I would recommended it. Very interesting class, as long as you have a good classroom dynamic, it can be a lot of fun.",
    "A class going over present and some of past tense Spanish. It is not too difficult and the workload is never overwhelming. It will make you somewhat literate and comfortable with Spanish.",
    "Spanish 110 is a very comprehensive and helpful class in laying the foundation for Further Spanish education.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. I began Spanish after taking French in high school. I was worried about starting a common language in college without having any prior experience. However, the course is set up well and the instructors are patient that allow for you to learn a lot in just 14 weeks."
