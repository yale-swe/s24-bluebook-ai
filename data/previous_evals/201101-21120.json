    "Fucking best course.",
    "If you are interested in either psych or econ, this is a really cool class to learn about some of the most interesting and important aspects of human decision making.",
    "I would recommend it -- it's not an enormous amont of work, and it's a fun seminar in which you'll learn.",
    "This was an interesting overview of some of the important papers\/concepts of behavioral economics. I liked that the professor did a fair amount of lecturing, as I didn't often get much out of the class discussions. The assignments were interesting and the professor was responsive to student questions. I wish we had gotten back more assignments (he grades rather harshly), but all in all I am glad I took the course.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. It was incredibly interesting and I feel as if I learned a great deal about such an important field. Professor Frederick was a great professor.",
    "Good (but not exhaustive) introduction to key literature in behavioral economics."
