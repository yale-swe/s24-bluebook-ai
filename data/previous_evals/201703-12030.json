    "Since its your own research and project you pretty much get the chance to study whatever you want and put time into that specific thing.",
    "Prof. Weir is by far the best professor that I've had at Yale. Not only is she very in the theory on conflict and terrorism she stresses the practical realities of conflict in all of her classes.",
    "I learned how to organize and compose a 30 page research paper, the most extensive paper I've written to date.",
    "The One-Term Senior Essay is an excellent chance to really delve into a fascinating topic of your own choosing for a semester. I really enjoyed the opportunity to meet face-to-face on a weekly basis with my adviser, Professor Nuno Monteiro, who was able to help me develop my research and writing skills to a level beyond even what 3 years of Yale had done. Being able to benefit from his knowledge while working directly with him was incredible. I gained a new appreciation for research and being able to collaborate with a fantastic mentor.",
    "Doing an independent study for your senior essay is nice to have freedom but you must make sure to be on top of your schedule. In some ways taking it in a class may have been easier for the structure."

   "comments": [
    "Get an advisor you really enjoy talking to and are comfortable around.",
    "Taking the senior essay in one term is both challenging and liberating. On the one hand, it is nice to have a flexible meeting schedule, where you and the adviser can cut straight to the process of discussing the paper whenever you reach certain checkpoints in the writing (creating a draft, etc.). It allows for a great deal of independence in shaping the project as well. It is, however, very easy to slip into procrastination, especially given that it is not a normal course, yet still needs to fit into the rest of your course schedule. Additionally, fitting the entire process, from finding an adviser to submitting the finished product, into one semester is a somewhat intense timeline. It's easy to procrastinate but the deadline is very good at sneaking up on you. In this way, the independence is both a blessing and a curse.",
    "Really up to you on how you manage your workload."

    "If you're going to have to write a thesis anyways, might as well do it independently and get an extra credit out of it",
    "Its this or in a seminar. There are pros and cons to both but I loved doing my senior essay through 480.",
    "Would definitely recommend",
    "I would absolutely suggest that any student take a course with Prof. Weir.",
    "I would recommend taking this course to any political science major who has strict self-discipline, good time management skills, and a strong interest in a particular topic. Working alone and planning directly with the adviser can allow for a greater focus on the topic, without worrying about having to fit it into a seminar syllabus. If you like working independently or if you really want to have a lot of one-on-one with your adviser, then this is a good option for you.",
    "It was nice to have so much freedom but it also meant that I had to constantly be thinking about working on my thesis"
