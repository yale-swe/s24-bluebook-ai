    "Yes, definitely take even if you're not from Chicago area!",
    "If you're from Chicago, definitely take this class! It does a great job of overviewing the history of urban planning in the city, starting with Bo Burnham all the way up to current problems with Chicago Public Schools and policing, and new lakefront developments. These are things all Chicago citizens should be informed about. I think this could also be a very interesting class for non-Chicago residents (and we had plenty in the class). You might just need to do a little background reading each week to make sure you understand the place that's getting discussed that week. Workload is very reasonable, three short plan analyses (more visually-based reading responses), a presentation on your final project, and a final project that consists of uploading visuals to a website and a 10 page paper. Definitely manageable as a 5th class.b",
    "As someone from Chicago, I thought that this was a great class. Although I already knew quite a bit about some of the material, just by being from the place around which the class is centered, I learned quite a bit as well. You start by looking at Burnhams plan for the city and then using that plan as a backdrop for all of the other \"units,\" which focus on public housing, policing, historic preservation, public education, and the like. Some units are stronger than others, and they focus on events both in the present and the past. Personally, I think to understand Chicago you have to focus a bit more on the Daley years. The reason the city looks and feels the way it does today is rooted in the policies of Daley senior's regime. Also, the planning analyses start strong, with good, thought provoking prompts, and then devolve into basically reading responses. The one with Burnhams plan was great-the other prompts should be just as structured and guide students through the intricacies and subtext of some of these plans. Much of this course is about history, but it is not a history course, so be aware of that. The final project is fairly open ended. I really enjoyed doing mine, but I thought the digital aspect was relatively pointless and it was unclear what the purpose of that aspect of the project actually was. Overall, a great class that I'm sure with iron out the minor flaws as professor Taft hopefully decides to teach it in the future.",
    "Planning Chicago would be a great choice for just about anyone. There is no background knowledge required. I would especially recommend it for those interested in urban studies, American urban politics, or Chicago.",
    "Would recommend for anyone with an academic or personal interest in urban planning and history.",
    "Planning Chicago looks at various plans for structuring the city of Chicago from its housing to its educational system. In the class you will look at primary and secondary source documents and their accompanying plans and will analyze and compare these plans across time. Highlights of the course include Daniel Burnham's 1905 Plan of Chicago and side-by-side comparisons of Chicago's current buildings and communities vs what they were just a few decades ago.",
    "Definitely take this class if you're interested in city planning, policy or social justice work.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to another student both to those from the Chicago area and outside. One of the strengths of this course is that you get to discuss a number of topics notably the design politics of public housing projects and the complex relationships between Universities and their surrounding areas that I feel are included in very few other Yale courses. With four planning analyses (each about 3 pages) and a final paper (only 10-12), it is a lot of work, but it's a very rewarding course, especially if you're interested in living or working in a city in the future. I also recommend it for those who are interested in an interdisciplinary approach to policy questions, because each assignment and topic we consider requires you to draw on the historical context and also carefully analyze planning images and language.",
    "Good detailed look at Chicago. Good for AMST majors and folks interested in urban issues\/Chicago. Very focused\/detailed, and lots of writing throughout the term and at the end.",
    "If you are from Chicago or at all interested in learning the ways in which a city comes together, TAKE THIS CLASS!",
    "AMST413 is a really fascinating course on the history of the built environment of Chicago. Our syllabus was well-constructed, and Professor Taft did a fantastic job weaving together all of our readings\/topics\/themes."
