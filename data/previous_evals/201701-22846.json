    "I think the course made great use of the course packet and cultural resources like videos, games and tv shows. I liked that the small class size meant we could get to know each other better and talk more honestly. However, my biggest criticism of the class was that there was very little consistency in terms of peoples' Hebrew knowledge or speaking skills, and a very disparate number of undergraduates vs. graduate students and auditors, which made conversing or even getting through course material very slow and sometimes frustrating. I think if there had been more common ground or a baseline level of Hebrew knowledge that the class shared, we could have been way more productive and had really fun conversations. I often felt like I was the only one consistently participating in class and watching the shows for homework, and I frequently had to explain things that I've already learned in my 4 semesters of Hebrew here to classmates that had never learned them."
