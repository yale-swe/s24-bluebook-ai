    "Take it. Brilliant professor, wonderful&timeless readings, and only 2 papers. Reading responses probably vary according to the TF, but Kerry only required a short, ungraded paragraph per week for 8 or 9 weeks of the semester. Section and lecture were both rewarding and relevant.",
    "Yes. It is such a great excuse to read awesome literature and get credit for it. And to be taught by such a caring and knowledgeable professor is invaluable.",
    "Prof. Alexandrov is awesome and the lectures are really interesting if you're caught up on the reading.There is a short reading response each week but they're easy, and there are two papers and a final.If you have time to enjoy these great books you will love the lecture and weekly section.Alexandrov's lectures are really entertaining and it's nice on a cold winter day to come into the nice warm classroom in LC and hear about Tolstoy's life and Russia.Warning- if you fall behind on the reading the lecture gets boring, but that goes for most things.",
    "The workload can be heavy depending on how fast and how closely you read, but it is very rewarding as almost every page of Tolstoy is a pleasure. Reading the material with Alexandrov is also wonderful as he exposed us to a lot of the subtleties that make Tolstoy great and gave us the framework to find more ourselves. He also gave us some background onto the author's life that add relevance to the reading. While his style is not particularly emphatic, I'm really glad I took the class with him and had the chance to read the material.It wasn't always a cake walk, but it was a pleasure.",
    "Absolutely. This is a class I think every single person should take before graduating Yale. Not just because everyone in the world should read Tolstoy at some point, but also because Professor Alexandrov is hands down one of the best professors at Yale. His lectures are amazing and engaging and every time you walk out of class you will feel like you really learned something new and important. Even though there is a lot of reading, Tolstoy is really clear and easy to read so it often didn't feel like much at all. Just make sure you go to lecture and take good notes (this will help a lot for the essays.)tl;dr version: TAKE IT! This class will make you a better person and Professor Alexandrov's lectures will give your life meaning. I swear.",
    "AMAZING CLASS! Must take. It's so inspiring and even though it is a TON of work, if you do it, you will be so proud of yourself. You learn so much about Tolstoy's works. Such a life-changing class.",
    "This is THE BEST course at Yale, bar none. Tolstoy is amazing, Alexandrov's lectures are amazing, everything is amazing. Seriously. The format is simple: read wonderful literature, listen to engaging lectures from a world-class expert, write two short papers and take a dirt-easy final. What college should be.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS BEFORE YOU LEAVE YALE. you must. you just must. You will be enlightened, your world will change, Just take it. And do the reading, which can be daunting, but it is SO worth it.",
    "This class is a really good class. Lecture can be kind of didactic and boring at times--I wish we had learned more about conflicting interpretations of the text. But the books are AWESOME and as long as you do the reading (maybe over Christmas Break so it's manageable), you'll get a good grade in the class.",
    "I would recommend it. I would caution that it is only worth taking if one is willing to do the reading and would also say that one should realize it the fact that it is a lecture limits opportunities for discussion to section, which can be hit-or-miss.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class--it's a chance to read novels I'd never be able to get through on my own, and with the kind of in-depth analysis to make the novels really come alive.",
    "I liked this class, though I took it CR\/D. Do the reading if you do take the class, even if its CR\/D.",
    "You'll read lots of great literature and learn a lot! If you're interested, do it!",
    "I would recommend Studies in the Novel: Tolstoy to a fellow students. This was a good, standard lecture course - the literature is classic and Professor Alexandrov provides great criticism and explanations of the works. There is a lot of reading, though, and it is a good idea to do most of if not all of it.",
    "This the only course I could muster enough care to write a response for, which says nothing about my other courses but everything about this one.",
    "Good class if you have time to read the books.",
    "This class was amazing. I had never read any Tolstoy before this semester, and Professor Alexanderov's obvious love of his work was absolutely contagious. Aside from the incredible reading list (War and Peace and Anna Karenina), lecture is really interesting and fun. The workload is manageable (obviously it's a lot of reading, but I loved it) \u0097\u00a0just two papers and a final. Take it!!",
    "Great course!",
    "This class was on the works of Tolstoy. You don't just read and discuss Anna karenina and war and peace but many other short stories as well.",
    "You read War and Peace, Anna Karenina, and Tolstoy's short stories. These books are long, and it's a lot of reading; I felt really swamped when we were reading War and Peace. I highly recommend reading Anna Karenina over spring break. Professor Alexandrov was delightful and his lectures were fascinating. The only thing is, I realized over the course of the semester that I don't love Tolstoy. This is mainly because of Tolstoy's narrative style, but also because of his ideas about human nature. This certainly isn't the fault of the course. If you think you like Tolstoy, though, definitely take this class!",
    "Yes good literature class with two great books. Sometimes lectures are repetitive but they do well to introduce the themes of the books. Also good biographical information on Tolstoy himself. Read Anna Karenina over spring break!",
    "Absolutely recommended, although be warned that it is a lot of reading per week, all through the semester. Totally rewarding if you do it, howeve: Alexandrov delivers passionate, engaging lecturers, and War and Peace, especially, becomes an alluring if hefty story. If you can take it credit\/d, and still motivate yourself to do the reading, it's relatively low stress.",
    "Wonderful small lecture class with discussion section once a week. You read the great works of Tolstoy and this experience in enhanced greatly by the fabulous lectures. Do not take this course if you're not going to have time to do all the reading because you really won't get anything out of it. Also, don't underestimate the time it will take to do the reading when deciding about whether you can handle taking this course. But if you can absolutely do! It was my favorite class so far at Yale.",
    "A very good introduction to the works of Tolstoy. I would recommend it to serious literary readers.",
    "Everyone should read War and Peace and this class is the way to do it!",
    "THIS CLASS IS FANTASTIC. Alexandrov is great, and a super engaging lecturer. The books are of course incredible. I feel incredibly accomplished having read both Anna K and War and Peace. Though the work load is a lot, if you get ahead you'll be fine, especially if you have already read the books before. If you know you want to take this class, start reading War and Peace over winter break, and Anna K over spring break, and you'll be set, because besides reading there really isn't that much work for this class. But absolutely take it.",
    "I think this class would be a great learning experience if you've never attempted something like a close reading of a novel before. However, if you have some background in reading literature, most of the lectures will merely rehash what you ought to have noted yourself while reading. In that regard, the class itself always felt like it felt short of truly profound engagement with Tolstoy, instead simply preparing the ground for such engagement. Good class to take if you want to learn what it's like to attend to the particular demands of a text. Bad class if you've already got an idea (you will be bored).Of course, those with a particular predilection for Tolstoy will probably love it regardless.",
    "Absolutely take this class. Best class I took at Yale.",
    "I take lit classes Cr\/D, since I love reading fiction but I don't have time to read for fun anymore. This turned out to be a good one for that--Great Books (capital G capital B), very good lecture, two short papers and a final. I enjoyed myself. You might too.It is a lot of reading, though. If you're taking three or four other Hu classes, you might find yourself swamped and missing out on some good stories."
