   "comments": [
    "The strongest part of this course was lectures by all three professors, which were always excellent, interesting, and engaging with our readings for that weak. The discussion sections were at times weak, because it was challenging for everyone to keep up with the large amount of reading each week, so at times discussions lagged. I think this could be improved by assigning shorter portions of the readings, or emphasizing which chapters will be important for discussion each week.",
    "This course suffers from what all discussion-based courses suffer from. Students are overloaded with readings to the point where they cannot actually do even a fraction of the readings. Then, during discussions, every student is only able to speak to the small section of the readings that they skimmed. People talk past each other, misconstrue the author's main message, or focus on minutiae rather than the overarching themes. I found discussions to be both the most interesting part of the course but also the most frustrating. This course lacked cohesiveness. It was difficult for me to tie the different readings together and to use them to inform my final research paper. At times, it was also difficult to connect the lectures to the discussion sections. I think the fact that there are three different professors for this class can at times be an advantage and a disadvantage.",
    "A great deal of information covered. Discussion sections could be intense.",
    "The readings and the lectures were great. Some direction on section discussions and how to effectively facilitate discussion would have been useful. Sometimes it felt like the discussion wandered in many different directions."

   "comments": [
    "This is a highly interesting and important class, not to be missed by anyone interested in agrarian studies. Be prepared for a heavy reading list and engaging with challenging material outside of your discipline.",
    "I would have a clear idea why you want to take this course. I caution students against taking the course solely because of the professors. They are great, but it is co-taught by three professors, so face-time with anyone professor may be limited. It also tends to be a big class. Also, be aware that the course has a big focus on China. I wasn't all that interested in China, so I found these readings (which were numerous) a bit tedious at times. It's not that China is inherently a boring topic (it's not), but rather I lacked the basic understanding of Chinese history and geography to fully appreciate the readings. There is a level of literacy with Chinese society that is assumed at the beginning of this class.",
    "Do the readings to get the most out of the course.... but know that you might not get through the whole book. Start your final paper as early as possible."
