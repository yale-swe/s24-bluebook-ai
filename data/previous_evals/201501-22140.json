    "I would recommend this class to anyone seriously interested in improving their French. While this class was the best decision for me, it is a very heavy workload and may be cumbersome to those not willing to rise to the occasion. The class meets two hours every day and has homework every night, so I would really suggest not taking too many other classes in conjunction with this one. Overall and incredible experience that's very worth the effort!",
    "This course is amazing for students who want to learn the French language rapidly. If you're good at grammar and daily French drills, then this course is for you. If weekly exams and daily homework are too much for you, then don't take this class. You learn so much and I highly recommend it, especially if Skorupa is taking it.",
    "French 145 is an excellent course. It is a big time commitment, but it is completely worth it. Your French will improve drastically over the course of the semester. The texts and movies are interesting and the weekly tests force you to keep on top of the material.",
    "Small class size, two hours long (with a break in between - I promise it's not as bad as it sounds), lots of homework and a test each week, but AMAZING results. We also spent every Friday Skyping in small groups with students at Telecom-Paris, and we really got to know one another in a deep way. It's a fabulous course! If you're willing to put in the effort, DEFINITELY take it.",
    "Best class I took this semester!!!! Professor Skorupa is the best professor ever; I wouldn't have thought there was a professor on the planet who could make 2 hours of class at 9:25 AM 5 days a week fun... but Mme Skorupa did it. I adore her. She never fails to be enthusiastic, patient, encouraging, and compassionate. On a level I've never seen before, she had a genuine interest in every student: often checking up on us and making sure we were doing okay in the class and in general. She went so far as to make cakes for birthdays, crepes and cookies for holidays, and amazing home-cooked meals for us all at her own home at the end of the year... I can't speak highly enough of her as a professor and a person; take every class you can with her. Of course, it is a LOT of work, but it was 500% worth it. The class is exceptionally well-planned and well-paced, so the work is at least manageable. The readings and films were genuinely enjoyable, and the conversations we had in class were often the highlight of my day. Furthermore, our class had an awesome exchange with an engineering university in Paris, so we got to Skype with French students on Fridays - actually making friends! I got to meet one of these students during a recent trip to Paris, and it was great. If you're choosing between intensive and non-intensive: know that this class is much more immersive than the actual class. This is a time investment, but it makes learning faster and (I think) easier. Think about your learning style, your overall courseload, and your passion for the language. If you're right for the class, it's the best thing ever. A word to the wise: don't take with a schedule of more than 4.5 credits, 4 to be safe. I took this class in a 5-credit semester and just about died. (But I still loved the class, so that should say a lot!!)"
