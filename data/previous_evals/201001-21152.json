    "A detailed survey of issues, themes, and problems in 20th Century Critical Theory, with an emphasis on German authors.",
    "It is difficult, fast-paced and not for wimps. But don't miss it!",
    "I would recommend this course to any student interested in political theory (or simply getting a sense of important theoretical\/philosophical debates). The reading covers a wide range of authors, but situates each author in discussion with the other authors read in the course. This helps both comprehension and also to get asense of the larger issues.",
    "If you are interested in a thorough introduction to contemporary European political thought, you could not do better than taking this course.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone.",
    "This is a great course which will give you a strong background in in 20th c. German thought. If you have no background in political theory you might benefit from taking political philosophy first as you need some familiarity with the work of Kant, Hegel, Marx, Hobbes, and Nietzsche.",
    "Very good way to improve knowledge of political theory in a short period of time. Interesting reading!"

   "comments": [
    "This course enabled me to think through a big group of European thinkers as members of a more-or-less well defined tradition, with certain key themes running through them. It enabled me to have a good big picture view of the issues that 20th Century European thinkers grappled with, and to begin to work on more detailed analysis of the theories they put forth.",
    "Great overview of the most important Continental philosophers of the 20th century.",
    "I work on continental thought (political theory), so this prepared me immensely. A lot of the stuff is also on the qualifying exam.",
    "While I do not focus in the area of political theory, this course provides me a groundwork to be more aware of and able to engage with work produced by political theorists and to incorporate it, when appropriate, to my own research. In addition, I plan to take the political theory exam, and this course covers many texts that will be on that exam.The biggest contribution to my research\/dissertation work that this course makes is giving me a better capacity to ground my work in important theoretical questions\/debates and thus speak to the important normative issues in politics.",
    "The course deepened my knowledge considerably regarding one strong branch of contemporary political theory. It did not contribute to my current research directly, but will undoubtedly inform my research in the future.",
    "Provided a great background for political theory and ability to read literature which I would have previously been far less comfortable with."
