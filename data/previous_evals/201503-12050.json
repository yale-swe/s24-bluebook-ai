    "French 140 is a difficult course and if a student doubted their French abilities I would highly recommend starting at a lower level. If a student felt up to the task, I would recommend this course and am sure it would greatly improve a student's abilities with the language.",
    "Professor Langlois was a great teacher. Class was always fun while still covering the necessary material, would definitely recommend him. French 140 is a solid class, and definitely a manageable workload as long as you stay on top of readings.",
    "This was a fine class to finish a french student's experience learning grammar and vocabulary in the classroom, but I do think it reaches the limits of what can be absorbed in such a setting. I would encourage a french student to consider studying abroad in place of this course."
