    "Hebrew with Ayala is tough and a lot of work, but also fun and worthwhile in terms of what you get out of it. YMMV, but my after-school Hebrew from middle school carried me through about 2-3 weeks, after that the material was almost all new, although having some prior exposure to the language definitely helped.",
    "If you are considering taking Hebrew, stop considering and just take it. It is not too difficult once you get over the learning curve and it is fun! Do it, you will not regret it.",
    "This was among my favorite courses at Yale. I loved learning a new and challenging language. The Hebrew department is excellent, especially Ayala. The homework was a bit heavy, but it ensured that students knew that material for the exams. Weaknesses would be sometimes a bit of a casual classroom environment, probably more the students fault than the teachers.Be aware that there are every week discussion section with TA in addition to the movies, Hebrew events, and Hebrew tables. This is a very heavy time burden for busy Yale students.Hebrew is a great language. Most students are Jewish and have some familiarity withthe language, but I did not and still did well.",
    "If you're interested in learning Hebrew seriously and putting the time into it, then Hebrew L1 is literally the perfect class for you. After 1 semester you will be able to say and understand so much, and Ayala is an INCREDIBLE professor. It is quite a chunk of work because you cover so much and have quite a bit of homework, but it's a really wonderful class if you seriously want to learn Hebrew.",
    "Great class. You'll learn a lot and Ayala is the BEST",
    "Yes, I would definitely suggest taking this course. Within one semester, I can converse comfortably in present tense and speak with a vocabulary covering a range of topics. I'm excited for my next Hebrew course."
