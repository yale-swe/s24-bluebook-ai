I would not say it has a particularly higher workload than other courses; it's about average. It can be a fun course overall, which I haven't heard from many of my peers in some other language departments. Of course I have no way of knowing, but I can say German is a solid choice.",
    "Yes, the course is an excellent introduction to the German language.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course if you are even the slightest part interested in learning German.",
    "Yes! The course is easy and you learn a lot"
