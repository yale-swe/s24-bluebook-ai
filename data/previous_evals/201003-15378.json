    "A lot of work, but that's to be expected.Not a bad class. But, it's kind of lame to have class every single day.",

    "I would recommend it, i would just want them to know that it is a lot of work and moves at a very fast pace.",
    "I would definitely recommend Spanish 110 with Oscar Gonzalez to another student. Professor Gonzalez is very fair and is a great teacher without putting immense pressure on his students like other sections may complain of. Do not worry about the supposed \"massive workload\" of intro Spanish that is often discussed. The workload is very manageable and you will not feel that having Spanish everyday is not worth it once you see how much Spanish is learned by the end of the semester. Take this class!",
    "If you have to take it, take it.",
    "Definitely. I can now have a somewhat valid conversation in Spanish, and I started from nothing!",
    "Be ready to do a lot of work! Its learning a language but 10 x faster than any high school language class."
