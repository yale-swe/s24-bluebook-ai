   "comments": [
    "I would recommend ENAS 850 if a student is interested in applied physics, materials science, or semiconductors",
    "Yes, I will recommend it to other students.",
    "Yes, it is an useful class",
    "If you really want to learn something, you can choose it. But you may struggle with your grades.",
    "I would recommend the class if your research involves optical and\/or electronic properties of materials. This course is essential in laying the groundwork for how these properties work.",
    "Good",
    "Course teaching the fundamentals of solid state physics. I would highly recommend the course, either for students going into solid state research or for students just wishing to learn more about the topic; there's plenty of room in the course to get out of it what you want.",
    "It goes from the basic solid state phsycis to semiconductor and devices. So I think itis worth doing.",
    "ENAS 850 is a brief but extensive overview of crystal structures, vibrations, energy bands, semiconductors and insulators. Semiconductor devices, Fermi surfaces, and optical properties of dielectrics are also covered. I would recommend this course to students interested in learning about the basic terminology in the field, but not if they are only concerned with specific semiconductor devices and engineering applications.",
    "I may not recommend this to others, because I found it was not really helpful for me to grasp the basic ideas of solid state physics and it was too hard to prepare for exams if one doesn't understand everything in detail."

   "comments": [
    "Solid State Physics is the fundamental for my research.",
    "Yes.",
    "Very much explained optical and electronic properties of materials. Extremely useful for device fabrication.",
    "Yes",
    "This course was very helpful in preparing me for performing research. I'm beginning material science research, so many of the topics (crystallography, band theory, semiconductors and device theory) were immediately useful, and will continue to be.",
    "Because my work is related to solids, this course introduces the thing I would use in my research",
    "Working on photoelectric devices, the course helped me to understand the solid state physics behind the process. This course helped me to understand energy band and semiconductors much better than before.",
    "At current stage, I don't find this course very helpful, because I have learned the same contents before. And it helped me to go over those materials but also confused me somehow on my understanding of some concepts. I believe this course will contribute to my research, and that is the reason I chose this course. It may help me in the future when solve problems in research."
