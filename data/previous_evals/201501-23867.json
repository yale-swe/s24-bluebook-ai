    "Would highly recommend.",
    "yes, yes, yes, take it. even if you don't think you like art history or architecture, you should take it. Craig is one of the best lecturers I've had at Yale.",
    "As a graduating senior, this class is one of the top 3 lectures I took at Yale. The material itself is fascinating, even as someone with little background in architecture. Buckley is an INCREDIBLE lecturer and has this creative yet assertive style that makes the material even more interesting while granting the course a strong framework and structure. He and the TFs are really friendly and flexible, and the exams avoid the rote memorization of other similar lectures, with the final being mostly noncumulative and the midterm and final each only involving something like 30 slide IDs to memorize. Subsequently, you can actually focus on course themes and trends as you study, and so you leave the course with a thorough understanding of how architecture, homes, and living spaces evolved over the course of the last 150 years.",
    "Very good course- could have maybe been a seminar by the size. Section was a bit of a formality.",
    "This is a great class! Professor Buckley is a great lecturer, perhaps the best of all of the art history lecturers that I've had, and the course's content is wonderful as well. Even as a senior architecture major, I was introduced to many building and architects that I hadn't encountered in previous courses. You'll get mostly residential architecture, but will also be exposed to some broader issues of urbanism and cultural movements to contextualize the constructions that you look at. The readings can really enrich the material that you cover in class, so I would highly encourage you to take a look at them, especially the primary sources. Overall, one of my favorite classes at Yale.",
    "A fascinating overview of domestic modern architecture. Highly recommended."
