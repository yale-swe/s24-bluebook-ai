   "comments": [
    "I learned about certain medical topics (osteoporosis, eating disorders, mental illnesses, etc.) and Spanish vocabulary related to these topics.",
    "I learned SO much about the anatomy of the human body and different diseases and mental illnesses that can affect human beings. I also learned the best way to cure them and ON TOP OF ALL THAT, I learned how to communicate everything that I learned in Spanish!",
    "This class was helpful for getting back into a Spanish mindset and learning vocabulary and the basics of medical conditions and care.",
    "From a science perspective, I learned a lot about human anatomy and physiology. More importantly, I learned how to discuss medical concepts and issues in Spanish. I developed my writing and analysis skills in Spanish, as well as the ability to speak and present on complex information in Spanish. I feel confident to write about and carry a conversation in the language, especially about topics related with medicine and legal policy surrounding that.",
    "I learned how to communicate in Spanish, particularly the use of specific grammatical structures and syntactical rules when developing papers and essays. I also learned extensively about various aspects of medicine and anatomy.",
    "I developed my spanish speaking, writing, and listening abilities. The class wasn't hard but it did definitely maintain and even improve my level of comfort with spanish",
    "My writing improved a lot as there is homework for every class and I learned tons of Spanish medical vocabulary that has actually really helped me in my volunteer work.",
    "I learned various medical terms in Spanish and lightly studied a few organ systems (the immune system, the urinary system, etc.). I also learned a bit about other medical topics (like triage). For my final paper, for which we could choose virtually any topic, I chose to study cultural competency in medicine, and I did some wonderful research into this that I technically could have done without this class but probably wouldn't have, so I'm grateful for that.",
    "Writing skills--the homework assignments helped me practice my reading comprehension and fluidity.",
    "I learned all about different illnesses and how they are discussed in the spanish speaking world.",
    "Extensive knowledge of medicine and relevant medical terms. I left the course with brilliant information regarding numerous body systems and diseases. HIGHLY recommend this course to anybody wishing to learn about medicine or simply become more aware.",
    "Learned medical terms in Spanish and a lot of other technical terms that you wouldn't use in normal everyday conversations.",
    "Knowledge of medical terms in Spanish, how to talk about various diseases, the various components of talking about illnesses and medical conditions (symptoms, diagnosis, treatment, etc.)"

   "comments": [
    "The course is an interesting survey of medical topics, and it is good for students who want to practice their listening skills and are very self-motivated to learn Spanish. However, it is quite disorganized, and I do not feel that my Spanish improved over the course of the class. There aren't many opportunities to really practice speaking or engaging with the content. More groupwork, more talking, a more organized syllabus, and fewer English activities (podcasts and TV shows were often in English) would benefit the course. The course packet is also unnecessarily large.",
    "Professor Mercedes was definitely a major highlight of this course. She makes the class incredibly enjoyable and does her best to ensure that we are all learning the material to the best of our ability. She is very flexible and she is willing to do her best to show\/incorporate material she thinks the class will enjoy most and learn the most from.",
    "This course's strength is that it is a low-stress but very informative environment. I felt that I learned a lot of what I was hoping to get out of it without having to worry too much about my grade. Mercedes is a blast, and she's very willing to make sure you have the resources you need to succeed.",
    "The course material is very rich and engaging. Profesora Carreras is incredibly patient, understanding, encouraging and helpful in building students' confidence in Spanish. I enjoyed the weekly homework \/ essays and the final projects & presentations were worthwhile in fully learning about a medical topic and presenting to class. It would be helpful if the course packet had a table of contents, and if the schedule of readings was created at the beginning of the semester. This would help in planning and completing the homework assignments. It would also be helpful in understanding the flow of the class. I found it tough to find a theme in progressing from one topic to the next (e.g. we went from Parkinson's to the Kidney to other systems, but it wasn't clear why the course was structured in that way. And, the book was also not ordered in the way the class was structured - it would be helpful if it were ordered after the class structure).",
    "The course presented very interesting topics and drew from a lot of my background knowledge. Sometimes the class could be disengaging because it was early and there was not a large emphasis on organic class participation.",
    "The course was very reasonable in its expectations. Prof Carreras was an excellent and engaging teacher. Not a course that will change your life but I can find few faults in it.",
    "I think there should be some group work to encourage participation from everyone in the class, as opposed to lectures everyday.",
    "Strengths: Every now and then, the professor would give us an ungraded quiz that covered the topics we had learned about in the past few weeks. Given that there are no official tests or quizzes in this class, I found these informal assessments to be INCREDIBLY useful, as I otherwise would have retained nothing from this class. My only regret is that we didn't do more of them. I also really enjoyed learning about things like triage, which I've never learned about before in English or in Spanish. It'd be great to see more topics like this in the course. Furthermore, there was one time where we listened to a doctor interview a patient in rapid Spanish, to see how well we comprehended it. This was very interesting and useful for my Spanish skills. Lastly, the feedback on the written assignments was great and very helpful. Weaknesses: WAY too much English in this Spanish class. We would often watch program like Bones that were (1) completely in English and (2) only marginally related to medical Spanish. We would answer questions about them in Spanish, but it would still be a pretty fruitless endeavor, both in terms of learning Spanish and in terms of learning medical Spanish. It would be great to minimize these kinds of activities, if not completely remove them. Things like TED talks may be best assigned as homework, with the homework being to watch the videos and answer questions about them. I understand that this class is designed to be easier than other Spanish classes, but this kind of homework would not make the class much harder, and it would leave more time in class for actual medical Spanish. The videos we watched in Spanish were less problematic but still only rarely related strongly to medical Spanish, which is unfortunate. I just think it's a shame that there were some classes where I worked more in English than I did in Spanish. The lecture style of the course was also not fun, as it prevented me from speaking Spanish (apart from briefly answering a question that the professor raised). Lastly, she had us do some role-play at the beginning of the semester, but stopped early on; I really enjoyed this activity and wished that she had kept it up, as I think it has potential to get people more involved in the class. I got the feeling that she did this role-play in response to a student evaluation, but stopped because we didn't seem that interested; I suggest that she persevere a bit more next time, as the problem may not have been lack of interest. The only reason that I rarely participated was that I was nervous, but even I would have tried out the role-play if we had done it often enough.",
    "Professor Carreras is an absolutely wonderful instructor. I learned a lot from the class and very much enjoyed it.",
    "I can honestly say there are no weaknesses. The syllabus was clear, the content was exciting, and the assignments enriching.",
    "I thought this course was great at providing an overview of concepts in medical Spanish. I learned so much, and my only suggestion would be to make the Canvas site a bit more organized. It seemed like there was material on our Canvas site from other years and that just made it confusing to find work. Otherwise, I think the class was structured in a great manner. I loved how we integrated readings, videos, and even music into learning various vocabulary words and concepts.",
    "Readings are interesting, but assignments are pretty dull and mostly just summarizing articles or answering questions directly out of a reading or video. Would have been interested in having broader discussions about the healthcare system and current debates in our society about medicine, rather than just being lectured to about a different disease each day, though I'm sure other students might have enjoyed that part. Learning how to talk about current controversies around universal healthcare, vaccinations, etc. I feel like would have been much more interesting. I did enjoy the readings, supplemental videos, and other aspects that tied this course to pop culture, media, and current affairs."

   "comments": [
    "I recommend this course to students very passionate about medicine\/health topics, to non-native speakers, to students who just want to practice their writing and listening skills, and to students who want a Spanish course that won't demand much from them.",
    "YES! Most definitely! You learn so much technical material about medicine and you have the opportunity to improve your Spanish skills abundantly",
    "If you're looking for an L5 Spanish class or if you're premed, this is a great option. Be sure to be early on the first day -- it's bound to be crowded!",
    "I highly recommend any student proficient in Spanish (L5) to take Spanish for the Medical Professions, and especially students interested in science or medicine (not necessarily premed; could be pre-law or anyone interested in health policy as well). Profesora Carreras is amazing- she is extremely kind, patient, and encourages students to speak in Spanish even if they are a little rusty. The course structure is 2 weekly written homework assignments, a 15 page final essay, and a final project presentation. The grading is very fair and transparent. The class helps you develop your writing and analysis skills a lot because of the assignments, but if you are also looking to develop speaking skills you will get as much as you put in. Sit in the front of the class and engage with Profesora \/ the class material as much as possible to really benefit from the class. Ask questions, contribute, and participate.",
    "Yes - it was very interesting and manageable and I'm very glad I took it.",
    "Absolutely. It was not a huge drain on my time, which was a life saver as I was taking several challenging stem classes concurrently. I learned a lot about the medical practice and got a chance to polish my spanish (esp. writing in formal contexts)",
    "Yes. The only problem is that it is a 9am, so make sure you're a morning person.",
    "In honesty, probably not, unless you really just want an L5 foreign language credit with minimal workload. If you sincerely want to improve at Spanish, take a more rigorous course; the grading in the Spanish department is generally pretty generous and you can learn a lot, whereas in this class there's too little emphasis on learning Spanish for that to happen. The lecture format of the class (as opposed to the discussion section format of most other L5 Spanish classes) also makes learning Spanish harder. If you sincerely want to learn medical Spanish, this class also isn't too great. You don't learn enough terms to actually be able to function in a medical environment. To be honest, most medical terms are derived from Greek (as opposed to the Latin on which Spanish is based), so the terms tend to be cognates (for example, what's the Spanish word for osteoporosis? Osteoporosis! (But with a Spanish accent)). Thus, you could learn a lot of this on your own if you wanted. The teacher of this course is marvelous, but the class isn't really designed to improve your Spanish skills; it's designed to be easy. I think what upset me most about this class was that it seemed that most people there weren't really interested in learning Spanish; they spoke English at every opportunity and rarely seemed deeply engaged. I'll admit that I was doing a lot of credits this semester, so having an easier class was nice, but I wonder if it was worth missing the chance to work on Spanish more in another, more rigorous course. I think that it's possible to make this class more rewarding without making it hard, and I sincerely hope that the professor can find the balance.",
    "Definitely. It is a very relaxed environment that facilitates learning.",
    "Mercedes is DOPE! Take her class its low work load with 12 sentence paragraphs due every class, a final presentation, and a final 10 page paper. Was not a stressful class to have my spring semester.",
    "Take this course!!! Whether you are pre-med or looking to better learn a language, I think this is one of the best classes at Yale.",
    "Yes!! This course is great, especially for peolpe who are considering entering the medical field.",
    "Definitely! It's a really great chance to practice your Spanish and learn new terms if you want to go into a health profession or do health-related work. Professor Carreras is awesome and creates a very encouraging learning environment!",
    "Depends on what you are interested in - I took this because I needed to take a Spanish course, but was not really interested in the medical component. I still found the readings interesting, and was able to use the final presentation and paper to explore topics I cared more about that were related to medicine, but I was fairly disengaged in the class itself. If you want to actually be able to talk about medical issues in Spanish, this course is probably well suited for you. Workload is pretty chill, two fairly low-key assignments a week, though they still do take time to complete."
