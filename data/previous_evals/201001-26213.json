    "This course is very important to biostat students, I think. It should be a must-take one. From this course I was able to understand some tough theoretical problems. Professor was able to go into depth and details of a theory and interpreted the problem very clear. If he can introduce more example, the course can be even better.",
    "The course provides a rigorous, and sometimes quite intensive, introduction to glm. It is heavy and proofs and derivation and is a great building block.I would of liked to have maybe a full lecture or two that showed how to do (with full examples) some of the glm fitting using R.",
    "This course was very useful! It tied together a lot of theoretical concepts that were missing from other more applied biostat courses. The lectures were for the most part an appropriate length (besides the one lecture that was over 80 slides!), and the HWs were VERY helpful even though some were quite time consuming. It was nice to include both material from the textbook and some more current material not included in the text (e.g. ROC methodology). I also like that there were notes provided before class, but they were supplemented quite extensively throughout each lecture with proofs and examples. The only thing that I'm comment about that could be improved is more class time... maybemeeting twice a week or making this a two semester course? The material seems so important and we really covered A LOT in a short amount of time. It would be nice to delve a bit deeper into the course material.",
    "This was a good class. Prof. Ma was really helpful in office hours (I didn't go too often because I had a class during his hours). I didn't do well on the midterm and was touched that he took time during spring break to e-mail back and forth with me about it. After we got the midterms back, I re-did the midterm and feel like I understood the material. It was just a bad exam, and I felt better knowing that Prof. Ma understood that. He's a really good guy. I liked the final project a lot too. My partner and I (once we met with Prof. Ma to brainstorm) had fun going through the paper and I found it to be an excellent experience. This was a really good course. I didn't love the book, but I really liked Prof. Ma!",
    "A really good ans useful course overall",
    "good introductory course of GLM, could organize the material better in the future"

    "Instructor: Shuangge Ma \u00a0Professor Ma is extremely approachable and is more than willing to spend time with you to help answer your questions. I would definitely take another course with him again.",
    "Instructor: Shuangge Ma \u00a0Great! Willing to stop the lecture for questions and comments (there were a lot of them!)... available during office hours. Quick to respond to questions through email... and flexible in terms of assignments (in the sense that time was taken to explain HW question that was confusing and options were given regarding the final exam structure).",
    "Instructor: Shuangge Ma \u00a0Prof. Ma is a REALLY nice guy. I didn't go often to his office for office hours (I had a class right after GLM) butwhen I was able to meet with him I loved it: He was nice, easy to talk to, and very helpful. He's really smart and I sometimes felt a little bashful asking questions, but he made me feel like it was OK to make mistakes. He definitely made me a better biostatistician.",
    "Instructor: Shuangge Ma \u00a0He presented the material really well. Thank you.",
