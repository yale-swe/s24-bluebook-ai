   "question_id": "AC350",
   "question_text": "Were the resources available to you - library, fabrication labs, classroom, software, desk space, etc. adequate for the fulfillment of the assigned work?  If not, please make suggestions.",
   "comments": [
    "Yes, resources were excellent",
    "Yes.",
    "The library has the most ridiculous hours of any library I have ever been. To open at 2pm on Sunday, is shameful. The art and architecture building is the only place a student in the architecture dept can go to work on a paper in silence, and its hours are not helpful. Even if they could keep part of the library open for paper writing (since there is not adequate space available for books and materials in the labs) it would be very helpful.",
    "I wish we could take books out of the library for more than three days.",
    "yes.",
    "The library hours of operation as well as checkout time was terrible.",
    "N\/A.",
    "The library is not conducive to study for this course or any other course that requires research. We should be able to check out more than one book at a time. We should be able to check out those books for more than one day at a time. End of discussion. A library is not a museum for books. If you want us to learn, the library could do more to make me want to read and not fear a five dollar fine.",
    "Good - using the Eiffel tower documents in the beginning was a great way to get involved with the material. Would love that sort of tie in again.",
    "Yes.",
    "Yes.",
    "Library policies are very rigid. Research is manageable, but made somewhat difficult by some of these rules. If books are placed on open reserve, there should be at least another copy in open circulation",
    "Library was available but found better resources at other school's libraries",
    "There was very little assigned work (only the paper) and it was up to us, the students, to find the material we needed.",
    "I feel that our architecture library is very inadequate. There are not nearly enough books available to do adequate research.",
    "The library here at Yale is not as comprehensive as I would have liked, but the journal resources made up for it.",
    "The library was open and it was closed, that's the way this library works. I do wish the hours were more accomodating to architecture students, but that would be miserable for the librarians who would be working around the clock.",
    "All the resources were above adequate, save for the speed of the computers at our studio desks. If more ram could be added to these computers there would be less crashes and our productivity and efficiency would be much higher.",
    "Resources were available",
    "Copier and scanner equipment at the library is in high demand because of the one day loan policy. Often times I found myself scrambling to document information because multiple copiers were broken or out of toner."
