   "comments": [
    "The course is interesting and useful in its aims, but the actual experience is dependent on a lot of factors including class size and classroom dynamic. This year the class size was too large and so I think it lost some of it's potential in motivating fruitful and engaging discussion. Additionally, it was in a classroom not fit for debate, but more of a lecture style. However, since the class design is discussion, there was clearly a tension in goals and implementation.I think given a limit of a 10-15 students, the class will be more effective in motivating participation and learning, and people will gain more from it.",
    "great class. well structured (though the class presentations might have worked better with a smaller class), I loved how the assignments were set up, and the professor is great at facilitating discussion while ensuring that we actually learn something rather than just talking out of our own experiences all the time.",
    "Very poor. I don't care what a bunch of second year policy students think about the issues. I care about what a professional working in the field thinks about these issues. The discussion was a bunch of ill-informed opinions and cliches. Lead the discussion but also take control and set the agenda.",
    "This course really helped me work out the process of policy analysis and also the components of a policy analysis brief. Very helpful!",
    "It was pretty much a class on writing a policy paper. There was no need to have weekly class sessions and there should have instead been more feedback on our paper along the various stages.",
    "Overall the class was ok. I enjoyed discussing health policy issues. However, I feel I did not learn as much as I could have about HOW to analyze a policy. Classes were also a little to free-flow. I would have appreciated a little bit of lecture to grasp core concepts. Also, perhaps the class could have been organized as if we were doing an analysis verbally... 1) what is the problem and why, 2) possible solutions, 3) weight solutions... etc.",
    "I really enjoyed the beginning of the course when we had readings out of the Deborah Stone book. I would have liked to see that more integrated throughout the course. Toward the end, I felt like we were just discussing various policy issues, instead of learning the \"tools\" of policy analysis. Unfortunately, I think the class size was WAY too big to have productive discussions. I realize that it's a required course for HPA, but I really feel it should be no more than 20 students in that class in order to have a good discussion.",
    "Strengths: great opportunity to dive deeper into the materialWeaknesses: there were too many people in the class. the class size should be capped.",
    "The course provides a good skill (policy analysis) which I found helpful in other courses, too. However, the class, itself, was not ideal. I think it was mostly because the course was just TOO BIG this year, and didn't allow for sensible conversation. The material was mostly interesting and relevant, but was just not designed for more than 20 people max. Class time was therefore slow and monotonous, unless you were one of the few people who contributed.If the class remains the same size, the format needs to change to be much more interactive (in smaller groups, perhaps) or include a significant lecture component or smaller assignments.",
    "The biggest strength of this class is the discussion-based approach with student opinions and feedback. Keeping the class to a 20-25 students would be more effective and engaging.The structure of the paper writing was perfect. Writing a first draft allowed students to get thoughts down on paper and gave time to solidify the paper more. It made the final paper not the first draft. Please do not change this.",
    "Excellent introduction to policy analysis.",
    "There was too much emphasis on class participation. It would have been nice to have somr portion of the class devoted to lecture.Other than that, I learned a lot; the most useful skill I got out of the course was how to conduct policy analyses in a structured format.",
    "Strengths: important course to discuss health policy, great instructor, fair workload.Weaknesses: health policy is a mess. Not enough outrageous remarks to engage people and find balanced arguments on all sides.Way to improve: the instructor should be more bold and direct in challenging people to discuss and defend positions in health policy issues. Smaller class size would be preferable. It would also be helpful to hear 'inside information' from current health policy makers and health policy advocates.",
    "The course was very interesting - especially given the current context of healthcare reform. The class size was a bit large for being discussion-based but Dr. Keenan managed the room well.",
    "Strengths - course critically addressed numerous topics in health policy and helped me learn to analyze them from a policy perspective. Flexibility of course was great in letting us write on topics that interested us.Weaknesses - size of class was too large which made class discussions intimidating or awkward at times.",
    "i think i learned a lot from this class in terms of how to do objective policy work. i think the class should be much, much smaller--more of a seminar format.",
    "It coincided well with current events which made for interesting topics and overall the course was good exposure to the policy analysis process and how to approach it from different angles. Could be improved by having more structured class discussions and perhaps incorporating some lecture.",
    "Overall, this course provided the unique opportunity to have open discussions about various health-related topics. The greatest weakness of the course was the class size. I felt that it really undermined the quality of the discussions.Several members of last year's class shared a lot of enthusiasm about this course that I did not feel this semester, and I think one of the biggest differences between last year's class and this year's is the class size. We had around 35 students, which made it very difficult to carry fluid and effective discussions.",
    "The idea of the course is good, but it is not executed well. The class was too large for us to have meaningful discussions. The class size needs to be cut down, probably in half. The readings did not seem extremely relevant to the interests of many in the class. The readings focused mostly on minute parts of health care reform, rather than other health policy issues. Professor Keenan should have had more structure to class meetings. She tried to let things run as a fluid discussion, but it was not well moderated and it was not enlightening. She should share more of her experience from working in policy analysis. It would also be helpful if she prepared a summary of key points for each class period. I felt like I didn't take that much away from the class meetings.",
    "OK -- well-constructed, good readings, but just way too much open-ended, seminar-style, \"What do you think?\" kind of classes and not nearly enough emphasis on teaching solid information about health care, policy, government, policy research. Of course there should be a mix of both, but this skewed too far towards aimlessness.Assignments are good."

   "comments": [
    "Instructor: Patricia Keenan \u00a0Patricia Keenan is a great professor - she's supportive and always prompt at responding to any queries about the course and\/or assignments. The only thing that I would recommend (again, this is contingent on class size) is if it remains a large section, then more lecture and less discussion might be better. The 'only discussion' framework works if the class is small and so one improvement might be to have prepared a basic lecture format for the first few classes to see how they unfold.",
    "Instructor: Patricia Keenan \u00a0great professor - informative, easygoing, good at facilitating discussion, etc.",
    "Instructor: Patricia Keenan \u00a0Needs to learn how to lead discussions more effectively. I feel like she taught only 2 hours, in total over the semester. The rest of it was other classmates talking or giving presentations. I think the syllabus needs to be revised and there needs to be a greater emphasis on really teaching good policy analysis skills.",
    "Instructor: Patricia Keenan \u00a0Dr. Keenan is a very good teacher.She is receptive to student's interests and given the current healthcare reform issues, she was very timely in the issues that she brought to the class.",
    "Instructor: Patricia Keenan \u00a0She was very knowledgeable, but I would have appreciated a bit more structured classes. Maybe the large class size was a inhibiting factor.",
    "Instructor: Patricia Keenan \u00a0Very responsive to students and provided great feedback, particularly on the final policy analysis paper. Unfortunately, with the large size of our class, I felt like our discussions sometimes went off on unproductive tangents.",
    "Instructor: Patricia Keenan \u00a0Strengths: Open to discussing anythingWeaknesses: Had difficulty adapting to the size of the class",
    "Instructor: Patricia Keenan \u00a0Dr. Keenan is an excellent instructor. She is passionate about the topic and really seems to care about the students' opinions.",
    "Instructor: Patricia Keenan \u00a0Knowledgeable and helpful with feedback when given, but her style (sitting down, attempting to facilitate discussion from the front of the room) was not conducive to a large class size. It would be good for a small seminar, but it meant that people in the back of the room didn't participate and had no incentive to get involved.",
    "Instructor: Patricia Keenan \u00a0Professor Keenan was amazing. She was always available to provide feedback and to talk about health policy. She was not only a great professor in class but also dedicated a lot of time to meet her students, to get to know them better, and to help them become better writers. I appreciated all her help.",
    "Instructor: Patricia Keenan \u00a0Very responsive instructor. Took the policy analysis class well and made us understand how policies are analyzed.",
    "Instructor: Patricia Keenan \u00a0I liked her, but again, I wish she gave a lecture for some part of the class instead of relying on us to discuss the issues for the entirety.",
    "Instructor: Patricia Keenan \u00a0Patricia is very patient and inviting to class discussions and personal interests in health policy. Some ways to improve the teaching is be more confident in steering discussions in certain ways. Add more emphasis on things that are critical lessons in health policy and perhaps even ethical health policy practice in each class.",
    "Instructor: Patricia Keenan \u00a0Dr. Keenan engaged the students as much as possible fostering a lot of interesting dialogue from the many perspectives within the room. Her feedback on all of the assignments was detailed and very thoughtful - I was impressed she spent that much time reviewing everyone's work. It may be helpful if she spent the last 10 minutes or so summarizing key points of the week's readings or discussion.",
    "Instructor: Patricia Keenan \u00a0Patricia was very knowledgeable on various subjects discussed in course and lead class discussions well. At times I wish that we, as a class, were allowed to go back and forth with one another in class during discussions, which I think would have made discussions more lively.",
    "Instructor: Patricia Keenan \u00a0patricia keenan clearly knows her subject and appears to enjoy teaching--her teaching style is laid back and she prefers to allow the students to broach the issues without interjecting with too much personal opinion. i believe this is appropriate. sometimes, however, i wanted to know more about her experiences doing policy work etc. because her background is so interesting. keenan is also approachable and seems to value student interaction.",
    "Instructor: Patricia Keenan \u00a0Professor Keenan is very knowledgeable and passionate about the topics she presents. She is also very approachable and interested in student opinion and reactions to course material. Overall, she was a good instructor and exposed the class to the nuances of policy analysis, but it would have been nice to hear more of her opinions and a bit of informative lecture on different topics. She wanted discussion to be open, but since there wasn't a lot of guidance or structure from her they were sometimes not very worthwhile- people sometimes didn't have much that was meaningful to say and so the quality of class-time was not as good as it could have been if Prof. Keenan shared her thoughts or information more.",
    "Instructor: Patricia Keenan \u00a0Professor Keenan did a great job of creating a comfortable environment in which she encouraged us to share our opinions. She was very open to our comments and responded with great feedback.",
    "Instructor: Patricia Keenan \u00a0Professor Keenan should have had more structure to class meetings. She tried to let things run as a fluid discussion, but it was not well moderated and it was not enlightening. She should share more of her experience from working in policy analysis. She seems like a very nice professor and seems knowledgable about health policy, but did not let her full ability and experience shine through. She was extremely helpful in one-on-one meetings, but not as effective in the classroom setting. It would also be helpful if she prepared a summary of key points for each class period. I felt like I didn't take that much away from the class meetings.She seems like a very nice professor and seems knowledgable about health policy, but did not let her full ability and experience shine through.",
    "Instructor: Patricia Keenan \u00a0See above - very comfortable discussions but aimless; too much focus on discussion. Professor Keenan herself is very likeable, friendly and funny."

    "great class.",
    "Don't take it unless you have to. Boring, tedious, and your classmates are your instructors.",
    "Overall this course is good, but VERY discussion-based and not very skills-based.",
    "A good introduction to how to write a policy analysis",
    "This is a good course that gives you a chance to look at health policy in a deeper way, but it's best in a small group.",
    "Required.Useful for future policy work. Not the best class. Needs to be much smaller.",
    "I would highly recommend all public health students to take this class. This class teaches you how to analyze policies and to form opinions based on readings and through discussions. Writing the policy paper helped to understand the complexities and the challenges of writing a concise and an effective paper. Communication and writing skills are essential to any job in the future.",
    "A must-take course for HPA Students. Interesting course too.",
    "Teaches you how to conduct a policy analysis, which is an analytical tool that can be employed outside of policy. Very heavy emphasis on class discussion.",
    "Important course for health policy students. An opportunity to think and discuss various health policy issues that hopefully lead to an expertise. A course to hear arguments,opinions and worldviews from fellow classmates (sometimes for better, sometimes for worse).",
    "Great course - the discussions and readings provided me with a more solid grounding in the issues important to healthcare reform and policy analysis.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone looking to further their knowledge and analytical skills of varioushealth policy issues.",
    "you will be exposed to current policy issues and learn how to do objective policy analysis with and without recommendation. i recommend this class but the class does not reach it's potential because of the unwieldy size that drowns the quality and quantity of individual students' participation.",
    "The course was a good overview of policy analysis and how to create policy analysis pieces, and the current events of health policy made for some interesting topics. However, since the class was not very structured in terms of discussion, it sometimes became a bit boring and repetitive when people did not have much to say or hadn't done the reading. Overall, Patricia Keenan is a very interesting professor so I would recommend the course...",
    "With the appropriate number of students, I think this could be a great class for discussing health topics. Professor Keenan does a really great job of creating a foundation and pushing students to build upon it. She is very responsive to students and their concerns.To further improve policy analysis skills, I would recommend this course.",
    "OK, gives you plenty of room to read and do your own thing but is seminar-style. You're on your own to teach yourself and even to figure out what to teach yourself."
