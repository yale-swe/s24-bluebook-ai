    "Take this course if you want to learn some of the nitty-gritty basics about finance, especially as it relates to China, from a practitioner. (Or to learn about other things that relate to finance, like the Euro debt crisis... or other things that relate to China, like social stability or the one-child policy.) The work is minimal; the lecture\/discussion is always topical and never wishy-washy. Awesome 5th course if you're at all interested in China.",
    "This course provides a surprisingly good basic knowledge of finance, which someone without any background will find tremendously useful, while someone who took a higher level course in the subject will find boring. The same can be said for its information on China: someone who doesn't know a great deal will find it interesting, but I'm a little dubious that anyone who lived or studied in China will hear much in the way of new information. The best suited person for this course is someone who wants to work in China. I have little intention to do that, so I found the course frequently uninteresting and often tuned out. Fortunately, the course is also very easy to do well in, so there were little blowback from my inability to pay attention. You don't seem to do the reading, which consists mostly of newspaper articles and chapters in an excellent book on the development of China's current economic structure. Overall: take this course if you want to work in China, but be prepared for a less rigour.",
    "a survey of not only theoretical financial structure, but tips on how to do business in china, how to run chinese companies, and how to maintain business relations in china.",
    "YES, Clements is amazing. While not every seminar was terribly engrossing (Clements does have proclivity towards lecturing instead of fostering discussion) the content of the course and the knowledge of the instructor made up from any temporary boredom that arose from a dry subject. I highly recommend taking any course that Clements offers.",
    "Great straightforward class on China's financial system with neat personal insights from Professor Clements, who has done quite a bit of business there. Not a lot work, but the paper does give you freedom to explore something you're particularly interested in.",
    "Yes, I would, if you are interested in China and it's financial system. Great class. learned a lot about China's Financial System. The lecturer was great too! he clearly knows a great deal about China and its system. but i feel like the class could have been more organized. and the lectures could have been divided into better segments, addressing one different topic in every seminar meeting. Overall, great class!Lovely class discussions and relaxing style. also not so much work. The final paper is a good dry run of senior thesis.",
    "Take this class.",
    "Yes, because the final paper is a good one to write and the professor is warm and a great source of knowledge, though don't be prepared to learn everything about China's economy.",
    "Yes take it if you are interested in China and finance."
