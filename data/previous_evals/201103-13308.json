   "comments": [
    "If you are interested in the topic material and want to read about it (that's how you will learn most of it in this class) definitely take it. Dean B is amazing, so that alone might be a reason to sign up for the course as long as you have some interest in the course material.",
    "I would recommend this seminar to another student. A lot of the discussion focuses around sociological evaluations of genocide and genocidal societies. Toward the end of the semester we also have a couple of weeks where we discuss policy approaches to intervention in genocide, prevention measures, and post-genocide state building. It is a mix of sociology and political science. I think that taking a look at the syllabus is the best way to evaluate whether or not this class would be something you're interested in, especially because discussions are completely student led.",
    "Good, interesting class. Definitely take it. Hard to get into, a lot of people are interested. Exposed to a lot of material that may be new, but definitely interesting and necessary to know.",
    "Yes, if you're interested in genocide.",
    "It's a survey of the major genocides of the 20th century. The class really doesn't allow room for contesting the fact that these were all genocides because you learn how each of these cases fits the interpretations (both legal and sociological) of genocide. You study four cases: Cambodia, Rwanda, the Holocaust and Bosnia. There is a lot of reading for the course and Dean B doesn't allow laptops in the class so you have to be engaged in the discussion or come prepared with notes in order to effectively participate in the discussion. She's the Dean of TC, so she's great at relating to students and understanding when you need extensions on assignments.",
    "If you can get in, YOU MUST TAKE THIS COURSE. Dean B is fantastic - she knows just how to guide discussion and encourage everyone to share their ideas. You'll love her, everyone does. Some of the readings are better than others, but as a whole, the syllabus is really interesting. (I've picked up a few other books by some of the authors just for fun.) I was also incredibly impressed with my classmates, who were very articulate and intelligent. Discussions were always great! Plus, Dean B brought in candy and Bosnian coffee, and we got to watch movies. Combine that with interesting discussions and you've got what I expect from any great seminar.",
    "This is a good class. It's very illuminating on the comparative context of genocide, and covers the main ethnic conflicts\/genocides of the post World War II period thoroughly. The material is obviously depressing and hard to grapple with, but it's obviously important to learn about these conflicts and the similarities in how they come about to be a knowledgable and functional citizen in a global era.",
    "This class totally depends on the people in it. The syllabus is nicely organized and readings are not overwhelming, but we often went on tangents that didn't relate to the readings because most people in our class had at least some personal experience with genocide - whether it be having family who lived through it or working on projects that dealt with it. If there is any reason to take this class, it would be because of Dean B. She's a gem and if you have the opportunity to take a class with her, you would be remiss in not doing it.",
    "I would really recommend you take this class because it give a great foundation into the subject matter, but you also have the flexibility to investigate any area of genocide that interests you.",
    "Genocide and Ethnic Conflict is a pretty amazing class. The material is heavy, but so important. You emerge from the class with some serious perspective on everything from human psychology and group dynamics to postcoloniality to the machinery behind international affairs and the human rights regime. Discussions are always engaging and readings are powerful and varied. Great class - it's hard to get into, so make sure you can make a good case for yourself! Also, if you're heart-set on taking it, try before your senior year - I was rejected as a junior international studies major specializing in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and had to reapply senior year, but it was worth it for sure."
