   "comments": [
    "A lot of work with very tough problem sets. Probably the toughest course for the semester.",
    "Hell.",
    "Very difficult math class, but an important foundation for a physics graduate student. I would only recommend to a physics graduate student for obvious reasons.",
    "Useful",
    "This is probably the toughest course of the core three that you would take your first semester. The homework's in this course usually take the longest and much of the material is probably new to you.",
    "Focuses more on pure math.",
    "I would recommend it. I would say its hard, but I learned a ton and it helped me grow as a physicist.",
    "This course is just a review of tricks. I would not recommend students take this course because tricks can always be learnt when you really need it.",
    "I would not recommend this course to another student.",
    "I would recommend it because it is a core course, but I think people can get more out of it if more relevant material (suggestions of books or notes) was provided.",
    "Yes. Good course for those who want to learn math well.",
    "The course is ok, but the amount of covered material is too much. Some of the topics are covered in less than one lecture and there's not enough time to deep understand the new concepts. I would probably not recommend this course, unless the syllabus is improved.",
    "Summary: an overview on many mathematical tool for physics.I don't know if I would recommend this class to an other student: math methods are extremely important and, as far as I know, this is the only class provided on this subject. On the other hand, I think this course completely missed its purpose: it wasn't rigorous enough to be mathematically satisfactory nor \"practical\" enough to be useful."

   "comments": [
    "The course definitely adds to my knowledge of how to do some of the mathematics involved in physics, although, since I'm planning on going into experimental work, I doubt this course will contribute as much towards my dissertation\/research.",
    "I learned things, but from outside resources...not from the course.",
    "The course did not necessarily deepen my knowledge, but laid groundwork for future work. However, it could have been taught in a more familiar way to strengthen the groundwork. How it contributes to my research remains to be seen, but it will likely have been useful.",
    "It helps learn more math",
    "I struggled the most in this course and likely got the lowest of my three marks in this course but I did learn a significant amount that I did not know before. The topics of asymptotic expansions and spectral theory in hilbert spaces was very interesting.",
    "It gives me mathematical techniques. I just hope i recognize when to use them.",
    "Note: I think this course could be excellent if more applications to physics were discussed in detail.",
    "It did not help me to increase the knowledge, just a refreshment of my memory. I am going to forget them in six months.It definitely contains some tricks that are helpful to my research.",
    "It hasn't yet but might be helpful.",
    "I believe that some of the more advanced topics were quite helpful, in particular the asymptotic expansion theory applied to integral function and non-linear differential equations.",
    "I hope it helped for the Qual"
