    "Yes, I would highly recommend the class - a well-taught, broad overview of the material. Reasonable reading load.Sections with Hussein were very helpful in processing the readings and lecture material. Hussein is clearly quite well informed, and has a pleasant manner. Plus, it was nice, for me, to have a TA who is Middle Eastern, and whom I assume is Muslim, to complement the Europeanness of our professor (though I do not know what, if any, faith Prof. Griffel professes.)Only caveat: perhaps it was a bit much to have a 15-page paper and a final exam AND a midterm for one class - that is far more than most graduate seminars.",
    "I would recommend the course to another student, especially one who is interested in the development of Islam from Muhammad to the 19th Century. It provides a good foundation for studying Contemporary Islam.",
    "an informative and interesting survey of an important topic",
    "The title of the course, Islamic Theology and Philosophy, speaks well the the subject matter. The course moves historically through the major theological and philosophical movements from the origin of the tradition, up through the modern era, excluding a brief portion of the 15-17th centuries. I would definitely recommend the course to others. It is a great introduction to Islam for those who want to move beyond the bare bones learned in high school.",
    "Yes. It is great.",
    "RS 717 01 is an overview of Islamic theology and philosophy, from the time of Muhammad to the 20th century. I would recommend it to anyone interested in Islam and\/or the history of theology or philosophy."

   "comments": [
    "Well, it served mainly to provide a broad background in the history and development of Islamic theologies. It helps me contextualize Christian theology, especially Middle Eastern and African Christianity, and will hopefully help me better understand my Muslim brothers and sisters a bit better.",
    "This course greatly helped me learn more about the history of the development of Islam and what issues were crucial for Muslims after Muhammad and until the present. Since my studies are focused on African Religious Experience, this course was invaluable.",
    "This course rounded out crucial areas of knowledge for my field and provided opportunity to explore areas related to my research."
