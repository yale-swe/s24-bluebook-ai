    "The library lacked the books that I needed for my research - most of them were in Italian. Also, the policy of one day book check-out continues to thwart well-developed and prepared research, considering the limited hours that the library has on the weekend.",
    "books which were noted to be in the library, were often not. Where are the books???",
    "The library has frequently cited weaknesses in its lending policies. One day\/one book is ridiculous. The time limit should be at LEAST three days, if not a week. Second priority would be allowing multiple books checked out at a time; five would be reasonable, if a limit is even necessary."
