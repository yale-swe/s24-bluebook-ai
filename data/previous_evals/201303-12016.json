   "comments": [
    "Yes, definitely, a heavy workload but totally worth it if you enjoy the material.",
    "Interesting class, good discussions. Professor can be a bit intense leading discussion but he never put anyone on the spot. LOTS of reading--don't expect to be able to do it all. Short paper and long paper that requires a foreign-language source, so get started well before reading period",
    "Its a spectacular class but is a massive amount of work. Take it if you're willing to work and think the material is interesting. Also, don't be afraid of the professor - he's brilliant and is really cool after the first couple of classes.",
    "This was a great class. Definitely take it.",
    "Yes, great history seminar. You learn a lot about areas of the world you probably haven't studied. Will help you understand current events better knowing this history.",
    "Overall it was a good course and an interesting perspective on the Cold War.",
    "Absolutely fantastic. I wouldn't change anything about this course, which I don't say about most courses. Well designed, and Friedman is a great leader in seminar discussion. Good balance with the workload, and I enjoyed coming to this course every week. I learned an incredible amount about the Cold War in the Third World, which is under-studied, and I left inspired to further study this topic."
