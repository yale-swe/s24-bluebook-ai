    "Didn't know what to expect.",
    "I was hoping to have a fully resolved project with great renderings\/drawings\/models but I felt like the studio got started a little too slowly and my project suffered in the end as a result.",
    "I expected an experimental investigation into what a new typology for contemporary cinema could hold. My expectations were not met as there was neither a clear approach nor research method brought to us, nor a search for potential based on the brief. While the brief showed much promise, it is clear from the resulting projects that the lack of direction resulted in fairly standard buildings and screening spaces. The introductory exercises did not relate to the program and thus did not contribute to creating interesting buildings. The lack of criticism from the critics led to stagnant process.",
    "My strongest concern was that there was not an in-house critic in addition to Joe Day and Michelle Paul. All advanced studios with out-of-town critics should be required to have an in-house instructor meeting with students every Monday."
