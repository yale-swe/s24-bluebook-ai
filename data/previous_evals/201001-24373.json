   "comments": [
    "Way better subject-wise than intro micro. But Fair is really boring!",
    "Material itself is interesting, lectures aren't good. But the book its great. If you have the option of taking it with a different professor I would",
    "interesting, but be ready to question why you went to lecture several times",
    "Material is very practical but lecture is insufferable",
    "Great class, learn a lot, not too demanding. Read the book, or go to lecture and skim the readings.",
    "I recommend it if you plan to pursue economics and take higher level courses.",
    "I think that macro teaches basic skills that all adults ought to have. I would recommend taking some econ at somepoint in your Yale career.",
    "Do not rec unless you're an econ major. VERY boring. Could learn this on your own time.",
    "Don't take it if you can avoid it. Though it is not too hard, it's so boring.",
    "Econ 116 is a pretty comprehensive course. The midterm and problem sets are fair. The final is, like all economics finals, a bit harder than expected. I would recommend this class to prospective econ majors or anyone who wants to be able to better understand the world around them.",
    "Lasciate ogne speranza voi ch'intrate.",
    "I would not recommend this course to those who are not committed Econ majors. The seminars seem better.",
    "Do not take this. Take a higher level class that actually has substance to it so that you won't be bored to death.",
    "This course presents information you absolutely need to know about the way the world economy works and its relationship to macro news you see every day in the NY Times. The material is difficult, the lectures are sometimes tedious to follow, the tests are very challenging, and it is hard to get a good grade, but I STILL think everyone who is even mildly interested in politics and economics should take this course. It's about personal improvement and being a good world citizen.",
    "Interesting course material and explained well. However the lectures can be a bit slow and boring and the lecture notes are not as good as micro.",
    "If you are going to be an Economics major, and think that you should take this course because of that, take it. If not, DO NOT TAKE THIS COURSE. You may think that you should take an economics class to better understand the economy and be a better citizen. That is probably true. However, do not pick THIS particular one.",
    "Take the seminar if at all possible. This class is poorly run and, at times, excruciatingly boring.",
    "the post-spring break part of this course is MUCH better than the first part. once you get into open economy transactions, the material actually gets interesting very quickly. don't listen to all the people who say that all you have to do is read the book and not pay attention in lecture. the book doesn't help on the psets a fair amount of the time, and although Fair may quote it in lecture, he still deviates from it. conclusion: don't substitute book reading for lecture. he actually says a lot of stuff you need to know exclusively in lecture. try to take notes on his handouts, and if you can't, try to befriend the people that sit in the front row who ask him a million questions. Fair is nice and tries to help people out, but the class can get tedious, especially in times when there is no overlap between the book and lecture, and you're not sure regarding what you'll need to know. The TAs are awesome though, and you should absolutely go to section.",
    "Yes! This course is excellent for all students (particularly econ. majors). It allows a student to vastly improve his or her knowledge of the US economy.",
    "important class but be aware of the teacher because he does not make class engaging",
    "In this day and age, I suppose every college graduate should know something about economics. Econ 116 provides you with the broad overview of the macro-economy that allows you to read the Wall Street Journal\/NY Times Business Section and understand what they're talking about. In this sense, I think it's a good idea for anyone to take this course.",
    "Recommend it only if you plan on majoring in econ",
    "Intro Macro is tough, and the lectures can be boring, but it's a requirement for the major and something that you need to take.",
    "Yes; I think the course material overall is valuable.",
    "Pretty good intro class for macro. You learn the basics, instruction is pretty clear, lectures aren't great but Ray a personable guy and explains the basics. take it if you're considering majoring",
    "You need to take it, so just get through it. It's not too hard, the exams follow the problem sets, and the material itself is cool if the class isn't.",
    "Don't take this class with Ray Fair. It's unbelievable that such a great school could offer this course with a straight face. Lectures are absolutely useless. Take the seminar or take it in the fall.",
    "classic intro course",
    "Macro is one of my favorite subjects. Understanding how exchange rates work, what government stimulus does to the economy and how the Fed operates is a crucial part of being an informed voter and every student at Yale should have a basic understanding of economics. That said, the way this class is taught is abysmal. I honestly came away shocked by the dismal dismal quality of the lectures day after day... which you know, is a real shame considering that this is supposedly one of the best universities in the world.The rumors about Ray Fair's lectures are true. They are bad bad bad. Fair himself is a very nice guy, obviously cares about the material quite a bit and the fact that he's willing to take time out of his day to go running with students and explain econ to them is cute. However, all this does not make up for the extremely poor quality of his lectures. Not only are they next to impossible to understand but at times Fair gets flustered and can't even figure out how to explain the material (one day he spent twenty minutes trying to explain why the AS curve is vertical in the long run and ended the class by saying he would try to figure it out for next time). Further, the lecture notes that Fair provides are awful. Think handdrawn pages filled with indecipherable scrawl.Somehow though I still ended up learning quite a bit in the class. The TAs are competent and willing to explain the material that Fair misses during his lectures. I still think that, on balance, the average Yalie should take this course but the fact that the lectures are so bad really gives me pause over recommending a course that I think should otherwise be required to graduate from college.This is unfortunate and Yale should strongly consider getting a new professor to teach this course. Let Fair teach seminars and do research and get someone else to teach this very important course.",
    "If you want to be an econ major, you have to take this or the seminar. There's no calculus, which is good, although it can be helpful to know it. Listen in section and read your textbook closely. That is your best friend in that course.",
    "Although many people claim that ECON 116 is quite boring, I totally recommend it for those who want to learn about the macroeconomy. Professor Fair is a world-renowned economist, very famous for his model to predict presidential elections and his model about the U.S. macroeconomy. If you want to have a solid liberal arts curriculum, you should take Introductory Macroeconomics with Professor Fair.",
    "A very thorough course that covers interesting topics throughout the whole semester. Would recommend to use for a distibutional requirement.",
    "I would recommend the seminar for macroeonomics. It's a subject that requires open discussion.",
    "A easy way to understand how the economy works...much better than micro",
    "If considering taking the class, best of luck, but if taking it, do not bother attending the lectures or sections. By doing the reading diligently an reviewing the graded problem sets, one can excel at the course without dealing with the highly uncompelling professor or TAs.",
    "I would recommend taking the class only if you are willing to put in the extra effort to pay attention during the lectures and learn from the book because it is easy to miss information during the lectures.",
    "I would recommend this course so that you can understand the macro news you read about.",
    "Unless you plan on being a econ major I would not recommend this class. The lectures are hard to follow and the information is relatively boring compared to other So credits you could get.",
    "Take it if you want to learn the basics of macro. It won't be a tough class, and you'll leave knowing more than you did about the world. Not as boring as it's made out to be.",
    "You may be inclined to take this course for at least two reasons as a non-econ major.You may think your future employers want it; you may think your future employers demand it. Take the time to consider two points: first, your future employers are not all narrow-minded folk who are afraid of hiring non-econ majors; second, this course is an utter waste of time for most who take it. Read a better econ textbook, and study on your own! These are good things to know, but not in this setting. And if you find that you are unwilling to study it on your own... guess there's your answer, buddy.",
    "If you're not looking to put a lot of work into the class, but still want some basic knowledge of macroeconomics, then this class would be good for you. However, for freshman, the seminar seems to be a better class for macroeconomics if you want to put more work into it. It gives students a more rigorous overview of macroeconomics, but the curve seems to be tougher.",
    "Good introduction to macro. Lectures can be quite boring, but section is more important anyway.",
    "Economics 116 is an introduction to macroeconomic theory. You learn about how the United States economy functions, and then apply this knowledge to a more global scale. I would recommend this course, as every bit of knowledge I have learned I have been ableto apply to my understanding of economics today. My ability to understand what is happening in the newspaper (with regards to economic issues) has vastly improved from this course. I think all of the knowledge verges on common knowledge, and it is very important to know.",
    "I would not recommend this class. Although I appreciated Ray Fair's attempt to make the material practical and applicable, the class had no structure and was impossibly boring.",
    "good class if you are interested in learning the basics of macroeconomics",
    "It's good stuff to know, but you won't have a good time learning it.",
    "Not bad for macro, pretty hard though.",
    "Pretty good class that will get you thinking about current events and make you think, too. Overall, exams were pretty challenging and problem sets were helpful in getting me to think about the material. Ray Fair really is a fine lecturer, and he does a great job of walking the class through the thinking behind macroeconomics, even if at times it makes for dry lectures.",
    "You will have to read the book to get through this class.",
    "This is definitely no the most well-taught class you're going to take during your time at Yale, but the material is interesting.",
    "10 problem sets, 1 midterm and 1 final. The final is worth alot of the grade but if you study you will be fine. Take this class to fulfill IS, EPE or a QR requirement but overallk econ is a good subject to understand in everyday life.",
    "The class really gives you an appreciation for macroeconomics but let me warn you, lecture is a drag. Professor Fair runs his 150 person lecture like a classroom and this year began pulling out a random number generator along with an alphabetized list of all the students in the class. If your number was selected, you'd be asked a question on the spot for everyone in lecture to watch\/hear. It was awful. To make it worse, Professor Fair is monotone and unengaging. He mumbles quite a bit, too, and he's inarticulate. Lectures moved at a very, very slow pace. 75 minutes of lecture felt like 3 hours. Before commiting to this class, be aware of the fact that grading seems--and sometimes is--quite arbitrary. Also, get a group of friends together to study for the midterm\/final. It will make your life a lot easier. This class is just one of those classes that works best with a study group. (This was especially true in preparation for the final, as Prof. Fair gave us the previous 2 final exams but no solutions for either of them. He lost them, apparently.) If you're looking to take this class just to learn about macroecon, there are many better ways to go about gaining such knowledge. If, however, you're taking it to fulfill a requirement, try to make the best of it.",
    "Can be a bit dull but if you need it for a credit or don't want to take the seminar, it is definitely a good class.",
    "Important stuff to know for anyone interested in econ\/polisci or anyone who wants to be a better informed citizen. Problem sets are short, easy. I recommend it, though it's not the most thrilling course.",
    "Interesting content, not very well taught, but great textbook. Take it if you want to be an econ major. Otherwise dont waste your time",
    "Its boring but you have to take it just try to study a lot for the tests and youll be fine",
    "I really enjoys Macro this semester! The classes were interesting, as was the material. Professor Fair did a great job connecting the course material to the realworld, and all of the TAs were helpful.",
    "Yes, by all means",
    "Interesting concepts and good material to know",
    "It's a typical intro course, with the added bonus that things can get very convoluted because of the models of the economy. However, you will walk out with a better understanding of how the economy works, and for that reason I recommend you take it.",
    "If you are not interested in economics, then this is not a class to take for credit. It is not much work, but it can be difficult.",
    "It was an okay course. The Professor is really nice, but he's not the most engaging lecturer. I didn't think it was as bad as people say though.",
    "Yes, the course is an excellent introduction to macroeconomics.",
    "Interesting material but bad professor. I would recommend the seminar.",
    "Great course. I learned a lot and it will be useful for future econ courses.",
    "The material in this course is interesting, but Professor Fair is not as engaging as he could be. He is dedicated and tries very hard, but the lectures may bore you. The book is really great though, so read it to do well on the exams and use the old practice exams as guides! If you need it for your major, take it, but I would not recommend that you just take it if it\u0092s not for a requirement.",
    "A decent course. A love that current events were worked in, and I feel much more knowledgeable about and able to understand both domestic and international economic issues that I see in the news everyday. I feel like I got a basic grasp of a broad range of issues. It was a good overview of macroeconomics. Lecture was not always the most interesting, but, in general, the course was valuable. Not a huge amount of work.",
    "Take the class if you need it to be an econ major. Otherwise, it is a lot less math oriented and more \"what if\" thinking.",
    "Great class",
    "Let me be straight to the point: take this class, don't take the macro seminar. I know what you're thinking, I read the reviews for both of these at the beginning of spring semester also and there are a lot of dings against Fair. Here's my reasons for advocating this class: 1)Ray wrote the book for the course. His book is used by college campuses all across the country as the staple intro macro book. He's also been teaching this class for countless years. This guy definitely knows what he's talking about. 2)All of the bad reviews for Ray are due to one thing: his monotone voice. People say his class is boring, but that's simply not true. If you pay attention and listen to what he's saying, it's obvious that he is extremely insightful and knowledgeable of macroecon. He is very straightforward in his teaching, and does it well; he just didn't have the blessing of a charismatic or interesting voice. But if that's all you cared about, you wouldn't be at this school anyway. 3)His course is straightforward and solid. He's been teaching the course the same exact way for countless years and has it down to a formula. You will know exactly what you have to do, what to study, and how to study to succeed in this class. This is a departure from the freshman seminar, which tests you on obscure and minute details and thus doesn't truly measure your intelligence\/hard work. Trust me, almost all of my friends took the freshman seminar and regretted not taking it with Ray Fair by the end of the semester.One more thing: Many reviews will say that you could not go to lecture and just read his book before the test. While this may be true, this semester has shown me that it is a LOT easier to learn the material and do well when you go to his class. The professor is the one who writes the tests, and he asks questions during the lecture which are very similar to test questions. This should be obvious. Go to class, stay awake, read when you get the chance, and you will succeed in this course.",
    "take macro in the fall semester",
    "Intro macro - buy the book, look at the handouts, and the practice test. The midterm was awful.",
    "I would recommend Introduction to Macroeconomics especially if a student is interested in becoming an Economics major and wants to learn more about it and also because Macroeconomics is a good subject to know about. However, I might recommend trying to get into an Introduction to Macroeconomics seminar simply because it is difficult to learn Economics in a big lecture class.",
    "It's true. The lecture kind of sucks. But Fair gets a worse rap than he deserves -- he isn't amazing by any means, but he's no worse than other mediocre to poor lecturers I've had here. Don't let that scare you away from this course. The material is really interesting, and you will come out of class with a better understanding of the world around you. It's a course that will honestly help you understand newspaper headlines, and imparts knowledge valuable to any informed citizen. If you're interested in how our monetary system works (or don't know what that means), I suggest you at least shop it and see if you can handle the lectures.",
    "If you have interest in the material and do not mind teaching yourself I would recommend it. Class is extremely boring but the work is very managable and I have heard bad things about the seminars.",
    "Yes, take it...even if you're not an econ major, it's good for general knowledge and useful for understanding news and government fiscal and monetary policy.",
    "Take it if you have to.. but it's a pretty worthless class since you don't get a QR.",
    "Fair's Macroecon has a reputation for being a boring class. However, as one who is interested in Econ, I didn't have a problem self-motivating myself to pay attention to the class. Once you get past what I honestly believe is a relatively minor problem (which, could be isolated to the fact that he lectures in a somewhat monotonous voice), you begin to realize that he has an excellent understanding of Macro. The text book is also extremely helpful if you \"forget\" to pay attention in class.",
    "This is an introductory course in macroeconomics. Professor Fair goes over a lot of major concepts and does a good job attempting to explain current economic affairs by the topics we have learned in class. I would recommend that you take this course only if you are interested in the material or have to take the course.",
    "I would not recommend this course to another student. If you really want to take an intro macro course, I suggest you taking the semniar one, which I heard from my friends that it is a lot better taught.",
    "Take it if you need to take it.",
    "I would not recommend taking this class with Ray Fair because it is rather confusing and boring. Although he knows his stuff, Fair had trouble teaching many simple topics and thus the lectures were not incredibly interesting.",
    "Yes, I would recommend it as long as the student will put in the time to go to section and read the textbook because she won't learn enough from lecture. Looking back, I have enjoyed the course because of how applicable it is and how important it is to have at least some understanding of the macroeconomy."
