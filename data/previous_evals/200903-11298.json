    "It is usually a requirement. Great for econ.",
    "Yes.The workload is not bad and is only sporadically intense. The subject matter is not that difficult. I felt as if I learned a great deal, I will be able to apply what I have learned to other subjects later in my academic career. Multivariable Calculus is useful to know and I'm glad I learned it in this format, in this class.",
    "If you don't intend on being a math major and want a general introduction to future math topics, this is the course for you.",
    "good class for prospective econ majors looking to get in and out. also a decent QR if you aren't terrible at math.",
    "Math 118 features the basics of linear algebra and multivariable calculus; it's like a watered-down Math 120. The concepts aren't too difficult to grasp, and the actual arithmetic involved isn't that hard. Make sure you get a good professor for this course. Lee isn't the greatest, but you can bite the bullet and take the class with him because he was a fair grader.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student. Even if math is not your strong point, you can still do well as long as you show up to class and do your work.",
    "It's a class where you have to teach yourself or get a classmate for help.",
    "I would recommend this math for econ majors. It is a good way to get the requirement done and the information itself is not too hard.",
    "`IT WAS HARD. HARD FOR NO REASON. THE MATERIAL WAS POORLY TAUGHT BY AN INSTRUCTOR WHO HAD TO TRY VERY HARD TO MAKE HIMSELF UNDERSTOOD.",
    "If you're an econ major and don't want to take 120 take 118."
