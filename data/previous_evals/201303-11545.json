   "comments": [
    "Lot of information but not a ton of work. I would recommend this class if you are interested in american politics and how the government has changed. Professor Skowronek knows it all",
    "If you're interested in American politics, and especially the president, then I would take this class. It's a fascinating exploration of the presidency, both historical and recurrent, and I left the course really having learned a lot. One warning, however: Professor Skowronek doesn't really use visuals while he's lecturing, so definitely shop this course before you decide whether or not to take the class.",
    "Yeah, if the student wants to learn about the background institutional development of the presidency.",
    "Really interesting just too much material to cover. The professor is really smart and knows a lot of information about the presidency. It will be a lot of material, but if you actually do the readings, the class could be enjoyable.",
    "Take this class! But go to lecture; everything makes a ton of sense and the material is fascinating if you do go to class.Minimal work\u00e2\u0080\u00a6The midterm is a take home essay, and the final was very straightforward (though it was worth 60% of our final grade).",
    "YES. It is the best political science class at Yale.",
    "Take this. You might regret it when you're reading 150 to 200 pages a week, but you will definitely not regret learning the material or listening to the professor. This is an amazing course, definitely one of the best I've taken at Yale - also one of the hardest, both in terms of quantity and quality of work expected. I wish that the percentage distribution of the final grade weren't quite so absurd: 60% for the final is a lot, especially when it doesn't feel like there's a good way to improve as you go through the class (only one paper before the final doesn't give you a lot of room for useful feedback). The grading aside, the material and the presentation were both incredible; Professor Skowronek has the gift of both writing and oration and lecture was like story time twice a week. Section had high expectations, but I don't think that's a bad thing. It certainly made me read more carefully and think more critically, and I don't think those skills should be underestimated.",
    "Great class! The material is very interesting, and the lectures super informative. Be prepared to actually do the readings though and the final is daunting: 7 essay questions given before hand and 2 are actually on the final, and then pick 11 of 17 ids. However I feel like I have a much better grasp of the office of presidency and I'm glad I took the class.",
    "if you are interested in american presidents and the patterns of history than take it for sure but if you are not the work is not worth it so dont",
    "Yes. If you like american politics or just want to be more informed about the development of the presidency you should definitely take this class.",
    "This is a very interesting class. The first half focuses on the historical development of the institution of the presidency and the second half focuses more on theories explaining the power\/success\/legitimacy of the modern presidency. There's one ten page paper around midterms and a final (which counts for 60% of the final grade). Neither are unreasonable.There's a LOT of reading, but the reading is interesting and my TA did a great job helping us understand the more complicated stuff. (If you can, get Patrick O'Brien -- he knows what he's talking about!) I learned a LOT.",
    "Great class if willing to do all the readings",
    "I think American Presidency is an incredible course on the historical development of the Office in American politics. Skowronek has a fantastic lecturing style, and is amazing at drawing links between the theory of the Presidency and a litany of real-world historical examples that explain the same. I recommend this course very highly to anyone who might have even a passing interest in the material.",
    "Definitely take this class if you can. I loved it!",
    "I would recommend the class not too much work and interesting."
