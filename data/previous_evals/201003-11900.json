   "comments": [
    "It'sa demanding course with an enlightening syllabus and lectures. Do it. Be prepared to work hard though - especially if you are a freshman, since the class is dominated by sophomores and juniors taking the class for the literature major or for distributional requirements.",
    "If there's a bunch of classic literature that you feel you should have read, but never got around to, this is the course for you. The workload is easy, the text is fun, and all you do is talk about literature. I recommend it.",
    "The course was valuable and the curriculum went quickly enough to stay interesting. I highly recommend requesting teaching fellow Heather Klemann.",
    "take it if you're interested in literary structure, but not if you want to learn how to write better",
    "Take it if you're thinking about being a lit major. It's actually pretty cool.",
    "You're probably a lit major, so you have to take it anyway! But even still, I'd say the class was pretty chill and we read\/watched some interesting works (there can be quite a bit of reading at times). No midterm or final and only four 5-6 page papers due over the course of the semester.",
    "I would recommend Litr 120 to another student. The book selections were mostly great, there were a couple of good movies that we got to watch, and I learned a great deal about literature. As a science major I am kind of scared of literature and writing courses, but Litr 120 was really enjoyable. The work load is a bit heavy (a book every week, rarely two books for one week), but they try to split up the longer books into manageable parts. There are only four papers you have to write, so overall it's not bad.",
    "This is not the kind of literature you've done before. Which is to say, though perhaps you have read some Faulkner or Dickens or Borges before, you've never read it like this. This is not a class about symbolism and motifs and themes, except insofar as those things relate to narrative as a whole. Intro to Narrative is about the construction of narrative itself. It is not about what the author is making you feel, or what they're trying to say, but how they are trying to say it. The professors teaching it are awesome, intelligent, and funny (Professor Quint once brought in props to reenact a scene from Sherlock Holmes, for example). If you're a prospective Literature major, this is a great chance introduction to comparative literature as a field. If that sounds at all interesting to you, you should definitely check out this class.",
    "This course requires a lot of reading, but they are interesting. I recommend this course to those who like to read and need a writing credi.",
    "I took this course for a WR and was fairly satisfied. Four papers: one 3-page, two 5-page, and one 8-page paper analyzing various works. None of them was too bad--you get several prompts to choose from. I was worried about taking a lit. course because I'm not the biggest fan of making stuff up about the author's intentions, deeper meanings, etc...but this wasn't too bad. The lecture\/seminar split was interesting, though I don't feel like I got a great deal out of either (especially because you couldn't write anything on what was discussed there), but I think that's my fault and not the course's. Professor Quint was good: enthusiastic, supportive, witty. I don't know how the other professors were, but you couldn't go wrong taking it with him.",
    "I would recommend this to anyone with an interest in learning to take a new approach to literary analysis. In this course (at least, when studying with David Gabriel, who I recommend highly), you look at literature in terms of structure rather than content (though the two are certainly related). The student will get out of this course whatever he or she puts in. You can get away with doing less, but you'll get less out.",
    "Solid class. You read a lot of interesting stuff, some of which is more interesting than other bits. The lectures were usually of high caliber. The overall experience you'll have here depends on the professor you get for seminar -- try to get one of the younger professors or one of the professors that is only listed as a professor in the Comp Lit department, and not Comp Lit \/ English, because they'll usually be more willing to broaden the scope of discussion. Workload is very light, but probably won't teach you a lot about the Lit major or narrativity -- take LITR 300 for that.",
    "Lit 120 is really a unique Yale course, and overall I really enjoyed it. The workload is very reasonable, the material is really interesting, and you get both a lecture and seminar environment. I'd definitely recommend it, particularly if you need a writing credit.",
    "I would recommend this class. The readings are awesome.",
    "Great intro literature course - not too difficult.",
    "The readings for the most part were enjoyable and the teachers are all quite friendly. It's worth taking it for a survey of different types of novels. Not too stressful for a WR credit.",
    "LITR 120 consisted of a mix of lecture and seminar classes. HUGE weakness: we were never informed of how we were being graded. At all. So, the entire class, we were actually entirely unsure. The professors in the Literature department are quirky, but they know they're stuff, which if you have David Gabriel you'd only find out if you went to office hours. To be honest, don't take it if you don't have to. I'm an English major now thanks to this class. If the entire Literature department is this unorganized, I just don't want to deal with it. Take another class for the WR credit; the readings may seem interesting but you probably won't be doing them by the second class because they're hefty and you can get by without reading. No worth the time.",
    "Entirely what you make of it. Great syllabus. Take Alryyes' section!!"
