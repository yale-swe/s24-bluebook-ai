    "Psychology 670 01 is for any kind of student, regardless of the student's familiarity with the subject material. I highly recommend this class to anyone, from those looking to fulfill a requirement in a degree toward some psychology specialty to those who are simply looking to get their feet wet in this incredibly interesting field.",
    "I would not recommend this course to another student unless it was necessary to fulfill a requirement. The level of discourse was not especially sophisticated, the instructor did not make sufficient effort to make the course engaging or foster discussion, and the course was not well suited for learning.",
    "Survey of the history of ideas related to personality theory in psychology. Would recommend, yes.",
    "No, I would not recommend this course to a fellow student. Never in my career as a student have I endured such awkward silences as I did in this course. Coming to class was unpleasant. Speaking up in class seemed fruitless, since virtually all of my ideas seemed to get dismissed or shot down."
