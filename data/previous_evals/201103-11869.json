   "comments": [
    "Yes, I would recommend this course. It is very applicable and helpful when taking Physics 180.",
    "Take it if you must, it's not that painful.",
    "youre only taking it b\/c you have to. its WAY easier and less time consuming than orgo\/chem119",
    "If you have to take it, then take it and take it while you're doing Physics 180\/170. The material matches up nicely and I would hate to take this separately from the lecture, but if you don't have to take it don't. The amount of work is much less than some other labs like chem and the difficulty level builds up nicely without it ever being too hard.",
    "Take it if it's a requirement. Otherwise I'm sure there are more interesting labs you can do.",
    "I would recommend the lab if you are interested in a bit of experience in seeing physical principles first hand. That being said it is not an exciting class but it is informative and overall not a bad experience, although the final was rather difficult.",
    "Pretty painless lab, especially compared to orgo. You're probably only taking it because you have to, though, so be comforted by the fact that it's not too bad.",
    "I found this class less stressful than past labs I have taken, especially chem labs. You usually get out before 4.30. 1 page write-ups are really great. The grading on the reports is unclear--sometimes points will be taken off without an explanation. Make sure you have a good lab partner, it will make the class more fun. The practical at the end was tricky.",
    "If you need a lab this one is good because the lab reports take no more than an hour",
    "Yes, I am assuming you will likely take it as a requirement and it is not that bad of a lab.",
    "It's a pretty easy lab, much easier than orgo or gen chem lab. If you have to take it, go for it, but really you're not gonna learn too much.",
    "If you need to take it, it is not that bad at all. If you like Physics, then you would probably enjoy the labs because they are informative. Otherwise, it's pretty much up to you!",
    "Calculations take a lot of time and grading can be very arbitrary",
    "Definitely recommend, and not just because you have to take it for pre-med!",
    "Take if you need for premed. otherwise, not necessary.",
    "Only if you have to take it. The labs are not hard, but are often frustrating and your comprehension depends 100% on your TA (so pick a good one). Also, the final exam is major crunch time.",
    "Really great class. The work load is extremely manageable. My TA was great. The experiments were diverse, interesting, and really helped solidify concepts.",
    "Physics Lab part 1 is not a bad lab. The teachers have crafted an entirely new lab from past criticism to make it less painful and time consuming. From what I understand, it worked! One page lab report\/summaries every week helped to reinforce concepts and were not annoying at all. Quizzes were sometimes slightly tricky, but most of the time you could get a 100 if you just read the lab handout before coming to class. The in-class practical final is a marathon and studying won't really help, because it combines concepts in new ways that you just kind of have to improvise with. However, that is not to say that it was super difficult. Challenging, yes. But there's a curve! If you're taking it, this lab is required. Just know that it is totally fine and not a time suck.",
    "Easy lab, short lab reports (page or less!), cool demonstrations, chill instructors. Try to get Boris as your TF. This is as relaxed as labs at Yale get.",
    "I would recommend the course for another student because the labs were interesting.",
    "I would recommend this course if you've never had any lab exposure before. If you have, you'd probably find this course a waste of time, since it would be too easy yet time consuming.",
    "This is a really great class and can even help students understand certain concepts that are taught in the course. The course is relatively easy if you do the reading before each lab. The labs themselves are not difficult. The only difficult part of this class is the practical. It is very stressful and difficult to study for.",
    "I would recommend it to another student, its not very hard and some of the labs can be fun.",
    "Yes, I would recommend it. It actually does give you a good physical grasp of mechanics concepts without being too painful.",
    "Physics 165L is a good introductory physics lab course that tries to emphasize the concepts without getting bogged down with extensive experimentation and reports, and I would recommend it. Despite the fact that I was taking Physics 200 as opposed to 170 or 180 (recommended), the material in lab matched up very well with the material for the course itself. The instructors and TAs will challenge you throughout the semester to think critically about the procedures you are following to teach experimental design, but overall grading is fair. One final warning: don't overestimate your time on the practical exam at the end.",
    "Take it if you have to, otherwise why would you take a lab?",
    "take it only if you need it for premed or some other major",
    "PHYS 165L is a good intro lab course to teach you the basics of recording experiments, how to keep a lab notebook, and just to make you comfortable thinking scientifically and understanding data. It's not too much work and not intimidating in class. Good taken concurrently with PHYS 180.",
    "Take it if you need a physics lab, but I don't think it reinforces very strongly the concepts of Phys 180.",
    "This is the perfect introductory lab course for anyone interested in physics. The material is basic, but fundamental, and the experiments are interesting.",
    "Pretty laid back lab, one page lab reports due each week and quizzes most weeks during the lab. There's really no need to take it if it's not a requirement, though, but overall the workload is totally manageable.",
    "It's one of the most painless labs you'll ever take.",
    "Better than other labs! only three hours... you CAN'T stay longer and it's completely doable to complete the labs in three hours. less step-wise than other labs. actually requires problem solving and thinking so come to lab prepared and well-rested.",
    "Typical physics lab experiments--not too exciting. I personally am not a fan of physics and could not wait to get out of (Friday) lab each day, but the experiments do adequately demonstrate the concepts you learn in physics lecture.",
    "You'll only take it if it's required. That said, there's minimal work outside the lab (1 page write-up\/week). Lab can be boring - make sure you get a partner who you can work well with.",
    "Physics 165 covers fairly basic physics experiments. While the effort expended to prepare quality lab notes during experimentation can be somewhat tedious, lab reports\/summaries are not too difficult to prepare and the workload outside of lab is very manageable.",
    "It's a class that people take because they have to take it. I wouldn't suggest it for anyone else.",
    "If you need to take a physics lab, this is a good class to take. You see the laws that you discuss in lecture happen in action. The work for this lab course is very manageable.",
    "Phys 165L is a basic introductory physics lab course. You cover really basic principles in straightforward labs that are very low-stress. I feel like the lab helped me gain a strong foundation in basic physics concepts. The work load is very manageable. The lab practical was tough; I don't feel like it was very helpful in evaluating my understanding of the topics and labs covered during the semester. I wouldn't take the course for fun, but it was by no means a bad experience.",
    "The lab reports are short, although some of the calculations were difficult at times. The lab final exam was more difficult than what we have done in class, but other than that, it is a good intro lab course.",
    "PHYS 165L is a good introduction to laboratory methods. The lab write-ups are not too intensive, yet can be made difficult if you do not have a firm grasp on error calculations and\/or the conceptual physics behind the individual lab experiments. The teaching fellow really determines if the experience will be positive or negative.",
    "This class is good, in that the outside work isn't anywhere near as intense as gen chem or orgo labs. At times, it was a little difficult to understand the topics, but by using a hands on approach, it definitely made the concepts in physics lecture easier to understand. Definitely take it with lecture.",
    "It's normal. Not as work intensive as other labs. Can be fun",
    "meh",
    "Well you have to take it probably. But don't worry, the labs are interesting, and make sure to get a good partner the first time.",
    "Great accompaniment to Intro Physics. Very basic.",
    "Such a terrible class. Really annoying lab and it felt like they were just trying to waste our time. The TA's grading was incredibly opaque and he never gave us any kind of indication why he was taking points off on the lab reports. Don't take this unless you have to. So glad it's over.",
    "Only take it if you need to. The final is a very stressful time, both in studying for it and taking it.",
    "Pretty easy, lab reports are limited to a page and quizzes are also easy.",
    "Physics 165L is a pretty good lab relative to the other labs. There's not that much work every week, but understanding the labs can be challenging.",
    "It's physics lab. They try to appeal to the premeds. It's easier than most labs, but that doesn't mean that you don't have to put in work -- that is the mistake I made this semester and paid for it. If you take it seriously throughout, it is pretty easy and quite fruitful as well. You learn a lot of physics, especially if in you're in 170, as that class doesn't go over the major physics concepts I'd recommend it if you're into physics or you need to take it.",
    "This lab is not too hard, but despite possible first impressions, not excessively easy either. In terms of workload, it is about what a half credit should be (compared to other labs that have their own problem sets, etc.). If your level of physics knowledge puts you in Physics 180, then this lab should be a good match. Experiments roughly follow the order of the lecture course. Lab meets for 3 hours (no more, sometimes less) once a week, and your only out-of-class work is a one-page lab report each week. Be sure to get a good TA. I had a good TA, but others were not so good and grading is done by your TA also. (Hint: pick someone who is friendly and speaks fluent English.) If you absolutely must get an A, you might be frustrated with seemingly arbitrary loss of points on lab reports, but chill out (and again, this will depend on who grades them).",
    "This course covers the basic topics covered in intro physics. The labs are not difficult and the lab manual is very well written. The hardest part will be using the software correctly and finding error in all the calculations for graphs. Overall, I thought this was a good balance between credits, learning, and time commitment. You have 1 page lab reports each week which involve just reporting findings and discussing error\/ other discussion questions. There are also graphs (lots of them) that, depending on your TA, may be done in lab or with the report.",
    "PHYS 165L is a nice lab with the right amount of time spent on lab writeups.",
    "I hate labs, and this was one of the most frustrating labs I've taken. The lab handouts do not give explicit instructions, which was annoying. Though I understand the rationale behind this--wanting us to think for ourselves--it is often just really hard to focus on physics concepts behind the experimental procedure when you're just trying to figure out how all the different instruments work. It also didn't help that I had a very bad TA--probably the worst in my Yale career. Nick only confused me more every time I asked him a question. I suspected he wasn't ever prepared. I would have liked if he gave us a brief lecture at the beginning of the lab session (to make up for the unstructured lab procedure and explain those physics concepts that we needed to know), but he didn't. I also ABSOLUTELY DESPISE THE CALCULATION OF UNCERTAINTIES. I think the course could teach us about the idea of uncertainties (as we did in one of the lab experiments) without making us have to calculate them for our lab reports every time. They seriously took about 2.5 hours to calculate for each lab, especially for the ones with complicated math equations. That detracted from learning the actual relevant physics concepts. That was definitely the worst part of the lab for me. I think it is of vital importance that this be amended. It is a very useful part of the class.",
    "Phys 165 is a great lab to take. The lab reports are very short (just one page), but you still learn a lot given the background information given for each lab. If you take Phys 170, it's not always in-line with what you're learning in lecture, though, so you have to do some extra work during those weeks.",
    "Physics lab is a good lab course. It was not terribly stressful and the lab reports are a fair amount of work. Though, as with all lab courses, it should probably be worth more than 0.5 credits. The teachers are good and genuinely interested in helping students to advance.",
    "This lab is purposefully designed to not be a lot of work, which is very nice (I am pre-med). However, during the actual lab time be prepared to deal with annoying, and buggy equipment that will frustrate you. Beyond that, it is a useful class for the practical application of everything we learn in class.",
    "It was ok but took a good deal of time to figure out what we needed to do in our lab reports. I wouldn't recommend it unless you had to take it for a major or pre-med requirement.",
    "I don't see why someone would take this unless they had to. The lab reports are reasonble but labs themselves vary from easy and chill to time-consuming and frustrating. Could have been a lot worse though. The practical final exam was a killer though. Probably one of the most difficult things I've had to do at Yale.",
    "I would recommend Physics 165L to another student because it is better than other labs. The lab reports are limited to 1 page, and they are not graded in a harsh manner. If you don't have to take, which you probably do, then don't take it because it is not that good of class.",
    "Physics 165L is a daunting lab if you don't have a good grasp of Physics simply because some of the experiments are quite confusing to understand just by reading, and will be a challenge to get through. However, the write-ups are very short, and overall it is a good class, and the TAs are extremely willing to help you understand the processes going on.",
    "Phys 165L is pretty good as far as lab courses go. The final is difficult, but the labs are low-stress throughout. Lab reports each week are a maximum of one page in length, so you won't every spend more than around 2 hours working on a lab report. Still, it is a course you should only take if it's required of you for your major, etc.",
    "This is an easy lab credit. However, most of the labs aren't very interesting\/enriching. Take this course if you just need physics lab credit, otherwise you may want to try a harder (an more interesting) lab.",
    "This class is awesome!! I know that sounds weird for a lab class, but it is the best you're gonna get for a lab. The labs are set up so you actually learn what you're doing, and the concepts are applicable and interesting. Also, the professors make a real genuine effort to make it as painless as possible. (They totally re-wrote the class curriculum to make it better this year) They say their intention is to have the writeups take no longer then 45 minutes (realistically it is more lie 2 hrs max, totally completable the night before or even the morning of. If you need a physics lab, this is the one!",
    "Take this class if you have to, otherwise it's not that relevant. It wasn't very much work, however, and the TA's and professors were very helpful. Some of the demos were pretty cool.",
    "Only if you have to - but it's not a bad lab. Compared to all the bio\/chem labs I've taken, this was much better. Easy labs, straightforward, and relatively short lab write ups.",
    "Quite painless. Take it if you have to, not if you don't. Lab reports take 2h\/wk plus 2.5h in lab.",
    "I had to take this course for bio and pre-med, but it's not too bad a lab. The weekly reports are not that much work, but the uncertainty calculations are a huge pain. The final was also really hard.",
    "I thought physics lab was very efficient and enjoyable. It is shorter than most chemistry\/ biology labs, and the reports are limited to one page, so that was very manageable in terms of the workload. Looking back, you really do learn lots of physics concepts by working with the springs, magnets, ect. and the instructors really try to incorporate real world\/ biological examples into the lab. I found it to be much more fun and low stress than other science labs. However, the practical at the end of the semester was extremely difficult, so make sure you know what you are doing each lab because that will definitely pay off at the end of the semester.",
    "I would recommend it as it is necessary for a lot of requirements and is a fun way to get a necessary credit.",
    "The class is well-run and it is what it is. Some of the procedures are quite tedious, but I'm assuming you're taking this class because you have to, and in that light it isn't terrible. A lot easier than some upper level lab classes I've taken here. The reports are only a page. The practical exam is a minus but isn't ridiculously difficult.",
    "Don't take it unless you need it for major or pre-med requirements because it doesn't really add much to your understanding of physics.",
    "Not too hard but very tedious every week. only 1 page reports though",
    "Physics 165 is a great companion for Physics 170 and Physics 180. It often helps students understand what is going on in lecture. I would recommend it to a fellow student.",
    "As far as science labs go, Physics 165L is pretty good. One page lab reports, quizzes are very easy, and the labs are pretty interesting. The final practical was hard mostly because of time pressure. But overall a well organized, good, intro physics lab.",
    "About as painless as lab can be. It's boring, but it's shorter than orgo and chem lab, not too difficult, and the lab write-ups are short. Plus, there are stools and you can eat in lab.",
    "The lab is less work than general chemistry or organic chemistry lab, but it is quite boring and sort of a pain. The labs are not very intellectually stimulating and the work really seems like a burden. I feel like I learned little and took it to satisfy a requirement. The quizzes are very straightforward, but the final practical exam was really hard.",
    "I would recommend it, definitely.",
    "I would recommend this class. However, the labs are lengthy. Only having to write one page summaries was refreshing.",
    "I would recommend it. Best lab I've taken by far.",
    "Physics 165 is a great Intro lab course and among the better ones I've taken here at Yale. Each week there is a one-page lab write up and sometimes there is a short quiz at the beginning of the lab period (nothing to worry about as long as you've read the labs ahead of time). Really helped to solidify understanding of some of the concepts talked about in physics lecture. Lab is scheduled for 3 hours and you should plan to spend about 3 hours for most of the labs.",
    "Odds are, you're taking this because you have to. That being said, I generally looked forward to lab, and I thought this was a reasonable workload for half a credit.",
    "Yes, this was a great intro physics lab if you need it for a pre-med requirement.",
    "If you have to take this lab in order to fulfill a requirement, then it is not a particularly hard class. The three hour sessions are hard to sit through but they are only once a week and there is little homework. I would definitively not recommend this at all for someone who is interested in physics, but does not have to fulfill a lab requirement. If you have a decent physics background, I highly recommend talking a higher level lab. Most definitely not worth the walk up science hill.",
    "Overall an easier lab that Chem. The format is a little more loose which is nice and the lab reports are not that bad. I personally really enjoyed the labs.",
    "Yes, you'll probably have to take it anyways for premed requirements, right?",
    "Take it if you have to and pace yourself for the final.",
    "Yes, highly recommend it, especially if you've taken other chemistry labs!",
    "It's a lab. You do lab stuff. Much better than either gen chem or orgo lab",
    "It's a good course and I'm glad I took it. It helped me gain a better understaning of Physics and I would definitely recommend it to anyone taking an intro Mechanics course",
    "Physics 165L is a good lab. I feel like it helped me understand the concepts of the Physics 180 better, and the course load was not at all unreasonable for half a credit.",
    "yes if you need a physics lab. it is a pretty low stress and reasonable lab that helped demonstrate basic physics concepts. shorter lab write ups and a final practical.",
    "Talk to your TA about the format of lab reports in the beginning, or otherwise you get little points taken off for formatting or not explaining something you were supposed to. Not a huge workload: random easy quizzes and one page lab reports. A little boring a tedious at times, but some concepts were cool. You usually work in pairs, but towards the end we were put in bigger groups which took away from my experience I think.",
    "Yes, I would recommend taking a lab, this one in particular, because it was helpful, but not overly time consuming.",
    "It is an interesting course to take. It become steadily more intense, especially towards the final, but you learn a lot. The final is quite scary because it is a hit or miss situation.",
    "It's not a bad lab, especially in terms of work outside of lab - if you take good notes during lab (basically write down everything you do and answer questions in the procedure, both of which aren't difficult especially since you always work with a partner or group), all you have to do is a one-page addendum to your lab notes. This doesn't take long at all and becomes very routine. The almost-weekly quizzes arenot a big deal, all you really need to do is read the procedure once or twice before lab. Lab itself was often confusing for me as instructions and concepts aren't always very clearly explained, but the TA and professor are there to help you out. I found the final to be pretty stressful (it's a practical consisting of 3 experiments) but if you need to take a physics lab this isn't a terrible option.",
    "I would recommended this course. This course is sometimes interesting and always improving.",
    "Take it if you have to for pre-med",
    "I would absolutely recommend this lab course to those needing to satisfy a lab requirement. The write-up for each lab is nothing to worry about, as it has been simplified and requires very little time outside of class. I think that having a good instructor section leader is integral to your enjoyment and performance in this course, and luckily I had very good ones. I would shop a few different sections to ensure that you find a professor leader who you will work well with. Also, preparing for the labs by reading the procedure is essential, not only for the days when a quiz might occur, but also to speed the completion of the lab. I would recommend this course without reservation.",
    "Good course, I recommend it to any student that is enrolled in physics 180 or 170. The course load is not too great because the lab reports are limited to one page. So the class doesn't take too much time outside of class.",
    "A relaxed course overall, although a lot depends on the TA.",
    "PHYS 165 is overall a pretty good introductory physics lab. The lab manual is very well-written; it\u0092s concise and useful, and there are additional reference sheets and videos available on classes*v2 for each apparatus or technique you use. The labs were all designed to be self-contained to three hours, which is strictly enforced, and you work with a partner; I found that all the labs were definitely doable within the three-hour limit, even if you\u0092re slow like me. The lab write-ups consist of handwritten lab notes (which you can do while you\u0092re doing the experiment) and a one-page typewritten summary (which is limited to one page). The lab manual is not redundant with the PHYS 170 lecture, but the experiments are mostly connected to the lecture in some way and therefore do a good job of complementing the lecture without being redundant. Grading on the lab reports depends on your TA, but they typically follow a rubric, and everything you need to do and answer is explicitly stated in the text of the lab manual (though it\u0092s sometimes not very obvious). The lab practical at the end of the course is long and kind of difficult, but it\u0092s curved.",
    "This was a wonderful introduction to physics lab techniques. I learned a lot without getting frustrated with busy-work lab reports or 5 hour lab sessions. We drank Izze while listening to the Katy Perry station on Pandora and doing a little physics on Monday afternoons! It is my favorite lab that I have taken at Yale. I was going to take 181 lab, but I'm so glad that I took 165.",
    "It's alright- not too interesting, but at least the weekly work-load is much less than other 1\/2 credit lab courses. The quizzes are really dumb- but worth a lot. The final is actually hard- so watch out for that. Try to pick a relaxed TA-as how hard they grade will determine your grade.",
    "Physics 165L is like any other intro lab: you have to take it. It's certainly not terrible, but nothing special either. Some of the experiments and equipment used are pretty interesting as you start to get into them. The weekly quizzes (4 multiple choice questions) don't happen every week and are pretty easy if you read the lab handout. The final practical exam is actually pretty challenging, and studying prior labs doesn't really help. Professor Cahn's demos are the most interesting feature of physics lab.",
    "If you're taking this lab, then you are taking it because it's some sort of requirement. That said, I think that the physics lab professors want you to enjoy the course and do a good job at thinking of interesting labs. The one-page reports are also very manageable. The class can be improved by making grading between TAs more consistent, though.",
    "Only if you need to fulfill a requirement."
