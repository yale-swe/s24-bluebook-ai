   "comments": [
    "I recommend it. A course that brushes on many authors and political theories but does not go very in depth.",
    "I would recommend it if you're looking for a demanding courseload with a high pay-off.",
    "I would recommend it because it provides a strong foundation for any other course in the humanities.",
    "I would recommend it, especially with Pincus. He's a good, experienced, engaged teacher.",
    "Absolutely. I loved all of DS. History and Politics, which is ultimately a politics class, was a great addition. I learned so much about where modern views of the state came from, how history shaped and crafted politics. Great course. The reading can be a bit much, but the essays and final are not bad at all.",
    "I highly highly recommend this class. Learning about Locke, Hobbes, Rousseau, et al is a necessity for any further study in the social sciences or humanities. Pincus is a fantastic teacher and you will learn a huge amount from him!",
    "DS H&P is an overview of the major works of historical and political thought from Machiavelli to Arendt. You read absolutely amazing works, from the founding documents of America to the social contract theorists, to Marx and more, and trace the development of key themes throughout the semester. While the class assigns a sometimes ridiculous amount of reading, and Pincus runs an especially intense section with a significant amount of extra work, it provides an excellent groundwork for not only future study in history and politics, but also for learning how to be a constructive classroom presence, working with professors, and writing papers under strict time constraints. It's a challenging class, but, if you're enthusiastic about the reading list, a really excellent class."
