   "comments": [
    "German 140 is an excellent continuation of the German language program at Yale. I would highly recommend this class and this language series to any student. The class itself is a lot of fun and I consider it to be a formative part of my Yale experience. Theresa Schenker is absolutely phenomenal and if you are lucky enough to have her as your instructor then you are in for a treat. I wish I could go back to German 110 just to have the fun that I've had in this set of courses all over again.",
    "Dieser Kurs ist am besten! The material is challenging and engaging, and really helps you improve your German. It's also interesting to see the different perspectives that are shown through this course in different countries. It is definitely a good idea to take the class with Theresa Schenker if you can!",
    "I would recommend it to someone who finishes L3 but not sure whether to continue.",
    "I enjoyed German 140 a lot. It's not always an easy class but the material is accessible, and the professors will always help you with any concepts you're having trouble with. Like all language classes, German benefits from small class sizes and individual help, and you can really learn quite a lot if you commit yourself to it. The language itself can be daunting, but the class makes it a little easier.",
    "It was a great class that will help you learn German, and if you put the work in, you will do well from a grading aspect, and learn lots of German."
