    "It's a class that introduces Balance of Power along with other IR theories in the context of 20th century history. Also serves as a great primer on the major conflicts of the 20th century.",
    "It is a good class that largely deals with reality, unlike many Yale courses.",
    "The course looks at the concept of 'balance of power' from both a theoretical standpoint as well as a practical one, beginning with World War I politics, through the current day world order.",
    "PLSC 651 is a must for students who are interested in international security. The course will introduce a more in-depth understanding of the power politics that took place in the late 19th century to the end of the 20th century as well as the challenges that the world faces today in terms of security.",
    "Yes."

   "comments": [
    "This course helps my knowledge of my discipline enormously. With a focus on development, I was never really exposed to these alternate, security studies theories and feel that I am now appropriately familiar with them.",
    "The course was extremely instructive for me, both in terms of grappling with some of the major theories in International Relations, as well as examining some of the details in major world events since WWI. Professor Monteiro did an excellent job of highlighting the most important concepts and events as they relate to the idea of balance of power, as well as some of the pitfalls and tensions in different theories attempting to explain how the balance of power plays out in world politics.",
    "This course provided an in-depth understanding of the power politics that took place in the late 19th century to the end of the 20th century as well as the challenges that the world faces today in terms of security. Learned a lot especially on the 1st and 2nd World War as well as the challenges that the U.S. face in Afghanistan and Iraq."
