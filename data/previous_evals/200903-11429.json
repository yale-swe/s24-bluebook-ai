    "Yes!",
    "Benkard is probably the best person to take Econometrics from at Yale. He explains things clearly and thoroughly--something that is often lacking with the other professors. He graded a little harshly on the midterm, though.",
    "Most students are in this class probably because they have to take it. That being said, Professor Benkard makes it one of the better classes at Yale. If you go to his lectures (at 9 in the mornings though), you can probably follow the materials without even reading the textbook. Econometrics is a useful subject in almost all aspects of social sciences.",
    "I would recommend it. Its an interesting class with real-life applications.",
    "I've always been told that Econometrics is an awful class, but Professor Benkard was fantastic and I really enjoyed the course! The work load is manageable and lectures are engaging. The first half of the semester was much better than the second half, but all in all, this was a great class.",
    "Its a required course - take it with this Prof if you can - I hear the other profs for this class are pretty bad.",
    "The course, at least this year with Professor Benkard, is a pretty good course to take if you have to take econometrics. Although some of the later lectures after the midterm seemed to speed through the material, in general the lectures are pretty solid and the professor is very clear in his explanations of the topics. Problem sets are sort of tricky and the project you have to do at the end takes up a lot of time, but all of them reinforce, to varying degrees, the material that you've learned in class. In sum, I'd definitely recommend taking econometrics with Benkard if you need to take it.",
    "If Benkard is teaching it, definitely take it. He's the best econ professor I've had at Yale so far. Very clear and competent. I'm an EP&E major and found the material completely accessible if not enjoyable. You learn how powerful probability is as an analytical tool through this course. Problem sets aren't bad and neither are the midterm and final.",
    "If you plan to take Econometrics, definitely take it with Benkard -- it's the best you'll get. Also, I went into the class not wanting to like it because everyone had told me it was hard and boring, but the course was actually very interesting. I don't necessarily plan to do the next level of econometrics because the first one was hard enough, but I will say that I was happy to have had a chance to take it.",
    "While statistics in and of itself is pretty boring, Professor Benkard does a good job of making this course interesting through applying the concepts to many business case studies (he taught at Stanford Business School before Yale). Indeed, this was the best part of the course: we learned about why airlines overbook flights, looked at the data that set off the reality TV fad, examined the effect of calorie labels on food consumption, etc.Additionally, Benkard does a great job of preparing for lecture, and his slides are always top notch. Given the reviews of other Econometrics classes, this is DEFINITELY the one you want to be taking; however, don't take it if you've taken AP Stats (it's probably just going to be review for you).",
    "THIS CLASS IS AWESOME. I am not at all a math type of person, and I came into this class purely because I needed to take it for econ major. HOwever, I actually found myself enjoying it. It was hard, and I struggled a lot on the psets. However, Professor Benkard is just AWESOME. He makes boring things interesting by using real-world examples, he puts so much effort into each lecture, and psets, and what he says makes so much sense (this may sound normal, but it really matters when what you're dealing with is statistics.) His notes are also very very clear and helpful. The exams are also reasonable. All econ majors should take econometrics with professor Benkard in the fall.",
    "This class dove through very basic and then complex material in a short period. It split up the material in a lot of practical ways, including case studies, a project, a midterm and final, and a strong-focus on Excel. Econ majors have to take it, but it was a much less unpleasant experience than I had expected from previous years. EPE majors can also (and should) take this class for the major. But, I would not recommend this class for anyone who doesn't already enjoy stats.",
    "I was shocked by how much I liked this class. As part of the Econ core, I took it because I had to, but I came away feeling that I've learned a lot of useful new ways to analyze the world. This is probably the most real-world applicable course I've taken in my years of Yale thus far. If you can take this class with Benkard, do so; he's phenomenal.",
    "It's a course which teaches you to work with regressions, lots of data, and use statistics. If you need to take this course, take it with Prof. Benkard, he makes the subject interesting and lightens it up with lots of real world examples. It's definitely not the most thrilling course and I only took it because I have to, but it has been helpful in terms of understanding research papers and their methodology when evaluating natural experiments.",
    "Yes, take it with Benkard, he will be great, and you will actually learn",
    "Take this class with Professor Benkard! He is outstanding -- his presentation of the material is very accessible, his lectures are interesting and you will learn a lot.",
    "Benkard actually makes the course digestable and actually a little bit fun. Problem sets aren't that hard and the material is definitely useful.",
    "If your an econ major, and have to take econometrics, make sure to take it with Professor Benkard. Even if you aren't an econ major, consider taking this class with Benkard. Econometrics can be a pretty dry subject, but Professor Benkard does an amazing job of making this class fun and interesting. Every concept is taught by applying it to a real-world example, so you end up learning about far more than the course material itself. The problem sets are difficult, but interesting. The tests are hard but fair. And the project you do at the end of the semester take a ton of time, but you learn a lot by doing it. Be prepared to work hard but feel like you are learning some really important things in the process. Benkard is also a really nice guy, so do your best to get to know him.",
    "Yes, for sure.",
    "Take this course if you need it for the econ requirement, but do not expect to be dazzled.",
    "i would recommend this class. it's clear and well-taught in a way that makes the material easy to understand, with plenty of in-class examples. it's a good introduction to statistics.",
    "Basic probability, hypothesis tests, and regression.",
    "its a good class for stats and probabilityeasy to understand",
    "In terms of this section versus others, definitely take this one with professor Benkard, he's the best professor around and makes the information interesting",
    "A great class, definitely take it!",
    "A great introduction to econometrics. I thoroughly enjoyed this course because it was so well organized and taught.",
    "Yes. It's a required course for Econ majors, but it's useful stuff and Lanier Benkard is the best professor you're going to get for it. He tried to make things fun and applicable to real life, which made this dull topic much more interesting.",
    "YES. Benkard is awesome. Besides the fact that it was at 9, his class was relatively enjoyable.",
    "Recommended! You learn a lot about probability and statistics. Take it with Professor Benkard if you can.",
    "You can skip class up until the midterm if you have taken a statistics course before. I would prefer this to another statistics class if you care about understanding the connection between data and real world business. Take it with Benkard and don't buy the book if you do.",
    "Definitely take econometrics with Professor Benkard.",
    "I would recommend this course if you were going into consulting or finance as it teaches you some of the basic tools you will see in those fields.",
    "Absolutely. Perhaps my favorite econ class so far. Learning statistics is extremely useful and Professor Benkard is a great professor who relates the material to real-world situations\/scenearios. The problem sets were tough but manageable and the midterm was very fair. I enjoyed going to class.",
    "Highly recommended!",
    "Great class, tough final.",
    "needed for econ major. midterm was okay, but final was really hard.",
    "SUCH A GOOD CLASSSSSS! I loved the professor, hands down one of the best, most clear econ professors I have taken at Yale. Really engaging. Also, incredible TAs (this year, at least) . The content was really interesting, and the professor always gave fun, fascinating real-life examples to make everything we learned seem really useful and important (which made learning it so much easier). Take IT! Well, if you're in econ, you have to...but if you just like stats, you should still take it! Really changed the way I read survey results...",
    "I would recommend this class even to non-economics majors who want a glimpse into how quantitative reasoning can answer complex questions. When taught by Prof. Benkard, it is clear and engaging and not the typical \u0091econ requirement\u0092 class you\u0092d expect.",
    "yes, gives a solid basis for statistics and regression analysis",
    "Yes -- especially if Prof. Benkard is teaching it! He makes it interesting and you learn important concepts\/skills!",
    "It's a really good class, if it's with Benkard. You put a lot of work in, but learn a lot. Just watch out--the final is deadly.",
    "i will recommend it.",
    "If Charles Benkard is teaching it, TAKE IT. he's very clear and engaging, his lectures are always well-organized, and he posts supplementary notes, lecture slides and even midterm practice questions online, which are very helpful.",
    "Econ 131 is a great class. Take it with Prof Benkard--he explains things very clearly and makes the course engaging. The first half of the class is on basic probability and statistics type stuff, with the normal weekly problem sets. The second half is on regressions, and the format changes slightly with one big assignment instead of the weekly ones. The midterm is really easy, the final pretty difficult. I took the class as a political science major, because the regression analysis tools are so useful for understanding political science research.",
    "Like applied statistics.",
    "Of course most students wouldn't take this course unless they were econ majors. That said, under Benkard this class was tolerable. (I shopped it under other profs in past semesters) Sometimes the Excel work was a little complicated without additional help, but that seems inevitable at this point in the field of statistics\/econometrics.",
    "This is a very challenging course. Most people who take it are econ majors. Try to find a group of students with whom you can do problem sets early on. Many people form these groups and it gives them a huge advantage. If you are not a finance person this is probably not the right course for you."
