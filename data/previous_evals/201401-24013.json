We not only learned a lot but we were able to cultivate relationships with potential future employers and produce products.I also really enjoyed the weekly speakers. Almost everyone of them was really insightful and informative about their topic.",

    "Additional emphasis in the beginning of the course about the 'arc' of the course- specifically, the timing of what skills\/info we'll be working on. I wish I could go back to teh beginning of the semester and do a closer reading of the doing deals book.",
    "This class would have been better as a two day, hour 1\/2 class with discussion on the first day and the guest speaker on the second. 3 hours is a long time to be stuck in a classroom, especially early in the semester when it's dark, and it was really hard to stay attentive all the way through.This class would be better taught in a seminar-style room like Kroon 321. The physical layout of the classroom put a damper on conversation and made the teaching team have to work a bit harder to encourage engagement.I really liked the structure of the topics covered, but I thought at times that we needed some more structured lecture before the guest speaker's often more anecdotal talk and apart from free-form class discussion. There were some fundamental parts that I thought got overlooked just because of the nature of a guest speaker class. I think the energy panel and the leadership talk were prime examples of this.",
    "I would change some of the speakers, but I indicated which ones on the speakers survey.",
    "The visitors after spring break didn't seem as organized or focused as the speakers before spring break.",
    "Multiple people from client organization provided competing visions for the project.",
    "The first half of class was a useful discussion section, but I think we sometimes spent too much time on group project updates. I learned more from the group presentations at the end of the semester than I did from these weekly updates."

    "I did not like the clinical component to the course. It was unstructured and unguided. I don't feel like I produced a valuable product, either for myself or my client, and it mostly just felt like busy work filler. I would have much preferred to research a conservation strategy or program of my choice to build connections to the geography and field that I'm interested in. This could have been a great opportunity to network or learn outside the New England region.That said, I loved my clinic partner and gained a lot from working with them on this project.",
