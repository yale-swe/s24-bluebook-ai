   "comments": [
    "Political economy of the environment in practice",
    "Lots of current energy policy, including reports for climate change and future projections.",
    "Good presentation skills Group presentation skills Listening skills Incorporation of feedback Writing assignment skills",
    "This class provides a general overview of the key topics in the future of energy through a series of lectures from the two professors and from an excellent slate of guest lectures. I would say the course is more knowledge and insight based than skill based; but if you pay attention, you're going to get a lot out of it.",
    "A broad overview of many key topics in energy and climate change. We also had a number of very interesting speakers that offered unique perspectives into the industry and showed us a number of ways that we could continue our passion in energy into our professional careers.",
    "For me, I got a much less myopic view of Energy Studies. Student and lecturer presentations focused on Germany, China, and the world at large really opened my eyes to international energy issues. Also, ESG investing and finance from Professor Krosinsky was new for me, and I'm interested in incorporating that knowledge into my career.",
    "In this class I learned about current perspectives on the world energy. We discussed future energy scenarios as well as how much energy investment is necessary to tackle them. Furthermore, we got to hear a lot of interesting guest speakers on topics such as (1) the German Energiewende, (2) International Climate Change politics, (3) climate economics, and (4) the IPCC. The guest lectures are very interesting.",
    "Survey of different topics in climate change and energy today.",
    "More on energy. Lots of recap. Land-area exercise was interesting."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I thought the blend of small-group assignments, lectures and guest lectures were very conducive to learning. The once-a-week format was perfect for this course.",
    "Great time having John Kerry in class. Good group of guest presenters and presentations from Oristaglio and Krosinsky.",
    "Strengths: The quality of content from both Dr. Oristaglio, Professor Krosinsky, and the guest lectures. You get a lot of well-presented, cutting-edge info Weakness: If you're looking to develop any skills besides developing your knowledge of the energy field, this probably isn't the course for you",
    "Strengths were the guest speakers and our professors' deep expertise of the subject. I also really enjoyed working on the writing assignments and final project, which is where I felt that a lot of the learning was done. In terms of weaknesses, I don't think we covered many the topics deeply, but after all, that was not the construction of the course.",
    "Strengths: Unique slate of speakers and collection of topics that did not overlap much with other Energy Studies course material I had taken. Weaknesses: KGL 123 was not conducive to small-seminar discussion, and is far from central campus. A round-table classroom could allow for greater participation and less distance between students.",
    "Overall, I really enjoyed the course. It is a very fun introduction to world energy problems. There is a lot of flexibility in the final project, which is great because it allows you to explore whatever aspects of the world energy situation that you want. My main criticism of the course is that there were parts of it that were very poorly organized. The schedule of guest speakers seemed to be constantly changing. Also the sound system for the guest speakers was poorly set up, making it hard to understand them a lot of the time. Apart from the guest speakers, there was very little formal instruction, with most of the class being dedicated to presentations or writing assignments. A little more structure in the course would have been nice.",
    "It's much more lecture than seminar, I think hosting it in a room and making the classes more discussion based would be helpful.",
    "Strengths: guest speakers. Weaknesses: need a seminar room. Lecture hall is too large and leads to everyone losing interest quickly. Topics were often repetitive-might be more interesting if scope of seminar were less broad."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, must take if you're a senior in the energy studies program. Oristaglio has also been one of my favorite professors at Yale, take it for more opportunities to work with him if nothing else!",
    "This was an awesome class, but you got out what you put in. I ended up really enjoying it and doing much of the reading, and trying to listen as much as I could to the thoughts of others in seminar. But you could also very easily just take this class from the backseat and not learn much.",
    "Yes",
    "Yes good way to get feedback for your capstone projects in energy studies and to practice giving presentations.",
    "Yes, if you want to learn about energy and especially if you're in Energy Studies.",
    "Absolutely, this was one of my favorite courses at Yale.",
    "Yes, if they want to have a broad overview of many of the topics concerning energy \/ climate change, then this is a must take. I would recommend that they have some type of background in energy studies (from any angle, e.g. economics, science, etc.), since this is the capstone course for Energy Studies and so, utilizes many concepts that students are expected to already be familiar with.",
    "Yes, it is the exit seminar for Energy Studies students and it is fascinating to hear about little-covered, internationally-focused topics by guest speakers and your own peers. However, G&G 748 overlapped with another fantastic Energy and Environmental Policy course taught by Robert Klee. I would be a lot more enthusiastic about recommending the course if there wasn't such a great opportunity cost.",
    "Yes I would recommend this course! Don't expect to be as structured and information-rich as other courses at Yale. That being said, I think the course is really valuable because it introduces you to a lot of different types of work that is currently being done on climate change. I really enjoyed just sitting in to the guest speakers and hearing their own opinions about what needs to be done to make the Energy sector more environmentally friendly. The workload of the class if fairly low, making it a great class to just enjoy without stressing too.",
    "If you're interested in energy and climate change this isn't a hard class and there were some cool speakers.",
    "Not really, to be honest. It's essentially an Energy Studies gut but there are far more interesting classes out there. It's a shame because the program seems to be chronically underfunded\/understaffed even though the topic is so important. Not sure what can be done, but maybe look to other MAPS for guidance? Also, the room plays a huge part. A smaller room would be more conducive to discussion."
