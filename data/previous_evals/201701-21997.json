    "I really enjoyed this course, and one of my most important takeaways was how philosophy might be applied to everyday situations. Often, philosophy classes discuss big ideas but its hard to see how that applies to the minutiae of everyday life. This course addressed that, which I really appreciated.",
    "How existentialism connects to the world. Frankly, there are so many thoughts in my head about this class and this philosophy that summarizing them is impossible; it permeates everything.",
    "This course pushed me to think about philosophy, argumentation, semantics, and logic. It gave me a scintillating and well-balanced introduction to existential thought. It also served as a great platform for comparing thinkers.",
    "Learned how to critically examine philosophical texts.",
    "I learned about the origins and development of the philosophical tradition popularly called \"existentialism\".",
    "I learned how to think critically about Existential ideology and writings, how to read closer and better understand challenging philosophers such as Sartre.",
    "I gained a new framework for interpreting my life. This class showed me why Existentialism has received such extensive use as a practical, \"popular\" philosophy. It offers individuals clear guidelines on how to think about their relationship to the world, and on how to interact with this world and with themselves as things in it. The extent to which I will apply these guidelines is not yet known, but for now, I think about them constantly, and for that I am grateful. I feel that my life is richer. We followed a pretty coherent path from the beginnings of existentialist thinking to some of its more modern applications in feminism and anticolonialism. This intellectual history component was engaging, interesting, and made the course more immersive. I think I became a more careful writer over the course of this class."

   "comments": [
    "I really don't know how it could be improved; I thought it was great.",
    "It's perfect.",
    "Overall this seminar is very well organized and executed. I do have a few detailed ideas, based on my experience in the seminar, for how it might be made even better. First, it felt like we often jumped into the readings in a very sudden, drastic way right from the start. It seemed like a lot of times, within the first few comments, we were critiquing, drawing connections to other works, trying to draw more abstract conclusions, etc. Obviously this is all great, but I think we need to build up to it. I think it would be really awesome if, for the first 5 or 10 minutes of class, we could just talk about the work in itself, as in what the writer is presenting to us. This would involve going over the key concepts and arguments, just looking at them for what they are, and not trying to draw any very abstract conclusions of them or critique them. If we did this, I think we would build up a much stronger base for our discussions, i.e. set ourselves up with our own material with which to work for the rest of the discussion. Too often I think it felt like we had overjumped ourselves, and had very little of which we felt sure, upon which we could rest or ground ourselves when needed. I think before we start discussing how we interpret the work, it's important to address what the author is saying, on a somewhat superficial level. The second thing is not so much an idea to improve the class but just an observation. It felt like almost every single text we read in this class was broad and deep enough to warrant an entire semester's worth of study. It was difficult, then, to try to undertake the degree of breadth that we did. It felt often felt like we were only really scratching the surface of the texts we read, like there were so many interesting and important ideas in them that we were not able to really address. I suppose this is inevitable to some degree, but I think some shift in the breadth-depth balance in the direction of depth would be good. Besides this, I felt like this was a very strong and well-executed seminar. I really enjoyed the openness (i.e. lack) of prompts for all of our writing assignments, so that we were able to focus our energies into what we found to be the most interesting and engaging. It also really encouraged intellectual creativity, which was awesome. And obviously our class discussions were wonderful, and Professor Khawaja did an amazing job or organizing and guiding them.",
    "This course was amazing, and I have nothing bad to say about it. Professor Khawaja is so intelligent, kind, and engaging. I also loved seminar discussion every week with all the other deeply committed students. The assignments were fair, transparent, and fun because they allowed students to really pursue their interests in the course material. The readings were well-selected and not too much in quantity.",
    "Such a fun seminar! I learned so much from the people around me and of course from Khawaja. Sometimes there was a tad too much reading to discuss all of it in class, but do it goes. Had a great syllabus and I read a lot of great texts.",
    "The course is strong in introducing students to major figures in the existentialist movement, and how those figures interacted. Professor Khawaja did an excellent job selecting readings that demonstrated conversations between texts and showed the development of key ideas in the tradition. I wish that we had read a few more of the religious existentialists, like Gabriel Marcel, but otherwise the syllabus was great.",
    "Professor Khawaja was great at getting everyone involved in the discussion, addressing questions from all students, being understanding of the difficulties we faced",
    "The readings were very interesting, and both demanded and deserved careful consideration. High engagement led to exciting discussions in which students were really invested. However, the complicated, abstract nature of the material made it easy to get stuck talking about particulars for long periods of time. It would have been nice if we more frequently sacrificed the parsing of particulars in order to talk bout more general themes."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Yes, if they were interested in philosophy.",
    "If you get a chance, absolutely take this course. Professor subtly is miraculous, rendering this often opaque philosophy understandable without depriving you of all of its magnitude and nuance. Everything we read I want to read more of, and it intersects with so many other areas of literature, philosophy, even science, and just life in general. I cannot praise it highly enough. It is the only class I will truly miss from this semester.",
    "This course is fantastic. You read some really interesting although often very dense works, and then try to work through them with the other students and Professor Khawaja (who, by the way, is an incredibly good professor in every way). I feel like I got a lot out of almost all of our readings and discussions, as a student and also as a person. The material definitely feels very relevant and applicable to real life and our everyday experience. A couple of things you should probably take into account though, if you're considering this course: (1) It is a very large amount of reading each week, which you really need to invest time in in order to understand in any significant way, and (2) I found this class to be by far the most intellectually challenging course I've taken at Yale. There were times in most classes when I felt like I was not able to keep up with the ideas and concepts we were talking about, which is an experience I had not had before. Although the material can often be very personal and even emotionally intense, it is also very cerebral and nuanced, and requires intense, delicate analysis to work through. Also, discussions can get very abstract.",
    "I would recommend this course, especially to students who love to engage in philosophical discussion and like to probe deeper into the details and the esoteric pieces of a text.",
    "Yes! Existentialism is such an important philosophy that is so relevant to everyday life. Was great to discuss ideas in class every week.",
    "I would fully recommend this class to another student of philosophy or any discipline. Khawaja does an excellent job making the subject material accessible to everyone without sacrificing any depth.",
    "Yes!! If you have any interest in Existentialism I would highly recommend",
    "If you take the time and make the effort to engage with the subject matter, which is not much of a chore given the exciting readings and Professor Khawaja's brilliant energy, this can be one of those classes that makes you see the world through a new lens."
