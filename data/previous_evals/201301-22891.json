   "comments": [
    "It's actually interesting.",
    "Yes, definitely. Apparently it's a lot easier than intro to stats and you learn the same things. It was boring but not a hard or annoying class.",
    "Take if it is required. Really easy course.",
    "The professor is absolutely terrible. I stopped going to lecture after the midterm since there were no tests after the midterm.",
    "Great way to learn basic SPSS functions as this is one of the only classes around that will teach you this program, unfortunately. It's little work as the homework is pretty easy, but if you have not had any stats before, this is a light intro if you have a packed semester. Good QR for those who need it as well. Yay SPSS! Boo STATA\/SAS.",
    "Take it if you need a statistics class for medical school or any other reason. The class is easy and doesn't take too much time.",
    "Absolutely! This class is great, and you leave it feeling like you solidified your understanding of basic statistics. You also learn how to use SPSS, which is a really valuable skill. The homeworks are fairly straight-forward, and there is only one midterm and a final project that is fairly flexible. Go to class and pay attention, and there's no reason not to do well.",
    "",
    "Take it if you want a very practical statistics class that will be useful for any kind of psychological research.",
    "This is a great fifth class to take. The workload is very light. Only a PSET every week, 1 midterm and a final project. The material is very straightforward. The final project is done in groups and in parts so it is very manageable. The professor provides great notes and resources on classesV2 and uses Piazza to answer questions as well.",
    "Easiest class at Yale.",
    "yes",
    "Take this class if it is required for the psych major. If you are looking for a more in depth evaluation of stats, consider a stats course not focused on psych.",
    "Boring required course for Psych major",
    "Very boring, you won't learn much, take it for your major.",
    "Only take it if you have to. it's not super difficult, but it's pretty boring.",
    "A very very basic introduction to Statistics, as the field relates to Psychology. Not challenging, not a lot of work, but also not a valuable course. Take it if you need to, but otherwise it's probably not worth your time.",
    "This class is still undergoing some minor tweaks from year-to-year, so make sure to look at the overall course schedule and requirement deadlines. Having one midterm was very stressful, and the SPSS manipulations were so simplified in section that we ended up being very overwhelmed by how much we had to teach ourselves for the final project analysis. Make sure you get a good TA who will answer your questions quickly and in detail!",
    "Would only recommend it if you need it for the major. Again, not hard, but just not really worth taking if you don't need it.",
    "It's a decently easy class as long as you just do the work, come to section, etc. For being a requirement for the psych major, it could have been a lot more painful! it's interesting to learn about the actual application of statistics to psychology. 10 problem sets, 1 midterm, 1 project, and participation make up your grade.",
    "Pretty easy QR credit. Recommend it and psych majors need it. Pretty light workload but material is hard to understand if you haven't taken stats before. Napier teaches in a way like she's teaching herself, which was actually very nice.",
    "Yes.",
    "Good class! Take it if you don't like math and need a QR, and it's required for psych majors!",
    "I would only recommend it if you're interested in stats or need to take it. Not the most interesting class, but not overly difficult. Just kind of a mediocre class.",
    "If you've taken a good AP Statistics course, PSYC 200 will probably not be challenging at all. And maybe a little boring. However, my peers with no statistics background found this to be a good introduction to the subject, and all students will benefit from learning how to use the analysis software that section is based on. In addition, the paper that is the final project is excellent practice for anyone who intends to pursue research, or write a senior thesis paper on independent research.",
    "Great QR credit for non-science\/math majors. Would absolutely recommend.",
    "I would recommend this class. To begin with, it's an easy QR with no pre-reqs. There are easy problem sets, a midterm (where she basically gives you the questions ahead of time), and a final project. No Final!! So if you want this class to be a gut it can be. That said, if you actually come to class and pay attention, you can learn a lot about how to do basic statistic. It's an incredibly useful skill and the Professor really makes an effort to make sure everyone understands.",
    "Painfully dull and slow. Only take it if you need a QR or for the Psych major. Hardly any work though.",
    "Really straightforward class, would definitely recommend. NO FINAL - just a midterm, weekly psets, and a final project. Do something fun with the final project!",
    "Do not take this class! The class is structured horribly. If you are interested in stats take Intro Stats in the Stats Dpt. STAT100 or STAT103. All we learn in this class is how to interpret stat software outputs. More emphasis needs to be placed on how to do the stats- to one understand the concept of what the test is doing\/what information we gain from it.",
    "It's necessary for the psych major. Enough said.",
    "I would take it if you are a psychology major",
    "I would recommend it if you are searching for a QR credit that is not particularly math- based.",
    "Required for the PSCYH major and definitely easier than the other stats options.",
    "I'd definitely recommend it to a Psychology major or another major who requires a statistics credit, because it's much easier to understand and more interactive than other statistics classes I've taken previously.",
    "Yeah it was totally fine. I learned how to interpret statistics and will probably keep the basics with me for the rest of my life. You learn SPSS, which is what's used in psych, so that's good. It was also really easy and not time-intensive.",
    "I would not. It was kind of a waste--I wish it were a more rigorous stats class. less rigorous stats classes tend to be confusing.",
    "If you took AP Stats in high school, you're set for the midterm, and if they keep it the same next year, there is no final exam, only a final project. Generally, it's a pretty easy QR.",
    "Take it. The class really did help me improve my understanding of general statistics. I'm a lot more critical of reported statistics these days. Also, make sure that Lauren is not your TF; she is not afraid to GO HAM on grading your homework. And by \"going ham\", I mean she'll take off points if the standard deviation you report has more than 2 digits behind the decimal point...",
    "I would recommend it as an easy QR. The midterm was very easy as long as you studied and\/or paid attention in lecture. There is no final, only a final project, which was kind of a lot of work if you are inexperienced with SPSS. Sections are kind of a drag, but the course was overall easy and stress free.",
    "I would totally recommend this course. It's an easy and useful QR and you end up learning how to use SPSS. The workload is low and the final project is fun. The weekly problem sets evaluate how well you learned the skills you were taught that week, and help reinforce them. The lecture slides were online, which I found useful because I found it was easier to learn by going over them after class.",
    "yes, such a joke",
    "Psych 200 is an intro level statistics course, comparable in difficulty to AP statistics (maybe a little easier even). You learn a lot of statistical tools for analyzing data, including how to use the SPSS statistical software, which is probably the most useful part of the class. At the end of the semester, you work on a stats project where you analyze your own data and write it up in proper format. I thought that this was a valuable part of the course because it helps solidify both the concepts from lecture and mechanics of the SPSS software program. The course is not very difficult -- only a midterm (no final), weekly problem sets (very easy, maybe 2-3 hours at most; little to no computation), mandatory weekly section, and the project. Professor Napier is a pretty good lecturer, and the lecture slides are clear and posted online, so there isn't even really a reason to go to lecture at all. You don't take this course for intellectual growth. You take it if you want to learn how to perform statistical tests, or if you are a psych major (required).",
    "It's really easy to do well in this class without actually understanding the concepts, until the final project when you have to use what you've learned and you realize you have no idea what you're doing. I would only take it if you have to for the psych major.",
    "I would recommend it, but I didn't get as much out of it as I had hoped. Easy QR credit, but another stats class will probably teach you more.",
    "A great class. Not too hard and not stressful at all. However, I don't know how useful this class will be because I don't intend on using the SPSS program that we used and I felt like I didn't learn that much about statistics.Professor Napier is great and puts all of the lectures online. Also, she's really approachable and cares a lot about her students.",
    "A bit boring, but take it. A much better alternative to math-heavy theoretical stats if you need this for your major\/pre-med stuff.",
    "I think the course is a fairly straightforward breakdown of basic statistics and use of the SPSS software, especially in light of application to psychology. I much preferred having a final statistics project rather than a final. Overall I would recommend the course to those who are a) interested in psychology, b) need a QR credit or c) simple want an introduction to statistics with a more practical focus",
    "This was the easiest class I have taken at Yale so far! We had one midterm and I think the average on it was a 90. Instead of a final, we had a research paper, which was kind of time consuming, but you could do it with partners. I highly recommend taking this class.",
    "Yes",
    "This is a good class. The psets really aren't that bad and Professor Napier was great. I feel like I learned the concepts that I needed to know in lecture. In the weekly labs, however, when we had to learn how to use SPSS, I feel like I still didn't know how to use it by the end of the semester. This made doing the final project a little bit more difficult, but it was still a class that was worth taking.",
    "If you're looking for an easy QR, this is it. Not bad at all.",
    "Yes, take this course if you are interested in learning how to analyze data without getting bogged down with mathematical proofs of the formulas. The examples are interesting and relevant, since they are from psychology research. Professor Napier is a good lecturer, making the potentially dry material bearable. There is minimal math involved; it's mostly data interpretation. You also learn to use SPSS statistical software, which is especially useful. I was able to use what I learned from this class to analyze data for my senior project in biology. Instead of a final exam, there is a final project, for which you can collaborate with a group. Note for MCDB majors: this course counts as an elective towards the major.",
    "An easy QR if you need one.",
    "I would recommend this class to be taken in a couple of years when it is more organized. It still needs a lot a logistic adjustment.",
    "I would not recommend this course to another student. Of course if you are a psychology major, then you cannot avoid it. The final project was very cool, but getting there was a struggle. This was definitely a course that over half of the class skipped.",
    "I would recommend this class only if you are a psychology major or if you are trying to get an easy QR credit. You could learn a lot more in an actual statistics class and the material is not really relevant if you are not majoring in psychology.",
    "Strengths: Clear, concise lecture formats. Class material was very neatly incorporated into activities that drew upon real research. These activities later transformed into real opportunities for research.Weaknesses: It's not always fun. But that's just kind of how an intro stats course is going to be. The easiness of some of the material also ended up meaning that grading was sort of arbitrary. I lost a few points for stupid mistakes on the midterm, which was the only way one could really lose point for this class. I hope that doesn't end up seriously impacting my grade.Overall assessment: The kind of class you won't really want to take, but, like, you need it for your major\/a QR, and it is of practical value.Recommendation: Take if you must\/are looking for a straightforward QR. No one could love a course such as this one. But it's made as interesting and relevant as it possibly can be. You won't regret taking it. The project is also pretty cool.",
    "Def one of the easiest classes I took at Yale, pests took only an hour tops every week and the midterm was very easy (I think the average was in the 90s lol). I stopped going to class after the midterm and I think I did okay on the project (no final!!!!) but it would have been easier to complete if I had gone to class. Anyway, no regrets, I needed this for med school and it is def a painless way to fulfill any stats requirement. I definitely also recommend it as a QR for anyone willing to do the work since it is not complicated at all. Assuming this class is even a QR.",
    "Yes. Valuable for psychology and social science majors, as well as people interested in a crash course in statistics. Great starting place, but by no means comprehensive of all statistics one will encounter in the social sciences. Overall, a great course - a valuable introduction to understanding statistics presented in the real-world, and especially psychology research.",
    "Take it if you have to for the psycholgoy or CogSci major, or if you want an easy QR. Don't expect hardcore, difficult, challenging or eye-opening experiences. Everything is spoon fed and straightforward. You don't have to attend lectures after the midterm- exam is easy, problem sets are very manageable, final paper is annoying but not too difficult. The easiest class I have taken at Yale for sure!Has its perks (no final, no textbook)!",
    "I highly recommend this class if you want to learn the statistics behind psychology. It's not for you if you want to learn all the math behind the statistics (we never have to do any tests by hand), but it's great if you just want to learn the concepts behind it and how to use SPSS. Prof Napier is great!",
    "Very straightforward and easy class. An important introduction to the field of statistics.",
    "Sure! Take it! This is (or was my year) the guttiest QR ever to exist. I took it for MCDB and spent about an hour a week on it (except for attending section, which is mandatory but somewhat useful). I have no idea how this is a psych requirement. There is one exam, the midterm- our class average was 90%. If you showed up to class and\/or looked at slides, you probably did better than that. The final report which replaces the exam is as hard as you make it. It can be a big time suck but I bet if you planned it right, you could get it done in just a few hours.",
    "great introduction to applied statistics. teaches you all the concepts and how to do data analysis on stats software without requiring you to do tedious, outdated math. the final project is actually pretty fun, and Prof Napier is definitely an approachable professor.",
    "It's not difficult, but it's annoying. Definitely a gut, but not the good kind -- the kind that force you to do busywork and teach you nothing in the end. If you truly want to learn statistics, look elsewhere. This course teaches the bare minimum, and I came out of this course feeling like I had learned almost nothing. At least it's easy though. I probably wouldn't recommend it, but if you're just looking for an easy QR, go for it.",
    "Take it if you are planning on doing research in Psychology.",
    "Take this course if you want an introduction to stats or need it as a requirement. Prof. Napier made learning stats as painless as possible.",
    "This is a really helpful and not overly difficult class. Napier was a really thoughtful teacher, and I would recommend taking it with her.",
    "Easy stats class",
    "Easy course. One mid-term that is extremely straight forward - a bunch of people got full scores. One end of term project, that you can work on alone or with a group. I did it on my own and it really was low stress, since the only REALLY important part was the statistics and knowing how to enter things in SPSS. Problem sets were every week- again pretty easy if you read the powerpoints. After the midterm, over half the class stopped showing up to class (since no final). I kinda enjoyed the lectures since they were very straightforward and easy to follow. The class was VERY focused on learning SPSS - so good if you plan on doing psych research but not sure how helpful otherwise.",
    "Painfully boring most of the time. I would only take it if I had to.",
    "This was an easy class that you don't need to go to. The slides are online as well as notes. To get a good grade you can lay in bed and read the slides. Napier speaks in a monotone voice but you will learn a lot if you teach yourself the slides.",
    "This class is a basic intro to statistics. It is not about memorizing formulas and doing repetitious calculations. It is about applying statistics to understand topics that you care about. Prof Napier is an engaging lecturer. Even if you're not good at math, you'll be able to understand this course. There is 1 midterm, 1 project, and weekly problem sets.",
    "It is a very interesting statistics class. I would recommend it because it is an lighter workload than most courses.",
    "An introduction to basic stats methods for the social science. Probably not an adequate substitute for general stats\/stats needed for other subjects.",
    "You can easily get by without going to lecture. It's all pretty simple stuff and learning SPSS might be useful at at higher level, but just manipulating data in a spreadsheet teaches you little about psychology or statistics.",
    "This is a required class. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not much more to say. Do not take the course expecting to learn much about statistics or to be enthralled by the material. The workload isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t too bad, though, so it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not as painful as it could be. I would not recommend it unless it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s required for your major.",
    "A class to take for a QR credit for those who aren't the best at math!",
    "A really basic stats class, a painless way to get a QR. You'll learn a lot of useful stuff if you're going to be a psych major. I actually really enjoyed doing our final project, and you'll see how cool it is to basically run your own study. I'd take it again, no regrets.",
    "Take the course if you want to know a bit of statistics without stressing out too much. The course does not require too much work and I think that it depends on you how much you will know my the end of the semester (you can do pretty well with limited and superficial knowledge of the discussed statistical methods)If you really want to know statistics you might want to choose a different course. If you need your fifth course...",
    "It was a fairly easy course that gave a basic understanding of statistics. I would not recommend it if a student wants to fully understand statistics and if powerpoint based learning is not helpful.",
    "Great course if you don't know much about the basics. Very straightforward.",
    "If you need to learn statistics, here's the place.",
    "This class is really not worth taking if you don't have to. I wanted to get a basic knowledge of stats but got nothing out of it.",
    "If you are a psych major you have to take it. Otherwise I would not recommend taking it.",
    "Take it if you have to or if you want an easy math credit. Study for the midterm.",
    "I would recommend this course. It is interesting and informative. The final project was a lot of work but it was fun",
    "The course this semester consisted of a weekly problem set due Friday afternoon (don't be deceived by how easy the first problem set is, they get harder. Never terribly difficult, but definitely time consuming). There is also a weekly section, which just takes you through steps on a computer program -- you just have to show up, you don't actually have to do the steps on your own computer along with the TA. There is a midterm that isn't too difficult, and no final exam (so lecture after spring break becomes kind of superfluous). The final project is a research project\/scientific paper that you can do by yourself or in a group. This is time consuming but not difficult. I found this class very boring, but a fine way to fulfill a QR.",
    "I took it for a QR credit, and it's a fairly painless QR if you're not a math person. No reading and no final, which is nice. Just a midterm, weekly psets, and a final project using SPSS. It's easy, albeit pretty boring. Going to lecture is definitely not needed since all the Powerpoints are posted online. Definitely go with Sam as your TF if he does it again-he was so great!",
    "It's unfortunate that this class is required by the Psychology department for Psych majors. The amount of statistics you learn is less than you would in AP Stats. That being said, if you're a non-Psych major who's looking for an easy QR course, this may be the one for you. Overall, this was hardly a worthwhile class.",
    "Yes I recommend this course. Some students might complain about how slowly this course moves or how easy it is; I actually learned quite a bit from it. The material itself is not explicitly oriented towards psychology, or not as much as you would expect anyway. It's a very introductory statistics course, I would say. There is also no textbook and everything you learn is purely from lectures and section which really helps you to focus on the essentials and learn them well (if you put in the effort). What you learn from SPSS through the final project really helps you get a good handle on data collection and analysis. Solid and easy course, all in all.",
    "I honestly think this was a fantastic statistics class. The class really focuses on you learning the material conceptually and understanding how it translates into the kind of statistics we are always surrounded by. Dr. Napier put a lot of work into designing a class that would fit this goal and it shows - for example through the originality of the psets and the lecture examples. The project we had to do for the end did exactly what they was supposed to in that they solidified what we had seen in class so we could internalize it",
    "This class gives a good overview of key concepts in statistics, and the homework allows you to make good use of them by forcing you to apply concepts to research. Not an amazingly fantastic class, but it gave me a good, solid understanding of basic statistics.",
    "This class is interesting, but really only beneficial for someone aimed at pursuing the psychology major. All of the material and examples are psychology based. Overall, the course material is very simplistic and superficial. I was hoping that I would come out of the class with a thorough and applicable understanding of statistics, but I've realized that I'm going to need to take more stats classes to get to the level that I desire. If the format of the course stays the same, the course gets very simple after the midterm because there's no final exam, only a final project. This means that the majority of the class stops attending lecture. The homework assignments for the course can take a significant amount of time, especially since the questions are often difficult to decipher and the grading seems arbitrary.",
    "I should preface this review by saying I'm an undeclared, humanities-focused student who'd never taken a stats class before and was looking to get a QR out of the way. I took this class assuming it would be easy and wouldn't take much of my time; I still think it IS objectively easy, but given my background, I actually should have allowed it more time than I did (and consequently I'm a little worried about discovering I got a C or a D after I submit this eval).Basically: you go to lecture twice a week, Prof. Napier reads powerpoint slides to you (so it's perfectly skippable---or at least that was the judgment I made when I started skipping almost every lecture the second half of the semester) and then you go to section once a week where a TA mechanically runs you through a few procedures on a stats software program called SPSS. If you've took AP Stats this is probably a great class for you, as I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think it goes into much more than the AP does, and SPSS itself is not too difficult to learn. There's also very little computation involved. You have a problem set due each week but it's not too time consuming, and then there's a midterm and a final project (no final!) neither of which feel too taxing.If you're looking to knock out a QR - and you have a tiny bit of stats knowledge or are willing to dedicate more than the hour per week that I did - this class is a great bet. It's certainly not particularly interesting or engaging, but are you really looking for that in an easy QR? Go for it.",
    "Great class! Essential for psych majors even those who haven't taken stats before.",
    "This was a great class! I would take it again. Take statistics before you graduate-- you will appreciate every other subject more.",
    "It was okay. Not the most engaging, but Professor Napier is very helpful and knowledgeable. She has a shy tone when she gives lectures, but she knows the material and presents it in a very clear way that's easy to understand. We had weekly psets, a midterm, and a final (group) project that required a short presentation and a paper.",
    "An easy introduction to statistics and it's usefulness in psychology.",
    "PSYC 200 is a basic intro stats course. It's very easy as long as you do the assignments and read the lecture slides. If you want to take a more in depth course to really learn the subject, or want to take a calc-based stats course, this is not the right one for you.",
    "It's a good, useful qr to have for non-science or math majors.",
    "A relatively interesting and easy-to-follow QR. Weekly problem sets and sections, a midterm, and a final project (from which I probably learned the most). Helpful TFs are great to assist in learning the software. Not the most exciting class, but I think done well given the pretty dry subject matter.",
    "Since its a requirement for the psychology major, take it. Aside from that, this course teaches you a lot about doing research, mostly from your own experimentation with the final project. This hands on approach is a really good way to learn anything, particularly SPSS.",
    "This was a great Intro Stats course if you're at all interested in psychology. If you're majoring in Psych it's required anyway, and if you're not but want a basic stats background I thought it was good too. We didn't do *any* theoretical or proof-based work though, so keep that in mind if that's what you're looking for.",
    "A superficial survey of the statistics required to understand psychological literature. Lecture component and lab where you learn to use SPSS (statistics program which is actually pretty cool). Weekly homework assignment where you answer questions about statistics reported in existing papers. Final project where you write a paper on a topic of york hissing using statiaticalmethods learned in class. Nothing to get excited about. But overall a solid class for understanding reports f statistics in psychological papers. NOT a math class- little to no theory is covered. Having a little more theory would make me more comfortable in using the statistical methods in studies, but this class is a good starting point.",
    "Good QR to take and I gleaned some statistics knowledge from the class. The lectures did require focus however and I noted that attendance dwindled as the class went on.",
    "PSYC 200 is a good intro to statistics as applied to psychology. You cover regression, t-tests, ANOVA and the like. There is a very manageable midterm and final project. I would recommend this class.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student, as the course material itself is both very easy to learn and extremely useful in many ways:in addition to preparing future Psych majors and statisticians, the course shows how statistics can be manipulated in daily life and how to verify their actual value."
