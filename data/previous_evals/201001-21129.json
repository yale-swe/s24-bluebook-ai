    "I would definitely encourage students to take this class. It provides for a great overview of bench to bedside research.",
    "Yes, especially those who are interested in translational research.",
    "Great course",
    "For a student whois interested in drug development or pharmacology, I think this course is good introductory class to understand the translation from bench to bedside as well as understanding the approval process. Overall, I think for anyone who is pursuing biomedical research, this course is worthwhile to better appreciate the drug development process.",
    "A class during which grad students from the basic and medical sciences get together to learn about all the steps from identification\/design of a novel therapeutics to the clinical realm.Yes I would recommend it.",
    "This course provided an overview of two important areas in drug development- first, drug design, and second, the drug approval process, which is most helpful to students interested in pharmacology, i.e. developing new medications, or clinical trials research."

   "comments": [
    "It helped me gain an understanding of the clinical aspect of the drug design and approval process. I have never been to a clinical research unit before and it was definitely a very interesting and eye opening tour.",
    "Yes, this course provided me with a general idea how human investigation works",
    "Great course",
    "I'm not sure that I will find myself in the future in drug development, but I do feel that I have gained a much better appreciation of all that is involved. And if my research does lead to development of a therapeutic, then this class definitely provided a good foundation for understanding the process.",
    "I learned a great deal in this class that I think may be useful in the future.",
    "This course provided a basis for my understanding of the steps that go into the development of new drugs, which is relevant to my area of research."
