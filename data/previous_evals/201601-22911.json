    "Take it! An important course on corruption for anyone!",
    "This course is a great opportunity to learn about corruption, economic development, and democracy using a multi-disciplinary approach. The course material includes readings from law, political science, and economics.",
    "This is an introductory course to the study of corruption. You do not really go in depth into any topic. I would not recommend it to someone who has already studied or worked in this field, and\/or wants a policy-oriented course.",
    "I would highly recommend this class. Professor Rose-Ackerman is one of the experts in the field. I've greatly enjoyed the class and learned so much from her class, no matter from weekly assignments, readings, class discussions, or final research paper. The materials really stayed with me. As I said, this class is a must-take if you're interested in corruption. Professor Rose-Ackerman is probably the best professor to take class with."

   "comments": [
    "It has informed my research agenda moving forward. Very very valuable.",
    "This is one of the few (or only) courses at Yale that focuses on corruption. The multi-disciplinary nature of the syllabus means that the course was a wonderful way to apply knowledge from previous statistics, economics, and political science courses. I also appreciated the course coverage of organized crime issues, another topic area that has minimal coverage at the university.",
    "I've alway been interested in corruption, democracy, and governance, but have't had an opportunity to learn much about it. I'm so glad to have taken this class before graduation. It really teaches a lot about corruption, and specifically, I've gained a deeper and better understanding of corruption in China, which is my main research focus. This class not only helps rich my research field, and also makes me think more critically and analytically."
