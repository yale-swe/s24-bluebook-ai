    "Alice is great and everybody else seemed to have a really fun time in the class, so I think it is just me when I say that I did not find type to be as exciting as I thought I was. However, everyone else loved it so just me. I will say the only really annoying thing was that we would spend a long time on one person's project and I feel like everybody was just repeating each other so it got really boring. Kinda wish we could have sped things up a little bit, but I get that she doesn't want time to be cut short for people. Also printing is the WORST",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone that has an interest in design, regardless of major. The things you will learn in this course are applicable in many different areas, and I think the ability to work typographically is a really great skill to learn here. Even if you do not have much design experience, you could certainly take this class and get a lot out of it.",
    "Yes! You'll work very hard in this class but it's (probably) worth it to see your own development as a graphic designer .",
    "If you are interested in type, take this course. It begins a bit slow, but by the end all of the projects feel like something you want to do, rather than a chore that needs to get accomplished.",
    "Typography in Graphic Design I focuses on visual communication using typographical elements like letterforms and different typefaces (fonts). I would recommend this course to another student as it helps focus a single thought or expression into concise communication. One must be aware though that homework assignments in this course take a lot of time to complete."
