   "comments": [
    "Yes, especially if you want to take upper level film courses. You have to if you want to major in Film Studies. But I would also recommend this to anyone who is interested in film or wants to understand cinema better.",
    "This class is great. Obviously there's a decent amount writing but it's not laborious. The two film reviews at the beginning of the semester are a breeze to write as a more informal voice is appropriate, and the two academic papers aren't too bad because Prof. Gregg and the TAs give you so much to work with. I took this class to fulfill my WR requirement and walked away with a much more informed opinion of film. I highly recommend going to the screenings, but if you can't (or don't have time) it's usually sufficient to check out the DVD from the Film Studies Center and watch like 15 minutes of it to get what's going on in lecture. Most of the films are really stellar, though, and should be watched in their entirety if possible.",
    "If you don't know anything about film, take this class. If you know a great deal about film, take this class. It will help you so much with writing papers, and not just film papers. It will help you to be clear and precise in your writing.",
    "For a survey course that by necessity skims over the study of film, it gives a good overview of the subject. I would definitely recommend the course; it was well-organized (we addressed a specific aspect of film each week) and the films screened were clearly carefully chosen and all worth watching. I've started to get much more out of the films I watch now, even not as part of the class. Also, Ron Gregg is an adorable lecturer. I do wish we watched more non-European foreign films, however, but I've been convinced to take more film studies courses because of this class.",
    "Who doesn't love movies? this class gets better as you go along.",
    "This is a fun, fascinating course--makes you a more educated viewer! It's one of those classes where you will have the subject matter reappear in everyday life. Especially if you're a film enthusiast, you should take it. Be prepared to spend more time on it than you expect, though--the section and mandatory screenings tend to add up.",
    "Good class and would definitely recommend it if you like the subject and want a writing credit that doesn't involve writing research papers.",
    "It's a good introduction to looking at films critically and is a fun way to get a writing credit. There is a lot of reading but you can get away with not doing it all and you don't really need to go to every lecture either. I would recommend it.",
    "Film Studies 150 is an excellent class, whether you're interested in film or simply looking for a good WR credit. One of the best classes I've taken at Yale so far.",
    "This class is so awesome! It's a lot of work, but it's great for a WR credit because the subject material is so fascinating. It's pretty important to show up for lecture, sections, and screenings, so you need to be willing to commit the time if you want to do well (it's a lot of class time). The screenings often actually go from 7 to 9:30 or 10, so you'll be leaving early and finishing them up on your own if you have something at 9.",
    "Intro Film is a broad survey of the different stylistic and formal aspects of film. You consider things like how editing works to foreground or subvert narrative, and how sound or lighting can shape your experience of a film. The lectures are insightful and interesting, but not hard to follow (Ron Gregg is great!!), the films are for the most part very entertaining or at the least classic films everyone interested in film ought to see. The screenings are time consuming, but it is really great to watch these movies on the big screen with a lot of people. All in all, this is a fantastic class and a very reasonable work load. Take it, and don't skip the screenings!",
    "Yes, it's a great course if one is even considering Film Studies--it covers many aspects of film",
    "Very interesting class, but if you really want to know and understand the material, you're going to have to more than just go to class. There is a lot of assigned reading every week, whether in the book, through supplemental materials, and online, and to get the full experience of the course you would have to read all or most of it. That said, the 4 papers are not too overwhelming and the assignments are clearly explained. Submitting a draft is extremely helpful, as the TFs provide useful incite (and you're almost guaranteed a better grade if you submit one). If you have any interest in the formal study of film whatsoever, take this class.",
    "The course is interesting and, at times, entertaining. Don't take the class if you expect to watch an array of commercial films that are mindless and relaxing to watch. The films on the syllabus are chosen to make you think and to provide examples of cinematic feats. You'll learn about film style, history and theory and will emerge with a greater understanding and appreciation for film. It has certainly made me view film in a different way and is something that I am glad to have taken.",
    "A very good introduction to film studies, the film industry, and the world of film in general. You\u0092ll love the movies, and though there are a lot of papers (4), they require you to write in a variety of styles, so they don\u0092t get repetitive. And they\u0092re a really good way to learn how to write about art in general. Professor Gregg is good, but he tends to look down at his notes the whole time he\u0092s lecturing, so it can be hard to pay attention. But you\u0092ll come out of this class knowing a lot more about film than you did coming in, and you\u0092ll probably want to learn more.",
    "Never went to lecture. Only went to section once a week.",
    "An introductory class about film studies with screenings every Tuesday, amazing lectures, an overload of reading, and discussion section once a week. I would recommend the class to another student because it was so amazing. If they're not too affected by the workload and willing to stick it out, the class is incredibly rewarding, fun, and amazing.",
    "Definitely take this class if you (a) need a WR credit, (b) are a Film studies major, or (c) just want a comprehensive introduction to some great films and elements of film style. I walked into it just for the WR credit (which was pretty easy - two reviews and two essays) but actually enjoyed most of the films and all of the things that I learned. I mean, if you leave with nothing else, you'll actually understand what cinematography and editing mean, which'll make for better Oscar parties, as the TAs said.",
    "Learn about the elements specific to cinemathat distinguish from other form of arts, such as theater, photography, ect...Understand that what seems self-evident is actually a convention and that alternatives to it are possible. Understand and move away from stereotypes.Though film are rigourously analyzed, it doesn't ruin the experience of watching film - I'm tempted to say, it improves it.Also, I had the possibility of discovering new types of film, and suprised myself enjoying russian movies with no or little narration(for there is much to a film then its stories, as we learned).So I recommend it to any student interested in film, or who is looking for a constructive class to fufill the writing requirement.",
    "Film 150 was like an appetizer: it only made me hungrier for more! The weekly screenings at Whitney Humanities Center were a lovely weekly exercise; the lectures were engaging; and the professor was so caring. I left this film class only anxious to take another one!",
    "Anyone with an interest in film will find something to enjoy in this course! And even if you don't take the course, have a friend remind you about the weekly 35 mm screenings....",
    "Absolutely take this if you are interested in film--as a major or just in general. The film screenings once a week are kind of a pain but it's nice to take a break from work to watch an incredible movie. Professor Gregg is a great lecturer and is always welcome to help you with papers!!! You only have two short film reviews, one short analysis paper, one longer paper, and a very easy final. I loved this class--it's fun and the work is very manageable!",
    "I would because my love of film eclipses everything else. This course satisfied that love.",
    "Interesting and enjoyable class. You will learn many basic techniques of filmmaking and gain tools for analyzing film. Beware of the heavy writing load (two 5-page film reviews, one 6-8 page paper, and one 10-12 page paper) and the heavy time commitment (lectures, section, and weekly screening). However, in spite of the relatively heavy workload, this class is definitely worth taking. It was a lot of fun to take a class on something that's not really esoteric and academic.",
    "I probably wouldn't recommend this class to people like me, who were looking for a writing credit, because it doesn't really teach how to write a standard essay. However for people interested in film I would highly recommend it.",
    "Even if you have the slightest interest in film, you should take this class. Its incredibly informative and very stimulating. Ron Greg is also incredible",
    "It's a class where you get to watch some classic movies. If you've the time to watch films (e.g. three hours every Tuesday night) and you're pretty good at writing in bulk (e.g. two film reviews, one film analysis, one final paper), it's a pretty straightforward class. However, at least my TA was somewhat harsh in grading, and I heard that some TA's curved down to a B+.",
    "classes revolve around a film screen that occurs on tuesday night. The film are chosen because they demonstrate some aspect of cinematography. Section is used to discuss the films.",
    "I would recommend it. Lectures, sections, and screenings are worthwhile but it's quite the time commitment.",
    "Pretty straightforward class. I enjoyed it because I have never taken a film class before and ended up learning a lot. The lectures were not my favorite part but writing about film and discussing the screenings in section were pretty fun.",
    "If you are a film studies major, this course is required, but I would argue that it really is necessary for future film classes that you take at Yale. A lot of what I learned in Intro Film, I was able to apply in another film class I was taking during the same semester. The course load is definitely manageable and the final exam is very straight-forward. Not a difficult class by any means. If you're not a film studies major, then I might recommend a different course that is more specific to your interests, simply because this course covers more of formal analysis as opposed to cinematic movements or their cultural\/historical context.",
    "Good introduction for people without film background. If you have a strong background in film do everything you can to place out of this course, it will be boring and redundant.",
    "A lot of class time... so make sure your other classes are not bad before considering this class. Do not think of it as a gut.",
    "If you're remotely interested in movies, I recommend taking this class. I don't watch a lot of movies, but I didn't feel like I was lagging behind at all. You learn basic film vocabulary and acquire a basic framework to analyze movies with - but for film aficionados, it might be a rehash of what you already know. If you're looking for a fun way to earn a writing credit, this is the class to go to.",
    "I would only recommend the course if the student in question is extremely interested in film. The films that are viewed are not always easy or fun to watch, and the screenings add an extra time commitment to the week.",
    "I definitely recommend this course."
