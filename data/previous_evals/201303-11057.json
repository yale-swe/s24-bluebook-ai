    "Lots of conjugation, get ready to put them all in order for the final.",

    "Absolutely loved this class. I think I would have enjoyed this particular class a lot less had it not been for Prof. Maria Pilar Asensio-Manrique; she was a fantastic teacher. She was clear and concise in her instruction and made class very enjoyable. The course was the perfect mix of grammar, vocabulary, comprehension and application of the language. I learned more Spanish in one semester than I did in 6 years of Spanish in middle and high school."
