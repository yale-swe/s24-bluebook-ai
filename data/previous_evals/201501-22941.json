    "Take it!!!",
    "This is a great, relaxed class where you aren't usually too stressed (except for the midterm and final) but you get a lot out of it. Sam really helps you think about the human form in a new way that's quite refreshing and rewarding. If you want to learn how to really just draw a likeness, you probably won't learn that here. It's much more conceptually based.",
    "yes",
    "Figure drawing with Sam Messer consists largely of in-class work. He brought in a model or several models for almost every class, with the exception being days that we spent outdoors sketching people walking around in public, or days that we spent looking at famous examples of figurative work (usually in the print room of the YUAG). There was a midterm project and a final project, plus several homework assignments scattered throughout the term; each of these assignments was deeply open-ended, but did require a somewhat significant amount of time & effort spent. These projects all get discussed in front of the group, in typical crit format. In general, this class is very chill; the workload is comparatively light, and Sam is open to all kinds of projects and approaches. Be warned, though: the in-class work is not just \"sketching\" or \"messing around\" as you might be led to believe; he is, in fact, watching you very carefully, and grading you on what you're making. Perhaps an obvious conclusion, but one that was hard to come to, after he opened the class with a speech about how he didn't generally concern himself with grades, yadda yadda. This would be a great credit\/D class to take senior spring.",
    "Fun class! Hardly any homework--mainly just keeping a sketchbook. Your drawing will definitely improve!",
    "Art 224 with Professor Messer (which rhymes!) was a fun course. If you're looking to grow technically, this class may be frustrating for you as it's largely idea-based. There's also not much direct feedback, so you need to be pretty self-motivated. But it was definitely my most fun, relaxing course.",
    "I would absolutely recommend Figure Drawing with the highest regard to anyone seriously interested in the subject matter.",
    "This is a course for students that want to learn how to draw human anatomy as well as how to be able to send a message\/tell a narrative through figure drawing. I'm not an Art major, but I think I benefited greatly from this course because I learned so much about mark-making and understanding how to form narrative work with the human body.",
    "Yes, if you want to learn anything about the human form.",
    "Yes! Take Figure Drawing. This is an amazing class."
