   "comments": [
    "This course offered a very interesting lens to understand the world. That is, that every current event now has a long intellectual lineage and that the great historical moments are often a product of seemingly random group dynamics.",
    "I was able to gain a lot of knowledge concerning a wide variety of historical topics. I was introduced to a lot of topics in philosophy and was able to debate with other students my opinions and interpretations of historical figure's ideas. I learned to better lead and take part in discussion, as well as to make cross-disciplinary connections.",
    "I learned a lot about how to analyze history in ways I didn't think to before",
    "This course helps me build a framework of world intellectual history. It is a great exposure to how the world becomes the world.",
    "Foundational knowledge of prominent intellectuals in western civilizaiton, as well as key philosophical ideas throughout the last 2000 years.",
    "I learned a great deal about specific points in intellectual history, and especially about the people involved in each of those circumstances and how their lives and attitudes affected their work. I gained a greater understanding of and ability to recognize how interpersonal relationships have affected and continue to affect world history and Western thought.",
    "In terms of insight, I got a sort of survey of intellectual history, colored through the lens of the topics and issues that cannot be settled scientifically.",
    "This is so far my favourite class I have taken here. I loved how we were able to take in a wealth of knowledge that provides the fundamental context to a lot of large historically significant ideas. We were able to learn how to develop our own ideas through historical intellectual circles ranging from the more modern issues of the supreme court to the ancient greek schools of thought.",
    "Such an amazing course, learned about prominent people all throughout history",
    "I gained an overview of intellectual history and knowledge of several key circles that drove it. I think this is a good first semester seminar in terms of developing college speaking and writing skills.",
    "I gained a much deeper understanding of intellectual and political history from this course. I also sharpened my discussion skills and developed time management skills for managing a heavy reading load.",
    "A deeper understanding of history's most prominent groups and figures and their impact and relationship with the world.",
    "I learned how important intellectual circles theory is. This course was great because of Professor Hill, and being in a seminar designed for first-years. I really loved being able to sit around a table with the rest of my classmates and our professor, and the discussion always made class go a different way than if Professor Hill had only lectured. I thoroughly enjoyed attending this course every Wednesday and Friday morning."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The strengths of this course are the very exciting readings and the lectures given by Professor Hill. A weakness was the quality of our discussion some weeks as it was obvious that many students had not read the books.",
    "Great discussion and inspiring material. I hope the class can be a little bit more close to each other.",
    "Puts emphasis on peer-peer learning in a helpful way. Relies on discussions in a way that increases engagement. Readings aren't always helpful.",
    "The readings for this course focus on the personal lives of and relationships between the members of each intellectual circle considered, without much discussion of the actual philosophies or works of these people. This came as a bit of a surprise to me, as I expected to focus more on the products of the intellectual circles, rather than the circles themselves. This made seminar discussions somewhat difficult, since they tended to focus on the actions\/theories\/work of the circles. Since the focus of the course was not the works and theories of the circles, I would have like to have learned a bit more about theories of intellectual circles, possibly covering the way they develop and are structured a little more explicitly.",
    "The only weakness is that the course was largely lacking in structure, as the majority of class was a student-led discussion. Because the discussions were student led, they usually were often about big ideas, and as a result of this, it seemed as though there was little incentive for the students to complete the entire readings.",
    "The main strength would be in my opinion the good balance between breath and depth of exploring ideas. It is hard to determine what exactly is required of the course and how it will unravel itself towards the end however.",
    "The biggest strength is Professor Hill, who is an incredible lecturer and devoted instructor. I've never had an instructor with such a breadth of knowledge or experience. In terms of weaknesses, sometimes the reading load was unevenly distributed, and I wish there had been more instruction\/ guidelines on the final paper.",
    "I really enjoyed the courses reading material and class structure (discussion led by a student followed by insights from the professor). It was the perfect balance between independent work (reading) and collaborative efforts (class discussion).",
    "I wish we would have studied maybe a bit more diverse intellectual circles, but I understand since it is only a semester long course that there are only so many groups that can be considered."

   "comments": [
    "Yes! This course was a great way to start freshman year in that I feel as if my mind has expanded!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course, as it is a really good course to see and discuss a lot of different topics and ideas.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It was a fair amount of work, with roughly 100-150 pages of reading a week, but the discussions during each and every class were incredibly intellectually stimulating, and Professor Hill always had more to add to the conversation.",
    "Absolutely. Very good freshman seminar.",
    "Highly recommended, especially for those who are interested in learning how does the world run.",
    "A truly educational, informative, and explorational course.",
    "I'd recommend this course to students who are truly interested in the personal lives and relationships between members of intellectual circles at specific points in intellectual history.",
    "This sort of intellectual history survey is an introduction to a valuable part (and a part often missing) from the college education.",
    "Would definitely recommend this to another student but class can sometimes go off tangents and for very logical-based \/ particularly stemmy students it might not be the best.",
    "Yes, such an amazing professor and interesting course",
    "Yes. I think it's a good first seminar, and it's also a good course to take if you're somewhat interested in Directed Studies but don't want to commit to three courses. You learn a little bit about a lot of things: philosophy, history, literature, arts, politics.",
    "Yes, I think Intellectual Circles is the quintessential Humanities course. It was challenging, and it encouraged students to analyze history through different lenses (e.g., geopolitical, literary, social).",
    "This is a great class if you're interested in the content (read the syllabus) and are planning to do the reading. Which I would recommend, it's really interesting and you'll get a lot more from discussion + lecture. Yes it's a reading heavy class, but if you aren't going to do it, it's not worth taking a 9am. Overall, this is a great class, would recommend if you intend to do the work. It'll challenge you to think about history and ideas more critically.",
    "Yes! It is a great class with a variety of different topics as we look at different intellectual circles. The discussions that follow from the readings are really enjoyable and end up being relevant to recent events and discussions.",
    "Absolutely. This course is an excellent way to get a taste of so much of history, philosophy, and the humanities and Professor Hill is incredible. I could listen to his lectures all day! In general, it was a joy to be a part of this class.",
    "I loved the structure of the course. There was something new to consider each week with a different circle, and that made for a very interesting class each time. I also loved how student-driven the discussion was, but that Professor Hill still facilitated the discussion. I learned much from this course, and I would hope that anyone else might have the opportunity for the same experience."
