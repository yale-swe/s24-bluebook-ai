    "I would highly recommend this course if you have had no music theory before, as I had, or if you want to improve your musicality. We did a lot of ear training and even though it wasn't something I never expected it, I have learned how to play a bit of piano.",
    "Great for beginners, i gets a bit challenging towards the end but you walk with a pretty good sense of the beginning of music theory.",
    "Music 110 is fairly easy if you have a decent background in music. Be prepared for a lot of somewhat tedious work just because the basics all need to be drilled in to become instinct."
