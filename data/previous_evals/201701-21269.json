    "Absolutely would recommend. You learn a lot at a quick pace but it's definitely worthwhile.",
    "I'd recommend taking this course to anyone who is willing to spend a good amount of time daily into learning Chinese. You'll definitely learn a lot.",
    "Would definitely recommend this course if you have taken 110 or am a relatively new beginner in Chinese.",
    "I rave about this class. I have recommended it to dozens."
