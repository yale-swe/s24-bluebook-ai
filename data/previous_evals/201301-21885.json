   "comments": [
    "I would absolutely recommend it to other people. In short, it's a intensive course of hours of French a week, but for me as a sophomore, it was worth it to take 145 rather than spread it over 2 semesters. Madame Sherak is also just absolutely wonderful, so you should try to take the class just for her. However, it can be stressful and overwhelming if you slack off at all, or if you're not really interested in being able to improve your French skills.",
    "Very intensive: be ready to dedicate a LOT of time to this class. That being said, it's totally doable and totally worth it: one of the most rewarding classes I've taken at Yale because you see yourself improve so quickly. I would recommend it if you're ready to dedicate a fair amount of time\/energy to French. But it's also a lot of fun!",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS IF YOU WANT TO LEARN FRENCH. I took L1\/L2 intensive last semester and this class this semester without ever having taken French before and I have learned so much. While the workload was pretty high, it was worth every minute of it, and I have gotten so much out of it. Professor Sherak is awesome and is a great teacher. If you're willing to put in the work and really want to get fluent in French, definitely take this class!!",
    "French 145 is basically taking Level 3 and Level 4 French in one semester. There's a focus on grammar and yet to learn I would recommend it to a student who is keen on learning French at a fast pace and has the time to take it\/is not taking it with other intense classes.",
    "A compact French class with a lot of work, with a test every week, but very manageable if you do not overload yourself with other classes. Very rewarding and good stepping stone to go to L5.",
    "Excellent course \u00e2\u0080\u0094 one of my favorite experiences here at Yale, academically. Sometimes the workload can be a little challenging, but it's definitely worth: my French has improved significantly and in so little time. Also, MADAM SHERAK IS THE BEST. She is one of the nicest professors you'll ever meet at Yale. She is passionate about French, incredibly knowledgeable and enthusiastic. Definitely take this class if you want to learn French!",
    "If you want to learn French really well, take this course sequence (including French 125)."
