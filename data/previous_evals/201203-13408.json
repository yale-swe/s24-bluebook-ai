   "comments": [
    "I would recommend English 114 03 to students who are looking to improve their writing skills, are interested in an aspect of pop culture(music, art, television) and who are looking to fulfill a writing credit. Although some of the texts are pretty hefty readings, the course overall is a good way to transition to writing college papers while discussing some fun topics in class.",
    "small seminar class discussing how society views pop culture and its influence. VERY interesting material i really enjoyed all the papers. i would definitely recommend it",
    "It all depends on the professor, to be honest, but (come on) it's freshman English. You gotta take it. :D",
    "I would definitely recommend the course - it was a great way to learn about and challenge my views on popular culture, and I think my writing improved immensely this past semester.",
    "This was an intro writing class. Some of the topics were very interesting to talk about but overall, the class was very difficult and hard to follow.",
    "English 114 is an excellent introduction to academic writing, which is quite different from high school english writing (even AP). There were 4 papers, one of which was a ~10-page research paper. The \"Bad Culture\" section focused on analyzing elements of pop culture. The papers were a bit boring and tedious to write, except for the last paper, which was a cultural commentary op-ed piece.",
    "Interesting readings. The course opens new doors to Media culture.",
    "This course focuses mainly on mass culture and popular culture. You will be reading a lot of readings from literature critics about theories of culture, mass culture, and popular culture. You will have readings every class and are expected to discuss the reading during the next class period. The readings vary but the average number of pages in a reading is 20. Overall the workload is a bit heavy but I think the topic is very interesting, and you will watch some music videos in class. If you like popular culture and want to improve your writing, you should take this course.",
    "English 114 03 is a challenging course not only because the course material is difficult, but also because the class is not taught very well. The class discussions are good enough but rarely are they exceptional because most of the students have no idea what they are talking about. I would not recommend English 114 03 to another student unless they are truly passionate about \"Bad Culture.\" Even then, taking the class would not necessarily be the best choice.",
    "If you like the topic of your section, then English 114 is a good class. As a freshman just becoming accustom to the kind of papers expected at the college level, I think that this class will prove very useful throughout the next four years. Thus, if you are looking for a basic introductory writing class, I would recommend this one.",
    "This course discusses what makes culture good or bad. It is an interesting topic and Damian is a helpful teacher. Your writing will definitely improve with his help. I would recommend this course."
