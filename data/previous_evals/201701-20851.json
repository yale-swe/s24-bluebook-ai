    "I think that the course was fine in its structure and topics covered. I do wish more time was dedicated towards the end of the semester and those topics because they are so much more difficult than topics in the beginning such as vectors.",
    "The course moves very quickly and the grading is very harsh.",
    "The class was taught too fast, unless you are in Miki's section you are screwed.",
    "Only one PSET per week, with helpful online resources, is very manageable. Two midterms and a final is tough, but also helps break-up the coursework and spreads out grading.",
    "I found that grading on assignments and exams tended to be inconsistent (penalized differently for equivalent mistakes) but otherwise this course was great.",
    "The course was very well laid out, but at times it was hard to see in the moment what the goal was. Looking backward, piecing everything together, helped to make sense of things."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course to a student only if they NEED to take it. The topics are interesting, but exams are difficult, and if you do not have a strong foundation in calculus and have a hard time with drawing\/imagining things in 3-D, this course could be difficult.",
    "Overall a good course that teaches a fair amount of material. However, it was not at all designed to facilitate learning - we go over the easy material in class and waste time reviewing simple concepts, even though the psets and tests are clearly harder. The tests are especially unfair, and I get the impression that they were designed not to test understanding of concepts but to be able to take off points. Graded unreasonabl, especially if your particularly section didn't go over something another section did... Also would have preferred it if we actually learned what we were doing (esp. wrt divergence and curl) rather than mindlessly solving problems.",
    "Nope. This class is structured so that students not in Miki's section will have to catch up for the entire year. Additionally, all you get is straight out of the textbook material, nothing unique at all to Yale.",
    "Yes, if the student was headed towards a math major, but I would recommend the engineering version of multi to a student taking it as a prereq for another major.",
    "Unless it is a requirement, don't take it.",
    "If you need to take it, you need to take it. We did skip several concepts in the textbook that are more physics based. The ENAS alternative is much more liked by students (easier, more applied to the world, more support). I took the same class in high school two years before and had to take it again because I remembered nothing, so I knew I would be able to understand the material, but I also knew that it was really difficult and that I didn't enjoy it. If you had a bad experience with multivar in the past, don't expect this to be different. If you found lower levels of math particularly challenging, this will likely be even harder. There is an option to drop down to 115 early on if you need to, but keep in mind that the hardest content comes in the second half, so if you're feeling good early on, that may not last."
