   "comments": [
    "Yes. If you are interested in finance this is a very good course to take.",
    "This course should be viewed as a work in progress (this was the first year it had been taught, and Prof. Berg's first time teaching, ever). With some revisions, the syllabus could become much more engaging. That said, we did learn a fair amount about innovations in risk management, mostly in the areas of municipal pools, catastrophe securitization, etc. It is NOT about the financial sector.There were two essays (one shortish, one 6-8 pages) and a group project. The project was quite demanding (you literally had to come up with a risk management innovation and present it to the class) but ended up being pretty fun, and the groups came up with some cool ideas. Working in a group was a bit of a pain, but was manageable. I'd recommend taking a look at the syllabus and deciding whether the material on it interests you, since I have no idea how it might change next year...",
    "Not a lot of work, and very interesting stuff, both in theory and in practice. Berg is a really nice guy.",
    "I would recommend it if it's taught again. Obviously, you have to be interested in the material, because it can be dry at times. The final projects are a lot of fun, and it isn't a ton of work. The two papers could be a bit time consuming, but if you're willing to meet with Greg, it makes the process much easier. Overall a good seminar if you're interested in the material.",
    "A basic understanding of risk management would help many students understand the business world in a lot more detail, especially those students with a more entrepreneurial spirit. It also just gives one insight into industries that affect their life because a lot of risk management deals with insurance."
