This engagement should be conscious of the concerns and priorities of the communities that I am serving and must comprehensively address the intersectional realities impacting these individuals."

    "Strengths: Format of the class. The framing lecture + student lead discussion + guest speak or activity was really great. Weaknesses: Sometimes I felt like we were pressed for time in class fitting everything in. Would have loved more time for Q\/A or discussion with guest speakers.",
    "This course provided incredible course readings, opportunities for discussion, challenging academic commitments (course presentation and 20-page paper on independent research), unique field visits (Beinecke Library, Yale Art Gallery, etc), and thought-provoking course speakers. I learned from this multifaceted experience and thoroughly enjoyed my interactions with the visiting professionals that came to the class. Moreover, Mike Mendez is a wonderful mentor and supported our growth in the class. I believe this course could be improved if offered as a foundations course. This would encourage more students to participate, and the concepts that we were presented with have impacted my preparedness as a professional."

   "comments": [
    "The work, while very engaging and worthwhile, is time-consuming. Be prepared to dedicate the appropriate amount of time.",
    "Take it! There are not many EJ focused courses at FES, so that alone is enough of a reason to take the course. In addition to that, the discussion-based nature of the class is really great - you'll learn a lot from your classmates. You'll get a lot of feedback on the major assignment, a research paper, which I think is useful for anyone who hasn't written something like this in awhile.",
    "This course will challenge you and provide unique opportunities for personal, professional, and academic reflection, enabling you to chart from where you have come and where you are heading."
