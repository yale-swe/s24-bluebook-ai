   "comments": [
    "Take it. It was an interesting overview of the rise of China that anyone should understand. I was at no disadvantage without an anthropology background. The workload was very manageable.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to anyone who wants to get a broad overview of how China came to be the nation it is today. As someone who knew nothing about China, I definitely learned a lot and greatly enjoyed the class. The workload is very doable. There are a lot of readings, but there are only two midterm papers (4-5 pages each) and a final and section meets only every other week. Prof. Siu from the beginning explains that she doesn't want this to be a stressful class and it definitely was not.",
    "NO! If you know anything about China, don't take it. The readings are really interesting and good, but the rest of the class is a waste. It's a very shallow overview of China in general.",
    "I enjoyed this class very much and it should be accessible to everyone. However, I did have some trouble as I was not an anthro major and did not quite understand how to use some anthropological terms (have improved after writing papers and preparing for the final). Make sure to take clear notes during lecture, and relate the readings to them.",
    "This course provides an overview of Chinese history, culture and society up until present day. Professor Siu is a wonderful lecturer. If you know little to nothing about China, this is a great course to take if it's something that interests you.",
    "Anth 170 is a solid course that really does help understand China. It's anthropology, but it covers history, some political science, and economics as well. You won't leave with an ability to interpret modern politics, but you will have the background necessary to see how most explanations of modern China are completely off (those looking at the last few decades really misinterpret things). You'll also get a sense of what life is like in China, which is quite useful for understanding individual Chinese people. There's a lot of reading, but a fair amount of it is \"fluffy,\" so doing it is fairly optional. The class is a gut in terms of grading and ability to write essays without doing most of the reading, but you won't get much from the course if you go that route.",
    "A great course as an introduction into China, or into Anthropology. Definitely helped me get a sociological micro-perspective on many of the macro issues discussed in poli-sci classes.",
    "Great class if you want to learn more about Chinese Culture, History, and Society. Modern China is also very well covered",
    "Anthro 170 was a pretty good overview of China from the first dynasties up to modern day China. It was difficult to sit through an hour and fifteen minutes of lectures sometimes, especially because it is literally just a lecture (no slides with notes or pictures) but Professor Siu is a great lecturer and we covered a lot of interesting topics in one semester.",
    "Definitely take this class if you have interest in China, anthropology, or both. Very well-taught; better knowledge of the nation as a whole - people's motivations, its political history, connections between past and present - is guaranteed. The class is quite reading-intensive, but all tests are essay-based and questions are given to you well in advance."
