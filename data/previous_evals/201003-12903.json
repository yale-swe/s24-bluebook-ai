    "Solid class.",
    "No. The TAs are awful and the section is excruciating. The grading is also totally arbitrary - you can have taken tons of classes like this and know all the material, and you can get stuck with a bad grade. Yes, the material is easy, but that doesn't matter if your TA randomly gives out tons of bad grades. Also there are lots of chances for this to happen - two papers and a midterm and a final, and the paper topics are quite specific so it's not like you can just do nothing until the final and then ace that. Lectures are boring. Do not do this.",
    "Really interesting class and not that much work, take it",
    "Good class for Credit\/D",
    "very similar to intro to IR",
    "I would recommend it to someone interested in IR theory, for sure, since it's a LOT of it. Someone looking for an easy class can get by with a decent grade as well but will get nothing out of it. I find the study of war fascinating so I think that If you do as well, then this should be in your schedule.",
    "Definitely not a gut. Take it if conflicts and power struggles interest you. And if you're willing to read up to 200 pages of material a week.",
    "Nice class, for sure",
    "yes! take this class, it is awesome.",
    "This course has one of the best reading lists at Yale, and covers among the most interesting and relevant topics. That said, lectures were a little dry and powerpoint-dependent.",
    "i would recommend this class because it was interesting material and overall not too much work",
    "Great course in the sense that it isn't challenging enough to stress you out, but you still learn. Exams are fair and very much like Kocher himself: straight forward.",
    "definitely take it.",
    "It's a good and easy class if you're interested in international relations theory. It could be very mediocre for someone just looking to get a social science credit.",
    "there are easier classes out there",
    "Good class, not too much work, interesting topics. You can get away with doing very little reading if you attend lecture, where Kocher often summarizes the week's readings. Two papers, and a very straightforward (read: easy) midterm and final.",
    "RECOMMEND. Take this class.Strengths-Extremely interesting lectures-Great lecture slides-Great structure; well-organized, easy to understand.-Interesting paper topicsWeaknesses-Readings might be a little too dense and hard to keep up with.Prof.Kocher is a great lecturer. Loved all of his classes. He made topics rather uninteresting for me in the beginning into very interesting ones through his lectures. It was also very nice to hear his own critiques of the arguments presented in the literature dealt with in class: made the concepts and topics a lot more relevant and approachable to students.",
    "I would recommend this course. It's enjoyable, informational, and helps you understand security considerations of governments and international organizations much better.",
    "The material is really interesting, but the workload is terrible because the essays are challenging and the tests are ridiculously simple.",
    "This is an interesting course, though not one that encourages much interpretation by the students. It was very \"theory-heavy\" even though we discussed two case studies (Vietnam War and World War I), which makes it seem somewhat removed from real life. Kocher has a clear lecture style that is conducive to memorizing the material he presents.",
    "Yes I would recommend this course to a fellow student because of its ties to international relations and its interesting material.",
    "Ehh...maybe. It's not the most interesting class. You probably won't learn a lot, but you might pull off an ok grade anyway. I'd probably recommend taking another class on international relations.",
    "Yes take it if you are at all interested in the topic. There are only 2 papers and 2 tests which is not much work.",
    "Generally a decent class. Take if you want a relatively easy, though not quite a gut, poli sci.",
    "Take it. Very casual, not too much reading. The course all falls under overarching themes which makes it easy to tie the course's goals into every facet. Sheen.",
    "International Security was an introductory look at the major topics involved in the discipline. I found the material consistently pretty interesting, and Kocher does a good job of presenting it.The course was run very well. I liked Kocher's approach and teaching style, and his tests and paper policies were refreshingly straight-forward. The only criticism I have of this course is that, in a few cases, large batches of reading were assigned which I'm sure almost no one did--Ferguson, Ikenberry, and Moyar. (Or rather, in my own case, I would more or less read the introductions and conclusions of each chapter rather than the whole 150-200 pages worth). If Kocher's OK with that, then no problem, but otherwise he might re-think his syllabus.",
    "Yes, strongly recommended. Absolutely essential for any serious IR students.",
    "Worth taking only if you are interested in military political science. Very interesting if you are, well-taught and cohesive.",
    "I would recommend this class. It's an overview of international security studies so if you are well versed in theory or have taken an international relations course you might be a bit bored. It is easy to do well in this course if you come to lectures and make an effort to do most of the readings. The course is also very theoretical and NOT about contemporary issues, so don't take it if that's what you're looking for. You will come away from this class with a better understanding of political science and international security studies.",
    "I LOVED this course. If it was possible, I would take this course three or four more times. Since the first lecture, I felt like all the info I gathered from newspapers and books for years, all the random ideas I had, started to get into a framework, started to make sense. Great introduction to international relations theories as well. This course is not only about war\/peace, it aims to explain state behavior. amazing course, amazing reading materials.",
    "This class is an overview of security and how it applies to WWI and the Vietnam War. I would recommend it to someone interested in war and wants to expand his\/her knowledge of IR. The workload is nicely spaced out.",
    "Fun course. Highly recommend it if you're interested in international relations\/security theory and its applications to history.",
    "I would recommend International Security to a Political Science major who seeks to gain a greater understanding of international relations, particularly the relationships between great powers. I am very glad I took this class, as I feel that the theories presented in the course are crucial to know in order to understand other topics in international relations. Although the course did not explicitly focus on current events, I thought the material also helped me to think about international affairs today more critically and intelligently. Professor Kocher will not be the absolute most exciting lecturer you've ever taken a class with, but I thought he presented the information clearly and effectively, and also encouraged students to ask questions during lecture.I did have a couple qualms about the course. Firstly, grading could be harsh, and was especially dependent on your TA, so be careful. Secondly, I thought the lectures on World War II and Vietnam were not particularly helpful or organized, and I thought the information could have been better incorporated into other lectures about theories relevant to these two conflicts. Overall, though, in my opinion if you are a political science major looking to learn more about international relations, the material covered in this class is too valuable to pass up.",
    "The class is good. Professor Kocher is a clear and interesting lecturer, the material is fun to learn, and nothing assigned is overly difficult. Although you might get the sense the class is a complete joke given the number of athletes that take it (I'd estimate a good 20-30% were athletes) and the tests do nothing to dispel that notion, the papers are graded rather stringently and serve to provide some measure of difficulty. Ultimately, though, it is an interesting course that leans to the easy side of the spectrum. If you are looking for an easier class to provide some sanity in a 4.5-5.5 credit schedule, I would highly recommend taking International Security."
