   "comments": [
    "Yes. Even if you don't care that climate change (i.e. drought) has literally wiped out every great society in the history of great societies on Earth, you should still take this class because Professor Weiss is fantastic.",
    "I would recommend taking this class if you are a fan of history or environmental studies (or both). If you like history, then this class will add a new interesting spin to the traditional narrative of collapse and European domination. If you like environmental studies\/paleo-climatology, this class will illuminate the field's potential as well as many of the current issues in the field that need to be addressed.",
    "I would recommend this class to any student who is interested in ancient societies or climate change. Without any background interest in the subject, the course might be a bit dry. Professor Weiss is excellent (and hilarious) and class is always fun and interesting.",
    "This course offers a good survey of paleoclimatological history and traces the ways in which climate change contributed to the collapse of various ancient and relatively modern civilizations (e.g., the Maya, the Mesopotamians). Professor Weiss was an excellent instructor, with very interesting thoughts and insights. He answered students' questions thoroughly and made sure that we were on the same page about the scientific articles and jargon that we encountered. The workload was fairly light - a few short papers, a final project, and two to three articles a week, with the occasional book interspersed. The class could have been better structured - as it was, it felt like we jumped around from society to society without a tremendous amount of logic behind it. (Some of this was due to logistics relating to guest lecturers, though.) Also, the 3:30 to 5:20 timeslot was less than ideal; I tend to find it difficult to concentrate for two straight hours, especially in the late afternoon. Hopefully, that changes in future years.",
    "Definitely take it! Pretty chill, not too much work, interesting material.",
    "Take this class! It's my favorite class of the year!"
