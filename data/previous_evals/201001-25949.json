    "Japanese 157 is a good way to help you keep up with your Kanji skills as well as learn a few new grammar patterns. But this class is not nearly as fun and beneficial as the lower level Japanese classes.",
    "yes. it's a class that you'd want to take.",
    "I would summarize Japanese 157 as a course that quickly raises a student's Japanese skills, especially in Kanji and reading. I would definitely recommend the course as the course really helped me improve my Japanese and created a Japanese family at Yale.",
    "To do your reading and preparation well takes a LOT of time put into it. Class meets three days a week but it wasn't unusual for me to spend 4-5 hours in preparation for each class.Even when the material is challenging, Murata and Seto put a lot of effort into their students and the materials they teach. They're pretty accommodating and chill when something comes up and a student needs leeway. I got the impression that while it seems they grade harshly (the number of red marks I got on each test was kinda depressing) they know when you're really putting in the effort and the final scores come out leniently to reflect that. The only reading i didn't like as much was \"Igirisu ha oishii\". Otherwise, there's a good mix of essays, articles, movies, songs, and a legit short story by the end.My reading and writing ability went up enormously after this class. Huge amounts of kanji (up to 15 or so a day) with occasional review tests are tough, but necessary. All my friends were impressed when I told them I was writing a term paper in Japanese for the final paper.Only real gripe is that the class size, especially afternoon section, was a little large, making it difficult to have as much speech practice in class. Definitely try to supplement class time with weekly Japanese table."
