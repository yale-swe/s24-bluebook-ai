    "A fast-paced course where you will learn a lot about Jin ping mei; definitely recommend.",
    "I would highly recommend Chinese 828 to any graduate level student who is interested in Chinese literature. It is a seminar dedicated to the close reading and analysis of the novel Jin Ping Mei.",
    "This is a literature course rather than a Chinese language course. I would highly recommend it to anyone interested in late Ming fiction, print culture or vernacular novels in general. The class discusses the content of the novel as well as its historical context. It is not so much for students trying to learn Chinese.",
    "I would recommend this course to others.It's a wonderful experience in literature and culture."

    "I gained much deeper knowledge in one of the most important novels in the history of Chinese literature, and learned new perspectives on late Ming social life and culture."
