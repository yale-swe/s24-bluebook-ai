    "The course material has helped my research directly. Although the materials covered in class are aimed at silicon or III-V solar cells, the theory can be extended to new, emerging photovoltaic systems as well.In addition to the course materials, Professor Lee is happy to take questions outside of the course. He is a valuable resource in learning and thinking about such devices.",
    "Learned a lot of new knowledge that I have never contacted before. Quite useful!",
    "It helps broaden my knowledge of semiconductor microelectronics to the field outside logic application."
