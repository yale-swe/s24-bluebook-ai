   "comments": [
    "I would highly recommend this course to those who want a more quantitative and rigorous approach to macroeconomics. It involves a bit of calculus, but the mathematics are not that daunting.",
    "Highly recommended. Not just econ people but also math people would be interested in this course. Even if your interest is theoretical, it's nice to see how differential calculus and other math techniques can be use to describe economic activities. Plus, weekly psets are very helpful and interesting; I got a sense of applying material covered in class to real problems in the world. Prof. Smith was a fantastic lecturer too. I could not recommend more!",
    "ECON 126 is one of the best courses I have taken at Yale. If you liked Intro Macro and Multivariable Calculus, then this is absolutely the course for you. For me, one of the best parts of this course is that it uses math to formalize many of the arguments that are made with hand-waving in intro macro. In addition to covering the material in the textbook, Professor Smith also added a number of additional topics to the syllabus, which gave me a preview of what a graduate-level economics course might look like.",
    "Not as hard as Microeconomic Theory, thank GOD. Reasonable workload, could have taught more.",
    "This class started off being pretty easy and then got really hard. It was a lot of work and there weren't enough resources outside of class notes. The final was really difficult.",
    "Great alternative to intermediate macroeconomics for its flexible and yet reasonably challenging content, but probably only suited for students who are mathematically inclined and great self-learners.",
    "For an Econ\/Math or just Econ major, this is a challenging but high quality class on Macroeconomics. It's probably the hardest Macro class at Yale, but will prepare you very well to be able to understand current debates in the modern political sphere. The material was hard, but the tests were actually quite manageable as long as you studied.",
    "Econ 126 is a more rigorous and in depth look at the field of macroeconomics. After taking it you will have a very strong grasp of finance and economics events. I very much recommend taking this class",
    "Take it if you like econ",
    "It is a good macro class. It is hard too.",
    "Yes, if you're more comfortable with math and calculus and Excel. \"Math 120\" is the prereq but most students had more math under their belts.",
    "A more mathematically rigorous and theoretical version of intermediate macro, but not as mathematical and difficult as 125. I would recommend it to another student if he\/she is interested in macro theory",
    "Econ 126 is a more mathematical version of Intermediate Macro. Prof. Smith is great and I really appreciated the small lecture format. Be prepared for some confusing lectures where you leave feeling lost, but there are many resources to help you figure stuff out. I appreciated the math and felt it was very helpful in gaining a deeper understanding of economics. If you have the math background and want to use multivariable calculus to understand economics, I definitely recommend this course.",
    "Mixed feelings about this class. I wish it was less mathematical and more applied, and that it better reflected the readings and textbooks ... but then again it's the quantitative, analytical alternative of macro and so I guess this was justified. I really enjoyed learning the theory behind the models, but I felt in the second half of the semester, Prof. Smith went a little too far with certain aspects (micro theory) without going much in depth at all with regards to really important topics (policy, open economy, etc.). Still enjoyed the class overall.",
    "I would recommend if you are looking for a much more challenging version of macro. You will need to put in a solid effort in order to really understand the concepts from class. If you're willing to put in the time, it would be a good class to take.",
    "I would recommend it to another student if they were very interested in economics and wanted a bit of a challenge."
