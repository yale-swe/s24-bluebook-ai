    "I would recommend this class to another student because its taught by a great professor.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course! It was one of my favorite classes this semester. I'm interested in ancient art, so this was the perfect class for me. Even if you're not particularly interested in ancient art, the course offers a great introduction to the subject in an engaging and interesting way. Professor Foster is wonderful and the lectures are fun.",
    "Not essential to History of Art majors. Though the images are often compelling, a great interest in ancient civilizations would serve the student well.",
    "A well-taught ad thorough survey of ancient painting and mosaic traditions from throughout the Near East.",
    "Absolutely take it! The lectures are relaxed and interesting, and yo will gain a great broad nderstanding of ancient art!"
