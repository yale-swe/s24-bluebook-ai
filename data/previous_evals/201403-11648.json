    "I think this course could be put at noon as an optional seminar session instead of a credited course that could be opened to all students who have specific interests in certain topics. Dr. White invited guest lecturers for each class session, which is the same way as the seminar sessions at noon that we frequently have, I believe opening this course to all other students might be helpful especially for the first years when they are still exploring their research or career interests.",
    "This course was extremely interesting and different. Structured such that the same person is never speaking more than once, this course covered a wide variety of topics to interest everyone. It was always relaxed and always conducive to learning.",
    "I really enjoyed this class and the topics we covered.",
    "I think the course was not meant for non-TCORE fellows--but it was very interesting regardless of whether or not all of the material was accessible or relevant to my interests as a first year MPH student.",
    "This course was great, I learned a lot. I think since it was the first time the course was taught I would be interested to see how the professor incorporated our comments in finessing the class in the future."

    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0The guests Dr. White invited were really experts from different fields and we had an overall understanding about tobacco products from basic science to policy regulation. And because we were a small class with less than 10 people who really took the class, Dr. White could pay more individualized attention to each of us that is the one thing I like the most.",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0Marney is one of the most enthusiastic and caring professors I've ever had. Although she did not teach every class, she was a fantastic role model and mentor for students working on their final projects. Her care for students growth and well-being was always apparent and for that I am extremely thankful!",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0Marney made the lectures really entertaining and informative.",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0Marney is extremely accessible and I think she did a nice job putting together a series of guest lecturers that were interesting.",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0Marney is excellent. She is very friendly and helps encourage discussion. We all felt very comfortable asking her questions and talking about our opinions.",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0she was often available to answer questions and help students."

    "If this course could be turned into optional seminar session at noon, then I think the broad topics could be helpful for more students to explore their interests in research or career.",
    "This class was perfect if you have any interest in issues about tobacco control. I would caution students, however, that in order to get the most out of the class you should have a background in basic science.",
    "Yes, I think we learned a lot of interesting information- I just am not sure how the course is going to change in the future."
