    "A great opportunity to learn US foreign policy from a practitioner. Definitely recommend.",
    "Great course on diplomacy and matters of U.S. foreign policy. I would recommend it wholeheartedly.",
    "Valuable for networking. Less so for academic purposes.",
    "This is a Global Affairs senior victory lap class. You get to sit around and chat about the issues of the day, never concentrating on one issue for more than one session. There's two papers, and you can write about basically anything, which gives you a good chance to explore something you're interested in.",
    "I would recommend this course because it is an unique opportunity to interact with a top State-man of the United States.You learn more listening 5 minutes of his classes than studying 5 months a book.The only downside of the course was the composition of the class: not balanced between graduate and undergraduate students.",
    "I would highly recommend the course to anyone with an interest in American Politics - be it at the domestic or at the international level. The course will give historical and contemporary insight into national security and diplomatic procedures."

    "The course offered great insight and context to the topics I am studying. It was also a great way to see the types of issues and questions I would need to address later in my profession on certain matters of U.S. national security and foreign policy.",
    "It deepened my knowledge and gave me a chance to apply my knowledge to current issues.",
    "This was a very enlightening course on the highest of American Politics. It definetly helps understand the US as an international power and how to establish and lead diplomatic relations with it."
