    "This class is zany and fun. It is not what you would expect from a typical 'Music Appreciation class,' although that classifier seems to be the closest match to what this class seems to accomplish. I am now endowed with tools necessary to evaluate love songs through a cultural, musical, and historical lens, which has in turn given me a whole new appreciation for the art form of song creation in general.",
    "This is definitely a great course to gain an overview on the history of music and how it has evolved through different genres and subjects. If you want to focus only on contemporary music or learn about songs you have heard before, then this probably isn't the right class (you start with 12th century troubador music). There isn't a large workload at all and some class sessions are pretty fun--we watched a live opera broadcast, an excerpt from Showboat, and performed parlor songs.",
    "Take this class! Music is everywhere, and I assure you that you will learn so many things that we take for granted every day by not listening properly, or by not thinking about the history behind the songs that we know. This course is enriching, inspiring and surprising, funny as often as it is moving (which is often). Professor Zayaruznaya is a great professor who always comes to class with valuable insights. You don't really need music theory to take this class some experience would be a slight advantage, but not much. This is a great course for people who love music, history, literature, art, culture, and the way they all intersect. Highly recommended!",
    "I would most likely recommend this class to another student. It was very interesting and a cool new way to look at music, though you have to be truly interested to enjoy it."
