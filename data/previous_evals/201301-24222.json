    "Loved this course, would have been nice to have more of that \"at the chalk-board\" discussions as that seemed to be more engaging for the students compared to the regular presentation\/discussion based classes.Also, integrating a lecture component would have been rewarding. If anything a 15 minute presentation on the topic then discussions- as I know some people in the class had been presented with the readings\/material with little to no background in the subject.",
    "It has a great group of instructors that it's very nice to meet and get to know. It covers some interesting topics as well and the guest speakers were very good. One thing I would change would be to have the entire class read only one or two papers on a subject for a week, but to then talk about it in great depth: how they use statistics and other methods, their argumentation, etc. Perhaps we could all even write a short review of the article before class as a practice\/learning exercise. I don't think we should do that every week, but perhaps at least once or twice in the semester.",
    "Course covered a variety of topics, but has been one of my most engaging and challenging courses at Yale. Really appreciated combined input of instructors, as well as the small class size and discussion with fellow students. Appreciated instructors information, experience, and push to expand our knowledge and interests. Dinner with current researchers was a definite privilege and treat.Since this class will continue to into the following semester I have instructor ratings until that ime.",
    "GREAT COURSE! Strengths: I have a strong background in biological sciences, but I still felt challenged by some of the assigned readings and topics for discussion, which is always appreciated. This took me out of my comfort zone and forced me to read through and review the material more thoroughly than I would have otherwise. I really liked the structure of the class, breaking into small groups to discuss the papers and giving short group presentations to the class. I also liked that discussion and questions were encouraged. The guest lecturers rounded out the class and provided a chance to learn from \"the experts\" and to get a feel for where our academic and professional careers might take us! Lastly, going through the process of identifying a summer research project and writing a research proposal (and next semester a scientific paper) is an invaluable experience! Very fun and rewarding too!"

    "Instructor: Alison Galvani \u00a0It was nice to get Dr. Galvani's perspective on topics during the classes that she attended. I would have liked to have gotten even more from her, as each professor offers his\/her own unique experiences and point of view.",
    "Instructor: Durland Fish \u00a0It was nice to get Dr. Fish's perspective on topics during the classes that he attended. I would have liked to have gotten even more from him, as each professor offers his\/her own unique experiences and point of view.",
    "Instructor: Paul Turner \u00a0The class that Dr. Turner led was different in structure from those led by Dr. Stearns, but I really enjoyed the relaxed atmosphere in which we discussed the assigned papers and thought through the questions and ideas posed during the discussion.",
    "Instructor: Stephen Stearns \u00a0Dr. Stearns is a remarkable professor. He really pushes his students to carefully read and evaluate the assigned research articles. His tremendous wealth of knowledge of evolutionary biology adds a great deal to the class discussions. I also really liked the lecture he gave and would have liked even more. Dr. Stearns really inspires you to want to learn and know more!"

    "Very interesting overview of evolutionary medicine including access to some of Yale's great minds and some visiting researchers\/faculty from elsewhere. It involves a good bit of reading, but not a ton of work overall, so I think it's a nice addition to other classes that teach more more depth about particular topics or that teach you specific methods in detail.",
    "A must take course from graduate students. Challenging but reward for anyone interested in research, public health, disease ecology or evolutionary biology.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student! This course provides a great survey of important topics in evolutionary biology but would also be useful for students who may not have a particular interest in evolutionary biology but would like a novel perspective on important topics in health and medicine. It is a really fun, exciting, and rewarding course!"
