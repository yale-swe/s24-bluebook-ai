    "This course is challenging but very rewarding. Os is one of the best teachers in the school, in my opinion. He is very fair and honest about the workload at the beginning of the semester. He was willing to work with me anytime I asked for a meeting, and clearly has a passion for what he teaches.",
    "Very heavy amount of work and a very challenging class. Having just finished though, I think this is the most valuable course I've taken at FES in my first year.",
    "This course was truly a terrific component of my education at FES and will be one of the most influential classes in my time here. Os manages to teach conservation in a way that fluidly blends theory and application.",
    "I thoroughly enjoyed this course! I feel like the PVA assignment was not so useful, and it may be better to spend more time on the mapping exercises (assignment 2-4). While I am excited to have these preliminary skills for species distribution modeling, it would be great to be able to understand it well enough to do these types of things in the real world. Right now, it seems that the point of this course is to understand these types of models, but we don't know enough to do it professionally. It just seems like a missed opportunity.",
    "An amazing class. I would recommend to anyone with an interest in conservation. The course seems daunting at first, but with the workshops to teach R and QGIS throughout the course, I managed to emerge with a more robust skill set. I thought I wouldnt survive the course, but I did and enjoyed it the time!"

    "This class fosters huge personal\/academic growth in a very short time period. I loved the learning curve, and feel that I have gained very strong technical skills in this class.",
    "Lectures were extremely interesting and provided a deeper understanding of applied conservation biology. While assignments were incredibly challenging and time consuming, they certainly served their purpose and provided students with hands-on, technical knowledge of tools and programs that are critical work in conservation.",
    "Learning the skills and framework to do comprehensive and science-based conservation planning.",
    "I enjoyed the homework assignments and the group work.",
    "I believe I learned more transferable skills from this course than any other at FES. The assignments give you the chance to practice different spatial and population modeling skills that will be very useful to anyone engaged in landscape-scale conservation work.",
    "The built in class workshops were an essential component. Without them I don't think I could have made as much progress as I did. I also really appreciated that we used R and QGIS which are both open source softwares as I plan to work in the developing world. Having the opportunity to choose our own study areas was also a great aspect of this course because it exposed the students to the difficulties of getting enough data. it also teaches you to be creative in how you fill that gap, always being aware of the assumptions you must make.",
    "Applying the spatial modeling techniques we were learning to real scenarios in the assignments and final project",
    "The course was very valuable for me as a conservationist. It exposed me to spatial analysis adequately and I am glad that I will carry this sort of work forward in my career.",
    "The best aspect of this course is the actual skills you learn in this course. All of these skills and lectures are very applicable to future jobs and can help make students to do better analyses and marketable to the job market.",
    "The material is critical to conservation science."

   "comments": [
    "- wish the lectures were more advanced, seemed relatively basic. Specifically, I wish we had discussed more of the underlying assumptions in the models instead of simply find\/replacing R code, and using them somewhat blindly. - was a little disappointed in the stewardship lectures. I like the intent of discussing stewardship, but think the execution could be improved in two ways: 1) on the lecture portion, could have had more discussion, it was one of the few lectures that ran out of time without any time for questions. I had a couple issues with the underlying assumptions, such as the only options are windmills on tops of mountains or the world is going to end from climate change. It was weird because the whole course, Os does a great job of talking about scenario planning and variants on outcomes, and then when it comes to climate change it's life or death. and 2) on the break-out groups, would be way better if it was a specific example. It was the most vague tee-up of all time, and so you're just not going to get anything useful out of it. Let's talk through a very specific problem!",
    "R. The course should require students to have a previous interaction with the statistical software.",
    "There are several things that would make this course better. First, I think group projects, while valuable, should require equitable group sizes throughout the class. The workload is hugely disparate when there are groups of three and groups of 6 with the same expectations for all. Second, access to Yale computers that have the software required for this class (QGIS and CircuitScape) should be available, because most student's laptop do not have the RAM required to run huge datasets through these applications successfully. Finally, the readings were hugely helpful, but my sense was that most student didn't do them because they were rarely mentioned in class and Os reviewed them in his lectures. If he could create a mechanism for accountability to ensure students do the readings before lectures, the class would get a lot out of it. Folks manage their workload according to what's required, so even though we of course could have held ourselves accountable, it's helpful to have that institutionalized.",
    "This course would benefit from more than one TA, as well as support from Yale computer labs. Some work was too heavy for laptops, and necessary software programs could not always be downloaded onto school desktops.",
    "There should be additional support for students who are new to either R or GIS. The TA was very knowledgeable, but had limited availability across all students in the class.",
    "I wish I had more support \/ experience with R prior to the course. It was a very steep learning curve early on and I often felt helpless without Matthew's assistance. I think it might be helpful of Os had a better idea of the modeling that was required as this might make prerequisites clearer.",
    "Overall I don't think the course needs much improvement. However, I came into the class with a basic level of skill in R and GIS. Many students did not have any experience with these types of software, and I think they found the course very challenging because of that. While there were some basic workshops set up to help introduce students to the software, I don't think they were extensive enough.",
    "I would have like to have more seminar type classes to discusses problems\/challenges with our projects as we progressed and to also discuss some of the topics that Os lectured on.",
    "The software materials (Excel processes, R scripts, GIS procedures, Maxent, Circuitscape) that formed the heart of the project work were in some cases not properly ready for the course, especially true of the R scripts (which needed more documentation as well as testing). There was not nearly enough teaching fellow support. And, while very knowledgeable and more than generous with his time, the one teaching fellow worked better with Apple than with Windows and other products. The time students wasted on incompletely prepared or presented software materials and on struggling with downloading internet materials without more instructions for doing so (these were very complex files to find, select, download and convert) should be considered unconscionable. The workshops were not workshops. They went too rapidly and included too little time eliciting student involvement to be considered workshops. Additionally, the materials needed preloaded for the workshops were available far too late (late night before, morning of). On the other hand... The course is being upgraded, developed, brought in line with cutting-edge and state-of-the-science software tools, so it is to be recognized that this year's course was a one-time experience. The course should-not-have-beens were too many and too hard to take to be considered just part of the process of professional development; but, this was certainly not willful, one doubts that the course will be run this way again, and one does not doubt the best intentions and the expertise of the instructor and the teaching fellow. Students in the future will benefit from the beta-testing of this year's students. Oswald Schmitz is responsive to student needs, sometimes recognizing them before the students do; and the opportunity to learn with him is not to be missed. The course had to move in the direction of more software tools to be a good professional-preparation course. Bottom-line: much more teaching-fellow support, better tested software materials, and better-prepared workshops covering less ground per workshop. The workshops will work if the materials are better pretested, if there is proper lead time to preload software and if they are done either as two-day experiences or with optional follow-up sessions."

In the real world, successful teams have individuals who have clearly defined roles and responsibilities.",
    "The course is designed for students to work in groups. The final project has a consulting project format in which collaboration and team work are necessary. The most notorious advantage of this approach is that it simulates real life conditions in which working with people and developing team work skills is imperative.",
    "My group dynamic was hugely challenging - my group was smaller than others in the class and workload felt disproportionate.",
    "There are always pros and cons to group work, and dealing with both provide real world skills. I had a strong group in most ways, though we did struggle with one member who did not produce material at the rate that was needed. This required problem solving and compromise, which I see as a necessary part of the learning process here.",
    "Group members bring varied perspectives and expertise to the term project. However, there is no check on the contributions of each team member. I would recommend a peer evaluation be incorporated into grading for this course, so that individuals are held more accountable for their work.",
    "I was really frustrated by my group work but feel this is more representative of my choice of group members rather than the framework for the group project. I consistently felt as though I were the only member of the group meeting our internal deadlines and completing the work I had committed to completed. I ended up picking up a lot of slack for other team members in the midst of a very heavy semester. This project lends itself well to a team but was a struggle for me.",
    "The group aspect was great. Without my group I dont think I would have learned as much. We did all our assignments together and helped each other troubleshoot. A value addition to the class.",
    "Working in the group for the final project was great because we were able to help each other out and learn from one another, since we had different strengths. Coordinating was a bit difficult in a group of 6, but we planned things well in advance and scheduling ended up worked out well.",
    "The group setting was very good and I highly recommend maintaining it in the coming years. Everyone in the group had the opportunity to show=off their spatial analysis skills, presentation and report writing.",
    "I worked with a really good group of students that brought different strengths to the project.",
    "Group works seems entirely appropriate and beneficial for this course. It has the advantages of expanding the amount of work that could be covered to take a system\/ landscape approach. The work is also very conducive to drawing on different team members strengths for the projects. A disadvantage, as with any group work, would be the possibility of ending up in a group that did not have a good work dynamic. However, I was very pleased with my group.",

If you're willing to work, though, this course is exactly what we all need. It's a truly wonderful learning opportunity for those willing to put the time in (and for those who can handle a little bit of stress from time to time)!

You may also be focused on just getting the current assignment done.

    "If you are learning conservation biology, take the course. Seek out assistance as often as you need it, as soon as you need it. Start the assignments as soon as you can, and work on them intensely early on. It is a good course, and the software and support issues of this year should be much less of an issue for you. R, GIS, Maxent and Circuitscape (and programs similar to Circuitscape) are the newest tools in the conservation science toolbox, so let's master them."
