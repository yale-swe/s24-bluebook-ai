    "Take it!",
    "Great class. You will learn not only about Arabic literature but also about the novel as a genre. Work load is reasonable and the reading is great. Definitely would recommend this class.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. It was interesting, and provided a window into a genre that I would not come across in my daily reading.",
    "This was a great seminar - Ala Alryyes is an absolute sweetheart, the novels were great and the discussions were stimulating. What more would you want? I took the class Credit\/D, which was completely unnecessary; I put as much effort into the final paper as I would have for a class I was taking for a letter grade simply because I found the material so interesting.",
    "Great class, take it! The professor is excellent.",
    "If you're interested in literature, or in the Middle East, or neither and you just want a class with a good professor, take this class. The books we read were great, the discussions allowed everyone to voice their thoughts and there were some strong thinkers in the class, so the discussions were lively."
