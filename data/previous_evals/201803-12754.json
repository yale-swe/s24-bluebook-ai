    "As it said in the class's title, I learned the basics to R.",
    "I gained practical skills in R coding, as well as insight into how statistics and graphics can be used to communicate my research questions and how I've tried to answer them.",
    "This class doesn't just teach you how to use R, but instead you walk away knowing how to think like a computer and answer your own inquiries using R as a tool.",
    "I gained adequate knowledge and skills in the use of R software program for analyzing and presenting data."

    "Accurately.",

    "Well",
    "They were perfect.",
    "Very well, I feel that I have a great foundation in R to jump off of.",
    "It was as per the expectations.",
    "I thoroughly enjoyed this course, and I feel like I received a good background on how to use and navigate R. I've taken other statistics programming courses in the past, and while I enjoyed how flexible and hands-off this course was (in terms of teaching ourselves the program using SWIRL lessons), I sometimes wish that Simon had lectured a bit more (which he did towards the end of the semester, which was appreciated).",
    "Pretty well, I would have liked to do more with data visualization but I think that is somewhat outside of the goals for this course, and the information I did learn in this course certainly helped me to learn more about data visualization on my own outside of the course.",
    "It was what I thought I would gain",
    "Appropriately. I would say that we spent a lot more time on the stats part of things than I imagined though. I was hoping to do more actual programming etc. which we did forwards the end. I needed a stats refresher though so I'm not complaining per se but I wasn't expecting it so much.",
    "The class was pretty much exactly what I expected - great applied introduction to programming in R",
    "The skills gained in this class aligned with my expectations.",
    "It aligned very well.",
    "The knowledge and skills gained from this class far exceeds my expectation. The course provided additional resources for data manipulation and that really was great."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of the course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: The teaching model is great. The SWIRL lessons are excellent, and the instructors understand how students learn programming. This was in pleasant contrast to prior programming courses I'd taken where students with little background were often thrown into the deep end right at the start. Weaknesses: I thought the labs were very simple. A slightly more challenging problem set every week would have been welcome.",
    "Could be better taught so that class time actually introduces and walks through new concepts or is a walk through recap",
    "I think its perfect for students new to R like I was.",
    "The SWIRL exercises were very unique and interesting. The TA and the Instructor made an epic team.",
    "SWIRL lessons were fun - and I enjoyed the encouraging notes and feedback. The ability to learn from and correct our homework assignments was also incredibly helpful and appreciated :). I do wish that the course had a bit more lecturing \/ instruction from Simon - perhaps he could take us through an exercise after running through the lecture's notes (I would have been fine with doing SWIRLS outside of class if it had meant more time and instruction). Similarly, I learned a lot doing the homework assignments \/ labs, but often felt like I wasn't equipped with all of the information needed to complete them from just the lesson notes and SWIRL notes alone, which made completing the assignments sometimes challenging.",
    "The course was very organized. The structure of lecture then practice worked really well!",
    "The SWIRLs, labs, and Friday bootcamps were very helpful to learn the material at your own pace, with instant feedback, and with real hands-on practice. Compared to other coding courses where we sit and listen to a lecture on how to code, a big strength of this course was the ability to learn by doing R labs and SWIRLs instead of only listening to a lecture. The data project was also a good learning experience, and I appreciated how it was flexible and could be tailored to best support our research outside of the course. One weakness was the disconnect between the SWIRLs and the course website. I found the information in the SWIRLs more helpful than the website sometimes, and it was difficult to go back and find the lessons from the SWIRLs when they were not on the website.",
    "There was plenty of support and time to work on assignments in class, however it was a little disorganized in the beginning",
    "The labs are a great strength. I also liked working through it in class with Batman (Simon) and Robin (Andrew) around to help. It was nice they stayed till 3 every day - I often did as well! Maybe make the lecture part a bit more engaging? Like I often wanted to write some of the code up there in an effort to follow along but sometimes we moved to fast and I just glazed over about it. Also Friday bootcamp was amazing. The coffee and treats were a plus. You guys did a great job fielding our questions and coaching (or dragging) us to success.",
    "I thought the applied nature of this class was really successful, and the Friday morning office hours were great for going over any additional questions",
    "Overall, I thought this was a great class. It gave me skill that I will definitely use in my research and my master's thesis. I really enjoyed the swirl lessons, labs, and Friday bootcamp. The in-class lectures could have been a bit clearer.",
    "Strengths of the class includes able to bring in material to analyze, as well as interactive lessons on R; weaknesses involve the general lack of engagement during lecture.",
    "I definitely have more confidence using R, but I wish lectures consisted of more \"how to\" programming instead of traditional lectures. Class time was not maximize, but the SWIRLS were very comprehensive in teaching R skillsets. Some of the SWIRLS contained content that was rarely discussed in class and that could be frustrating at times.",
    "The course brings cutting-edge knowledge on data analysis and empowered students to try out the procedures personally."

   "comments": [
    "Definitely a great introduction to programming class that is probably more accessible than the usual. Take this if you have no background and want to build one, or even if you have some limited background and need a refresher. If, like me, you are interested in learning R but lack the time or motivation to do it independently, this course is the ticket. The labs are easy. Finishing them will get you the grade, but if you want to establish a deeper level of comfort with using R, don't be afraid to seek out additional problems from the internet or textbooks. Definitely refresh your statistics before you start. The course assumes knowledge of statistics, and while you can still get through reasonably well without a solid statistical foundation, you can get A LOT MORE out of the course by brushing up on stats beforehand.",
    "Not to take it unless you absolutely know you will need to do R or coding",
    "I would highly recommend taking if you have an interest in data and research. It's best if you have your own data to work through during the course.",
    "Go to office hours! Take advantage of Andrew and Simon's time that they offer, because they have great insight!",
    "It is a very good course especially if you are into data science or analysis. A statistics background might be very helpful.",
    "This is a great, thorough course for someone with limited-to-no background in R who is looking for a comprehensive understanding into how to use the program. It's *not* a statistics course, but, rather, it's just an overview on the R program and language.",
    "This course is a decent amount of work outside of class (weekly labs and SWIRLs, and the final data project), but the basic R skills you learn are helpful and it is very helpful to go to the weekly Friday bootcamps.",
    "You get what you put in",
    "Awesome way to learn R. Simon and Andrew are great and patient and know their stuff. Some stats ahead of time could be helpful as this is a stats heavy course. The project is what you make it. If you have some good data you want to work with you can really do something cool!",
    "If you want a hands-on introduction to programming in R, definitely take it.",
    "If you want to do scientific research, take this class.",
    "Invest some time outside the class to work on the lessons and labs.",
    "Go to the Friday sessions because you will receive very individualistic attention.",
    "This is a very good hands on course for anyone interested in data analysis. You need to try to follow the weekly assignments as this will pay off at the end when you prepare your final project."
