   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend DS Lit to a fellow student. Although you unfortunately have to go through each of the books fairly quickly, as I mentioned above, the amount of material and different genres that are covered in the course is truly remarkable. I had the opportunity to read so many great works of ancient literature that I probably would never had read otherwise, but some of these works, such as Antigone, have ended up being some of my favorite books.",
    "Professor Yeazell's section is great! If you get placed in it definitely stay. Discussions in her class are very rewarding because she makes sure we tackle many important passages in the text by guiding the discussion. Her guiding of discussion is not too firm so it allows students to discuss other passages they found interesting as well. I also appreciated her providing of background for texts.",
    "Would absolutely recommend. When else are you going to get a chance to read great literature with great professors? Yeazell is also a wonderful section leader.",
    "This course is a broad survey of western literature from Homer to Dante, with emphasis on how earlier texts influence later ones. I would recommend this course to anyone with an interest in literature.",
    "Because this class also comes with two other classes, I would really think about what you want to study and how you want to study. If you want to study things in depth or break out of the Western Canon into new subjects, you should definitely not take this class. However, if you are interested in a variety of Greek, Roman, and Medieval works, I would take this class.",
    "Foremost, this is a Directed Studies course with all of the merits and challenges that entails. Beyond this, Directed Studies Literature is a fantastic introduction to the Western tradition and the practice of analyzing literary works from nuanced passages to canonical themes. The opportunity to take this course with Professor Yeazell should not be missed. For each literary work, her enthusiasm and keen observations create an environment of lively discussion and exciting discoveries."
