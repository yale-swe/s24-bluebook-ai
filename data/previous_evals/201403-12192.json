    "Directed Studies is pretty awesome. This literature course is an incredible survey of some incredible pieces of literature, and if you are interested in DS you will not be disappointed. It is a lot of work, but it is totally manageable, and the intellectual payoff is well worth a few late nights and extra effort.",
    "Take DS for the entire experience, but, hey: take DS especially for literature. You'll read texts you might not outside of it, but they're ones that are important to read in a discussion-based, intense setting.",
    "I would recommend it.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to anyone who is committed to putting in the work. A desire to read literature (as well as philosophy, histories, and political works -- can't have the first without the other three) is also pretty necessary. If you put in the work (which isn't as bad as it sounds), this class will be incredibly rewarding.",
    "Lit is a survey of classical literature from Homer to Dante. Take the class; the books are great.",
    "DS is usually billed as a tour of the Western canon, and I think that the tour metaphor is actually quite apt. The books on this syllabus are like the Leaning Tower of Pisa or Mount Rushmore or the Eiffel Tower, landmarks that you probably first encounter in the form of a cartoon or an off-hand reference on a TV show rather than as a monument erected for a specific reason in a specific place at a specific time. I knew the books on this list by the cultural memes and one-liner summaries that they spawned, and it was exhilarating to get to read the books for myself and see what had been diluted or filtered out by the time I first heard about these books. As with any tour, you must also keep in mind that you are seeing highlights, a selection of sights based on what has survived. These books did not endure because they were superior to their peers; they endured due to a lot of factors that don't indicate their quality. I would recommend DS Fall Literature as long as the student is committed to reading every page of these works. You dont have to read every page with the same attention to detail and not every page will be equally annotated, but one of the skills that DS teaches is sensitivity to density and significance, (ie learning which passages to skim and which passages to explicate) and you can only acquire this capacity if you read the works in their entirety.",
    "Lots of great books, but you'll skip a lot of it and go too fast, sadly. Classic DS, classic college."
