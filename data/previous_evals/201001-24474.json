   "comments": [
    "I would not recommend this course. I would recommend taking the many courses on the history of the book in the art history and art departments, and on theories of literature and authorship in Lit Theory.",
    "Yes, absolutely. For anyone interested in media studies, this course is a must.",
    "This class was very strange. There were some cool elements (we met in the Beinecke, we got Kindles, we got to meet some interesting people in the Library system). And both Brantley and Pressmen were very worthwhile and engaging teachers. But it was often unclear what the bases of our conversations were... like there was some intellectual gap that prevented us from making headway on the (very important) questions asked of us. So discussion tended toward the dull. But potentially excellent, especially with some tweaks.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to anyone. There's a lot of work, but I thought it was well worth it. The opportunity to work with medieval manuscripts alone makes it worthwhile. The topics were great and very relevant given the current shift in book technology. It was a lot of fun, and it made me think in different ways from other classes I've taken at Yale.",
    "This was an interesting class and will only improve if it is taught again. The parallels between New Media and Medieval Manuscripts were very interesting and it was neat to really think about what a book is, has been, and can be.",
    "Absolutely! Be prepared to do a lot of reading and approach material in ways you've never considered before."
