    "This course was excellently structured in order to teach us how to conduct and write independent research projects. I also learned so much from my fellow students and found their engagement with my own work helpful.",
    "It provided me an opportunity to get more practice doing archival research and writing an original research paper. I got to know the library resources at Yale better and had time to explore digital resources outside the institution.",
    "how to better write a research paper. And address the different writing pitfalls.",
    "Students came away from this course having written a research paper that could fit into a dissertation or stand alone as an article in a peer-reviewed journal. Prof. Sabin worked with students on their academic writing, and also at the level of framing a research question and problem."

   "comments": [
    "I feel like maybe there should have been another deadline in between the draft and the final. There was a big gap between the two. Strengths include the professor's willingness to meet, engagement of other students, structure to actually write and research!",
    "It was nice to have Paul's pointed, honest criticisms on drafts of my paper, as well as the comments of my colleagues. Paul didn't always seem to know the answers but he knew where to point us. There were a few class sessions that weren't as productive in the discussions as they maybe could have been. But having regular check-ins definitely wasn't a bad thing. And I could see progress in all the students' papers as the semester proceeded. I think to a certain extent it could have benefited from having a little more reading to showcase examples of proper essays, but not too much because it tends to get buried in priorities behind readings for readings classes.",
    "The professor offers very insightful as well as manageable suggestions. With his help, I have a better sense of how to convey my ideas."

   "comments": [
    "Yes",
    "Yes. It's always nice to have time to research and write, and Paul was a good facilitator.",
    "I would highly recommend this course. I have learned a lot of writing skills and avoided a lot of writing pitfalls. If I did not take this course, I would hardly know where my research will navigate. Indeed, a fantastic course.",
    "This course was excellent, and I would highly recommend it to students seeking to improve their academic writing or begin working on a dissertation chapter. Prof. Sabin generously gave his time to offer line edits, and comments on multiple drafts of our seminar papersall invaluable from the perspective of a graduate student."
