   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course because it was interesting. It was better than most history courses I have taken.",
    "This is a good class if you're interested in the most social aspect (instead of the scientific one) of the history of DNA. Prof. Strasser also devles into the history of the biotech industry, which as a HSHM major potentially interested in the pharmaceutical industry, I found extremely interesting. You learn a lot about an interesting subject, although there are definitely too many details in the lectures.",
    "A great course--take it!",
    "History 193 was a great class, especially if you're interested in molecular biology. No science knowledge is required and the class covers a plethora of material that all comes to haunt you at the end of the semester. I do recommend this class, however youmust keep up with it. Don't rely on being able to skip out of the final by submitting a research paper, because he only allows two or three student to do it.",
    "If you need to take a 5th class, this would be perfect.",
    "LOTS of readings, memorization of dates and names, Final isn't long but has a focus on details of history.",
    "A wonderful wonderful class. Highly recommended.",
    "This class walks through the rise of the discipline of molecular biology, tracing its history through various social redefinitions of life and its smallest units - the constant reevaluation of \"the secret of life.\"Strasser's lectures are funny and interesting. Lectures will pretty effectively cover what you must know for the class. The evaluation structure is relatively generous to the student, and does not add too much work during conventional high stress periods.While the courseis relatively easy and enjoyable, unless you are very interested in the subject and plan on doing not only the assigned readings but also additional work, or want to fill a schedule slot with something vaguely interesting that won't take up too much time, I'm not sure I would recommend the class. In many ways the material could be summed up effectively in a 90 minute documentary, and the devotion of an entire semester to the subject, in the manner in which it is currently presented, may be overkill for most, or not enough for people who are seriously interested.",
    "A history of molecular biology and biotechnology in the 20th c. Strasser is a generally good lecturer, although his pace can get pretty fast. Assignments are reasonable, grading is pretty fair. I'd recommend it for History\/HSHM majors or any others interested in the subject who can deal with fast-paced, fact-heavy history lectures.",
    "Great course, almost like a survey of the major events and why they happened from Mendel's Laws and the focus on proteins in the early 1900s all the way to today's biotechnology industry. It's essentially a story of molecular biology's coming of age as a legitimate field. VERY interesting. Also pretty easy: 1-page newspaper analysis, 5-page book review, and a final.",
    "This is an excellent course for a history student interested in the development of today's most prominent scientific field or for a science student interested in learning the background of his\/her field (or looking for a humanities credit). The workload is relatively low and the material is almost always interesting. The assessments are few and well spread out. I would highly recommend this course.",
    "If you're interested in the history of molecular biology, take it. Not too much work throughout the semester, though the material does get a little dry near the middle. Doesn't require knowledge of science. Final is a lot of memorization. Professor and TA were fantastic and really open to working with students.",
    "Decent course, not too hard if you want it to be (especially the 1 and 5 page paper) and not much work if you don't want it to be.",
    "Structurally, not one of the best HSHM classes I've taken but the material is interesting. If the format changes its definitely worth taking.",
    "There was none of the promised life or disease in this course. It was essentially a history of molecular biology. While interesting, it was a monotone focus and the uniqueness wore off after a few lectures. The class still presented worthwhile information, but not what I was looking for."
