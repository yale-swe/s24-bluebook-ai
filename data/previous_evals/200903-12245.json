    "This is a good class, but far too much reading.",
    "YES! yale doesnt offer many latin american history courses, or south american history courses, therefore if you have any interest in the region, this is a must. the reading is amazing, even though there's a lot of it! professor schwartz does a great job at exposing different theories and ideas about colonization. i loved it!! and even though its a survey course over a large period of time and a large geographical area, it does not feel like a high school history course.",
    "Interesting lectures that cover a wide range of material. Definitely be prepared for a lot of reading and more work than most history classes, but if you enjoy the material it's worth it. Think hard about whether you're willing to make the time commitment, but if you are then go for it!",
    "I took this class to fill my \"other parts of the world\" requirement for the history major, and didn't think I would enjoy it, but it has definitely been one of my favorite history classes. Even though it's a lot of work (a lot of reading, two papers, a midterm and a final), it is really fascinating, and certainly broadens your knowledge of an important (and very nearby) part of the world. I would definitely recommend it if you have even an inkling of interest in the subject.",
    "This is a great class. It was my first history class and I loved it. There is way too much reading to actually do but don't let that discourage you. If you have any interest in Latin America, take this class!",
    "Class covering latin america from spanish\/portuguese conquest through the late 19th century when many countries gained their independence. It's a pretty solid \"third world\" credit, but the material can at times be very dry and even repetitive, especially if you do not have a pre-existing interest in Latin America.",
    "A very typical history lecture. You'll learn some interesting specific facts and some broad generalizations, but as in most surveys, don't expect to come out really understanding colonial Latin America because the topic is so broad. Schwartz is a decent lecturer, although his textbook, Early Latin America, is boring and over-generalized and was my least favorite part of the course. Assignments are numerous (2 tests and 2 papers) but not very demanding. Overall, a good course for people interested in the subject, and a useful choice as a non-Western for anyone interested in European or U.S. history around 1500-1830.",
    "WAY TOO MUCH READING. But the good news is, you don't really have to do it. But the bad news is that you really won't get that much out of the course if you don't do the reading. Also, two papers, a mid-term and a final and section is a lot.",
    "yes, definitely - the lectures are great, the material is interesting, the grading is easy, and you don't have to do the reading.",
    "Survey of pre-conquest, conquest, colonial empire development, and the path to independence in Latin America.",
    "I thought CLA was a pretty solid class, despite the fact that some of the readings were on fairly recondite subjects. Alas, such is the nature of most Yale history courses. Still, even if you can't\/don't do all the reading, you'll still probably come away with a pretty broad, if not very deep, understanding of Spanish America.",
    "Yes, this is a pretty good class. There's a fair amount of reading. The lectures are pretty solid.",
    "I'd recommend it if you're interested in the field or want to learn more about it. Not my favorite history course that I've taken, but it's not really the area I was most excited for. You come away with a strong base of knowledge though.",
    "You should definitely take this course! Super interesting and fun.",
    "The course was great. Prof Schwartz is the man&he makes lecture fun and interesting. Please take it if you have any interest in colonial latin america.",
    "Colonial Latin America is a great class because it really delves into Latin American history, which to me was an area I knew virtually nothing about before the class. There are a lot of readings though which can be a little overwhelming. The lectures are really interesting.",
    "Colonial Latin America is a survey of the history, politics, and culture of colonial Spanish America and Brazil, starting with pre-contact America and the Iberian peninsula through the movements for independence in the 19th century.Professor Schwartz was a dynamic lecturer (though some of the lectures were better organized than others).The reading load was heavy for a lecture class but was always pretty interesting (Professor Schwartz tried to combine primary and secondary sources, which was very cool). Be warned that there are two papers, the second of which was an 8-10 page research paper (seemed a little heavy for a lecture).",
    "Take it if you are very interested in Latin America. It's a good course, but lots of work so you need to be motivated.",
    "History 355 is a great intro history course. The material is interesting, Prof. Schwartz engages students with amazing narrative skills, and all the readings are captivating. This course has tought me a lot about Colonial Latin America, which was a novel topic for me, and it gave me the joy of learning history.",
    "It was okay. Not very exciting information. Yes, pirates do make a brief cameo. And the conquest of the area is interesting. But, it is mostly about labor systems, identity, ethnic and gender roles, etc. Very much a cultural history. If that's your thing: take it. If not: the 300 plus pages a week on \"millenarianism\" and shifting conceptions of race will be insufferable. Plus, the two papers, midterm, final, and section are a little over the top. In short, if you know you already like the subject, go for it. If not, be careful.",
    "no. way too much work.",
    "This course provides an overview of Latin American history from the conquest to the independence movements. Professor Schwartz is very enthusiastic about the material and really makes his lectures engaging. The course does have more work than a standard history class (two papers, midterm and final exams), but it is nothing too excessive. If you have any interest in the topic, I would definitely recommend this course.",
    "prepare to do more work than you might have expected. It's not too difficult to do well - it just gets exhausting before the test.",
    "It's a good overview of Latin American history. It's a lot of reading and plenty of work (2 papers, midterm and final, around a book a week), but not very hard. Professor Schwartz spins a really good narrative of Latin American history, but it's fairly Eurocentric--all about how events in Europe shapedthe course of Latin America. Which is probably unavoidable but it would be nice to see more critique of this view. It's enjoyable, but kind of like a high school history course.",
    "This class is a great introduction to Latin American history. Professor Schwartz does a great job at showing the importance of developments in Latin America on world history. This class is especially great for fulfilling the history major pre-industrial and \"rest of world\" requirements. I definitely recommend this class.",
    "Great class, but beware its a LOT of reading! And a lot of material\/work in general.",
    "Professor Schwartz made this class absolutely fantastic. He made an already interesting topic even better with his great lectures--he lectures without any notes at all and has the tone of telling a bedtime story. Professor Schwartz is fabulous and made HIST 355 just as good. It's a good class to get a PreIndustrial distribution for the major, as well.",
    "Colonial Latin America is an excellent overview of Spanish imperial history, indigenous American history, and an interesting study of the interaction of the two. It sets up a great background for any further Latin American study- it presents the ideas of how and why certain cultures and communities have developed into their present states. Great class- a must take for history majors.",
    "Great course! I definitely suggest it to any other student, especially if you need a PreInd. Prof. Schwartz is very engaging so you won't be bored in lecture. There's a bunch of reading, but that's pretty standard for any history class. The other coursework is very manageable: 2 papers (one short and one longer 8-10 pgs.), a miderm (you get all the possible essay questions and IDs), and a final.",
    "I really enjoed this couse. It seemed pretty standard for a history course in terms of work load, but lecture was really good, and I liked the material.",
    "Take it if you need a preindustrial rest of world history credit, like I did. Overall I found the class to be interesting, though the readings were excessive in quantity and often quite dull. The lectures were great, too. I enjoyed the class, but I would not say it has been one of my favorite history classes at Yale.",
    "I would recommend it unconditionally if I knew that I had an 'A'.",
    "A great survey of Latin American history from the arrival of Columbus to independence.",
    "History 355 will more or less tell you how modern culture was formed. You will learn about how indigenous tribes mixed with the Europeans and how colonies formed. You will learn everything from culture to trade to inheritance rights in the New World. I did not think I would love the class but Schwartz made me love it and made me actually interested in the topics. There is a lot of work for this class - too much for a lecture, but if you have time to devote to it, I would definitely recommend it. That said, there is a lot of work but the exams are not difficult.",
    "Yes-- great course on the birth of Latin America. Be ready for the workload though.",
    "I would wholeheartedly recommend History 355. The course effectively offers a survey of Latin American History from the 15th-19th centuries, retaining both the broad strokes of history and the details that make it interesting. If you've never studied Latin America before this is a great course to take as an introduction (although I imagine it would be useful even if you have a background in Latin American history). Professor Schwartz is a great lecturer, who clearly has a passion for his subject. Take it!",
    "I would recommend this class. Professor Schwartz is a good lecturer and the class is not too much work. If you're at all interested in Latin America, this class is essential for understanding its history.",
    "HIST355 IS THE BEST HISTORY CLASS YOU CAN TAKE. It is a lot of work-- reading, papers, exams, but it is worth it! Professor Schwartz is an incredibly exciting lecturer-- you will NEVER fall asleep in this lecture. Enjoy it.",
    "This is a great course to learn more about Spain, Portugal somewhat, and Latin America (including Mexico, Peru, and Brazil). Professor Schwartz's lectures are both interesting and densely packed with material. You will emerge from this class with a thorough understanding of the colonial period and the New World. HOWEVER, be aware that the reading and paper-writing load is substantial.",
    "This is a pretty good class. The pros are that Schwartz is a very good lecturer who's great at taking big trends and describing them succinctly. The workload is pretty steep but doable. As long as you're somewhat into the material it's fine - but if you're just taking it to fill a non-Western history requirement you should think about how interested in the subject you actually are. I found my own interest flagging after a little while.",
    "Take it! It's great.",
    "this is a decent class with a good subject matter, but it could stand to be improved--the lectures lost their way at times and the reading list was overly ambitious. take it if the subject matter interests you; it will pull you along.",
    "Yes. If you don't mind doing a ton of reading, it is overall an excellent introduction into a topic about which most Yalies know very little.",
    "I would recommend this to anyone remotely interested in Latin America. It provides a good foundation for what the region is today and answers a lot of questions.",
    "Great class! Schwartz is really good. Only bad part for me was my TA, so I highly highly recommend shopping around TA's if you can.",
    "I would recommend it--an overview of Spanish and Portuguese involvement in Latin America from the 16th century until independence in the 19th. Some explorers you'll remember from elementary school history, but you also learn about a lot of new things and people (like Captain Morgan).",
    "I would recommend the class wholeheartedly, especially for history majors who want to fulfill the non-American, non-European requirement. It's definitely more interesting than the other \"rest of the world\" classes I've taken. You'll never realize how much you didn't know about this region until you take this class--it's a great survey of a fascinating region.",
    "Yes."
