   "comments": [
    "I think the material could be presented in a more interesting, dynamic and creative manner using examples more relevant to the majority of students who won't go into a career in risk assessment.The course is back-loaded, so most of the work falls within the last month of the term when students are super busy. The reliance on tests and a group project that is only assigned at the end of the term makes it impossible for students to pace the work throughout the semester.",
    "THERE IS NO SYLLABUS FOR THIS COURSE! WHAT IS THE GRADE BREAK DOWN? FROM WEEK TO WEEK, WHAT ARE THE THEMES?The layout of this course is VERY poorly structured--or at least, that structure is not made clear to the students.The debate and having a quiz to gauge understanding of the material just weeks before the semester ends is not sufficient.This needs to be taught more like a seminar course than a lecture--there is NO forum for student discussion in the class, essentially. This class, and the nature of the material, could benefit greatly from that. Changing the format of the slides to a question-answer format would help. It is clear that the same slides and materials have been used from year to year.It does not seem to make a difference to the Professor whether students are engaged with the material or not--the lectures are the same in structure from week to week despite minimal to no student engagement. Seeing as for many people this is a required course, students are not there of their own volition, per se, but may require some additional effort (in terms of how the information is presented) for engagement.Professor Borak is extremely eloquent. I thought we was great. This class, with him as the professor, has the potential to be much more than it is. For me, it was another disappointing YSPH experience.",
    "I think the course is useful, but I think providing students with a more applied approach to risk assessments would be more useful.I think a strength of the course is its ability to give you a solid sense of risk assessment language.The weakness would be the distribution of the course work. I didn't feel like we had any assignments during the first half of the course. Then towards the end we were bombarded with a ton of things. This can be very stressful to manage alongside other course projects, and final exams.",
    "Environmental Risk Assessment is an important skill for anyone who wants to go into environmental regulation or be involved in environmental health or work for the EPA. However, basically no one wants to do that, and no one really has the background in Toxicology or chemistry or even basic environmental policy that are needed to do well in this course and understand all of the intricacies.The material is important - but not taught. The material needs to be taught and explained, but instead you spend the time having to teach yourself the material without much instruction, and attempting to sort through 400+ powerpoint slides for arbitrary quizzes. These \"quizzes\" involved memorizing terms out of context, which is extremely difficult and generally worthless, yet it is time consuming and takes most of your grade. THe syllabus is also poorly laid out, if you could call it a syllabus at all - it's most just a schedule of class topics which we only occasionally abide by. Finally, both the final \"presentations\" and the final exam are within days of each other - so we have no time to actually learn anything, as we go straight from a 2nd quiz, to a final presentation, into a final, without absorbing any of the material.",
    "The course starts off light but gets heavy at the end. Hence the pace of the lecture could probably go faster at the beginning.Additional homeworks\/TA sessions would be good to consolidate what we learn during lecture.",
    "I did not like this course. The material was too advanced and I didn't understand the relevance to my division. The material is very dense and dry and I think it could be made a little more interesting by engaging the students more and really applying the concepts early on in the course to promote better understanding.The instructors are very enthusiastic about the material and really want to teach it to the students but application of the material would maybe make it a better experience.",
    "I understand that it is hard to teach this course in a logical manner but I feel that Borak does accomplish that. Looking over the slides, everything is logically ordered and makes sense. This course is far too end-heavy though. There is almost no work to do in the first few weeks. Then around mid-term there is a vocab quiz. 3\/4 of the way through the term there is another quiz. Then there is a debate and within a week of that, a final. The readings and materials for the debate should be given out much sooner than they were. We had 3 weeks to read through 150 pages of documents and put together a presentation when it was a very busy time of the semester. It also would have been good to have some practical experience in doing a risk assessment. It is great to have taken a course in risk assessment, but an employer would be much more interested if I had some sort of experience in performing one or elements of one.",
    "A typical Borak class. Tons of information, pure memorization, assessed not on the level of understanding of the material but how perfectly you can regurgitate EXACTLY how he's presented the answers, oh, and on pure luck of guessing what obscure questions will be on the quizzes.",
    "This course is very good and helpful in understanding those basic concepts of risk assesment.",
    "Dry reading material. Boring content.",
    "Risk assessment can be a really pragmatic course, but it was not. The class was too didactic and while it was understandable we needed to know vocabulary, it was not until the debate that we actually applied them. Borak could have gone over more models in detail.",
    "Shouldn't be a requirement for MPH - too specific",
    "This is the worst and most irrelevant course that I have ever taken. I was excited for this course but now I realize that when I graduate I will be hesitant to say that I know how to perform a risk assessment.The concepts were outdated and most information was in the realm of toxicology, having taken tox last year this course should be called toxicology 2 because 80 percent of the slides are identical.Having to do a debate was a stressful joke, not a single person in my group or other groups that I talked to felt that they had learned risk assessment by having to regurgitate a old, lengthy documents.The final asked us to use concepts and vocabulary in context as if this was something we learned to do beforehand, when in reality we were given hundreds of slides not knowing how concepts worked together or how to apply them.All the reading were also irrelevant, every single paper (about 4) was at least 20 years old and we never really talked about them, it was a complete waste of time.Please find a real risk assessor to teach this course!",
    "I am an EHS student and I did not really learn how to do a risk assessment after this class....I am hoping next year's class structure\/or new professor will be better.",
    "Strengths: Case studies on benzyne, asbestos and MTBE were the only truly useful class sessions in which I began to understand the point of risk assessment.Weaknesses: Unclear expectations, little incentive to complete readings\/participate in class discussions, no devoted\/clearly indicated office hours, material was detailed and did not provide a useful overview of environmental risk assessment as was presented in a haphazard and disorganized, extremely detailed manner not suitable to those without a prior degree in hard science (e.g. chemistry, biology) or medicine. Much emphasis on memorization of terms not conducive to actually learning concepts. Course presumed a foundation in toxicology, which was unrealistic for most students taking the class to fulfill the EHS requirement. Course bar was set low initially when student asked a question on the first day of class and professor stated there was not enough time in this type of course to respond to the question. This discouraged future participation, and led professor to presume and state on more than one occasion that students came to class unprepared.",
    "The course was relatively useless in a large class setting. Would have benefited from small group discussions w\/ one on one interaction, conversation with the professor. Was much more engaging during debate session. As it is currently structured, would not recommend this course for any one only taking it as a requirement without an interest in risk assessment.",
    "The course is ultimately quite interesting. I wish there was more time to bring the concepts together at the end. I really started to understand the material better after having worked on a risk assessment for a debate project. I would suggest covering the vocab in the first 45 days of the course via \"matching\" and \"fill in the blank\" quizzes, then moving on to actually working on risk assessments.",
    "This course was good about presenting risk assessment; my knowledge about this area is much better than it was before. That said, I think it was a lot of lecture time for a relatively cursory introduction to it, but I understand that it takes longer for many people to grasp the material.",
    "This is a very challenging course because of the material. I think if the class remains as big as it was this past semester then the class would benefit from discussion groups so that the material really sinks in.",
    "This course has potential to be very good and the material is interesting but it isnNot presented well and this the class is a struggle and painful to sit through.",
    "this topic could be presented in a much more interesting fashion. disappointed in the teaching style--too much lecture. vocabulary quizzes also seemed very elementary.",
    "I hope the course works can be distributed more evenly throughout the semester. I feel there's not much to do in the first half sem, then everything crapped in during the end of second half sem.",
    "strengthsyou come out of the course with an outlook on science and debatequizzing on vocab, albeit painful, was a useful way to get the terminology to stick.weaknessesfocuses too narrowly on obscure topics of risk assessment.doing so forces some students to work doubly as hard as strengths whose strengths are toxicology-- they have to learn the principles of risk assessment and tox at all once.Suggestioneven though this is not the point of the course, it would be nice to have a guide or something in the end about how to actually conduct a risk assessment-- it's always easier to tear things apart than to construct; thus I would have liked to see\/consider each step OEHHA\/EPA they put into building their argument.",
    "Less coursework, better notes, better explanation of concepts.",
    "very week. D+ at best",
    "material is useful, though slightly outdated",
    "I think the course itself is interesting but it could be taught better by (1) organizing and teaching the information better by developing a logical scheme for students to follow (2) reviewing how the quizzes are developed as there is no need to force students to cram that much information only for it to be forgotten the next day, the emphasis should be on understanding. I personally enjoyed the final exam much more than the quizzes because it forced me to apply the material from the classroom.",
    "excellent.",
    "Good introductory course. Somewhat unevenly paced. Some material is redundant for many and most complicated issues not highlighted enough."

    "Instructor: Jonathan Borak \u00a0I know that Dr. Borak must feel frustrated that students take this course because they need to fill a requirement, but even when students attempt to engage the material, he responds at times with sarcasm and mild hostility. When I tried to ask questions, he admonished me for not paying attention to previous lectures, despite the fact that we had just completed a test on the material covered in those classes. While he later corrected his remarks, it made me feel unwilling to put myself out and contribute in the future.",
    "Instructor: Jonathan Borak \u00a0Dr. Borak and Cheryl were both good lecturers. It was unclear though throughout the course, how we were actually graded. There was no breakdown of how grades were calculated.",
    "Instructor: Jonathan Borak \u00a0The \"professor\" is arrogant and comes with quite a bias at no point does he actually admit. Through a little google searching you can see he has testified against every environmental regulation ever attempted to go into place to protect public health - against the public health side. Those of us who have done research in DC and other places across the nation have spoken to others who know of and despise him. Some have suggested the low rating of YSPH is due to Borak's presence and how often he has gone up against well known public health professionals associated with other universities and institutions. He spends a great deal of the class not actually teaching - but insulting epidemiologists, statisticians, environmentalists, government, and basically everyone who isn't a toxicologist. He also is a storyteller - he spends so much of class time talking about completely worthless information, barely or not even related to risk assessment - which is why it's so difficult for students to sort through the information presented and find out what they should actually study for (also, since we don't have much of a syllabus, it's impossible to really know what our real learning objectives are). In addition to his arrogance, he is quite insulting both to individuals and the class, he is completely inappropriate towards young women, putting his hands on their backs, making comments about how they need to smile, and generally making women feel uncomfortable. On several occasions he has made what I can only say is a racist joke. For instance, in one class while discussing the MTBE risk assessment debate andthe organization in California writing up the public health goal, he pronounced their acronym, said it sounded like \"a bad sushi name\", put his hands together, and made a little bow. It was. Extremely. Offensive. I have never in my life seen a Yale professor, or any professor behave in such a manor, especially in front of an entire class. The following week he also made a joke in poor taste about lingerie, which made many people obviously uncomfortable.",

Despite long ramblings on about some topics,he present the concepts for risk assessment in a logical order and provides great examples. It is obvious that he has experience in this field often shares his knowledge through sharing specific examples of risk assessments that he was a part of. His slides are logical and make sense, they really help to bring the course together when they are reviewed.",

    "Instructor: Jonathan Borak \u00a0Very smart and obviously knows that subject matter very well.",
    "Instructor: Jonathan Borak \u00a0This is not Dr. Borak's expertise, he is not fit to teach this course. Aside from his failure to teach this material well there were other issues that made attending class a true chore. He was condescending and at times and there was a general apprehension to participate in the class due to fear of being ridiculed.Dr. Borak should not teach this course and stick to toxicology.",
    "Instructor: Jonathan Borak \u00a0Fostered a hostile classroom environment with sudden mood changes and shifts in expectations that were difficult to follow. Swore in class on more than one occasion and told students after asking for more clarification on what to study for the quiz that he didn't tell them to sign up for the class, they should have realized what they were getting into. Also, stood over and stared at me for nearly 5 minutes while completing an exam, which I turned in with incomplete answers after feeling unconfortable about the sitation. Such power\/intimidation tactics are not conducive to learning and should not be tolerated in any class (let alone university) setting. This made me reluctant to approach professor for extra help, exacerbated by the fact that his company office was the setting prescribed for seeking extra help.",

    "Instructor: Jonathan Borak \u00a0Strengths: Involved, An expert in his subject clearly.Weaknesses: A very strict examiner. I put this as a weakness because I feel exams should not be meant to have 10\/10 difficult questions. There should be a good mix of questions for all kinds of students, especially when the course is a mandatory course which means not everyone taking the class is avidly interested in it. Some people are there just because its mandatory.",

I wondered sometimes if it was because we were so many and that people were not keen enough on the class because it was a requirement therefore he felt compelled to be harder. The class atmosphere seemed to create more resentment from students and therefore wasn't particularly useful.However, I met him and Cheryl several times at the office and I found them both extremely helpful.

It was waste of time and I'm left wondering how to perform a real risk assessment.",
    "Risk assessment may be useful, but this class was not.",
    "No, I would not recommend this course. Instead of providing an informative overview of environmental health risk assessment and decision making, the course focused on memorizing technical details of this field that will not be used by most students enrolled, before students had the chance to understand the point of the field of study in the first place. Providing readings that are pared down and incorporate relevant examples and application of the material to real-world situations is recommended. Expecting students to memorize detailed terms, models and mechanisms without providing examples that resonate is unrealistic and not conducive to actual learning or understanding of the material.
