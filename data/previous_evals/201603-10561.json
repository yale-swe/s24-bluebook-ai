   "comments": [
    "This course will drastically improve your Chinese language skills but you will have to put in a lot of work to make the most out of it.",
    "Strength is the daily lessons and sheer amount of daily tests and homework, so that even if a couple of quizzes get bad scores, the average is good by the law of large numbers. Something that is less strong is that success on the class is very dependent on the participation of other classmates. If others do not do the work or do the work, not as much can be gotten from the class. Fortunately, I had a great class, but sometimes the discussion was slow and not as helpful.",
    "Great instructors.",
    "I think this course benefits from the rigorous workload. The homework assignments are easily accessible, and there is plenty of feedback to ensure that students know what they can improve on. I think it would be really great if during the tutorial sessions, we also went over our most recent essays and discussed why each correction was necessary for the final draft. I feel like that would provide a lot more learning opportunities.",
    "One of the strengths of the course is that it is very organized. Each nights work was about the same length of time, and it was easy to know exactly when assignments were due and what was coming up next. I thought evaluations through dictations, written tests, and oral tests were fair and covered different skill sets. Furthermore, the class was very well-taught by engaging professors. It was also really beneficial to have a small class size. I don't see too much room for improvement.",
    "The teachers manage to engage the students very well and ensure that whatever we have studied or memorized for homework actually sticks with us.",
    "Your Chinese will definitely improve. Both teachers are great and you are forced to do a lot of practice every day through homework and class. The only weakness of the class is how monotonous it feels by the end. Sometimes, the schedule can be a little demanding in that in one week you could have 3 assessments, but other than that I enjoyed this class."

    "I would highly recommend this course for anyone who is committed to improving their Chinese language ability.",
    "Yes, my Chinese has improved tremendously.",
    "Yes, because it was a very relevant class and was very well organized.",
    "Absolutely. The language itself is wonderfully different from many others. The teachers are kind yet demanding enough to push your limits. The course is very well organized, so students can focus on learning instead of finding tomorrow's homework.",
    "I would recommend this course to others. It is organized, challenging, but also manageable. I enjoy going to class every day, especially because of the small class size and fun professors.",
    "Chinese 130 is great. I improved a ton, and it doesn't really feel like as much work as you would expect. the Teachers are great at interacting with you in an enjoyable way that makes sure the stuff you learn really sticks with you, which is great. Excited for next semester!",
    "I would recommend this course to any other student genuinely interested in learning Chinese.",
    "For anyone serious about learning Chinese, I would encourage them to carry on with this class.",
    "This is a demanding class with a heavy workload, but my Chinese has definitely seen huge improvements."
