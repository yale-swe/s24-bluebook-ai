   "comments": [
    "I definitely would recommend the course to another student. It is one of the few literature courses I've ever taken interested in literary contributions to the sociology of literature. How and why do certain modes of reading become popular or not? In what institutional contexts do we see reading publics form? As fiction changesin book form and the way stories are told, it only seems appropriate that as literary scholars we keep up with those changes and think reflexively about how we read and how we circulate those readings in the academy.",
    "I would characterize this course as an overview of recent fiction that is not (yet?) \"in the canon\" as well as of important recent secondary material. I would certainly recommend this course in general as a good window onto what is happening now in in both the literary and scholarly worlds (and where they overlap, too). The only hesitation I have would be in recommending it full-throatedly to someone who studies something well outside the area of focus. An obvious strength of the seminar setting is everyone contributing to a conversation from different perspectives, and conversations can, of course, develop in interesting and unexpected ways. There were just a couple of times, though, where conversation naturally veered far from what we had read for class and into what everyone else had also read outside of class. This is not a bad thing, of course, but it relies upon a shared set of knowledge that everyone might not have and makes contributing to the conversation from outside that set a bit more difficult.",
    "A sort of methods class where the most interesting primary texts were often critical essays rather than novels or poetry. Not really a survey of the field per se, but rather a chance to engage closely with a small number of hugely important critical works--Latour, Warner, Guillory--and some of the major issues in literary study. The Best and Marcus \"surface reading\" week was especially cool. Yes, I would recommend the class to others. Definitely an awesome opportunity to get a sense of some of the biggest questions in literary study and to engage these questions alongside our peers"

    "This course introduced me to some important recent scholarship that I may not have come across organically in my own research. While the course is outside my field of study, I was exposed to some valuable ideas and critical tools that I hope to incorporate into my future scholarship in productive ways.",
    "As I said before, definitely helped to provide an overview of some of the major questions in literary study today. I think this sense of \"the field\" is hugely important to grad students, especially those in the first couple years of study, who are trying to figure out what kind of scholars they themselves want to be. Having a sense of where the field has been and where it's going is crucial. The Guillory and Latour books were both revelatory for me"
