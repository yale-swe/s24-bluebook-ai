    "I'd definitely recommend THST 341 to another student! This course is really incredible and unlike any other course I've taken at Yale. It encourages you to explore and engage with the other students in the class in really fun ways. The exploring can sometimes be challenging but always is rewarding and such a blast. Throughout the semester, we learned a lot (through reading and mostly through practical work) about comedy, about laughing and making others laugh, about performance, and about bringing what we learned in this class into our interactions out in the world. Also, Daniel is the BEST. This is a course I miss already!",
    "It feels a lot like going back to preschool -- you play games and do make believe most of the time. Then you look back and realize that you must have gotten so much more courageous and creative to be able to do the things you did in class.",
    "You literally get to play like kids for 4 hours a week. It's the best class ever. Daniel is amazing.",
    "Absolutely. Everyone who wants to do theater after college should take this course.",
    "This class is unlike any other you'll take at Yale. Now I've never taken a theatre studies class before, but this class is fun and interesting and often ridiculous. Larlham is the man, but don't expect to know what you're going to get in the class. I'm writing this right now and I'm not sure whether I'm going to get an A or a C. Overall, it's a good class and you really do enjoy going to class every day.",
    "Yes",
    "If you are lucky enough to get in you'd better take it. It's like recess. Best class at Yale if you like to have a good time and act a fool",
    "This course is unbelievably fun, but it also helps deconstruct the little barriers we make for ourselves at Yale in terms of seriousness. The focus on play and the collaborative atmosphere mean that failure is even encouraged as a means to understand the subject material in a more in depth way. Larlham is also a wonderful guy. He takes an interest in each of his students and supports everyone in how they approach the somewhat atypical nature of the course. Take it if you get into it.",
    "I'd absolutely recommend this class to a student interested in letting down their guard and playing like they're in preschool again. There are interesting scholarly readings and discussions balanced by performance work that really helped me in terms of building characters, improvising, and collaborating. It was always unpredictable and exciting; I looked forward to it every class day. You never know what's going to happen in this class, and I think my class really became a community and grew a lot as performers together, which was really exciting."
