   "comments": [
    "yes.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to any student wanting to seriously engage with \"looking\" at works of art and familiarize him\/herself with such the visual idiom of Cubism. This course is indeed looking-intensive, and highly rewarding for the art history student who wants to pare down the visual experience to its most fundamental.",
    "HSAR 715 was a seminar based on visual analysis, not on theory or contextual evidence, although such sources were addressed as a secondary element of the course. While this is a very focused class, it will cultivate skills and practices that students can apply to looking at and engaging with other kinds of artworks and objects.",
    "The course was very much as advertised: it was a focused look at cubism, using Picasso and Braque, that centered in formal analysis while also digesting a range of recent scholarship. Yes, I wouls commend it to someone.",
    "I would summarize History of Art 715 for a fellow student as rethinking Cubism. I would absolutely recommend the course to another student. Sebastian is a great teacher and his ideas about Cubism are truly fascinating and revolutionary.",
    "A course on Cubism, but also on close-looking. Highly recommended for students regardless of specialization.",
    "The course was dedicated primarily to visual analysis of Cubist artwork rather than a discussion of its historiography. I would recommend the course to any student of modern art wishing to improve his\/her close reading abilities.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student. I would let him\/her know that the class is front-loaded with reading and that the student should come prepared to give an assessment of his\/her thoughts on the weekly readings. The class is not for a shy person. A student needs to participate in class and be prepared to give a presentation at the end of the course."
