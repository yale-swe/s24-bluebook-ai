   "comments": [
    "You will learn a lot independently. Make sure you know a good amount of international finance. The class format is not desirable but the content is interesting. Lots of work.",
    "It is a great course worth taking if you are interested in Latin America, economic history, and the study of financial crises.",
    "Good course if you are interested in the history of LatAm economics (more history than current state)",
    "Highly recommend to anyone who has an interest in laying America. It's a lot of work but it's worth every hour.",
    "Take this class if you're at all curious about the economic development of Latin America. You understand populism, colonialism, and other common themes. Professor Zedillo is a delight in class. The work can be a tad intense, as he does expect you to have done every single reading and have a weekly reading response. But this class is worth it.",
    "ECON 467 with Professor Zedillo was a truly valuable experience, being able to learn about his area of expertise from him, as well as being able to hear about his own experiences dealing with some of the economic and political topics we covered in class. Professor Zedillo is very dedicated to the seminar, and I always looked forward to each class. The structure of the course was also very organized and helped me gain a better in-depth understanding about the economic evolution of Latin American economies and also in relation to their present-day conditions."
