    "I highly recommend this class. it will aid in the development of understanding what it means to create relatable characters. The challenges of the class offer a rare luxury to struggle through developmental difficulties giving the student the opportunity to see real progress rather than to simply observe problems in passing. The assignment to create a scene every week and to film it allows one to hang in there with their challenges, experiment with improvements and learn a little about what might work or what might not work well.",
    "Great course! Professor Roemer is really experienced in filmmaking and often has some deep insight into how to make a scene. However, if you're only interested in the technical side of filmmaking, this might not be the course for you.",
    "Definitely recommend if you want to develop your writing and directing (as suggested by the title of the course). But if you want more specific instruction on your writing, maybe try a straight screenwriting class. If you want more specific instruction on technical aspects, look elsewhere, because you definitely don't get that with this class. You don't get much in the way of tangible skills, but you definitely *feel* your writing, confidence, creativity, etc expanding and improving."
