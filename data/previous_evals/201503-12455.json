   "comments": [
    "Professor Rosenbaum is a gem. He may come across hard-hearted at first, but when you get to know him, he is a real softy. He cares so much about each and every one of his students. Don't be intimidated. You will spend a lot of time doing the reading and the presentations, but you will learn a lot, and you will get to hear some really hilarious stories. Definitely take it if you can get in! It is fairly competitive, so don't count on securing a spot.",
    "Excellent class. Professor Rosenbaum is a leader in the field and will teach you a lot. If he teaches this again, I highly recommend taking it. He is intimidating at first - very intimidating. And you will have to do all of the readings. But, over the course of the semester, our class become much warmer and comfortable and seminars were very enjoyable. The best option for a MCDB senior seminar I can think of.",
    "If you are actually hoping to learn how to read primary literature this isn't the best class to take. If you are looking for a relatively low work class where you'll hear the professor talk for a majority of the class, take this class. Also, expect the class to go over time by half an hour each session.",
    "You read 1-2 papers per week and discuss the papers over two hours once a week. However, the course helps connect the different courses taken previously, and the stories behind the research are incredibly fascinating. Rosenbaum does go on tangents talking about these stories, and that was the most interesting part of class. Its almost comical how much that is known of science is due to small, and possibly accidental, changes in protocol. I would def take the course if you get in!",
    "We read 1 or 2 cell biology articles a week and one or two people present them and we discuss in class. I highly recommend it!",
    "I say that this class is very fantastic and really should be taken by seniors in MCDB. If I had to summarize it in three words, I'd say: Great Unfettered Terrific Definitely worth taking",
    "I enjoyed this class a lot! The focus is on scientific research and the development of ideas, which is rare for the more intro-level and intermediate MCDB classes. This class feels like a culmination of that, and is really worth it for people interested in science.",
    "A course where you learn a lot through discussion, but not too work intensive outside of class except for a paper you have to read throughly once a week for discussion. Really great class, and not too difficult!",
    "MCDB 435 is a great course to take for anyone who is interested in the many pivotal discoveries in the history of cell biology as well as in training and improving paper-reading abilities. The course is fairly informally structured, with two students serving as the leaders of each week's paper while other students must read for firm understanding of the paper in order to participate in fruitful discussion, led by both the leaders and Professor Rosenbaum. The course only meets once a week and as such, it is imperative to try to be able to attend each course. Participation is everything and there are no other assessments in this course. That said, after the first few week's of having pressure not knowing what to talk to about, most students generally have a feel for how to prepare for the class each week and the class does become very fun. I learned a lot and would recommend this class to aspiring scientists who want more background about the facts they learn in other classes.",
    "Fine if you're interested in historical cell bio papers and older methods. If you're more interested in current work this might not be right for you. Pretty relaxed, although there may be classes you would get more out of."
