    "Useful survey of development literature. In its current form, audit it.",
    "You end up reading (maybe) a lot of cutting-edge articles in economics and development. This class is a great review of the literature (though definitely from a Yale Econ Department perspective; at least a quarter of the articles you read will be by one of your professors).Then again, it's not the most amazing class ever, and some days you just kind of sit there and wish for it to be over. Since I'm in Poli Sci, it didn't end up counting towards anything in my department requirements, I just had to take it because I took the first half of the class and the final exam covers both semesters. So unless somebody LOOOOOOVES development, I wouldn't recommend it to a poli sci student. And if you like development that much, you could probably just do the readings on your own time, go in and talk to Karlan and Rosenzweig about it for a bit, and come out better than if you'd taken the course.",
    "A tour through the major topics in development economics. Recommended to audit -- no value-added in taking the course for credit."
