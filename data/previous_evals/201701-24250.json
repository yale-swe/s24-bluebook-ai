    "Strong introduction to various aspects of the Arabic language and culture.",
    "My Arabic speaking and writing skills improved a lot. I learned a lot about Arabic culture as well.",
    "I expanded my arabic vocabulary and began to grasp more complex concepts in Grammar.",
    "Improvement in my speaking, reading, and writing Arabic skills. Vocabulary and grammar.",
    "In Arabic II, students strengthen the skills they began learning in the fall semester. We focus on vocabulary building, grammar, pronunciation, and culture.",
    "I gained a good foundation of Arabic grammar and syntax that I feel prepared me for my intermediate program over the summer.",
    "In this course, I gained a greater facility with spoken Arabic and also improved my listening comprehension in both formal Arabic and the Levantine dialect. I also improved my writing, learning how to construct richer and more complex sentences and becoming more comfortable with the Arabic script through dictation exercises.",
    "I learned intermediate Arabic skills in terms of writing, reading, and speaking. My knowledge of the language has improved with more grammar lessons and vocabulary.",
    "I learned memorization skills, how to push through being in an uncomfortable situation, and lots of Arabic of course :)"

   "comments": [
    "Very insightful and helpful grading. Homework seemed like a lot at times, but that's what's expected from a language course!",
    "I think shaami could be incorporated more into monday-thursday classes.",
    "I think the course moves fast. We finish a test and we've already started learning vocabulary for the next test (coming in a week to a week and half). I end up falling behind for most of the time we go over a chapter and then catching up towards the end when the test comes around, and then the cycle repeats.",
    "The course is very well structured. At times, the workload can be a lot to handle. However, Professor Aziz is very understanding. As long as you communicate with him regularly, everything will work out fine.",
    "I believe that this course developed my Arabic speaking skills quite rapidly. I wish that our grammar lessons could have been more structured, and that we learned more relevant or useful vocabulary. (I know this is a fault of the textbook rather than the course itself, so perhaps add another section to learn more practical dialogues?)",
    "This course could be improved if there was a higher focus on grammar because it differs so much from English grammar. This course offers a good variety of speaking, listening, reading, and grammatical skills. I would also assign more reading passages because it will help with overall Arabic skills. I think speaking with a TA in dialect once a week was very helpful in learning to speak in Arabic.",
    "I love the course and Professor Aziz does a great job, but I wish it was structured a little differently. The vocabulary we learn sometimes feels very random, as does the grammar. I also wish we spent slightly more time working on speaking Arabic, because that is my weakness."

    "Great professor and great class. Don't miss it if you love Arabic, languages, or would like to go into international relations with a focus on the Middle East.",
    "Take it with prof. aziz. He is a great prof who is really understanding and wants you to do well. The class is sometimes disorganized but aziz makes up for it by being funny.",
    "I would only recommend Arabic to students that seriously consider using the language in future careers. The dialects are very difficult, and the class requires a significant degree of work.",
    "If you are dedicated to learning the language, take it.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student interested in learning Arabic. It doesn't require any previous knowledge of the language (other than what is learned in L1) and is a fairly adjudicated class with a very reasonable workload.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who is willing to put in the work to learn a new language. Arabic is a very challenging but rewarding language. I would recommend this course to anyone interested in learning Arabic.",
    "Absolutely I would!"
