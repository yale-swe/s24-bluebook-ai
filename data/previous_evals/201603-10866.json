   "comments": [
    "I truly saw my french abilities skyrocket during this course, especially with grammar and audio comprehension.",
    "My French improved incredibly! The grammar got harder but the vocabulary was really good, especially because it's things you'd use in real conversations. I feel a lot more confident not only in my speaking skills, but also that we read French literature. The literature made me feel really accomplished and I loved that we read and analyzed important pieces of the French canon.",
    "I made some great progress on the cementation of my basic foundations of French grammar and conversation.",
    "I love that I was able to read French litterature and watch French movies with friends. I felt as though my grammar improved significantly as well as my auditive abilities.",
    "Knowledge\/skills: Learning French grammatical structures, vocabulary, and idioms as well as exploring some French literature and films, in large part for the purpose of comprehension before beginning more complex discussions near the end of the course Insights: It's difficult to grasp the breadth of the works of any foreign language or culture without experience - this class really helped me to gain appreciation of the richness and complexity of French culture, and love for the language itself",
    "This course provided me a great framework to develop my French skills.",
    "became better french student",
    "I advanced my ability to read, write, listen to, and speak French.",
    "I improved on many specific french grammar points and also learned different ways to study a language before the tests",
    "Being really comfortable with speaking",
    "I felt this course gave me a firm understanding of the grammar of French while expanding into more of the intricacies of the language. Outside of just learning French it is a great literature course as well. One truly starts delving deep into great works of literature in the language they were meant to be understood in. One also understands French not as much rule based but gains more of a natural intuition for the language as well."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The strengths are the number of resources available (so many!) to ensure student's success. The weakness is the difficulty of managing the workload (a lot) with other classes.",
    "There is a LOT of homework. None of it goes to waste, though: The reason French is so amazing is that as you're learning, you're studying for the tests. Studying obviously helps, but the active learning that is so integral to the course is what really puts the language in your head. I do wish we got to practice speaking a little bit more, but the writing and listening aspects are great.",
    "The audio programs are highly engaging. I think the class could force more dialogue from the students, similar to that of L1 and L2.",
    "It requires a lot of work, but at the same time this ensures a vast knowledge coming out of the course.",
    "Great course! Take it with Koizim if you can.",
    "I would suggest some way of diversifying the homework assignments, if possible, as it's the same type of thing for the whole semester and does become tedious after a while. The course itself, however, is very effective in teaching the material if the student is engaged and wishes to improve.",
    "The course is hard, but it should be as that is he only way one can learn a language. I cannot find a weakness in this course.",
    "too much work, but good teaching structure",
    "This course does a very good job helping with understanding written and spoken French. However, I wish there was more emphasis on practicing spoken French.",
    "I think the audio recordings for both the texts we read and the workbook were very helpful, although sometimes they went unnecessarily long and slowly.",
    "Frequent tests which might be difficult if you're taking a number of classes",
    "The workload of the course is necessary for understanding the language but can become very tiresome facing it everyday. Also, this varies by section, but not knowing when one will have a quiz can become stressful especially when trying to balance other courses and what to focus on when managing ones time."

   "comments": [
    "If you want to learn French, this is the place to go, whether you moved up from L2 or got placed into the course. It's totally worth all the time.",
    "It is certainly a difficult class, but I would definitely recommend it. Id you do all the work the skills you gain are highly gratifying.",
    "I would recommend it to anyone who would seriously like to learn French.",
    "Definitely take it!",
    "If one is ready to put in the work, this course will definitely help with one's development in French.",
    "if you want to learn french and don't care too much about the grade yeah",
    "Yes I would. It was an interesting course, and I learned a lot and was able to progress very far in my studies of French.",
    "I found this course much more engaging and enjoyable than french classes in high school so I would recommend it",
    "Yes take it with Ruth Koizim if possible She's gold",
    "French L3 with Madame Koizim is amazing! She makes learning anything very fun and cares very much about each of her students. I really enjoyed the selection of French novels and films.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student if they had time for the workload, since one learns not only French but analyzes literature as well."
