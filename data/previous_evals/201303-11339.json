   "comments": [
    "This course teaches you a bit about woodworking, joinery, and (mostly) trends in American furniture over time. You start noticing different things about furniture in everyday life and you'll be able to describe furniture with technical words effortlessly. Also, it's possible to skip most of the readings and just learn about your weekly object, for you can learn about what the rest of the reading said from others' presentations.",
    "I would recommend it. It is a great class. Weekly low-stress presentation on a different piece of furniture each week. Three small (750 word) essays and a final paper (7-9 pages).",
    "This class offers a very interesting analysis of furniture and material culture. Professor Cooke is an amazing teacher and you will surely get much out of his insight and the class discussions.",
    "One of the most amazing classes at Yale that drags out a bit in the first couple of weeks if you are not too interested in woodworking techniques, but it is an absolute joy when you get to studying objects and holding weekly 5-minute presentations on them. Classes are held in the furniture study which is an invaluable experience. I recommend it if you are interested (but actually interested) in design and history of furniture. Don't take it just as an easy course if you don't care about art\/furniture, because you will ruin it for others who care to learn if you don't put enough into researching your objects and presenting them properly.",
    "AWESOME CLASSSSS! I did not have any background in art AT ALL before coming to Yale, but this was definitely one of the best classes I have taken. A wonderful insight into furniture and it really changes the way you see things from now on. Take it if you are looking for a different experience!",
    "This class was fantastic! It's a lot of fun, you learn a lot, the way you see a room changes, and it's not much work at all. A great course, a great professor, and a must-take.",
    "Do it.",
    "Professor Cooke forces you to examine the history of these objects in more ways than I thought possible, which is a great skill to acquire for any history course. Not sure how this counts as a writing credit because while you do write three short papers and one long final one, there is no editing process or peer review, just Professor Cooke's comments. Gives freshmen access to a great professor and a great Yale resource (the Furniture Study has great people and great pieces). Also, being able to touch centuries-old iconic pieces is so worth any amount of reading (not that all of the reading is necessary to get a lot out of the class).",
    "We go into the overflow of our Art Gallery and have the opportunity to touch and connect with the furniture. The course load is enjoyable and easy to connect with. It is my favorite class, I would recommend it.",
    "This is an amazing class! It can be a bit overwhelming at first since the subject matter is usually unfamiliar to most people. Over time you become ore familiar with the terminology and it becomes more fun. Great for people who are visual\/hands on learners. Completely changes the way you see furniture."
