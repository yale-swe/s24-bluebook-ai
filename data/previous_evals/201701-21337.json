   "comments": [
    "Learned a HUGE amount of Korean vocab, grammar, and culture. Professor Lee is honestly probably the best person to teach Korean.",
    "I developed better communication skills as well as writing and reading skills in Korean. I also learned a lot about the Korean culture in ways that can't be portrayed on the news or media but has to be taught in the classroom.",
    "I'm not a heritage speaker (I know this is a heritage class but...whatcha gonna do) so I think this class really challenged my listening and speaking skills more than other language classes I've taken at Yale. On the most basic level, I've learned to be more open about speaking, and possibly failing, in class. I just realized it doesn't matter that much.",
    "By taking this course, I was not only able to significantly expand my Korean vocabulary, but also thoroughly practice my real-life communicating skills as well.",
    "I gained Korean language skills both in terms of grammatical structure as well as vocabulary. Speaking proficiency and writing proficiency drastically improved as a result of taking this class.",
    "I learned new rules of Korean grammar.",
    "I think my Korean language skills developed in general, particular in the amount and complexity of vocabulary we learned in class.",
    "I learned Korean culture and language in a very warm and culturing environment.",
    "Improved my Korean speaking, reading and writing abilities, primarily through plenty of practice and guided supervision."

   "comments": [
    "Very intimate setting that allows for maximum learning",
    "There were NO weaknesses. I can only think of strengths.",
    "Class format was very interactive and fostered a lot of discussion and practice of the Korean language (both oral and written) in an environment that wasn't forced or unnatural.",
    "The strengths are the constant engagement brought upon everyone by Prof Lee-Smith. She truly goes to great measures to ensure that the material is being thoroughly understood.",
    "The course was really engaging but sometimes I think we spent a lot of time on pieces that were super difficult to understand. At the end of the day I just got a handful of vocabulary words from it but I don't think I understood the complicated sentence structure any better. Maybe heritage students would but for me maybe a more in depth breakdown of the structures happening in the TOPIK pieces we got would be helpful.",
    "A strength of this course is the constant encouragement to participate in the discussions held in class.",
    "There are only strengths to this class. The lessons were structured in a way that lead to the cumulative growth of the student by the end of the semester. The lessons were very enjoyable, and class participation was (obviously) very important.",
    "More opportunities to review past vocab would be helpful. That way I can remember more words. I would also appreciate more grammar lessons.",
    "I think one of the best aspects about this class was that Prof Lee is extremely compassionate and tries her best to make sure everyone in the class is comfortable. This way, people are comfortable with speaking their minds on sensitive issues. However, in terms of improvement, I think it would great if there was more of an emphasis on Korean grammar and reinforcement of past vocabulary. I thought we went through a lot of words, but I don't know how well I can recall them now. However, all in all, I really enjoyed being the in class and can say, it was definitely one that I looked forward to going.",
    "Strengths: It is a really well designed course that is both enjoyable and rigorous; your Korean will definitely improve. Weaknesses: Not really any. This is a fantastic course."

   "comments": [
    "Highly, highly recommend. I learned so much, and my Korean improved a lot over these four months. It was a joy to have Korean class every day; it became something I looked forward to waking up every morning thanks to the amazing class dynamic facilitated by Professor Lee. Not only is she extremely knowledgeable but also extremely dedicated to making sure her students get the most out of her class. She always goes above and beyond. Every Friday after class we would have a weekly Korean language table where we would cook Korean food together as a class and practice Korean all throughout. Overall, taking this class has been one of the best experiences I've had at Yale thanks to Professor Lee's genuine love for teaching and for her students.",
    "HUNDRED PERCENT recommend this course! If you are a heritage speaker and are even considering taking Korean, don't consider anymore, just take it (this class or L152, the styles for both are similar). You will learn a lot while still having fun and becoming almost like family with your class (Professor Lee is such a mom it's great).",
    "Yes, the heritage track is an especially useful one for those who struggle to read and write as well as are lacking in culture. This class did a great job to fill in those areas appropriately.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. It was my 5th course this semester and it never felt particularly burdensome. Professor Lee Smith is seriously an angel and will make your mornings super bright. It's worth getting up in the morning for.",
    "The Korean class taught by Professor Lee is amazing. She is a very patient teacher that is willing to help each individual student so that no one is left behind.",
    "I would recommend this course to any Yale student on this campus. That is how great it was.",
    "Yes! I loved the instructor!",
    "Yes I would recommend this course. The professor is amazing and made me really enjoy a course I was originally not that thrilled about taking. If you put in the time to study the vocabulary, it's also not that difficult to keep up with.",
    "YES ABSOLUTELY - TAKE IT.",
    "YES. This is a fantastic language course. Prof. Lee cares about your personal Korean improvement and does much to cater to your individual aspirations\/needs\/weaknesses as a student in order to challenge you to improve. There is nothing negative that I can say about this course. Also, enjoy the Friday lunch language tables; you can practice speaking Korean and also cook Korean food. It is a great weekly opportunity for the cultural immersion that is a bit lacking, being in the United States."
