    "I learned so much in this class not only about cell biology lab techniques, but about life as well and the career of research in biology. I've gained insight into my career path and feel more confident about my course at Yale and in life. I also learned how to present scientific data clearly, which could help with obtaining a job in the future.",
    "If you are a freshman, sophomore, or junior reading this (and you are considering taking MCDB cell bio and eventually this labs class), THEN TAKE BOTH CELL BIO AND THIS LABS CLASS. You will want to sign up for both MCDB 344L (1st half of spring term) and MCDB 345L (2nd half of spring term). This was my favorite MCDB class ever. Joseph Wolenski might seem curt in his emails, but please trust me when I say that Professor Wolenski is not only one of THE nicest guys at Yale, but also one of the best teachers as well. Here is a breakdown of the class: 1. There is NO homework or lab report write -ups! For MCDB 344L, you will have to give a 15 min. presentation on a recent published paper. The goal of this is to help you with your presentation skills and help build confidence. You will also have a mini quiz at the end of MCDB 344L about the experiments that you did. In MCDB 345L, we do more experiments. The only thing you will be graded on here is a 5 min. mini-presentation in which you have to explain an assigned topic (ex. super resolution microscopy, GLUT4-insulin binding, etc.). It's very chill. *Note: the experiments are usually new and relevant -- Wolenski doesn't really recycle experiments from past years (and he's been teaching this class for 24 years now). 2. You should take this class because you will become extremely close with the other 14 students taking the class. Everyone in the class is on the same team -- we all help each other out during experiments and we all leave class at the same time. It's a really nice environment. 3. When does the class meet? Both MCDB 344L and MCDB 345L meet on Mondays AND Wednesdays, from 1:30pm to around 5:30pm (sometimes 6:00pm). Yes, this is a commitment. BUT IT IS WORTH IT. You learn so much from this class -- all the times you in your inttro bio classes that you heard about Western Blots, Immunoprecipitation, phase contrast microscopy, etc., you ACTUALLY do those techniques here. Take this lab even if you are already working in another lab for independent research. Take this lab even if you are in YSO (if your rehearsals conflict with MCDB 344L\/345L, then tell Toshi that you are going to take a break from YSO during the spring when this class meets). If you are a student athlete and have practices that begin at 5:00pm or 5:30pm, it might be difficult but try to convince your coach to let you arrive around 6:00pm on Mon\/Wed. 4. Professor Wolenski and his 2 TAs (which he personally picks, and the TAs each year are AMAZING) are THE BEST at explaining concepts. They are very knowledgeable about life and extremely understanding\/compassionate. You will learn so much from this class and feel more confident as an MCDB major.",
    "If you want to get introduced in a friendly, enjoyable, and effectively taught way to biology research, please take this course.",
    "I learned how to think like a scientist and how to give scientific talks, which I know I will definitely use in the future!",
    "This is a wonderful course because of Professor Wolenski. He cares so much about his students and if nothing else, you will get a wonderful and valuable resource from him for the rest of your life. He's the type of professor who knows your name before you even walk in the door. Besides that, you'll obviously learn a ton of lab stuff that can be very helpful if you're working in a molecular bio lab.",
    "This course is definitely my favorite course so far at Yale - take it! The professor and the TAs for both modules are incredibly dedicated to teaching and to making sure you're keeping up with the class. In addition to twice a week labs, we presented papers in a short presentation, which was challenging but definitely doable and a great bio and presentation learning experience.",
    "This course did a fantastic job in teaching me to feel comfortable in a biological laboratory setting. I quickly became familiar with some basic laboratory protocols, and pipetted enough to put a blister on my thumb. The work expected of us was never focused on results or competition, but rather wanted us to become familiar with the processes involved in the lab work, and it was set up so that we could do as much as possible either alone or in pairs, and know intimately how each protocol was achieved. One of the modules focused on nonstandard amino acid incorporation, which was a new topic for me and really let me synthesize a lot of material from other courses in a fun way. We also had a great lesson in public speaking through the class, presenting significant papers as our own \"Job Talks\". Scientific presentations like this haven't been common in my education, and it was important to me to have this practice discussing research, and presenting it in front of an inquisitive audience.",
    "This was an awesome class! I learned so many techniques in lab, but even more importantly, learned a lot of skills that are valuable as a professional scientist, like giving a job talk. This is one of the greatest courses I've taken at Yale, and by far the most personal.",
    "I learned how to approach scientific problems, formulate insightful questions, and design experiments. I of course learned cell biology laboratory techniques. I also learned how to give scientific talks.",
    "I developed my skills in the laboratory, learning lots of techniques that I had never used before.",
    "You'll learn how to be a scientist, both in practice and in theory. You'll be inspired. You'll meet amazing people and THE BEST PROFESSOR at Yale. You'll have great snacks. You'll learn super useful lab techniques and experimental design - you'll be taking the best class at Yale.",
    "Before this course I had never spent time in a biology laboratory before and now I feel ready and excited to begin working on my senior thesis for MCDB next year in a lab at the medical school. We learned an incredible amount about nsAA incorporation, gels\/Western blots as well as experimental design. I also developed a strong presentation giving skill set -- learning how to perform a job talk and chalk talk.",
    "Dr. Wolenski and our TF, Koen, ran several parallel experiments in this half-semester course: HeLa cell isolation, lipid raft isolation and accompanying analysis, and the integration of non-standard amino acids. Each of these techniques was thoroughly covered in both theory and practice, and we were accountable for mastering each step. Dr. Wolenski emphasized the importance of interacting with our classmates - we were to engage with one another about the methods we were pursuing and help each other work through difficult procedures. This was the first class I have taken wherein we were actively encouraged to engage with each other in a lab setting, and this experience will greatly inform how I interact with my peers in the future in professional lab settings. Dr. Wolenski challenged us to understand the reasoning behind each step of the scientific process instead of having us rely on the simplified steps that are so common in labs today. For example, adding \"solution A, then B, then centrifuge\" became a thorough analysis of the chronology and purpose of the specific solvents, as well as a comprehensive education as to the benefits of different types and speeds of centrifugation. Similarly, each student was tasked with giving a job talk, which required us to condense a landmark paper into a 15 minute presentation. This experience not only prepared me for practical needs for professional work, but also required me to expand upon the knowledge I have built over the last few years at Yale in a recent and scientifically relevant setting. Peer feedback and questions were also greatly appreciated as part of this process. This course made me believe I am truly a scientist, and I owe that validation to Dr. Wolenski and the opportunities he has afforded me.",
    "I learned a lot in this class, for example, how to encode non standard amino acids. I would definitely recommend this class for anyone wanting to learn lab techniques.",
    "So much, that I don't even know where to start! Of course, I learned basic lab techniques in cell biology, and how to give presentations on scientific papers, but I think the most valuable skill I learned was how to ask questions. Because Professor Wolenski encouraged us to ask questions on other students' presentations, I went into every paper with the intent of thinking of questions, and I've found that that skill has transferred into my other classes and work as well!"

   "comments": [
    "All are strengths: Professor Wolenski is an incredible professor who cares deeply about the material and his students. He is engaging and makes the class enjoyable. The module, which was developed by Koen our TA, was excellent and we learned new techniques every day as well as had meaningful conversations about biological research. The workload was perfect, spending many hours in the lab and presenting on a scientific paper (a \"job talk\") during the semester. This was incredibly useful as we may be doing something similar in the future for our careers, and I got great constructive feedback on my presentation.",
    "No weaknesses. Keep it as it is. Keep the current location in SCL.",
    "Strength: awesome professor and TAs Weakness: it's a lot of class time, so bring snacks.",
    "Professor Wolenski puts his heart and soul into making this an incredible class, and it truly went above any beyond any expectations for a biology lab. The greatest strength is how many applicable skills I learned, from giving science talks to techniques I know I will use in my research lab experiences.",
    "Be warned -- this is a five hour lab twice a week. That being said, the time flew by. In every other lab class I have ever been in, the time drags on, whereas here, it'd be 6:30 before I realized (snacks and ice cream definitely helped on that). You have to wait for everyone and often do things together, so patience helps. I think the job talk is a great exercise for anything kind of presentation -- Wolenski is tough but fair and gives good feedback.",
    "The strengths of this course were that the instructor and TA(s) were all very knowledgeable, dedicated, and enthusiastic about the course. They always came prepared, while being flexible to new ideas and schedule changes. Being a smaller MCDB class, I also got to know a lot of my MCDB peers. The course was also set up in a way that encouraged students to work with each other and ask for help - which I definitely did a lot!",
    "This course does a great job getting students to engage with the professor, with each other, and with the material. Professor Wolenski is incredibly kind and engaged with us, and makes sure that each student knows what is happening at any given step. He does this in part by giving us our own reagents and buffers, so that (with a few exceptions), the students are each individually or pairwise doing the entire protocol themselves. The course is made strong by its TA as well. The use of a TA-led module allowed us to see what the TA is working on, and exposes us to material that we would not otherwise see in an undergraduate setting. It also helps that the TA is engaged throughout the course, and works very hard to not only answer our questions, but create a terrific learning environment.",
    "I love that Dr. Wolenski modifies the course for every class he has. This is a gem of a course, truly the best MCDB has to offer. It's so engaging, personal, useful (thank you job talks and chalk talks), and fun. I learned so much more than many of my other lab classes. Dr. Wolenski and the TAs are, of course, this course's strongest asset. The only potential weakness I can think of is that it went over time a few times, but it wasn't bad at all!",
    "The course is fantastic, and I cannot think of any improvements I would make.",
    "This class was amazing. The professor and the TA for this class were both great, and the material that we covered in class was very interesting. I'd say the biggest strength for the class was the small class size that allowed us to get more personalized instruction and the twice a week format which allowed us to get through more material than we would have been able to in a once-a-week lab. There were no significant weaknesses.",
    "It has no weaknesses! It's the best course I've ever taken.",
    "The experiments tended to change a bit in protocol but this was usually detailed on the board -- so really cannot think of a weakness.",
    "The course moves at a comfortable pace through a variety of different techniques. Both Dr. Wolenski and Koen did a great job at ensuring we were aware of why were taking specific measures, which made the class extremely engaging. All of the techniques used are modern and are generally relevant to the research that we're doing as undergrads, which makes this even more exciting! Of note, Dr. Wolenski's emphasis on having proof of our work - of providing us with pictures of our gels and slides - made this class exceptionally rewarding for me: it provided the first opportunity for me to prove that I could create something. Koen also did an incredible job at leading the class through the intricacies of nsAA incorporation, and was helpful and attentive throughout the process. The class benefits from a strong sense of camaraderie and family that is fostered by Dr. Wolenski. The experience I had in this course, the enjoyment I experienced each day, and the bonds I formed with my peers were quite unlike those found in every other class I have taken at Yale. The fact that it was capable of pairing those experiences with genuinely practical, relevant, and significant experimental techniques is what makes this course exceptional. I have no recommendations as to its improvement.",
    "Because it's been taught so many times, this course doesn't have many flaws. It's very engaging. You learn a lot and bond with the students and professor.",
    "I loved that the course encouraged collaboration amongst students. I loved that it was laidback enough to not be unnecessarily stress inducing but also rigorous enough to be challenged and to learn. Can't think of any weaknesses!"

    "Absolutely. Do not be intimidated by the hours in the lab, the time passes so quickly. Without a doubt, one of the best courses at Yale I have taken. It is a stress-free environment that is focused on learning and improving your skills as a researcher and helping you as you look down career paths.",
    "A) TAKE THIS CLASS AND READ WHAT I WROTE If you are a freshman, sophomore, or junior reading this (and you are considering taking MCDB cell bio and eventually this labs class), THEN TAKE BOTH CELL BIO AND THIS LABS CLASS. You will want to sign up for both MCDB 344L (1st half of spring term) and MCDB 345L (2nd half of spring term). This was my favorite MCDB class ever.

    "Yes. Take this course! Great professor and TAs and totally worth the two lab sessions per week.",
    "1000% Take this class!!!! Professor Wolenski is amazing and you will learn so much. Though it is a lot of class time, there is barely any work outside of that. You will become friends with everyone in the class and it is truly my favorite class at Yale!",
    "Take it if you can! There's essentially no work for the course which makes up for the length. Wolenski is a great guy and you'lll learn a lot!",
    "YES, I would definitely recommend this course to any student interested in cell bio! This course is my favorite course so far due to the professor, TAs, other students, and interesting material. Professor Wolenski is understanding and will individually explain concepts to you or procedures if lost.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS! This was probably the best course I've taken at Yale (along with MCDB 345L). It is such a fun way to learn about whatever Wolenski has in store for that year - he really works to keep it fun and engaging, and so changes around the syllabus frequently. It's hard to get into (long waiting list), but if you can take it, it is absolutely worth the time spent in the lab.",
    "Absolutely take this class if you can get in. Don't be one of those people who signs up and then chooses something else. This is one of Yale's gems, and you'll become close with your classmates, learn a lot about being a professional scientist (or even skills that could help with med school). This class is 20000X better than the other MCDB lab classes, and it's personalized for every group of students that comes in. Workload is not heavy, although in-class time is, and you'll come out with experience in cell culture, practice giving a job talk, and a potential letter of rec.",
    "This class is absolutely fantastic, and I recommend it strongly. Professor Wolenski is an incredible scientist, professor, and mentor. He runs the lab in a way that enables students to learn a lot, but the class isn't stressful like many of the other labs I have taken at Yale. The TF's in the course are also incredible. The course is a big time commitment, but it is a great experience.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to another student! The workload outside of the class is not very high, but you are signing up to be in the lab for 10 hours every week, so that is significant. The time goes by fast, however, and the lab is very enjoyable. You'll learn a lot and you'll have a great time doing it!",
    "You'll learn how to be a scientist, both in practice and in theory. You'll be inspired. You'll meet amazing people and THE BEST PROFESSOR at Yale. You'll have great snacks. You'll learn super useful lab techniques and experimental design - you'll be taking the best class at Yale.",
    "This course is incredible -- you become so close to your lab family and really learn how to work well with others in a lab. It is unlike any other lab course I have taken at Yale (I actually looked forward to coming to lab each Monday and Friday!). This was really due to the team-like environment of the lab and the fascinating experiments we were always running. Although the amount of hours you commit to this lab are high, the amount of time you dedicate to the course outside of lab is minimal (except for preparing two presentations -- one for 344 and the other for 345).",
    "The experimental techniques are relevant, the teaching engaging, and the environment conducive to both fun and enjoyment. The class benefits from a strong sense of camaraderie and family that is fostered by Dr. Wolenski. The experience I had in this course, the enjoyment I experienced each day, and the bonds I formed with my peers were quite unlike those found in every other class I have taken at Yale. The fact that it was capable of pairing those experiences with genuinely practical, relevant, and significant experimental techniques is what makes this course exceptional. I strongly recommend reaching out to Dr. Wolenski about this course.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. It was fun and interesting. Dr. Wolenski is a fantastic professor and the TAs he brings in are great as well.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS IF YOU GET THE CHANCE! Professor Wolenski and the TA's were absolutely fantastic, and the small class size really lets you bond with your fellow classmates. You can tell that Professor Wolenski really cares about his students- I've never seen that level of genuine care for students from a professor before. I loved that it was laid-back enough to not be unnecessarily stress inducing but also rigorous enough to be challenged and to learn. Truly a fantastic class!",
    "I can't recommend this course highly enough! It is definitely one of the most valuable academic experience in my time at Yale, thanks to Professor Wolenski's enthusiasm for teaching, love of experimental science, and a uniquely respectful and caring manner in which he treats every individual student. By all means take this course if you can get in ! You will grow intellectually throughout the semester, not only as a well-rounded scientist, but also as a person. The friendships, values and knowledge of both cell biology and life that you build in this class will stay a part of you for the lifetime."
