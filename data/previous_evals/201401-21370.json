   "comments": [
    "Problem sets were fun, but that's the only redeeming factor. Lectures were very slow and redundant, often going on unenlightening tangents. Midterm grading was a nightmare.",
    "This class is alright. The subject matter is very interesting and after you complete the midterm project you'll feel like a wizard if you do it correctly. But this class isn't without its flaws. Professor Biro is probably one of the weaker professors I've had so far, which isn't to say that he's bad, but he's just not that engaging. He here has a pretty heavy accent, which isn't a problem most of the time but occasionally there are moments of confusion (e.g. he's giving a lecture on regional differences in pronunciation and isn't really able to imitate the differences very well). I felt like I was the only person in the class who didn't already know set notation, since it was everywhere in this course and I had absolutely no experience with it. Python is kind of an afterthought and you're supposed to teach yourself, but it's a pretty easy language so anybody with any degree of computer science experience could do the programming easily. However, I found the problem sets to be rather difficult, which kind of sucks since it's 40% of the grade for the class. The grading was pretty harsh (60-70% medians for some of the psets) and the work isn't easy so this definitely is not a class to sleep on. I probably wouldn't recommend it if you have just a passing interest (as I did), but if you're really gunning for computational linguistics it's certainly not a bad course.",
    "Don't take this course unless you have to. It is not taught well. You are better off spending a few days on your own going to wikipedia's computational linguistics page. You would probably learn more and it would be much more interesting.",
    "What a mess of a course. Talking to a friend that took this as LING 141, he said that every problem set involved programming, the professor was good and the class was interesting. Having taken this course as LING 227, I can say none of those points are true. There was no programming until the third problem set and even then plenty of points still depended on non-coding tasks. Tamas made little attempt to make lecture more exciting or more interesting than the textbook and often failed to explain or provide examples to important algorithms. If you're like me and are a computer science student wanting an SO without needing to write essays, I guess you can do this, but really take a look at your options.",
    "If it's taught by Biro, no.",
    "The book is pretty nice, you will learn as much as you intend to. You'll have to learn python and some nltk tools.",
    "The course is very frustrating, in that the material is fascinating but the teaching is terrible. The class is very inter-disciplinary, you learn about Hidden Markov Models, some probability theory, python programming and algorithms, and even a little bit of abstract algebra. Sadly, the lectures by Professor Biro are dry and do not help and I had to learn by myself. However, he is pretty good at responding to emails. He seems to explain things way better when he writes it down. The last chapters of the textbook were very cursorily covered so the final part felt very rushed.",
    "I would not recommend this course, but I don\u2019t recommend any course if the lectures aren\u2019t worth going to. Prof. Biro is for the most part well-organized and familiar with everything we cover (which is a good range of interesting topics), but he is a very dry\/boring speaker. The class was pretty easy for a CS major, but if you\u2019re trying to get your So there are much more memorable\/impactful classes you could take. This is not something you will remember after graduation.",
    "Poor instructor teaching great material, though it should be good for next year.",
    "I would recommend this course for linguistic students interested in computational applications and computer science students interested in linguistic applications and theory. There is a lot of overlap in the fields, not just because we use similar tools to create systems like translators, etc, but also because the fields share a lot of formal theory- coming from a computer science background, learning about chomsky's hierarchy, etc. were valuable things. However, for a student interested in less specific aspects\/an introduction to these fields, this is a very technical course and would probably be uninteresting.",
    "The material is really interesting and the problem sets were almost fun. I knew python well going in, which made most of the coding pretty trivial, it might be more challenging if you haven't programmed before. Prof Biro was sweet but not a very compelling professor. Very well-intentioned, but difficult to understand, and it was totally unnecessary to attend class.",
    "The assignments, midterms, and tests were good in explaining the concepts and giving you an opportunity to practice them. Lectures were rather slow and repetitive at times. In short, it's a decent 5th course.",
    "While confusing sometimes, computational linguistics is a lot of fun. Take the class, if only for the subject matter.",
    "Interesting and fun psets, but boring lectures... Take if you're interested in the subject and know some programming.",
    "This class could have been so great but it was only 10% great (the assignments, which were the only way I actually learned anything out of this class because I had to actually understand enough to implement it). Tamas is a good guy who knows what he's talking about but he needs to work on his teaching technique. Many of the students skipped lecture regularly. The subjects meant to be covered are fascinating but the execution was less than satisfactory...take if with another teacher. Although I've heard Gaja is pretty bad too. I really can't say if you should take this because it's going to be ENTIRELY different in future years.",
    "This is a hard course to review, because the material was so interesting, but the lectures were just so painful. I'd say that I'm glad I took it, but was not always glad to be taking it. It didn't help that it was taught at prime nap time of the day,"
