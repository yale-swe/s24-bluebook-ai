    "Take this course!! Super interesting techniques like IVF, and making chimeric embryos. Lots of dissections so if you get a little queasy from rodential odors this may not be the course for you. Oh the no lab reports thing is so wonderful, but that leaves a lot of pressure on the midterm and final exams (50% each...) so be prepared to pay close attention in each lab.The sections are small so you get lots of attention from Professor Klein (which is such a blessing in the sciences) and I had awesome TA's. Overall a ton of fun. Watch out the midterm practical was a lot harder than I expected. Make sure you can recognize the histology slides for EVERYTHING (yeah... the corpus luteum slide threw me off so hard)",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS",
    "Yes! But you have to get on the waiting list about a year in advance and email Mary Klein multiple times to get and confirm your spot. I had to go through my dean to get a response.",
    "The good part about this lab is that you get a lot of experience a) working with microscopes, b) working with dissected animals, and c) doing biology laboratory procedures ingeneral. As someone who has not worked much in a biology lab before, I felt that this was a great takeaway. That being said, a lot of the procedures in the course involved a TON of frustratingly minuscule mechanical procedures that were almost impossible to execute. You were not graded on how well you executed these procedures, which was good, but still, it made the class seem extraordinarily frustrating at times. Get ready to be frustrated, but you will also come out feeling like you learned a ton. ALSO: The midterm is hilariously impossible. One of the most unfair tests I've taken at Yale. It needs to change, in my opinion.",
    "Awesome way to fulfill a premed\/bio lab requirement. No weekly lab reports which is fantastic, just a practical midterm and a final. The procedures in the lab aren't always easy, but they have no relation to your grade so no need to stress about them!",
    "Amazing lab - there are a couple of slightly less interesting labs (flowers and flies), but the others are really incredible. It's so satisfying to successfully flush embryos from a mouse uterus and find them waiting in the dish to be implanted or turned into a chimera. Such cool techniques that are basically the same as the ones used for humans in IVF and lab research on reproductive biology. Getting into this course is hard - e-mail up to a year in advance and expect to be rejected if you aren't a junior or senior. The lab practical was tough because we had to identify things from parts of slides, etc., but if you study the lab handouts and look at the pictures of slides in the handouts, you should be ok. The final was a lot of writing but not too hard. No lab reports, so not so time-consuming on a weekly basis. Sometimes got out at 5 and sometimes a little early.",
    "A good hands on lab course that is applicable to real lab experience. Definitely recommend.",
    "Absolutely take this! The procedures are really fun and its a very rare opportunity that you are able to do this.",
    "Unlike other labs where you have to do reports each week. But you really have to buckle down for the two exams since those make up your whole grade.",
    "This is an excellent lab to learn real procedures with important applications not only in the lab but in every day life! I loved it! The only downside again is grading. You have a midterm and a final... Do well!",
    "Take it!!! It is so cool, by far the most hands on and fun lab I have taken as a Yale premed. Although a lot of it is theory, and there is some repetition which can at times be tedious, you come away with both academic knowledge and technical skills that are so valuable. People will tell you the tests are hard...they are tricky but not impossible if you study...everything you need is in the lab handouts. Seriously. And no lab reports!! Does it get any better? I submit that it does not.",
    "This lab is significantly better than any lab I have taken at Yale in terms of the actual lab experiments. However, I really think that the class should have another way of assessing its students that is not just 2 exams.",
    "Great lab, not much work during the semester, but lab practical midterm was pretty tough. Only midterm and final, 50\/50, so be prepared to study hard. Other than that the lab sessions were amazing, I learned a lot, and had a lot of fun while at it. One of the few labs where I didn't mind staying late or going over the allotted time.",
    "This lab is one of the better lab courses I've taken at Yale. While it suffers from some organizational issues, it's not too difficult and it's very informative. Also, it's fun. You'll do everything from dissections to looking atslides to IVF to mouse surgery. Dr. Klein cares a lot about her students, which makes the organizational issues not seem too bad.",
    "a great lab. no work outside of class, but your grade comes down to a lab practical (50%) and an exam at the end (50%). be prepared to study for those!",
    "A solid biology lab. You learn a lot of cool techniques like in vitro fertilization. Don't take this if you're squeamish! There's LOTS of dissection and weird smelling animal innards. No lab reports, only a practical midterm (slide and specimen identification) and a written final. Both were pretty fair, definitely needed to study before each, but other than that, there's no week to week work.",
    "Really interesting class. Probably the most applicable lab you'll take at Yale.",
    "Not very much work at all because there are no lab reports. However there's a lot riding on the tests, and they aren't exactly easy.",
    "This was a good course for a lab. The level of work was much lower than for other labs at yale.",
    "The labs are pretty interesting and challenging. Sometimes we didn't succeed after several hours of work. However, the grades come only from the exams and there are no lab reports. There are lots of animal dissections.",
    "This course was a great way to explore reproductive biology. I thought the labs we did were very interesting and very advanced, in a fun but sometimes confusing way. As far as testing goes, the first exam tested not on useful skills but on rote memorization that was not novel or useful, and was pretty unfair. The second exam was more fair. Overall, very enjoyable.",
    "YES. TAKE THIS CLASS. IT IS AWESOME.",
    "This is a good, laid-back, interesting lab that I highly recommend. Be warned, though, grading is rough.",
    "Come to lab. There is a packet. Read it before if you don't want to be lost. There will be notes on the board. Copy them down and ask questions if you don't understand something. Do what you're supposed to do. Leave knowing that you won't have to write a lab report and smile.For the midterm, try to memorize all of the pictures in the handouts. Tough sledding but worth it.For the final, Memorize the board notes and the handouts. Tough sledding but (I think) it's worth it (since I don't know my grade yet...).Take the course.As someone who is good at memorizing, I feel like I performed very well in the class. However, if you are not good at memorizing, either visually for the midterm or \"linguistically\" (is that the right word? I mean what the handouts say :) ) for the final, then you might want to watch out. Also, I didn't really enjoy the fact that animals were killed for me to work with them. I felt bad for the mice and even the baby flies (even though they were gross). If you don't want that sort of experience, then bow out before you even start.This is by far the best science lab I've taken at Yale and one of the 3 best sciences classes I've taken.TAs, Max and Emily, were also fantastic.",
    "Best lab class at Yale!! No lab reports and only a midterm and final. The midterm was a practical, which was hard, but the written final was much more fair. Most of the experiments involve dissecting mice and you really get to do some exciting stuff (try to make a chimeric mouse for example). Email her in October or November if you want to get into this class. Dr. Klein is also such a great professor.",
    "THIS IS THE BEST. No lab reports doesn't mean no work. You need to know what you're doing. But it is so fun to learn, and the tests, while hard, are totally about the things you spent the semester reading about and practicing. You'll probably have a hard time even getting in, and all the people in line ahead of you and behind you do have the right idea. You are doing more than playing with life, you are seeing it create itself and you are working with ways to harness that power. In a half-credit lab.",
    "Take this course, especially if you are premed or interested in biology \/ dissections. I was not interested in reproductive biology much at all, I just wanted a good, chill lab - I found it far more interesting than I thought previously. If you wanna take this lab, email Mary by the end of the previous semester or earlier (you may get lucky at the beginning of reading period, but that's stressful). You'll have to memorize quite a bit for the two or so days before the hard midterm and easier final, but it's worth it (as is the lecture course).",
    "Barely any work, but it was difficult to maintain a grade with just the midterm and final determining it",
    "Really cool experiments but the exams are really tough.",
    "Take this lab, not some other crappy lab. You learn actual skills in this lab and there are no lab reports. At all. Your grade hinges on two tests (midterm and final) which is intimidating but doable. Dr. Klein is totally awesome and a great teacher. You spend the majority of the time dissecting animals so if you're squeamish you might want to reconsider. To me, it was the best lab course I've taken here. I recommend HIGHLY.",
    "Yes! A really cool lab, where you are not graded on technique during lab (doesn't help motivation as a senior). No lab reports, which is great, but grades are based on a midterm and final, both of which are very difficult.",
    "The class is lab-based (no weekly reports), but requires that you really study the lab guides outside of class. Only recommended for those who are motivated enough to do work in the absence of formal assignments. You really need to study.",
    "Yes, this is my favorite lab class at Yale, and if you've taken Repro Bio with Professor Klein, I highly suggest you take this lab too.",
    "Repro Bio Lab is great! I would certainly recommend it - without a doubt the best lab course I have taken at Yale. You do dissections, learn about different reproductive systems, and develop skills for different reproductive technologies (such as IVF, etc.)It's not like your average lab course, in that almost all the work is done in the class (there are no lab reports, only a lab practical midterm and a written final). The exams are hard (you really need to study quite a bit) but the tradeoff for no lab reports is awesome. Dr. Klein is really encouraging and makes for an interesting, fun, and relaxed lab.Note, though, that if you want to take this course you have to get in touch with Dr. Klein way ahead of time (like, a semester at least).",
    "YES. You learn so much. The midterm and final are crazy hard, but overall the class was worth it. No lab reports, so very little work other than studying for midterm and final. Mary Klein is amazing. I love her, I want to be her. ***You have to email her a year in advance to get into the class though.",
    "No work but tests are awful."
