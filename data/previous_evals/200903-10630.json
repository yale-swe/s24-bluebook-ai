    "I'd highly recommend it to anyone interested in mesoscopic physics.",

    "It's a good course to open your view, but need much more learning to use it.",
    "This was a very good introductory course for Mesoscopic Physics, which is a broad and fascinating topic. I would recommend it for students who have taken some advance physics courses (particularly Solid State), since they will be able to understand the material much better. It will require a lot of outside reading if you really want to learn the details and derivations of equations."

   "comments": [
    "It's closely related to my research interests. I was able to relate a lot of the topics covered in class to what's going on in the lab.",
    "This topic was not directly connected to my research but provided another point of view.",
    "I took this course to familiarize myself with a topic I have had interest but little experience in. It definitely widened my understanding of the topic and contributed to my general physics knowledge."
