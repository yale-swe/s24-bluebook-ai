   "comments": [
    "If you have any interest in how instruments work, especially if you are a musician, TAKE THIS CLASS. This class is the most engaging and entertaining class I have ever taken at Yale.",
    "Excellent class for the vast majority of the course, but the final project can be very time consuming toward the end of the semester. Doing an electronic instrument was the best decision I made as it required much less work than physical instruments and the analytic component was a joke.",
    "AMAZING. This course is really cool. The final project, making your own novel instrument, was fantastic--amazing to see everyone's hard work at the final presentations. It will take a fair amout of work, though, and the psets\/labs are sometimes confusing in their wording (though I think this will be better next year, since this was the first time they were teaching the class). Larry, Konrad, and Thibault are an excellent team, and every one of them was passionate and knowledeable about the subject and the tools in the CEID. Awesome to combine music and engineering, too, since so many people at Yale play instruments or sing\/in general love music!",
    "Take this class. It is hard, but take it. You will not regret it.",
    "TAKE THIS COURSE! but don't take any other classes- to really build good instruments you need to live in the CEID. but you'll want to. The labs were definitely not a joke- as a music major i found the physics and acoustics not exactly trivial. If you've ever wanted to build a serious instrument (especially a completely novel one), clear your schedule and take this. The resources available were astounding, as were the final projects. Check out this video of our final presentations that Yale and the CEID made, if you can.",
    "ENAS 344 is a course about building instruments. We go over the function and physics of a few categories of instrumentsbars (xylophones), strings, tubes, and electronic synthesis. The first half of the semester seems harder, in retrospect, given the amount of mathematics in the problem sets and labs. There is one problem set and one lab per week. Labs involve building instruments and will consume a fair amount of your time, especially if you are a perfectionist. Once final projects begin, you will have to invest a large amount of time to make it a success. I would estimate that I spent about 40 hours in the CEID just in the week before the project was due. I would absolutely recommend this course for those interested in designing and building instruments, or for musicians who want to know more about their art.",
    "I absolutely love this class; perhaps my favorite class at Yale. If you're interested in both engineering and music, then this class is perfect for you! It gives you the opportunity to be exposed to a wide variety of areas and appreciate the connections between each. It also allows you to fully live the CEID life: I personally used pretty much all the tools in the CEID from the electronics bench, ShopBot, and 3D printers to the coffee at 4am for two weeks leading up to the final project deadline. Despite the above average workload (including weekly p-sets and primarily the final project), I found the course very rewarding. Larry, Konrad, and Thibault are all super enthusiastic and were always willing to help and guide us. It is also a delight when we can hear the sounds from the instruments we made which we can keep at the end of class!",
    "This course is wonderful in concept, but leaves much to be desired. You won't learn that much beyond the very fundamentals of musical acoustics, but it was really nice to have the opportunity to build musical instruments for a class. Lectures were not the most interesting, but discussed concepts necessary to complete the homework problems. The course was a ton of work this year, but I imagine that the professors realized this and will make changes in the syllabus for next year. The best part is that for the final project you get to design and build a novel instrument, which you can keep at the end of the course.",
    "Final project is as awesome as you make it. Lot of fun ideas that were executed well. The class, however, spends too much time in the beginning of the semester on labs that get you acquainted with fundamental physics, Solidworks, machine tools, etc. For an elective type course, I would recommend this class if it's work load decreases substantially, which is possible given this was the first year it was taught.",
    "You'll spend the first chunk of the semester learning about the physics of acoustic and synthesized music; the last third or so is spent working an individual project where you design and create your own innovative instrument. Absolutely take this classyou'll learn a ton, the instructors are incredible, and you'll get to learn practical design skills and make music in the process! It's the best ever!"
