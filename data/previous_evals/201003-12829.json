   "comments": [
    "You hear every Sondheim musical written, with maybe two exceptions. A lot of reading, but mostly interesting and very diverse.",
    "A fabulous class. Obviously, don't take it if you don't care about Stephen Sondheim, but the class is well-structured, the work is just the right amount, and Dan Egan is wonderful. Plus, we got to meet with Sondheim and see A Little Night Music on Broadway for free! If you think you might be at all interested (and why are you reading this if you aren't?), TAKE THIS CLASS!",
    "A survey of Sondheim's musical as well as an analysis of the greater themes and trends that pop up throughout his work.",
    "Excellent survey of Sondheim's material and forum for discussion. take it if you are interested in musical theater.",
    "Dan Egan is my favorite teacher I've had at Yale, and I'm surprised his classes aren't more well-known than they are. This class is a blast the entire semester, whether you're already a huge fan of Sondheim or you're skeptical of him or you know nothing about him. The homework is never too much (usually just listening to 1-2 musicals and some light reading), and the class discussions are extremely interesting because not only does he have some good things to say, but he also makes sure everybody in the class gets to speak. Aside from weekly readings, the only assignments are a 5-pg, a 2-pg, and a 10-15pg paper, all of which he'll meet with you well ahead of time to work out topics with. Best of all, we got to go to NYC and have an hour-long class session with Stephen Sondheim himself! I definitely recommend this class! Also, his general American Musical Theater History class.",
    "I would HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend this class. Prof. Egan is a fantastic professor who really works hard to help his students succeed. The material is fascinating and fun. Take it!",
    "Great class - there's a surprising amount of work to be thoroughly prepared for discussion each week, but when the bulk of the work is listening to musicals it hardly feels like homework at all. Professor Egan is great and clearly demonstrates that he's interested in each student. He also does a good job at tailoring the class and his individual focus to each person's background in music theory and Sondheim\/theatre exposure.The chance to meet with Stephen Sondheim and be treated to a production of A Little Night Music on broadway with Bernadette Peters and Elaine Stritch was an amazing way to cap off the course, although I don't know if that will be offered every year.",
    "This class is absolutely wonderful! I came in as just a Sondheim enthusiast--I had little to no background in Theatre Studies and not really into musical analysis. I struggled for a little bit in getting what this class was 'about,' but after I started treating the class like an English-music class and looking at the musicals with a detailed and critical eye, I got so much more out of the class. Not too much work and Professor Egan is a detailed grader, but he greatly values participation of any opinions in class. If you show enthusiasm and improvement, the class will be a great one.",
    "This was probably my class this semester. If you're looking at this evaluation, chances are you're familiar with Sondheim shows, but even if you're not, take this class anyway! The opportunity to meet Stephen Sondheim is not to be missed, and it's great to just sit and talk about musicals for credit. I learned a lot from my more knowledgeable classmates. If you're looking for a class to remind you of why you chose Yale (like I was), this is a class to take. You should not be disappointed.",
    "This class is a great one for anyone who enjoys Sondheim- even those who don't know a lot about his work. Most of the work involves listening to his music and reading critical essays, and class discussions involve analysis of music and critiques. A great class if you are looking for a fun but engaging music class.",
    "WE MET STEPHEN SONDHEIM!!!That's probably enough to sell you on the class, but it's compelling enough on its own.This class promotes critical thinking and taught me to apply it to more fields than I'm used to (esp. since I'm not a music major). We ended up talking about the impacts of sets, the palindromic score of Sweeney Todd, and whether the heroine of Passion is the arch-typical Nietzschean villain.The readings were interesting, esp since Egan mixes in some problematic critiques. I loved writing the final paper. Egan leaves the topic open, but talks your proposal over in detail so you don't end up floundering.Professor Egan is stellar. He's intensely engaged with the material and always interested in discussing material in more detail after class or in following up with you when you've made a comment that interests him. Makes a real effort to build up good discussion culture (I wish more Profs did). He's extremely responsive to emailed questions if you run into any problems."
