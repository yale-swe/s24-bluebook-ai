    "I would summarize the class as a basic two week primer of statistics directed especially towards clinical applications. Whether or not I would recommend the class would depend on the needs of the student; for someone with a lot of statistics background, the class would not be very useful because the clinical application part is only one or two lectures at the end. However, if someone has not had a strong statistics background or is going to be using the spss software, then the class would be useful.",

    "The main knowledge that I gleaned from this course that is useful for my research is the difference between Spearman and Pearson correlations, which we use to interpret proteomics data. Other than that, it was not very useful because we do not do a whole lot of survival analysis or model-based statistics.",
    "Not much."
