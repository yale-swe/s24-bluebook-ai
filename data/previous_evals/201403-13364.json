    "I've never been more excited to get to a 9:25 seminar. So, as the Beatles might say, \"Dear Prudence, won't you come out to play?\"",
    "I thought this was one of the best organized seminars I've taken. Prof. Van Vleck is a phenomenal professor and person, and the subject material is really interesting. I do think that we cover SO much ground that sometimes it feels a little rushed--not sure there's a good way to change that, though. I also liked a lot the links we drew between historical events and current events.",
    "TAKE IT! This class is different from any other history classes I have taken and is probably my favorite class at Yale. I learned so much for the transnational approach. Demanding, but highly rewarding!",
    "It takes the \"1960s\" and looks at global dimensions of this period, and problematizes the timeline and notion of a decade as a unit of historical study. Yes, take it. Good reading material, good options for research.",
    "HIST 411J is a transnational study of the 1960s. It's a really great class that pushes you to think about the ways in which events and circumstances in various countries during the 1960s were interconnected and related, and also the ways in which themes that emerge while studying the global 1960s are still relevant today. I would definitely recommend the class. Sometimes I found the class challenging because I did not have a lot of background information about some of the countries and events that we studied, so it might be helpful if you do have background knowledge, although it is not a requirement.",
    "Take this class if you can get in. It was my first history seminar, and I learned a ton. I didn't know much about the topic going in, but I feel like I learned so much relevant information about both the time period and about history as a discipline as well. The readings are really good and encompass a wide variety of genres (films and tv episodes included in there as well). Prof. Van Vleck is great. She's very chill but still really passionate about the class. She provides really helpful comments on the midterm paper that will help you when writing your research paper. The research paper had mini deadlines that help you stay on task and on target, so the work for the paper is spread out and more manageable. And Prof. Van Vleck is more than willing to help you with any questions or issues you may have regarding the course over the semester. Definitely take it if you can.",
    "Would definitely recommend this course if you're at all interested in this period. The seminar does a great job at examining this time period from a transnational approach and looking at how the civil rights movement, for example, might have been influenced by Fanon's anti-imperialist work in Algeria. The workload is a bit heavy (about a book each book) and there are discussion questions due each week. There's also a mid-term paper (evaluating texts you've read thus far) and a final paper. You have a bit of freedom with the final paper, just make sure not to leave too much of it for the end of the semester. Van Vleck does a great job at staying on top of you about the paper and offering advice. Overall, great junior history seminar.",
    "The Global 60s is one of the best seminars I've ever taken! Van Vleck is a wonderful presence at the harkness table, and was able to guide discussion so that each week was really fulfilling. The material is fascinating; the readings Van Vleck assigned were generally strong, and the movies and tv episodes (Mad Men) were always incredible! But one of the best aspects of the course is being able to bond with your parents on a new level over winter break when you suddenly have a whole new body of cultural references to share.",
    "The Global 1960s is an interesting course that gives a broader perspective to the events of the 1960s than what is normally taught in the U.S. The course is well-structured, with weekly readings (and sometimes films); a presentation; and a midterm and final paper. The class discussions could be more engaging. But Professor Van Vleck is a motivating and encouraging professor.",
    "Take this class if you have any interest at all in the 1960s. The seminar makes you think about history in a unique, transnational context; the readings and films are all very interesting. Professor Van Vleck is brilliant, kind, and engaging; she was probably the best seminar leader I've ever had. The workload is also reasonable for a junior seminar -- weekly reading responses, one presentation, one 5-page midterm paper, and one 15 to 20-page final paper.",
    "In a way, this course is an intro class to the 1960s. You cover all the major topics of the 1960s, from the Civil Rights Movement and May '68 to the Vietnam War. It's great because you really get a sense of how dynamic the 1960s was and what great changes occurred during that decade. However, sometimes we only covered the material very superficially, which was frustrating. That being said, I would recommend this course, if only for the understanding of the global dynamics at work at the time and for the research project at the end of term."
