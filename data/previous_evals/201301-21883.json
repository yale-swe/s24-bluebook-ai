   "comments": [
    "I liked 140. If you're unsure if you want to go through 140 i would say do it especially because its 1.5 credits.",
    "I would recommend it to anyone who wants to learn to write French better. You do not improve your speaking skills a ton.",
    "If you're even slightly interested in French, you should definitely take this course! By the end of the semester, you will look back on all the readings and all the films and say to yourself, \"Wow, did we really study ALL of that!?\" It's remarkable how much you can learn about WWII and the history of France in the course. Plus, Madame Burton is hands down the best French professor out there - she is funny, witty and incredibly caring!",
    "Take it if you're interested in pursuing french, but Professors who teach it vary greatly so shop wisely. The work load is a lot if only because you have class every single day--not too bad if you manage your time well though.Madame Burton is the best professor in the French department. Hands down. She is always engaged and makes class fun, engaging, and educational. You'll find her supplemental hand outs\/assignments will put you miles ahead of your peers and vastly help your French improve. She is very theatrical, and if you don't enjoy public speaking\/acting exercises you should get over that fast because you will be doing lots of dialogues.",
    "A lot of work but you learn a lot of French. Assignments are helpful but you don't need to do everything.",
    "Great class. A natural progression from L3 that has a decrease in workload if anything. Reading can be difficult\/overwhelming, but if managed wisely simply serves to increase reading capacity substantially. Take it with Madame Burton if you can. Fun, understanding, and kind woman who loves the language and her students.",
    "This class is usually used for getting language requirements out of the way and taking it with Madame Burton was enjoyable and an easy way to get through the course.",
    "I would definitely recommend it. Not only did my french skills improve dramatically, but my understanding of other ideas grew (esp. the experience of french people in WWII).",
    "French 140 was a great class in terms of the grammar, but I found the readings and texts to be not terribly engaging. However, We spent a great deal of time on World War 2, which I really enjoyed. Also, I did find the movies we watched to be very interesting."
