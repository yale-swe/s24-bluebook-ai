   "question_text": "What knowledge, skills, and insights did you develop by taking this course?",
   "comments": [
    "My artistic eye, my problem-solving skills, and my appreciation of books and other printed works has increased. I can't look at a book anymore without mentally analyzing its build and all the work that went into it.",
    "I truly gained a new skill that I never even thought about developing before this course. Watching my skills in printing develop into something tangible was very exciting!",
    "I learned a lot about the nuances of the skill and history involved in printmaking and bookmaking. Obviously, I gained knowledge of the specific process itself, but I also learned more general ideas surrounding art and design. Overall, this was a class unlike any I'd ever taken, and I'm thrilled to have had this opportunity.",
    "I learned how to print on a printing press which was awesome! I also learned how to linocut, bind books, and access Yale's amazing book collections.",
    "I developed an appreciation for typesetting and an appreciation for the massive amount of knowledge printing has given us.",
    "The concrete skills I learned were how to use a printing press, how to set type, how to do lino cuts, and how to design different printed projects, including a coaster, a broadside, and a book. More figuratively, I learned how to execute a design, something I had never done before having never taken a workshop art class like this one. I better learned how to collaborate with other thinkers and how to share a collective space. I learned and experienced firsthand all the hard work that goes into any printed work.",
    "I learned a lot about the history of the printing press, typography and close attention to detail, and how to use the various printing presses in the JE press room to print posters and books."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "It would be better if students could get access to the Press Room. Coordination with press managers was difficult.",
    "This course was at times difficult to handle in terms of time commitment. It requires a lot of involvement out of class. Its also very fun!",
    "I do wish we'd learned more about the history and specifics of bookbinding, printing, etc. I loved the artistic component of the course, but wanted to know a bit more about the background!",
    "It is a really unique and wonderful class. Professor Rose is an amazing teacher who knows his stuff. I also really enjoyed the field trips. My only complaint is that I had to put many hours in outside of the classroom, but I think that comes with the territory.",
    "I'm not a particularly artistic person, so some of the design that went into projects wasn't the easiest for me. The solution would probably just be more practice, though.",
    "One gets exactly as much out of this course as one puts in. It was hard for me without any real art experience to be \"plunged into the deep end,\" as Professor Rose puts it, but it's really up to you to keep up and make something you're proud of. I wish there was slightly more instruction as to different techniques (there were demos for each of the presses and for certain other skills, but for the most part, the first time I tried things was for one of the projects, never for practice). I think we could have been given slightly more direction for the paper, and I think that we could have had a couple fewer field trips and guest speakers towards the end of the course to make room for more working days on the final project. The strengths of the course were truly countless. I bonded so much with my classmates, struggling in the press together, hearing their incredible ideas, and just being proud of each other's work. I think that the satisfaction one feels at the end of the course is worth every moment.",
    "I loved Art of the Printed Word. Not only did we learn a lot about the history of typography, visit the abundance of special collections available at Yale, and learn about the importance of material choice to the experience of the consumer, but also how carefully consider typographic form and refine our skills of observation. One of the weaknesses would be the short amount of time for some of the projects! During the end of the course, it was definitely necessary to carefully plan your time in order to finish everything by the due date, though this is not necessarily the fault of the course! Time management is essential."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Certainly! It's an excellent course. I'm not the most artistic person, but it really helped me learn aesthetic appreciation.",
    "I would recommend this course with the clear warning that this is an art class and not a history or intellectual course. It is very hands on!",
    "Yes. Though unusual, this course gave me a chance to explore an artistic side of me without the intimidation of your average art course. As it is a freshman seminar, my classmates and I were all in our first terms, and therefore shared much of the same trepidations. Also, no one had used a press before, meaning we all began the process together. It was a great class that I worked hard in not for the grade, but for the art, and I think that is rare to find freshman fall.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to other students! There are not many places where you could take a class on letterpress and Yale is one of them. People should definitely take advantage of Yale's unique resources!",
    "Yes, but there may be more work than you expect.",
    "This course is amazing, but you really have to throw yourself into it. There is no point in taking it if you just want to slide by. Prepare yourself for many frustrating hours fiddling with very small details in the press, but also prepare yourself to come away from the course with an amazing, very obscure new skill, a real appreciation for books, a strong bond with your classmates and press managers, and a couple amazing pieces of art you made yourself.",
    "I would highly recommend this course! It is a lot of work, but definitely rewarding. It is such a great feeling to make someone thing and know that you put a lot of effort and time into it. The class is quite a bit of work, especially at the end of the semester when the final project (a book with an edition of five copies) and a 6 page single spaced paper, but it is definitely manageable with appropriate time management and is worth the time investment!"
