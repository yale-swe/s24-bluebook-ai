    "An excellent survey of the substantive topics in racial politics in America.",
    "This course was an excellent survey of race and ethnicity politics in the US. I learned a lot about how the field has evolved, as well as how and to what extent it has interacted with or clashed with the study of American politics more generally. In addition, I was able to examine different methods for studying race and ethnicity in American politics including the use of case studies, ethnography, experiments, legal analysis etc. Vesla's effort to highlight both popular and underrepresented works in political science and sociology was a really helpful way of understanding the field and helping situating myself within it. In addition to the content, I also gained practice in writing a literature review and pursuing original research within the field. Vesla provided excellent input to help me strengthen these skills.",
    "A wonderfully interdisciplinary course that focused on everything from methodology to philosophy. Perhaps the most crucial skill emphasized was the ability to challenge texts both in conversation and in written work, yet analyzing different methodologies was also a priority. Each piece of reading was fascinating in its own right, but put in concert with others from the syllabus, the material became even more dynamic and thought-provoking.",
    "This class introduced some big themes in the racial politics in the US. Primarily through a series of case studies the class dissected the various places in american politics that race and ethnicity are salient factors in shifting power dynamics and resource distribution. The course encouraged students to identify and critique the basic political theory that each of the authors proposed and to develop their own more comprehensive political theory of race in America.",
    "This course served as a wonderful foundation for the graduate study of race and ethnicity in politics. I was introduced to fascinating work that will certainly inform some of my future research."

   "comments": [
    "Excellent breadth and great student self-selection so great classroom discussions.",
    "This course was the strongest course of my semester. The syllabus seemed to flow perfectly and the response memos gave me opportunities to dig deeper into topics that I found particularly moving or provocative. Vesla's introductions of the material at the beginning of course helped us situate it in the broader discipline, while student introductions gave us the opportunity to hear our peers evaluate weekly assignments from their perspectives\/frames of reference. I also appreciated the pacing of our final assignment, including the submission of a topic proposal, literature review, and precis prior to submitting our final paper. My only piece of criticism is that I would have liked to receive feedback on our literature reviews and precis a bit earlier than we did. In particular, feedback on the precis would have helped me work out some of the kinks in my proposed research design earlier than later.",
    "Structured very well overallwould have liked to analyze a few ethnographic studies, so as to be able to compare their academic worth to other methodologies. Course discussions were spirited and eye-opening, material was fascinating, and written assignments well-structured and stimulating.",
    "The course was at times difficult to access for someone not already versed in american political theory. In addition some of the longer case study books were so detail specific that I struggled as a nonpolitical scientist to extrapolate from one case study to the american politic at large.",
    "Everything was really wonderful. Vesla is fantastic at facilitating discussion."

   "comments": [
    "Yes. It is an absolute necessity for any serious student of American politics.",
    "Yes, this was my favorite class at Yale to date.",
    "I would certainly recommend this course to another student. As I said previously, it is a well-paced and rich survey of the study of race and ethnicity in American politics. It encourages anyone interested in the study of American society to critically examine normative assumptions made by social scientists about what is truly important in the study of politics. Further, it encourages students to think differently about how we study political institutions and behavior by considering the instrumentality of race in shaping our institutions, ideals, and the political economy.",
    "Absolutelybut be prepared for an incredible amount of work. The reading material is all fascinating, and you will definitely reap the intellectual rewards should you put in the requisite time and effort. The course is wonderfully comprehensive, thought-provoking, and perspective-orienting; anyone seriously pursuing a career in social justice or race relations should consider it crucial to their academic experience.",
    "Yes I would recommend this course to someone looking to deepen their understanding of politics in the US, and someone trying to grasp how race is an organizing principle in American political life. You will benefit from learning specific details about incidents of political representation and non representation for certain groups. And mostly you will benefit from the broad theories developed around the influence of race and ethnicity in American politics.",
    "Absolutely! I've been recommending this course to everyone--in and out of the AP subfield!",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course"
