    "I became better acquainted with programs like Logic and Max.",
    "I learned about the history of music technology, advance some of my knowledge of harmonics\/frequencies, etc. Mostly just an interesting class to geek out on this stuff, I guess.",
    "Digital audio techniques (not practical, but general ideas of how they work). You will learn basics of Logic on your own",
    "Helps with understanding the fundamental tools used in electronic music from a historical perspective.",
    "History of electronic music, from the earliest synthesizers and recording equipment to modern DAWs; significant composers and works; analog and digital synthesis techniques; basics of the physics of sound and the theory of tuning\/harmony\/timbre.",
    "I was exposed to a wide variety of technological tools to augment my work as a composer. I also gained deep insights into the history of technology in music and was introduced to many devices, thought processes, and other technologies that I seldom even wondered about previously.",
    "I learned about the basic physics of time-domain and frequency-domain audio, learned how to use Logic at a fairly basic level.",
    "I learned to give all music and artistic expression a chance, because under the surface the mechanisms that are used to create experimental music can be really mindblowing.",
    "I took it because I had to for my major. The first half was really interesting, When we were learning about the human ear and acoustics and microphones. But When we started switching over to max and logic, at least for me (Im a Computing and the Arts major and have taken other Music tech classes) things became super repetitive and my level of engagement dropped. I wish we had kept learning more about the physics and the biology of sound, which was What I had signed up for and what I was excited about. I realize that there are a lot of non CPAR people in the class who probably enjoyed the second half more, but these are my two cents.(especially if it is a mandatory class for us)",
    "I learned the fundamentals of music technology which includes the physics behind sound waves, the history of who made the technology, and some music theory used as a basis for the development and logic behind such tech.",
    "Broad foundation for various aspects of music tech, inclusing DSP, DAW, and various music-historical threads",
    "I learned how to think about music and recording in an entirely new way. I learned about the techniques and technologies that have defined the sounds of different generations of musicians, and I gained some skills in computer music languages and DAWs.",
    "I gained a broad understanding of acoustics and the technologies that manipulate these acoustic and psychoacoustic principles.",
    "I learned about the history of music technology and the basics of how it works.",
    "I gained knowledge of the history of technical music.",
    "I deepened the knowledge of physics behind music and I feel really more aware of the electronic and digital tools that I can apply in order to make music. I feel grateful for the big improvement this course gave to my artistic career.",
    "I learned about the history of music technology and the science - specifically physics - behind sound and recording, as well as the basics of how to use tools like Logic Pro X.",
    "I developed some basic knowledge of the mathematical\/physical principles of sound waves and musical sounds (i.e., pitches and intervals), as well as the principles behind developments in music technology (tape machines, microphones, speakers, DAWs) in the last one hundred years. I also grew accustomed to listening to and responding to the experimental music that influential musicians have made using this technology.",

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I think a better step-to-step analysis of how the technology works would be helpful. Sometimes the lectures moved really quickly and glossed over some seemingly important concepts.",
    "Strengths were the interesting subject matter and classroom full of kids who are really geeky and into this topic. It was a very engaged room. Downside was the total disconnect between homework and lecture. Like, no connection at all. No examples in lecture. The homework had a lot of math. I guess it was just to check off the QR box but it was pretty annoying. The projects at the end of the semester were fun and hands on, but I don't know if it would've been fun for me if I hadn't had all my previous knowledge of how to use a DAW (logic).",
    "Strengths: Konrad is great. He knows so much about this area, does fantastic demos, and can answer almost any question thrown his way. Weaknesses: I wish more of the homeworks were projects. Its cool to make the things happen in your own hands.",
    "Strengths: Konrad's Max\/MSP demonstrations are incredible and they illuminate ideas in way that you couldn't find anywhere else. Weaknesses: Even though this is an intro course, if you don't already have experience with the topics that Konrad presents, then many of the lectures could be lost on you.",
    "Although the class was very engaging, it needed a bit more structure. The lesson plans were very clear, but I felt as if there was a neat thread tying all the concepts together, other than their presentation in chronological order. I often felt that I was searching for connections between topics. Nonetheless, the information that was presented was very clear, and the instructor and TFs were very helpful in digesting the various topics.",
    "I felt like the lectures were not very informative at all. The lectures were largely demonstrations using software programs. If you didn't already know how to use the software program, or didn't have background in the topic, these lectures would be completely meaningless. This unfortunately comprised a big proportion of the lectures. (The people I know who had background in computer music \/ music tech seemed to somewhat enjoy these lectures, because it was \"reminding\" them about a topic they already kinda knew, and showing a different angle. But for anyone else, it was incomprehensible.) I learned essentially everything for the course while studying for the exams. TAs were very helpful. The advantage of the course is that it is about a topic that is interesting. But I don't think this is an excuse for how it's taught.",
    "Strengths: You get to learn a lot about music that you probably wouldn't otherwise listen to or even know about unless you were already very into more experimental music. I learned how to expand my horizons and reserve judgment when it comes to artistic expression, because much of the music we listened to was not immediately appealing to me on the surface but I came to respect many of the pieces when I developed an understanding of what it took to make them. The structure of the class is a little strange to me. In lecture, Konrad talked about a lot of very detailed and deep technological concepts which we never really got to understand outside of just watching him do demos. This may be because I'm not a musician, but a lot of times the stuff he was doing in lecture was just totally foreign to me. The homeworks and labs were nots very structured either, so it was always a little confusing as to what was actually expected of me as a student.",
    "I wrote it in the question above",
    "weakness: it was hard to find resources. to fix it, more communication with students about grades, homework and etc. strengths: the variability of topics",
    "the only weakness of this course is the relationship of the lectures to the problem sets. as the course is the structured, the problem sets are almost exclusively addressed in section, and I think that it would be helpful to have actual computations modeled in class, not so that students avoid section but instead so that the interconnections\/sequencing of the material becomes more clear",
    "The course is thoroughly interesting, the professor is great, the TFs were wonderful, the content was interesting and accessible, and the work was reasonable. There were no glaring weaknesses in this course, but using the Grades feature on Canvas and releasing p-set solutions would have been helpful for studying for exams.",
    "The lectures were interesting, and the demos were fascinating. I loved section and found the homework very manageable. However, the readings were often extremely technical and I wish that there was some in-class or in-section discussing them.",
    "The course material was great but the assignments weren't very engaging and didn't leave much room for creativity.",
    "The course began with an engaging lecture format, but, following the first midterm, devolved into the professor playing with Max patches in front of us for the duration of the class (that were never shared with the class, to my knowledge). Although it was nice to see him have a good time while cutting up his vocals and creating strange sounds\/effects, Im not sure these latter classes were very conducive to learning. Additionally, the course dealt with a lot of rather complex topics, lacking the time to go into most in depth, which led to a rather surface examination of music technology as a whole. A good example of this was the ID section on the two midterms, where as long as you regurgitated a key phrase relating to the listed word, you received full credit. I think the course could be strengthened by reducing the amount of topics, and doing deeper examinations of whats left.",
    "I think I would've learned more with more emphasis on practical skills, i.e. mixing demos in lab (instead of doing course homework). That way, we could've gotten more familiar with the technology itself.",
    "More clarity on expectations and goals would be really helpful - it felt to me that the format of the midterms was somewhat of a surprise both times, which made it more difficult to get much of value from studying; this was especially true given that the content felt somewhat disjointed, even for a survey - for instance, a great deal of time was spent discussing history, but this was not particularly represented in the work that students were expected to do; the lack of work requiring synthesis of historical information from lectures diminished the value of that aspect of the course. There were also some surprises in the problem sets - for instance, the musique concrete assignment, while it was valuable to do, there was only really a week between when it was clear what we were supposed to do and when it was due, which was not really enough time to thoughtfully compose (especially given that a short time span doesn't allow flexibility in balancing such work with work from other classes). I wasn't really sure what the purpose of section was - the sections where we shared our musique concrete pieces or did some simple things with Max or Logic seemed useful, but the majority of section seemed like office hours, which was not helpful to have as a mandatory commitment of time. I think that this is would be a really important area for improvement - the class would have been much stronger with more hands-on work, which certainly could have been accomplished in section. This is especially true given that a lot of time was devoted to logarithms, which, while not unimportant, doesn't really seem like it should bear so much of the weight of the course. I thought that the most interesting parts of the course were when it discussed creative practices explicitly - in particular, when looking at modern and historical songs in terms of what processes and tools were used for artistic effect.",
    "The course is very demanding with homework every week which require many hours of work but is the only way to manage the amount of information covered by the course. Everything is explained in an engaging manner and the subject is extremely interesting. There is a lot of math that might be scarying at the first sight but with the help of the teacher and the TAs is possible to manage it.",
    "The strengths lay in how interdisciplinary the course was, although that could also be seen as a possible weakness, as it jumped from topic to topic, though not before covering it in great detail.",
    "Professor Kaczmarek always kept the lectures very full, so there was a lot of content to think about. His explanations of mathematical and physical concepts were generally easy for me to follow. I personally was already interested in this area of music before I enrolled in the class, so I found most of the discussions of music and creativity easily accessible, but I am sure there were some students found the music pretty opaque. Professor Kaczmarek always has a good sense of humor about experimentalism, but I would have liked if we had spent more time talking seriously about the merits of this music, and the reasons we should be interested in studying it. I already had some ideas of my own about that, but some students who have never taken music classes before might not have felt like all this history was relevant to their interests. In general I wish we could have spent more time thinking about the aesthetics of the music itself instead of just positioning each piece in a historical timeline (e.g., students could respond after listening and discuss why the did or did not like the piece). There were several times we listened to a string of pieces during lecture, and afterward some students might have asked questions about how the piece was created, but I rarely heard anyone (Professor Kaczmarek, the TAs, or students) say anything about what they thought about the merits of the piece. I think prompting students to respond to the music in a personal way could help make this course material feel more relevant for students who don't have any experience in this area. I also thought I could have learned a lot more if we had had more project-based assignments. I really enjoyed working on the musique concrete project, the Logic remix project, and my final project, and I wish I had gotten more opportunities to talk about those experiences with my classmates in our lab section. In general, I thought our lab section was a bit too lax and we could have learned a lot more if we spent time digging into Logic, Max, or Audacity. I was already interested in working on digital audio projects before I enrolled in the class, and I would have happily taken on more assignments (or more challenging\/more specific assignments) of that kind. I am also most interested in the creative side of this subject area (rather than the historical or scientific sides) so I would have loved to get some more serious experience working on creative projects of my own using this technology. I understand that the course was designed to be accessible for students who don't have any experience working on recorded music or digital audio, but I wish there were some more serious academic spaces to do work in that area at Yale.",
    "The course is well-taught and there's a lot to see and hear, but there is not much student participation enforced. Which can be both a blessing and a curse. The TAs were phenomenal. I also wish we used Logic Pro or Ableton Live a bit more."

   "comments": [
    "I highly recommend this to music majors, especially if you need a good QR. I think most people in music would benefit from understanding these technologies, whether or not you make electronic music.",
    "Yes, if you want a good SC or QR credit and enjoy music tech. It's not the most practical class, really, but helps you with listening and thinking about how music tech has progressed. Prof. K. is really into the more computer\/amelodic stuff\/musique concrete so there are weeks where you don't hear a single melody or harmony. But it's a good course, the lectures are interesting, and Professor is pretty funny.",
    "Recommended if you are interested in experimental and abstract music and techniques behind them. You will also learn about many digital audio techniques and what they do, but not really how to use them. NOT recommended if you are looking to learn how to produce music",
    "Any musician interested in electronic\/experimental music should take it. It exposes you to the tools and history of the genre",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to anyone with an interest in electronic music. Having already known a good amount on the subject, I found this course to be a good solidification of concepts. Konrad's slow, soft-spoken lecture style makes some moments drag on, but his illuminating Max demonstrations make up for this.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. It balanced both enjoyment and learning and definitely aided me in seeing music from a different point of view.",
    "No. If you need to learn about music tech then it is your only basic option. But you will only learn a small amount, and most of the lectures are not well taught.",
    "I would probably not recommend the class to a non-music student, or to somebody with very limited musical knowledge. I don't have much music knowledge at all and sometimes I felt in over my head, but then the problem sets and tests were easier than I would have thought given how confused I felt for a lot of the semester.",
    "I would, Konrad is great",
    "No, it is problematic finding the resources to learn the materials well enough outside of a weekly 50 minute TA meeting because not all of the math is covered in class.",
    "I would recommend this course to students who enjoy listening to music they are unfamiliar with. If you are not curious about the hows and whys of music this course may not entice you, but I think that Professor Kaczmarek does a good job iof making the more avant-garde topics of the course engaging even for those who are not aesthetically partial to them",
    "I would recommend this course to any students interested in learning about music production. Even if a student knows how to use a DAW and has a good handle on production techniques, this course would still be valuable, since the emphasis on the science and math behind the music is interesting and illuminating.",
    "Yes! Konrad is awesome, and youll learn a lot.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student who is curious about the history of music technology.",
    "I would recommend the course to someone who already knows something about editing\/mixing softwares. That way, they'll appreciate the content more.",
    "Yes! I really enjoyed how much I learned through the course, and the material was truly fascinating. I felt like I emerged with not only all this knowledge, but a newfound skillset.",
    "I would recommend this course to students who are interested in a survey of some principles of acoustics and physics, or a survey of the history of music technology in the Twentieth Century. But for students interested in seriously digging into any of these subject areas, I didn't think this course facilitated very much of that.",
    "Yes! If you want to learn the history of electronic music, definitely take this! I took it because I wanted to make electronic music, and although you don't for most of the time, towards the end of the course you get to make your own song\/remixes in Ableton Live or Logic Pro. A really fun and creative time. The weekly homework is done at a 45 minute to hour long section which turned out to be an office hours where the TA helps you do the homework. Pretty great. There are two midterms though, but you'll get a terms review sheet for each one beforehand. Just make sure you take some decent notes or to go to one of the TAs' review sessions. Really fun course!"
