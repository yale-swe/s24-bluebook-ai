    "This is a VERY BASIC introduction to calculus. Take this class if you have no prior calculus experience, or if you sat in on 115 and feel you need a bit more preparation. This class is very easy if you have already taken AB in high school. I honestly feel like it hasn't really prepared me for 115 (which I decided to postpone because it seems MUCH more difficult than the calculus I covered in high school, and after taking this course, MUCH more difficult that 112). So be warned. This class is easy and boring if you know the material well. Take it if you really need a refresher, you don't want to take multivariable\/stat but need a year of math, or if you are scared of 115.",
    "I would definitely recomment Mathematics 112 to fellow students. The workload was rather light (especially for students, such as myself, who have been introduced to Calculus prior to taking Mathematics 112). The tests are a bit difficult; however, grades are curved, and they are certainly do-able.",
    "Basic course, starts with defining a function and telling us how to graph a straight line. Not difficult, but if you don't have a good teacher it can be a really unenjoyable class.",
    "No. I would not recommend this course to anyone. Because is really hard and the subject does not interest me.",
    "Good class. Weekly homeworks. Three exams."
