   "comments": [
    "It's a very interesting class, but somewhat disorganized. You cover a wide array of topics without too much detail, but get a nice understanding of the big picture. If you are at all intrigued by environmental history and have little or no prior knowledge about it, I'd definitely recommend this course.",
    "good class with interesting material but Weiss is very disorganized making hw hard to follow. the hw is based on what lecture he is giving but often times its not clear which lecture he is on and also he seems to get off topic a lot but then at the very last second some of his off topic stories are relevant and then you're typing furiously to summarize what he has just said",
    "I would highly recommend this class. It would be hard to find a professor more passionate and enthusiastic than Harvey Weiss. You will come out with a wide range of information learned, and it does not require much work, so you can focus on learning and enjoying the material instead of memorizing facts (it is more about concept understanding and application).",
    "If you go to lecture everyday and pay attention it is not too difficult to grasp the material however, if you miss class you will be completely lost. People either love or hate Professor Weiss; I happened to love him. He truly is an expert in his field and his personality and passion made the 9am lecture enjoyable.",
    "This is a fantastic exploration, incorporating the very latest research, of human response to climatic change from prehistory to the present. I would highly recommend this to any student the least bit interested in Environmental Studies.",
    "A good credit\/d\/f class for those interested in the history of human kind and the environment. Totally interesting, but Weiss' eccentric way of lecturing makes it hard to take the class really seriously.",
    "Do not take this class. By far the worst class I have taken at Yale. Not hard but I learned almost nothing and the professor was so difficult to deal with. It is one of the requirements for EVST, but take a different class in the group like Sabin's class. It is worth doing more work to actually learn something and not deal with a scatterbrained professor.",
    "The description of this class sounds awesome - how society developed through the ages, what role the environment may have played, etc. But the class itself - not so awesome. I frequently left class having no idea what I was supposed to have learned, having taken one or two sentences of notes over the full 75 minute period just because there was that little to learn. I am fairly sure all the material we covered could be covered in 4 or5 lectures, but it was stretched out over the full semester. This class is not a lot of work at all - just some readings (Professor Weiss frequently says are too hard for us or otherwise not worth doing), one short paper, a midterm, and an exam.Don't take this class unless you literally want just a credit and don't care about learning. Also do not take this class, seriously, unless you're totally okay with very loose structure and don't need to have a sense of what you're supposed to be learning. Also don't get confused and think that because there are few people in the class this is a seminar - this is NOT a seminar. It is a lecture that just happens to have a small audience.Professor Weiss has very extreme opinions and not much filter, but he is a good guy.",
    "EVST 226 was a fantastic class, probably one of my favorites so far at Yale. Professor Weiss is brilliant and funny, and I enjoyed attending and listening to his lectures. While at first the class might seem unorganized, and it might be unclear what should be studied for midterms. If you attend review sessions and lectures prior to the exams, things will be cleared up and there will be no questions what material will be covered on the exam. I highly recommend this class.",
    "This is definitely one of the most interesting classes I've taken so far. The lectures aren't super structured, but if you pay close attention, you will learn a lot about major events in global environmental history. Furthermore, the workload of the class is some of the lightest of any course that I've taken here so far.",
    "EVST 226 has a midterm, a short final paper, and a final exam. The lectures are hard to follow, and it is very difficult to get to the bottom of what he is talking about. Things come together when studying for the exams, but I would not recommend the course.",
    "I would not recommend this class to another student because it is so disorganized. The structure of this class made lectures and studying very frustrating.",
    "I would recommend the course if you are particularly interested in environmental history.",
