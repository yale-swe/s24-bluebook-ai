    "This is a great class to take to maintain your Spanish skills. The work load isn't too great, but there are a lot of graded tasks throughout the semester. The material covered is interesting and always ensures that the conversation flows during the whole hour. The best part of this class is B\u00e1rbara. She is an incredible instructor and never fails to make the class interesting. You will have a lot of fun with her as well as learning so much from her!",
    "Everything in Spanish, often time-consuming homework, rewarding discussions. Recommended to a student who wants to take their Spanish speaking to a higher level after attaining a firm grasp of the language and Spanish grammar.",
    "This class is a good class to solidify your speaking skills. Grammar wise, Safille teaches a lot. I don't know about other profs.",
    "If you have to fulfill the language requirement, this is the class to take.",
    "I would recommend this to satisfy any L5 course. The workload is steady and you are always doing something but in comparison to other L5 courses besides maybe grammar you will get a lot out of it.",
    "You practice speaking and Spanish skills",
    "Spanish 105 is a great course that enables students to practice speaking Spanish so as to allow for development of their conversational abilities. I would highly recommend this course to any student that desires to work towards the development of their Spanish speaking abilities.",
    "Yes, recommended. However, if you don't like talking much in class or generating your own ideas about the topics being taught you should consider another class.",
    "I would recommend this class because it's not terribly demanding\u0097it requires significantly less work that L4 Spanish\u0097but it helped me make major progress in my Spanish. My speaking is much more fluent and clear, my vocabulary has grown, I have better knowledge of Spanish idioms, and I feel energized to continue my study of Spanish. It's a shame that difficult grammar concepts are not emphasized in this class, because I do feel I've forgotten somethings, but the time dedicated in the course to open conversation was very valuable. Take the class, and take it with Safille!",
    "it didnt really improve my spanish too much, but it did some. the readings were difficult, i thought, but not necessary always. its annoying to feel like you are being graded based on what should be a natural, free-flowing conversation in class."
