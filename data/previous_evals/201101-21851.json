    "Take this class, but don't assume it's a gut. Professor Prum gives enthusiastic, knowledgable lectures about ornithology, but the midterms proved quite difficult, with relatively difficult grading. You will really enjoy it though, nevertheless, and will learn so much. Take it with the lab for maximum effect (I liked the lab more than the lecture, honestly).",
    "Ornithology is an INCREDIBLE class - for science majors and non-science majors alike. Professor Prum is one of the most incredible lecturers I've had at Yale - he will make you care about birds, even if you didn't before taking the class. TAKE IT TAKE IT TAKE IT. You won't regret it.",
    "This is a great bio course to take if you're interested in birds or want to get an interesting science credit. It's really not that easy, with three fairly tricky tests and then one research paper 10-20 pages in length. Prof Plum is an expert in the field and makes everyone excited about birds. At times the class can be off putting because of the overly keen bird watching questions some students ask and the fact that all of the seats fill up at least 5 mins before class even begins, but once you set that aside, it's great.",
    "Take it--you'll find yourself talking about it all the time to your non-Ornithology friends. You'll never look at birds in the same way. That said, if you are not a biology person, get ready to dive in. Words like meiosis, organelle, follicle, and hydrocarbon chain do get thrown around. You'll figure it out.It's not easy, but I would do it again in a second. This is what the distributional requirement is all about.",
    "Imagine all the science classes that don't have prerequisites and are open to non-science majors. Now imagine the tiny fraction of those classes that are worth your time, and in which you will actually learn. Ornithology is one of these! Even if you have little or no science background going in, Rick Prum explains the material very clearly and it was always possible for me (no science background at all, not even AP science in high school) to follow.I would recommend Ornithology either as an elective for ascience major, or for SC credit. For non-science majors: be aware that the workload is substantial - 2 difficult midterms, a 20-page research paper, and a final (same length and difficulty as the midterms). You need to take good notes, review, and read the book - this is not a gut.",
    "This is a great class for science and humanities. Just rigorous enough that it remains interesting but never inundating.",
    "BIRDS. All the time. This is just a really great class, particularly for people who want a legit science credit. I took the class because I wanted a good bio class and not because I needed a science credit, which probably put me in the minority among the students there, but Professor Prum didn't compromise on the level of information he gave us just because a lot of non-science majors were taking the course. Ornithology provides a rigorous but totally reasonable introduction to the major concepts in bird biology (it's NOT about learning all of the different families of birds\u0096\u0096that's the separate lab course that only a few people take). You get everything from paleontology to bird feathers to breeding systems, all in a great deal of detail. There's not much work most of the time, just a lot of studying before the two midterms and the final, and a lot of work as you're writing your paper. The midterms are long for a 50-minute test, so you have to rush a bit, but the midterms and the final (which this year at least was the same length as the midterms but we got a full 3 hours to do it) are each worth only about 22% of the grade. The paper is 10-20 pages (huge range, right?) and can be on anything you want, but it's a real scientific lit review paper, so be prepared to look up a lot of scientific journal articles and synthesize them. Professor Prum makes the class. He's really enthusiastic about birds, which is really necessary when you've had to walk up to Sachem Street at 9:25am three times a week. He doesn't always get back to you that quickly when you email him\u0096\u0096the TFs do a great job of getting back to you\u0096\u0096but if you talk to him after class he'll help you out. I find that I notice birds on the street a lot more now, and I actually care about them a lot more, which is a testament to how good the class is. Not offered again until spring 2013, but when it is, TAKE IT!",
    "Excellent. Even if you don't have any interest in birds, Prum makes the material fascinating and tangible, it's really fun.",
    "A great class if you are willing to do the work. I took it as a non-science major with no biology background since 10th grade and found it doable. It does take a fair amount of studying for the test. And the final paper plus final exam combo is kind of obnoxious. Professor Prum is a very fun lecturer, and the material is more interesting than the title might cause you to think.",
    "A must take at Yale. I would absolutely recommend this course. If you want a class that will having you walking and talking facts about a very palpable science (look outside--there are birds everywhere!), Ornithology is totally for you. Not a huge amount of work either. Three exams (final is equally weighted with the two midterms) and a 10-20 page final paper. Take it. You won't regret it.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. Birds are really fascinating creatures so there is never a dull moment.",
    "BEST CLASS I'VE TAKEN AT YALE. Professor Prum, a huge deal in ornithology and evo bio in general, is passionate, funny, and just all-around amazing. You don't even have to like birds that much to like the class. If you stay engaged during lecture (easy b\/c they're so great, hard b\/c of the time), take good notes and learn them well you'll do fine on the tests. Start on your paper early, too! If you're looking for a science credit I'd go for this; it's not a \"for science major class\" but if you've had some bio none of it is too conceptually difficult.",
    "A course on birds, not specific birds, their habits and recognising them, not on bird ecology. Very interesting and informative. I took it for a science credit and am a humanities major with little science experience. Now, I love and understand birds more than I ever could have otherwise. It was very tough, but do-able \u0097 if you want to learn about birds, here is the place!",
    "Ornithology is a very interesting class and I would recommend it to everybody who would like to fulfill the science credit with an intense but rewarding lecture course. It's definitely not a joke class: 3 exams and one long research paper in addition to three lectures per week requires commitment. But the material is very diverse: ranging from anatomy, evolutionary biology, behavioral biology, to topics from physics, and chemistry. The perspective on nature and its beauty is fascinating so that it is definitely worth the work.",
    "If you are interested in birds, you will absolutely love this class. Even if you aren't, you will probably love this class. All you need to know for the tests is the material in the lectures; you don't haveto read the book to do well. Professor Prum will keep you awake with his enthusiasm at 9:30 am. You will learn tons and tons of information about birds and will be humbled and amazed by birds if you are not already.",
    "EEB 272 is not a gut, and I highly recommend students suet hard for the first midterm, which caught me off guard. That warning aside, I loved the class, enjoyed the material, and now know far ore about birds thn previously.",
    "It's a great class, and a great way to learn about all different topics in science (anatomy, animal behavior, physics, evolution, chemistry) through the lens of birds. You might not think that birds are interesting before taking the class, but you will soon find yourselves walking down the street, seeing a bird and thinking \"hey, I know all about that now!\" which is pretty exciting.",
    "Take it! It's a fascinating subject, and you'll come away learning a lot of cool new things. Non-science majors shouldn't be scared away, but it's no gut class either.",
    "If you're interested in general bird biology, take the lecture. If you're more interested in biodiversity, take the lab.",
    "Ornithology is a great course, and I would definitely recommend it to anyone.",
    "Great class for anyone who wants to fulfill a science credit without taking a gut. Be prepared to get up early to go to every lecture though - large portion of the material covered in class is not in the book. Research paper was not terrible to write. Professor Prum is a great professor.",
    "It's a decent science class, but it is not easy. I repeat: IT IS NOT EASY!!! You have to be really interested in birds, and the science of birds specifically.",
    "Although this class might seem wildly specific (almost to a fault), the broader biological and evolutionary perspectives make the course worthwhile. Lectures themselves were strong and focused - a good balance between \"big picture\" concepts and random, interesting specifics. Especially for non-science majors, a great choice - not a joke, but certainly not overwhelming. Cocktail party facts for the rest of your life and no problem sets!",
    "Prum really knows his stuff. In lecture, he can be hard to follow because he speaks rapidly, trying to cover all the material he knows. You learn a lot in the class, and will find yourself telling your friends facts about birds. Though the class isn't being offered next year, take it the following year if you have the chance. Also, start to work on the paper early. I wrote it during reading week and it wasn't the most pleasant experience.",
    "I would definitely recommend Ornithology, especially if you're not a \"science person.\" The material is very approachable and interesting, and the professor is clearly dedicated to the subject. Now when I look at birds, I think of all the fascinating stuff I learned aboutthem!",
    "This course was so AMAZING that it has inspired me to compose a brief series of haikus.Richard Prum: da man.His bird knowledge? Unsurpassed.Engaging lectures.OrnithologyThat word is five syllablesThat IS convenient.Discover the birds!They're avian dinosaursAs you will soon learnFrom feathers to nestsTrust me, you will know it allAND you'll have some funFor science credit:The best option in the land?Ornithology.At 9 AM, butHilarious anecdotesWill keep you awakeIt's ZUGUNRUHE!It's the catastrophic molt!Mysteries of birds...All will be revealed.Two midterms, and one finalAll are very fair.There is a paperBut the TAs will help you.And you chooses topic.OrnithologyListen, folks, just take this course.Ornithology.",
    "Quite possibly the best, most well-taught biology class at yale. If you choose an interesting paper topic, it will hardly feel like work. Each lecture is a treat that I wouldn't dream of missing!",
    "This is a very good class to take, especially if you are interested in the biological sciences or birds in general. Even if you are not a science-oriented person, it is a very interesting class, though you might need to put in a little extra time getting help or working through some of the concepts. Overall, though, it's easy to follow, even though the information is not surface information and is interesting and relevant.",
    "Take this class! You will not regret it! Professor Prum is amazing and I have learned so much from him. You do not need to have a strong science background to do well, but this class does require some work. I would absolutely recommend this class to both non-science and science majors. It is most definitely worth the walk up science hill."
