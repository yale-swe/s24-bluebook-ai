   "comments": [
    "Learned more about panel data, nonparametric\/parametric estimation methods. Good if you want to go beyond OLS.",
    "We did a very useful review of the asymptotic theory of ordinary least squares and instrumental variables. The best new material was panel data, non-parametric methods, and maximum likelihood estimation.",
    "I learned about a lot of different ways to model data that I probably wouldn't have ever learned outside of a graduate school econometrics sequence.",
    "This course introduced to many key econometrics concepts and methods. In pairing the course materials with the mid-semester and final projects, I was able to see how the concepts we were learning about in class are applied and expanded upon in practice.",
    "I learned a lot more econometric techniques than I had ever even heard about in my life, and also learned a lot of the mathematical background to these techniques. I really got better at following econometrics mathematically, and thinking critically about how to do things different when reading papers."

   "comments": [
    "Great, fairly chill course that teaches you that OLS is not the only estimation method out there. Interesting material, intimate learning environment - no complaints.",
    "I thought the assignments had a good balance between theory and applications. The title is somewhat misleading though - I might just drop the \"applied\" since the course does not lean toward applications.",
    "I wish we could've looked at more papers. The presentations were very interesting and it would've been cool to see how these techniques get applied a little more.",
    "I really enjoyed this class and thought it had several strengths. First, the course covered a wide breadth of material so as to introduce us to a variety of concepts. Second, the mathematical rigor with which these concepts were taught was helpful to me both to understand the concepts and to continue to develop my math skills. Third, the projects and presentations were a helpful way for me to reinforce the concepts that were taught in class. I think the course could have been improved if there were more assignments similar to the paper\/projects - for example, if at the end of every concept unit students were assigned to read a paper and look at the code for data analysis.",
    "It's a really good class but some topics could have been moved from the second half to the first half.",
    "I think the strength is the breadth of topics covered and the mathematical aspect of it. As for weaknesses, I think that sometimes I wished that we had gone slightly slower and covered some techniques more in detail, or had gone through more examples of different types of techniques and how to actually implement them with real data. I also wished that we had gotten more feedback on our papers and presentations, as how we actually did on those are still a mystery as of now. It would've been helpful to get feedback from the first paper before the second paper. Other than that, it was a great class."

    "Great, fairly chill course that teaches you that OLS is not the only estimation method out there. Good for those that want to explore econometrics more in-depth. Interesting material, intimate learning environment - no complaints.",
    "A natural extension of Econ 135\/Econ 136. This course will help you in reading and writing economics papers, whether in a senior seminar or in your own senior essay. I am a more confident econometrician for having taken it, so you should too! The courseload is reasonable: there are weekly problem sets (which generally don't take more than 3-4 hours), two papers in which you replicate and test the robustness of famous economics journal articles, and a final exam. No midterm. A low stress experience.",
    "I'd recommend the class. You'll learn cool ways to work with data that probably won't be taught anywhere else in the undergrad sphere, at least outside of pretty high-level statistics classes.",
    "I would recommend this course to someone who enjoyed the introductory level econometrics courses and would like to learn more about econometrics",
    "I strongly recommend this to anyone who wants to do any type of empirically related work in the future. Sometimes, this class is teeth-pullingly painful because it's a lot of information and hard to digest it all, but the things that you learn are so good and important, and the skills are so useful, that it's definitely worth your time. Sometimes, you'll even learn about a technique and go \"Oooh, that was really clever\", which is such a lovely feeling. Take it and spend a lot of time on it to really get the most out of it. Don't take it if you're a lazy econ major who just needs a senior seminar."
