    "I would recommend this class for anyone who needs a science credit. The material is easy to read and as long as you do the problem sets the exams are easy.",
    "A course on ancient astronomical systems and cultures. If you are interested in these things, take the course. If not, the @#$^ off.",
    "This is a great science credit! It's an interesting topic and you really do learn something about basic astronomy. It's not a gut, but it's not very difficult and Professor Faison is always available to help with the problem sets. I highly recommend this course to a humanities major who wants a science credit that will actually teach you something.",
    "You should take this class, whatever knowledge you have of astronomy. The problem sets are interesting but straightforward, lecture is fun and the atmosphere is very laid-back.For the first third of the class, you learn the history of naked-eye astronomy, which means you also learn the mechanics of astronomy: how to refer to objects in the sky in different coordinate systems, how things move around the earth, when different objects should rise and set and what they should look like. The history aspect is interesting too; there's a lot more to the story than Ptolemy and Copernicus.Then you delve into archaeoastronomy, which means analyzing cultures todetermine what astronomical significance their relics or monuments may have. You look at a lot of rituals and buildings, which gets a bit repetitive but makes use of the astronomy you just learned.The class definitely strengthens your intuitive understanding of the motions of the sun\/moon\/stars. You'll find yourself noticing where and when the moon and planets rise and set and which constellations are above the horizon, which is fun.",
    "Great science credit. I learned a lot but it didn't take up too much of my time.",
    "Interesting astronomy course, especially if you're interested in studying ancient civilizations.",
    "This is an interesting and well taught course. To do well in it you will have to attend all of the lectures and do all of the problem sets. There is one problem set each week and two mid-terms. The problem sets are 30% of the grade and will take a few hours each to complete. They are all interesting.",
    "Astronomy 135 is basically a humanities credit that somehow got hijacked into a science credit.",
    "It's a difficult course. Don't snooze off in lecture!",
    "In the first half of the class, we learned about the current scientific understanding of astronomy. By the end of this section of class, we had a good understanding of pretty much every common astronomical phenomenon, at least that can be observed with the naked eye. With this foundation, we then went on to learn how different ancient cultures perceived the sky, and how it affected their civilization.I would definitely recommend this course. There is a reasonable amount work to be done -- be prepared to spend a few hours a week on problem sets, plus a few additional things like observing exercises, exams, and a paper. But in the end, I think it's all well worth it.",
    "General course on naked-eye astronomy with a healthy dose of anthropology. Good for a science credit if you're not up for bio\/chem\/physics but be warned - the class is probably harder than you think. The midterms and psets can be quite tricky, although it's nice to have a short final paper (6-8 pages) instead of an actual final.",
    "An interesting, broad introduction to naked-eye astronomy from around the world. Learned how to use an astrolabe, how to determine latitude and longitude, talked about Stonehenge (everyone loves Stonehenge), talked about calendars and architectural alignments. Prof. Faison is an engaging lecturer, the material is cool \u00e2\u0080\u0094 take it if you're interested.",
    "Astronomy 135 can be thought of as divided into two main sections. In the first part of the course, you learn the basic concepts of classical astronomy, including the movement of celestial objects in the sky and how these movements are observed and recorded. The idea is that this part of the course prepares you to understand the archaeoastronomy in the second part, but this first part was actually the most memorable and enjoyable for me. This first part of the course is when you finally learn (if you did not know already) what causes the moon phases, what things like equinoxes and solstices are, etc - all those things that are cool to know when you go outside to observe the night sky! In the second part of the course, you focus on archaeoastronomy, and examine how ancient cultures (including the Babylonians, Greeks, Romans, Muslims, Mayans, and Inca) thought of and studied the sky, and how their ideas are recorded in ancient archaeological ruins. While this second part of the course moves quickly and is really just a survey of many different cultures and histories, it presents some interesting ideas that you may want to go back and explore on your own. Thankfully, you have an opportunity for this further exploration in the final paper of the course; instead of an exam, you get to complete a library research paper on any topic within archaeoastronomy that you choose! This paper gives you a chance to go back in more detail to explore a topic that the course syllabus just touched upon. All that said, I would definitely recommend this course to a fellow student, especially to a humanities student like myself who is a little intimidated by math and science. The ideas covered in this class are comprehensible, Prof. Faison is really engaging andaccessible, and you may be surprised to find that astronomy is so relevant to history and world cultures."
