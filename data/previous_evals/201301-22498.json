    "Close analysis is not my favorite part of film studies coursework or practice, but it is an incredibly useful tool to rely on to help bolster more creative\/high level analysis or to tease out additional talking points - both through disassembly of a work into the smallest components possible.A must for film majors, and a useful transferrable technique for anyone making written arguments, though the means of deconstruction change greatly across different media, and require additional background.This is also a plus of the course as directed this semester - among the regular screenings and discussions, we also visited the Yale University Art Gallery, and discussed various non-film art forms produced by filmmakers. By contrasting media in this way, it was easier to understand the similar and unique qualities the conceptualization of film bears with other forms. Somewhat like finally understanding the difference between directing or acting for stage and camera.",
    "As a film studies major, you don't really have a choice. And as a non-film studies major, there's a really good chance you won't get in the class in the first place.That being said, JD is a great lecturer and will make a rather theory-heavy class enjoyable. He knows a lot about film and will make seminars engaging and humorous. I was expecting a boring class, but I actually enjoyed the movies and the discussions every week.However, some readings are just nuts. Absolutely insane. Gary-Busey-on-Celebrity-Apprentice levels of \"what the hell is he talking about?\" If you can drudge through those readings, you'll find some real gems and walk away from the class knowing how to analyze film.",
    "If you're reading this evaluation, it's probably the case that J.D. is teaching the class this year - so take it now if you have the chance. J.D. is incredibly cool and a great teacher, and turns what could be an unexciting, nuts-and-bolts course into something that's thoroughly engaging and enjoyable. The workload is moderate for a seminar: screenings and readings are well-selected, and the paper assignments are entirely manageable and even fun to write, if you're into that sort of thing.",
    "The screening list was well-rounded and the readings diverse. It's oddly not a survey course (too in-depth), yet not focused enough to get a great idea of any one approach to film--but I am much more confident in my film analysis, having been exposed to so many approaches. JD is the best. Take any class he teaches.",
    "Only take this class for two reasons.1) For the Film Studies major2) To learn how to make film still charts to better analyze film.The films are diverse but boring.",
    "This class goes really in depth into film studies. The films are interesting but after reviewing a film viewed for one day, there is no follow up. I find that this class is really geared towards those who are definitely majorig in film studies.",
    "Absolutely. Film 320 is the perfect class for understanding some basic yet essential elements that go into filmmaker.",
    "Take this class. It's incredible. JD is the best professor."
