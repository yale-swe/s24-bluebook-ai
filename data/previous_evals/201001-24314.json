   "comments": [
    "Great class if you're interested in economic history. Also good for an econ major looking to pick up a little history, or a history major looking to dip his toe into econ.",
    "3 Papers. Light workload especially Cr\/D. Not the most riveting material out there.",
    "Yeah",
    "course about the ancient economy, a relatively new field [economic history of rome\/greece]. pretty sketchy unless you want to major in classics.",
    "Take it if you like econ and history.",
    "Not that much of a gut.",
    "Course is not a lot of work and the lectures are interesting, but the class is disorganized.",
    "This is a great course for history majors, or those who enjoy writing papers over taking tests in huge history lectures. The syllabus was straightforward yet provided flexibility to write about what interested us in particular. The first paper was graded harshly but Manning was always available to discuss our papers with us.",
    "If you have any interest in economic history, take this course. If not, don't. I can't see this course being inspiring for someone who isn't already interested in the subject matter.",
    "I would recommend it in the hope that the second time around, the course would be a little better organized, but I think it does a great job of making methodological challenges clear to students.",
    "Don't take it, its boring and you won't learn anything and the papers are completely arbitrary.",
    "Provides an in-depth look at the ancient economy of the Roman Empire and the reasons for the absence of an economic take-off. I would recommend it if you are interested in classical civilizations but it should not be taken as an Economics class.",
    "Yes, but you must be engaged. You get out of the class what you put into it.",
    "This is the worst course I have ever taken for two reasons: (1) lectures were repetitive and rambling (2) the material was repetitive. Everything seemed to point to the fact that we cannot really learn anything about the ancient economy because of the lack of information. I rarely went to class not surprisingly after I realized these things -- this happened after the second lecture. What a complete waste. You may think it will be slightly interesting or even no work, but think again about spending a credit on such a bad course.",
    "Yes I would. It's an easy humanities class (if you need the credit). It's not too much work and it's fairly interesting. The papers aren't too difficult to write. The Professor is great, so if he's teaching a seminar I'd recommend it.",
    "This was an easy class to do acceptably in. The material wasn't pushed into us hard enough.",
    "I would not recommend ancient economy to another student. Professor Manning is a dynamic lecture, but the material itself is very dry. There isn't a ton of work, but it is graded very harshly and it is almost impossible to get an A. Look for a better history class.",
    "Really interesting class, especially for econ majors. Although not having an econ background does not really hurt, knowing some terms and concepts can be helpful. Great readings. This class is a great way to get introduced to a not that well-know but exciting field of history.",
    "Not too much work, but also not terribly interesting",
    "Absolutely not. This course is awful. Perhaps as a gut if you can handle the repetition and extreme boredom that accompany this course. Very disorganized and repetitive. Without substantial changes this course shouldn't run. You don't come away with an understanding of the ancient economies. You also write essentially the same paper three times. The course focuses too much on Finley.",
    "I would recommend The Ancient Economy if you're really interested in the subject. Otherwise, it might seem kind of pointless\/",
    "The Ancient Economy is heavy on broad ideasand light on details. We ended up with a sketch of the ancient economy. Truthfully, at least half the class did not show up to lecture, and those people probably were able to do just as well in the course. The papers were actually really interesting. Professor Manning is a great guy, but his lectures will seem repetitive.Overall, I would say this was not the most entertaining class, but not very hard at all.",
    "3 papers... was a new class but I'd recommend it. The lectures get sort of slow, but I think Manning will improve on the course as a whole next year",
    "Only take if you need a easy\/boring class. there wasnt much work. there are definitely more intriguing classes",
    "Good class with not much work, take it.",
    "I would recommend it. Despite somewhat dry material Professor Manning is great."
