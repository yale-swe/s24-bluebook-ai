    "CHEM 565 is an excellent course that is fun, low stress, but extremely interesting. This is a rare opportunity to learn a unique skill with a very knowledgable instructor and I would definitely recommend taking it. To get the most out of the course, I would recommend setting aside time directly after the class or throughout the week to come in and practice some of the techniques. They are a bit hard to get right if you only are able to practice during class.",
    "Glassblowing is an extraordinary course, one of the best at Yale. Learning how to engage with a spectacular material, with a truly fantastic instructor, has been a highlight of my Yale education. When one project breaks, what should one do? Make another. A great motto for glassblowing, a great motto for life. Glassblowing with Daryl is not just a phenomenal course in how to approach engaging with glass, but how to approach engaging with life. Daryl is an absolutely incredible instructor. He could not be more skilled at his craft, and could not love what he does more. He loves to share glassblowing with his students, and could not be any more adept at instructing and guiding students in the craft. One of the best people at Yale."
