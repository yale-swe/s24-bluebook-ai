   "comments": [
    "A great math class with plenty of resources for help. It applies calculus and different math models to areas of research. Really cool in applying this to biological models!",
    "Take 115. This course is good but there are no resources to study online because the material is very different.",
    "Loved this class. Challenging at times, fair tests, no curve, but Prof. Frame made it so worth it. Content is interesting, too. Highly recommend if Professor Frame is still well and teaching.",
    "yes, this is a good course to take if you are pre-med or math in general gives you fits. michael frame teaches the material deliberately and at a slow enough pace that it's easier to understand. definitely a better alternative to math 115.",
    "I would recommend Math 116 to anyone interested in Math, Biology, or both. The course was interesting and the material we learned was applicable to many biological issues ranging from population studies to the human anatomy to medicine.",
    "Open-note tests, but that does not actually mean they are easy.",
    "Math 116 is a great course that introduces you to a lot of different topics in mathematical modeling of population dynamics and systems. Go to office hours!!!! Because it will really help you with p-sets and consolidating the material.",
    "It is necessary to separate the course from the professor. Professor Frame is incredible, inspiring, and helpful. His genuine passion for the material and desire to help students who come to office hours was much appreciated. However, the material itself was extremely difficult, confusing, and abstract. Students who do not have a strong math background will struggle in the course if they do not devote significant time on the problem sets, attending the class tutor's hours, and going to office hours. Therefore, the class was very stressful at times, since understanding the material was a burden. While most of the students in the class are pre-med, the material itself only delves into specific biological applications only briefly, and ones that pertain to population dynamics.",
    "Take the class. If you are a bio major and you are looking for your math requirement, this is the class.",
    "The class is wonderful, but make sure you absolutely understand the material or it will be very hard. If you put forth the effort, it's definitely worth a look.",
    "It is a great class to take to explore such mathematical calculus topics that you have never thought to be models for biology. I would definitely recommend it to anyone.",
    "Take it! It's a great alternative to math 115",
    "A great class that covers differential equations in an applied way.",
    "the class is certainly much better than MATH 115 and MATH 120 but is not as applicable to the biosciences as the name would suggest. a lot of the material is abstract\/theoretical, but interesting nonetheless. and the psets\/exams arent too bad",
    "Math 116 is a very well-taught course, especially if you hold an interest in further work in the biosciences. The subject matter is a bit different than normal Math 115 though, so bear that in mind. But you will learn some cool stuff! Make sure not to leave your pset for the night before it is due. Also, take advantage of Frame's office hours! He's great.",
    "It is a class where we connect math to many real world problems.",
    "MATH 116 was excellent because of Professor Frame. He introduced interesting topics practical for medical application. Many lessons in this course covered material completely foreign to high school AP Calculus A\/B. He introduced interesting topics practical for medical application (e.g., Arnold's model for the cardiac system). Professor Frame's patient teaching style and approachable, good-humored nature made challenging lecture material enjoyable to learn.",
    "I would definitely recommend Math 116 to another student who is a science major at Yale. I would only recommend this course if the person is willing to put the work in day in and day out because some of the concepts aren't so easy to grasp.",
    "It was an enjoyable course that can make anyone interested in math, more interested without dissuading anyone who isn't fond of the subject.",
    "This class was actually one of my favorite classes this semester. I heard a lot of amazing things about the course, so I decided to take it. The first few weeks, though, were kind of difficult, and that's when most people dropped out of the class. But things eventually went more smoothly as the semester progressed. The material is super interesting, especially if you've taken AP Calc AB before and want to learn more than just normal calculus.",
    "I would take this class if you're really interested in the real-world application of Math 115. It is slightly harder though.",
    "A really great course. A wonderful way of using mathematical models to approach biological problems - every class was so interesting. And Professor Frame was phenomenal - he brought so much passion and knowledge to his teaching, and was just such a kind, inspiring person.",
    "It's a great class especially for those who have already taken Calc BC but don't necessarily remember enough to dive comfortably into Math 120. This class is interesting in that it contains more than just calculus, introducing elementary concepts from linear algebra and fractals. I definitely recommend it.",
    "I can't recommend MATH 116 enough! I am leaving the class with a much greater understanding of calculus and a greater perspective on how it can be applied in so many ways in our world. Professor Frame is an incredible teacher and a pleasure to learn from. He ensures that everyone is on the same page and made my experience in the class amazing. The course is the perfect balance between general calculus and applying it in unique ways--making the material that much more enjoyable to learn. I am so fortunate to have been able to take this course.",
    "Soooo much better than math 115. The material is interesting and not difficult to grasp if you go to class. You can basically finish the entire pset by going to office hours because Professor Frame is so helpful. Take this class!",
    "116 was my favorite class this semester!!! This class is a MUST TAKE while it is still offered. The course material is very interesting and it is a great way to learn calculus. Awesome substitute for 115 for premeds and non premeds alike. Unless you need 120, take this class! The applications of the math are really interesting. Frame is a truly incredible teacher. He is really great and always enthused to help. Take advantage of his office hours. 1 pset a week, 1 midterm and a final. Very manageable work load and pretty low-stress class. Finally made sequences and series understandable.",
    "Math 116 was the perfect way to start my math career at Yale. I would highly recommend the course to any student looking to be challenged by an incredible professor. I established a relationship with Professor Frame that I look forward to maintaining throughout my time at Yale.",
    "I would, but not if they want to take more math later on because I think 115 is a much better preparation for 120.",
    "I already have recommended this class to several of my friends. I would summarize it as second semester calculus that is presented in the context of biology. Also the range of topics is much broader than a normal calculus class, and the topics were so much more interesting than a normal calculus class."
