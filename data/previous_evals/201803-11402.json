    "This course helped me to expand the breadth of my reading and methodological exposure in religious studies. It also helped develop my blog-style academic writing.",
    "I learned a lot about the history of the field and the major theoretical and methodological questions that scholars of religion have grappled and are grappling with",
    "I learned how to communicate with people from different religions and I enjoyed how to understand religions in an interesting way.",
    "grounding in the foundational texts of religious studies, the critiques of those theories and texts, and an understanding of where the discipline has been, is, and might be heading",

   "comments": [
    "Strengths: I loved the course readings, engagement with others from different areas of study, and discussion. Weaknesses: Very, very minimal; I loved the class. The only thing I can think of is that there was very little critical engagement with one another; perhaps encouraging this in a future class could lead to fruitful discussion.",
    "The syllabus and reading selections were excellent. Weekly discussion posts were a helpful way of engaging with the material before class. I think the seminar component would have been better if we had a smaller group.",
    "I think the readings in this class is very helpful challenging, and the discussions were challenging and interesting. The teacher is very kind.",
    "It seemed like we spent a really long time in the beginning with older texts -- all the Smiths, etc., I think it's important to know these things, but I would have appreciated getting to the more contemporary stuff sooner. Also in the classroom discussions and posts, a lot of us were saying things that disagreed with each other, I am not wishing the class was more adversarial, but I do think it would have been interesting\/helpful to engage these differences of opinion.",
    "The course was well though out and helpful."

    "Yes, some people in earlier years have said they really struggled with 510, but I found it to be an overall pleasant classroom experience",
    "Yes I would. It is important to have a centralized place for discussion in this variegated field."
