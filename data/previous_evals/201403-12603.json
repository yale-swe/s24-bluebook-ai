    "Wow what a fantastic course!! Certainly not for the faint of heart, though. That was a tough, but very rewarding course (think similar to MB&B 301) where so much information was packed into one semester that you leave saying,'Wow, I may have shaved 10 years off of my life due to the pre-exam stress, but I sure did learn something!' The course is split up into two sections; the first covers electrophysiology of neurons, ie- neuron=circuit, and goes in detail about the specific ion channels involved in action potentials and synaptic transmission. For that part, make sure you know your physics. (I was a physics major so it was easy for me, but if you don't remember capacitors and resistors, you are going to be in for a rough time.) Also, learn all the toxins!!! As has been reiterated in these evaluations from year to year, you WILL be tested on them and they WILL be an integral part of at least one question. The second part of the course covers more of the anatomy and overall connectivity of neurons within the nervous system, specficially how certain circuits such as the visual system or the pain system gets triggered and carries information to the brain. The lectures in that section will be IMPOSSIBLE to understand, but the lecture notes he posts are excellent, so try to look those over and print them out before you come to class. Overall this is a difficult course, but very rewarding. Also, please take it with the lab. The lab is fantastic!!!!",
    "The material is interesting, but the class was my least favorite of the semester.",
    "This is a very tough class. As a CogSci major, I'm glad I know more about this information, but the material is dense and filled with so many details. There are some concepts, but much is simply memorization. Prof. Forscher is quite a bad lecturer, so make sure you go to TF sections in order to figure out the material. The lecture summaries are your best friend, and I found online explanations to often be better than textbook ones. Electrophysiology is kinda boring though. Prof. Keshishian is pretty great and leads an enjoyable second semester. And definitely the more interesting material. There are no p-sets, but I think that is a bad thing. It is difficult to know how you are doing during the semester. Prepare for the tests well in advance.",
    "This is a hard class. Do not underestimate it. That being said, if you have any interest on the biology and pathways of any neural system, you should absolutely take it. I've learned so much from this class that my head feels like it's going to explode. In a good way.",
    "Yes, you will learn a lot. No, it was not worth the pain of sitting through lectures, cramming massive amounts of material in my head, and taking extremely difficult exams for which no practice questions were provided.",
    "It's hard and requires a background in cell bio\/biochem\/physics, but it was so fascinating! Take it if you have time to devote to massive studying.",
    "17-page final that took 3 and a half hours, and that still wasn't enough time. Midterms weren't any less intense. Unless you love neurobiology so much that you want to make sweet, sweaty, passionate love to it, RUN FAR AWAY. If you're willing to subject yourself to that torture, you will learn a lot, from electrophysiology and biochemical pathways all the way up to cortical organization and functions (and everything in between). Know your 2nd semester physics well because that helps a ton for the first half of the class.",
    "I would recommend this class. Be prepared for a lot of self and group studying to really understand the material. Worth taking and interesting material. Keshishian, Froscher, and Zhong's are quite different so know that what you see during shopping period is not necessary what you get.",
    "MCDB 320 is a course that will call upon your background knowledge from nearly every subject you've studied thus far and will require you to apply it in many different ways. If you wish you have a proper understanding of the course material, then it will be essential that you read the book and take detailed notes. More importantly, you will need to commit yourself to reading and studying this material every day, for as long as is required for you to understand it. I would highly recommend seeking the services of a tutor from the very beginning so that you will have someone outside of the classroom who is familiar with this material and who can provide you with additional support. This course may very well test the boundaries of your study skills, organization skills, and time management skills; it is a course that requires the utmost discipline. However, I believe that if you exercise that discipline, you will attain a great wealth of knowledge and understanding about a very complex, engaging, exciting, and groundbreaking subject. More significantly, you will learn more about yourself and what you are truly capable of.",
    "It is a great class to take if you are a bio major or someone interested in the life sciences. Be advised it will probably be the hardest bio class you take (so don't take immunobio at the same time like I did... you won't be a happy camper during finals week). Take VERY good notes during Keshishian's lectures because he doesn't follow the book and he talks quickly. Make some friends too.. and take the lab!",
    "It's a great class for people interested in neurobiology. You will learn A LOT but it may be painful in the process as it is A LOT of information.",
    "I actually really think this course would benefit from having some sort of homework or more reviews for exams. There is actually very little means of gauging how you are doing in the class. And the exams don't really stress the things that seem to be the most important. In particular, the final exam has been described on many occasions as an assignment in creative writing, because a lot of the topics seem to come almost out of nowhere. You learn a lot of interesting concepts, but the class really is a lot of work to keep up and can easily get quite frustrating.",
    "Difficult course- no required work other than the 3 exams, but there is a lot of information that builds on each other (especially in the first part). Falling behind is highly not recommended, as it makes studying for the exam really rough",
    "A lot to memorize but if you put in the work then it's a really interesting class."
