    "I learn more than I expected. At first I thought this was a studio about styles, but when I started to do it and talked about it with George and Leon, I found something more than style----the sense of structure. I am very satisfied with what I learned.",
    "I felt like too much time was spent trying to convince students that it is worth studying traditional architecture and urbanism. I do not think students needed to be convinced. I would have liked to jump right into the designing of a new city.",
    "I think the studio work is beyond my expectations, in terms of critics' mastery, availability, and ability of encouraging student exploration.",
    "This was without exception the best studio that I have taken and my favorite semester at the School. To begin with, the idea that each student works within one master plan but on separate buildings radically changes the studio dynamic in a positive way. It naturally fosters a team approach in which the work of each students complement\u00e2\u0080\u0099s that of his or her peers rather than offering only a competing vision. More importantly, though, it was the first studio in which the context in which the student is working really does matter. It is not good enough to design in a vacuum when your peer is making connections across the master plan; this dynamic forces more critical thought at the urban scale. Though the output of the studio was principally architectural, that architecture was undergirded by a stronger urban awareness than any other studio before it.I was very positively surprised by the balance between intellectual and practical considerations during the semester. The awareness of how a building goes together and what the architectural implications are of those decisions came through in the final work.The trip was a pleasure. We all might have benefited from a bit more exposure to \u00e2\u0080\u009creal\u00e2\u0080\u009d Guatemala as opposed to the very manicured and choreographed social environment of Cayala, but I do not think any of us could really complain about our accommodations. The architecture that we saw was inspiring, but strangely I think the memory that will stick most with me\u00e2\u0080\u0094and which is maybe most pregnant with implications for an architectural response\u00e2\u0080\u0094is the surprise visit to the coffee plantation. It was an eye-opening window into the culture of the country.",
    "I expected an architectural style to be demanded of me. Instead the studio was tailored to my interests. Leon teaches the tools-- the methods to gather information and precedents, the ways to organize that information, ways to use drawing to communicate ideas that we had not used before, etc. Then, with these tools, we formed our own investigations."
