   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend both French and Prof Koizim. This class is really rewarding and guarantees improvement in language skills. In the same time, it is maintained in a friendly atmosphere so it never should be a reason for worry.",
    "I would recommend French 130 to any student who wants to start to learn how to understand and speak French. This course focuses much more on practical speaking and listening, while sticking to fairly simple grammar concepts. It is a great way to both fulfill a language requirement and learn French in a way so that you could go to a French speaking country and communicate well with native speakers.",
    "Absolutely recommended.",
    "L3 is a significant amount of work. You start reading novels and especially at the beginning, the shock from moving to L2 to L3 will be substantial. You meet every day and are only allowed 5 absences the entire semester, including meeting during reading period. I wished the Petit Nicolas unit moved slower. At the beginning of the semester, it did not give me a great initial impression of the course.",
    "Amazing class.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to anyone who tests into L3 French. Mme Koizim is a great teacher--she does a good job of keeping class interesting while still teaching you A LOT of information. For a 1.5 credit class, the workload isn't that bad, but you still get a lot out of it. Definitely try to get Mme K's section for this class.",
    "The course is a lot of work, but the expectations are clear and manageable. Don't get behind in homework and the course will be fulfilling. I highly recommend this course.",
    "Highly recommend it. Great way to immerse yourself in higher level french.",
    "Yes I would recommend it. A good balance between grammar and literature."
