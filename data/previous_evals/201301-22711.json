   "comments": [
    "If you're humanities-minded and have any interest in French literature I say go for it, this class is great.",
    "Yes! If you are interested in French Intellectual history you will enjoy this class",
    "A very solid introduction to major literary movements in 19th century France. The books we read are all masterpieces and the professor talks a lot about underlying background and connections between movements so that we could better understand the different writers and their works. Workload is totally manageable and reading the novels was a breeze. The in-class quizzes sound daunting for a literature class but they were actually fine. Just make sure to take detailed notes in class. The 2 papers were short and not very stressful (25% in total). Overall the class was not too stressful and you will really enjoy it if you want to know more about French literature.",
    "I would recommend it to another student, particularly one with an interest in French literature who wants to continue developing a pre-existing passion."
