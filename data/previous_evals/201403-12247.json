    "I would not recommend anyone takes this class who doesn't absolutely have to. Textbook readings are horrible and the lectures only excel in breadth, not depth. You leave the class feeling like you've learned a little bit about a ton of things and nothing of consequence.",
    "Psych 110 is a great intro course, but be aware that it is not a gut class. The class is curved so that 30% of the class gets As or A-s, so don't go into the class thinking it will be very easy. Work load is not that bad as long as you space out the textbook reading. I would definitely suggest this course to other students because the topics are relevant to everyone. I don't know a single person who doesn't find the course content interesting! Professor Chun is a phenomenal lecturer.",
    "A fantastic class. Absolutely worth taking if you have not taken a psychology class before, because the material is incredibly interesting and the professor is an amazing lecturer. The reading can be a dense and there is a lot of it, but it is certainly manageable. I highly recommend the class!",
    "PSYCH 110 IS AWESOME. It's a super hyped-up course, and so it's easy to go in with unrealistically high expectations. You should lower your expectations just a little bit so that you're not disappointed, but it honestly is an amazing course. Fascinating content, not too bad of a workload, and Marvin Chun is just a fabulous human being. TAKE IT.",
    "TAKE THIS COURSE. No bones about it. And take it ASAP because it may just change how you want to spend the rest of your time at Yale.",
    "Do all the readings and review all the lecture slides to do well on the tests. This class is not a gut. If you don't expect to put in the work, take it credit\/d.",
    "Psychology is fun and it makes you happy.",
    "I would highly recommend PSYC 110 to another student. I found the material very interesting and highly applicable to everyday life.",
    "PSYC 110 is about as interesting as any introductory psychology course is going to be. Professor Chun does a good job of keeping his lectures interesting and integrated with more modern research, but this did mean that sometimes you would have to pick up the slack by reading the textbook more thoroughly. The grading is overhyped, though--Professor Chun sort of tries to scare people at the beginning of the course by announcing that the class isn't a gut, and it's not, but it is a pretty easy class, especially compared to those in the hard sciences. I took it to fulfill by SO requirement, and the class worked well enough for that.",
    "I would definitely recommend taking this class. Don't stress about all the info in the book, you don't need to know it for the tests that well.",
    "TAKE IT. Psychology is so relevant to all aspects of our life, and you'll really have a different way of looking at the world. Every lecture is super interesting, and Marvin Chun is the literal best.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to any student at Yale. It opens your eyes to have ubiquitous psychology really is, and how we are all innate psychologists that go about the world trying to figure out why people do what they do. The course itself covers a large breadth of topics that are relevant to pretty much anybody's interests, whether it is economics, clinical psychology, linguistics, neuroscience or just everyday citizens of the world. I strongly recommend it to everyone!",
    "I would absolutely recommend taking this class! Professor Chun's lectures are engaging and relevant to daily life.",
    "Highly recommend, even if not interested in psychology. It changes the way you think in an interesting way.",
    "almost necessary",
    "Fun course. Relaxing lectures (if you aren't frantically taking notes all of the time). You might have already heard a lot of the facts taught in the course from popular media or various other sources, but it's still a good overview and a way to correct any misconceptions you might have, which pop psychology tends to be riddled with.",
    "Great intro to the field of psych, take with Marvin Chun if you can!! It's a fun course and you'll learn a lot of things that are relevant to everyday life. Not much work at all.",
    "Absolutely recommend taking this class Credit\/D\/Fail as a fifth class. That way, you can still get all of the awesome material out the lecture, without having to worry too much about reading the text book and memorizing the boring stuff, like specific parts of the brain, etc.",
    "An entertaining introduction to Psychology. I would definitely recommend it.",
    "This is a fantastic course- definitely make sure Chun is teaching it. This is the first class I've ever taken where I looked forward to every single day of it, and didn't wish the class would end when it did. There's life lessons scattered throughout every single lecture, and Chun's sense of humor keeps it moving very quickly. People applaud after every single lecture. They don't do that in any other class I've taken.",
    "Engaging, large lecture-style class; interesting guest speakers; moderate workload (little homework, but tests require significant preparation).",
    "Great intro course. It is interesting and if you're willing to study, you can get a decent grade.",
    "The course material is interesting, although I wouldn't expect it to change anyone's worldview. Most of the concepts we talked about follow common sense, but it is interesting to learn about the methods used to prove them scientifically. I'm happy I took this course, but I'm not sure it deserves its reputation as a classic must-take Yale course.",
    "Very interesting class with a light workload. What more could you ask for?",
    "Overall, this course was good. The material was not always particularly interesting, but Professor Chun was engaging and fun. I would recommend PSYC 110.",
    "I would recommend PSYC 110, but just keep in mind that it truly is an intro class and that is reflected in the material. I had never taken a psych class before and a lot of the time I felt like I was taken common sense 110. That said I had a few \"wow that's pretty neat\" moments which were exciting. Marvin is a enjoyable fellow and the lectures managed to hold my attention for probably an hour of the 75 minutes on average which is pretty impressive. The guest lectures were consistently fantastic, Salovey in particular is amazing. The papers were probably my favorite part, the short length and freedom to pick your topic makes them a fun exercise in research and concision. Tests are pretty easy, and no final is a nice bonus. As a stem person I felt I could've searched a little harder and found a SO that was more aligned with my interests, but as it stands this was a good course. All in all, take if you need a decent SO or are interested in psych.",
    "Amazing course. Would definitely recommend to everyone at Yale to take before they graduate. Prof Chun won't be teaching 2015-2016 so you should wait until Fall 2-16 (if you can). It'll be well worth it!",
    "I would 100% recommend Psyc110 to a fellow student. However, I would recommend taking the course with Marvin Chun because of how great of a lecturer he is. The class addresses a wide range of topics, while giving you a full, comprehensive look into Psychology as a whole. Lectures are a must to attend because Professor Chun makes majority of his test based on his lecture content. However, keeping up with the readings is very important if you aren't taking the class Credit\/D\/Fail because on the test they are many strictly book based questions.",
    "Fun but very memorize heavy.",
    "Psych 110 01 is a must take course. You will not be disappointed, and even if you have zero interest in psychology, everyone takes something applicable to life away from the class. I've learned so many good lessons.",
    "This was a very interesting class that set a good base for the continuation of my taking Psychology courses. It gave a good background of psychology and planted the desire to take further psych courses in the future.",
    "I would only recommend this class if you start it Credit\/D\/Fail, some people just do well and others do not. The lectures and material are totally worth it though. So take it, but Credit\/D",
    "Amazing class, the topics are broad but very interesting. Prof. Chun is an especially delightful lecturer to have. Even though it's a huge class, it never feels overwhelmingly big. Anyone from any area should give it a try.",
    "I would definitely recommend PSYC 110 to anyone even remotely interested in psychology. The readings were more than doable, the lectures were interesting, and the dynamic of the course was great. However, the exams were a little difficult, so study beforehand!",
    "PSYC 110 is great, especially with Marvin Chun. It is a good introduction to, and summary of, the field of psychology, and the guest lectures are fantastic. It can get a little repetitive, but if you are looking to take a classic psychology class at Yale, I highly recommend it.",
    "PSYC 110 is a course that is beneficial to all students, whether they are planning to major or not. It teaches you much about yourself, how you can further your own success, and how we can affect the world. At its heart, it really is the study of humans, how they think, how they function, and why. That knowledge is relevant to anyone who plans to interact with another person ever in his life. Take this class. Do it.",
    "Psyc 110 is a great intro class that's engaging and really interesting. You'll find yourself relating class material to the real world and with your interactions to others. It really shows you how the world works. It makes you think and gets inside your head so that you'll find yourself applying class concepts to the world around you. The instructor is one of the best I've had; he's very accessible and his lectures are always fun. You will never find yourself bored in his class and he creates a very absorbing atmosphere. The readings are a lot so it's a bit difficult to keep up but manageable. I would definitely recommend this class as it has been my favorite and I was genuinely sad when our last lecture ended.",
    "If you are interested in taking a course that you will find to be relevant to your own everyday life, you should take Psych 110. Indeed, I sometimes feel that I didn't actually learn that much aside from a plethora of facts about human nature, but in conversations with my friends, I often find myself citing the studies that Marvin brought up. A lot of the studies that we discuss are somewhat self-evident-- i.e. that getting more sleep will improve your cognitive performance-- but nonetheless, I would recommend this course. The workload is not terrible. Just do the readings (not all the night before exams), know the lecture material really, really well, and you will be fine.",
    "My favorite class this semester! Definitely take it.",
    "PSYC 110 really is a must-take class at Yale. Even if you don't find yourself suddenly wanting to major in psych, I can't imagine anyone being bored by the material in this class. The beauty of it is that you study the most fascinating and exciting parts of each branch of the field and then move on before things become too technical or dull. Best case, you will find inspiration to pursue a part of psychology more in-depth. Worst case, you will leave with a general understanding of the field and will have learned astonishing things about the way your mind works and how you function in society. Really no reason NOT to take it--the work is manageable (though not easy, you do have to keep on top of readings and essays), the material is constantly engaging, and Professor Chun is a brilliant, one-of-a-kind lecturer. Take it.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. Whether or not you plan to study psychology in the future, this is an enjoyable class where you learn so much.",
    "Not only is Marvin Chun a great professor and psychologist, but he also seems to really care about everyone in the class's wellbeing. He wants to help you become happier, healthier, more aware of your surroundings. I absolutely recommend this course to everyone.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to everyone! Professor Chun is truly an amazing professor, who controls a room of hundreds and is accessible to anyone who needs or wants his advice\/help. It is not only helpful to those interested in psychology, but is helpful to anyone seeking to better understand their own lives and relationships with the world around them.",
    "The class is fairly straightforward. Read the book and listen to the lectures.",
    "Took this as a senior, and would recommend to anyone. Had some pretty interesting lectures, and Professor Chun is great. A decent amount of memorization is required, but for the most part, the tests were pretty fair.",
    "I absolutely loved this class, and you should definitely take it with Master Chun. He is one of the most fun, interesting, engaging, and effective professors I've ever had. I looked forward to this class every week. Guest lecturers were great too. This might be the class that sticks with me most after I graduate, as I learned a lot that is relevant to pretty much anything involving people. Definitely worth starting the class CR\/D though, as the midterms are tough.",
    "Amazing class that every student should take",
    "Classic Yale class--take it if you can, but it's not a huge deal if you don't. The material covers traditional intro psych topics and Professor Chun does it in a generally interesting and engaging way.",
    "Great entry point into psychology and highly relevant to majors and non-majors alike. Would recommend to all class levels. I took this as a junior and still gained from the class.",
    "If you've never been introduced to psychology before, this will certainly be a great class to take. It's a very broad survey of topics, and there's almost no work at all (3 500-750 word essays, three homework assignments that each take about 1 minute, and a lab requirement that can be completed almost entirely online if you're proactive about signing up for slots). That said, if you're reasonably well read, you're probably not going to learn too much new content. I came into the class having read some pop psych out of casual interest, so I already knew about things like the Milgram Experiment (though I did learn that it was done at Yale!), the Stanford Prison experiment, and things like that. Much of the content matter is also common sense. I still think taking the class was great for my freshman fall, however. It's a nice class for easing oneself into the swing of Yale. We were told at the beginning of the semester that it's not a gut class, but there really isn't much work at all. The workload is almost nothing compared to most STEM classes--that's for sure. Be sure to study LECTURE NOTES. The textbook readings can be skimmed, but most of the test content comes from lectures (so absolutely do not skip lectures).",
    "Interesting Lectures and guest lectures, but not in depth. Chun is engaging and interesting to listen to. Course requires three research papers, each under 750 words, very simple to write and also three examinations, not cumulative, which are multiple choice, so no real knowledge of science required. Great lecture for those interested in psych, and not at all inaccessible to non-science minded students. Take the class, it's great!",
    "Psyc 101 is a good class. Most of the questions on the exams come from the lectures. However, there is some detailed information from the readings. Also, the readings are long and sometimes very hard. Not a gut.",
    "Highly recommend.",
    "Marvin Chun is fantastic, and I've never had a class with such great guest lecturers. The class isn't easy, but it's not too tough.",
    "This is an AMAZING course. As a sophomore who already took a few psychology classes, I was never bored in Psych 110. I looked forward to every lecture, because the material is so interesting and Marvin Chun is amazing. Seriously, he is not only a great lecturer but also a very humble, nice and approachable person. If you are thinking of psych\/cognitive science major, you will love this class., it is the best prerequisite ever. If you are not a psych major but interested in the material, you should still definitely take it, but be aware that the class requires a lot of memorization. You have to know all the details in the lectures as well as in the textbook, so the work can get pretty overwhelming. However, the tests are fact-retrieval type multiple choice questions, so if you know the material you will be perfectly fine (the tests are VERY straightforward, although incorporates too much detail). Overall, I think everyone at Yale should take this class, but you might want to consider taking it credit\/d if this is your 5th class or you are not into learning the details of psych experiments.",
    "Definitely should take this course. Chun is an incredible professor and the class material is very engaging and intruiging.",
    "Among Yale's best courses. Well taught and well paced. Just make sure to keep up with the work. It's not overwhelming, but it's not nothing either.",
    "Intro Psych is an incredible course that everyone should take. The material in this class is relevant to everyone, regardless of your major. Although the exams can be challenging, the class itself is not difficult, as Chun does his best to clearly explain the topics. There are three homework assignments that are fairly low-key, three papers which require a bit more work, and three exams. Also, there is a lab study requirement, but that is really fun to do and can be done from the comfort of your own room, thanks to the many online studies that are up. Chun is an incredibly engaging and wonderful lecturer and its worth it just to see him twice a week!",
    "At first I was somewhat misled from some of the reviews. The PSYC 110 lectures are great - Professor Chun is an awesome lecturer and gives both interesting and humorous lectures. However, some of the textbook readings can be dry and off topic. If you are taking this class Credit\/D than I guess you don't really have to worry about textbook readings. But if you are taking this class for a grade, you will have to get through the readings, which are sometimes moderately interesting and sometimes pretty dull (basically reading a bunch of facts to memorize for the exam). The exams are not bad - you pretty much just memorize a bunch of stuff, some of which is easy to remember anyway. If you know how to memorize stuff well then you are in great shape. Anyways, beyond just knowing facts for the course, the take-home messages from this course are very useful to understand and be aware of in everyday life, and things that you learn in the course will give you a new perspective on everyday phenomena.",
    "I would recommend this class because it was truly great and a great way to prep for the mcat you fellow premeds....",
    "PSYC 110 is a highly engaging class for both majors and nonmajors that gives a broad overview of introductory psychology material. Marvin Chun is an able lecturer who knows how to connect with his students through demonstrations and anecdotes.",
    "This is an introduction to key concepts in psychology! You explore personality, behavior, attraction, disorders, and more. Though there is sufficient overlap with AP Psychology, shop the class and see if you think it might be beneficial to take. I personally took the AP test but never took a psychology course, so I found this to be a wonderful overview of psychology. For those who haven't taken AP Psychology, do take this class! If not for pre-med, distributional, or major requirements, just because this class is so easily applicable to your own behavior and your interactions with others. The essays are very manageable and not menacing at all (only three of them - each 750 words). The exams are very very fair - they are completely based off of lecture information and key concepts in the book. Be sure to actually study the lectures enough because just reading the book isn't enough to be prepared for the exams. The book is very accessible and easy to read!",
    "It's a good class - very relevant information and interesting, too. Prof. Chun's reputation as a great lecturer is well-deserved. His presentation of the material is engaging and he is very fair - and explicit - about what will be covered on exams and the expectations for paper assignments and other homework. The textbook is well-written and is actually rather fun to read (and doing all of the reading is a good idea - there are portions on each exam that come straight from the text). The exams themselves are MC and short answer (three over the course of the semester - there is no final).",
    "his course is actually hard. Don't take it as a gut. Only take it if you have a strong interest in psychologoy",
    "Intro to Psych is a great class, but it is definitely NOT a gut. There are lots of readings (I basically read the entire textbook) that you certainly don't have to do, but I'd recommend doing it to get a larger scope and better understanding of the material (and the textbook authors can be very funny at times). And some of the facts in the readings pop up in the tests. If you're not too interested in the topic of Psychology, I'd definitely say take the class Cr\/D\/Fail or as a fifth class that could be easily dropped... and one big piece of advice: don't take this class just because everyone else is taking it. I did that, and, because my interest in the subject was only lukewarm, I didn't find the class as good as the hype. That being said, the material can be very interesting (and, I assume, much more interesting if you're interested in the subject), and you will definitely learn a lot about human nature and behavior. Professor Chun is also pretty awesome as a lecturer, and he definitely kept the material as interesting as it could be.",
    "It's interesting and relevant to everyday life, there's something for everybody.",
    "A really great class, especially if you've never taken psychology before. Chun is amazing! Don't leave all the textbook reading until right before the test.",
    "It is a class where you briefly learn about pretty much every psychological concept you will come across in the field of psychology. It is a great class for potential majors or just someone who wants to learn a little bit about the science of the mind. I would recommend it to ANYONE just because the course and the subject itself is just so applicable to everyday life... and because the course itself is awesome.",
    "Yes, I would. Professor Chun is great and though not all of the topics are relevant to every day life, much of it is. It is one of those classes that you should take just for personal interest and to be an educated person in the world.",
    "ABSOLUTELY. if you don't take this class, did you even go to Yale?",
    "A+ is the grade I would give this course; definitely take it if you have the slightest interest in the subject! The semester of introduction to psychology was a broad and yet comprehensive presentation of psychology. If you are deciding between Introduction to Cognitive Science and this course, take the advice of somebody who shopped both classes: choose PSYCH 110! We do not have weekly reading questions. We do have amazing presentations, amazing instructors, doable exams, great guest speakers -- e.g. President Salvoey, who by the way was AMAZING. Do yourself a favor and take this class!",
    "Psyc 110 is a must take class. It is so interesting and every day is exciting. The only problem is that there is so much reading, a lot of vocab to memorize, and the tests are anything but easy. If you are not an abstract thinker it is hard to perform as well as you would like on the tests. Taking the class credit\/d is a great decision, however it is possible to get a B or higher with just working hard. Again it definitely is not a gut class but the curve is reasonable because it is a large lecture. But yes take it take it take it!",
    "I would recommend it. It's interesting, not a lot of work, and I think that psychology is a field that everyone should at least skim the surface of.",
    "Lots of reading, but the reading is rarely boring; you will have a blast with Chun!",
    "I would cite this class as one that you have to take at yale. Its informative, fun, and interesting.",
    "PSYC 110 is such an enjoyable class, and the material that gets covered is so applicable to daily life that you find yourself reminded of psychology concepts on a regular basis. Take the class with Marvin Chun!",
    "An excellent introduction to Psych--it really is one of those classic Yale courses. Professor Chun is a great man and a great professor. NOT a gut course. NOT a light courseload. Highly recommended Credit\/D\/Fail.",
    "This was one of the best classes I've taken at Yale, and if I had taken it as a freshman or sophomore, I probably would have wanted to be a psych major afterward. Master Chun is a superb lecturer, he's engaging and funny, and he makes it super clear how relevant psychology is in everyday life. The pace of the class is slower than I expected, which I think made me appreciate the material more--If you're used to constantly taking notes in lecture without having time to think about what you're actually writing, this class will be a great break from that. The material's easy, and the workload isn't huge, but watch the curve. I think only the top 30% or so of the class get an A or A-. Definitely take this class, you will learn so much from it and really enjoy lecture!",
    "Thorough overview of the field of psychology that is a must take with Professor Chun; he made the course worthwhile and highly enjoyable!",
    "I would definitely recommend the course to others who are interested in Psychology, but I would tell them to take it C\/D\/F and to bear in mind that it is in no way a gut course.",
    "Yes would highly recommend it",
    "PSYC 110 is amazing. I would recommend it to everyone no matter what your major is. The workload is not too bad although you do need to do all of the readings to do well on the exams. It is by far one of my favorite classes that I have taken at Yale. Take it!!! Also take it with Marvin Chun he's awesome.",
    "An extremely engaging and interesting course! Would definitely recommend it!",
    "I would say that Intro Psych is a broad introduction to the field of psychology that touches on a lot of interesting topics at least briefly. We don't really go too much into depth on any of the topics, but this is expected of an introduction course. I would definitely recommend this class as it was fun, interesting, engaging, and full of cool information. Professor Chun is one of the best lecturers at Yale and I wouldn't recommend passing up the opportunity of taking this course with him.",
    "Amazing course to take - but take it credit D!",
    "It was a fascinating lecture based course that requires self-motivation to learn since there aren't discussion sections but doing the textbook reading is rewarding in and of itself!",
    "light workload, learn all concepts, interesting course",
    "PSYC 110 is a straightforward course and you get what you put intoit. As the professor will tell you at the beginning, it is not a gut course, and little work will get you a poor grade. That said, it's a very interesting and engaging class, and you will learn tons of material that you will see happening around you every day.",
    "Best introduction class and best lecture class you will take at Yale. Highly recommended!",
    "Take the class, go to lecture. One of the better courses I've taken.",
    "I would recommend it to him. In a way is Psychology that can be used every day and so you realize that all of us you use every day. You realize Psychology is more around you than you realize and is more broad and interesting than you realized.",
    "Take it if you want a concise and interesting overview of psychology. And take it with Professor Chun!",
    "PSYC 110 really gives a good introduction to the field of Psychology. I never took the course before in high school and was just looking for some exposure into the area. You would need to study from the textbooks, but the classes are always interesting.",
    "PSYC 110 is a good course to sit in on and just absorb the information. However, although the material may seem easy the tests end up being hard. 100% if you take this course start it credit D\/Fail. Many people I know ended up not doing as well as they would have liked to and had to keep it on credit D.",
    "I would definitely recommend for those wanting to get an insight into what psychology is all about or those who just want to learn some interesting things!",
    "Of course - everybody is going to recommend this class to you.",
    "I would definitely recommend.",
    "Psych is an amazing course and so applicable to every day life. It helped me adopt a good mindset for the transition to college.",
    "Difficult and a lot of memorization but it's a pretty fun class.",
    "Yes, I think it is a really interesting course. It provides a lot of good dinner table knowledge. If you are looking for an in depth psych course you will probably have to look deeper into the department, but this is a good intro course.",
    "I would recommend this course if you have not taken any form of psychology previously.",
    "Definitely take the class, but make sure to not skip the lectures as they are the most important (and enjoyable) part of the class.",
    "PSYC 110 is exactly what you'd expect it to be. It's a comprehensive introductory psychology class that touches upon many different aspects of the field. It is a huge lecture, which can at times be a turn-off, but I would definitely recommend this to anyone who either wants to major in psychology or just take a fun class.",
    "Psyc 110 is an overview psychology course, and as a result does not go into too much depth in any one subfield. If this is what you're looking for you will love this course.",
    "The class lectures cover topics from sleep to prejudice, and anything else that is relevant to everyday life. In Professor Chun makes the class one of the best at Yale. Grading consists of in-class participation (clickers), very simple homework assignments, reading, 3 short essays and 3 exams. It is not a class you can breeze through in, but I would recommend it to all. It should be a distributional requirement, because it is so helpful to college students in general! Great class, absolutely enjoyed it.",
    "I would recommend Psych 110 because the subject material is relevant and exciting and it is taught in an entertaining way.",
    "Intro Psych is a really great class and, if you can, absolutely take it with Marvin Chun. He's a gem of a professor -- incredibly engaging, so humble and smart, makes the material really exciting and interesting -- and the material itself is something that pretty much everyone should know, no matter what field you're going to go into. The tests are a lot of memorization but definitely do-able, and papers are not bad; so the class itself isn't a ton of work, and you get so much out of it. Take it with Professor Chun, and have the best time. It's a class that everyone should take.",
    "This course is fun and interesting during lectures, but requires a lot of self-teaching before exams. The textbook is dense and will be boring to those without a passion for psychology. That said, last minute crams are always possible, and - to some - the banter in lecture will be worth it.",
    "I would recommend Psych 110 to another student because it is an awesome class with great material that is relevant to all of our lives. Psych 110 touches upon all of the basic fields of psychology with some in depth look at a lot of information. Overall, it was a great introduction to psychology.",
    "Psyc110 is a great course to learn about fundamental ideas and approaches in psychology. While the lectures are engaging and interesting, the exams tend to be surprisingly detailed, so be prepared to study way beyond the lecture material.",
    "Take it",
    "I would recommend PSYC 110 to another student because the course load is not too heavy and the lectures are interesting.",
    "I already recommend this class to everyone I meet. It is just a wonderful experience for any and everyone",
    "PSYC 110 is one the best courses I have taken at Yale. The subject has something to offer everybody, regardless of your area of interest\/career plans. Professor Chun is a great lecturer and, moreover, a great professor in that he was very considerate of his students overall. This could be a great course to take Credit-D if you were just interested in the subject but a good grade in the course is also very attainable.",
    "Definitely one of the must take Yale classes",
    "A must take class.",
    "I would 100% recommend Psych 110 to another student. If you've never taken a real psychology class you will truly love this class. It's interesting, the professor is amazing, and I found the workload completely manageable. I started my class credit\/d but I switched back after my 2nd test. The only test that I kind of struggled in was the 1st test and after that I was pulling solid As on all my tests. My personal advice is take the practice exams so you can get a feel of the questions. Then if you really look at the class notes and book reading seriously (not just skim) the tests become very easy. Also there's no final which made the class much easier.",
    "I definitely recommend PSYC 110! Professor Chun is awesome. It's a great survey of interesting and applicable topics. I also have mostly seminar classes, so it was fun to be in a huge lecture with lots of friends.",
    "PSYC 110 is a fantastic course for anyone who is interested in learning about the way that humans behave. There are so many useful tidbits of information in the curriculum, and if you take this class, you will gain a far better understanding of why we behave the way we do.",
    "Absolutely!",
    "I would say that PSYC 110 is a course worth taking because the subject is interesting and Marvin Chun is a wizard of a teacher.",
    "A must take at Yale with professor chun! It's hard but worth it!!",
    "When professor Chun says it is not a gut class at the beginning of the year, listen to him. A few people I know went in thinking it would be super easy, etc. and were not prepared for the work. You have three short research papers and three tests, it's all doable but you have to dedicate some time for it. The class material is really interesting and cool and definitely there are a bunch of takeaways that I have already applied to my daily life.",
    "Great intro course that helps you decide if you'd like to continue on in the psychology track. Also gives you an idea of your work habits in a lecture versus a seminar.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. I was comfortable in the class with no background in psychology!",
    "Psych 110 is a basic introductory course. It covers many topics in psychology, exposing one to many specialities within the field. With Marvin Chun, an incredible professor, class is exciting every day. Guest Lectures are also incredible. Course is relatively more work at Yale, but interesting and worth it. midterms a bit difficult-very specific and detailed but papers are interesting and coursework is definitely fair. TAKE THIS CLASS",
    "Take it!",
    "Absolutely take Intro to Psyc if you like any part of human psychology. It is a chill class though it requires more effort than a gut course (I wish I had studied more).",
    "PSYC 110 was an amazing course, and I would especially recommend it during freshman fall. Marvin Chun is engaging, available, and an incredible guy, and the guest lecturers were amazing. The course was definitely not a gut, but was extremely manageable, with 3 papers and 3 non-cumulative midterms. Marvin definitely has his students' best interests at heart, and will try his best to ensure his students are happy with how the course is going. Definitely stop by his office hours! Even if it's just to chat, he's a really interesting professor who loves talking to his students. Lastly, I had never thought of myself as a potential psychology major before taking psyc 110, but this course is a broad into to psychology that will definitely let you know if psychology is (or might be) for you!",
    "PSYC 110 is an interesting course, but not an easy one like many students say. I would only recommend this course to a student who is willing to do the work and go to the lectures without a professor or TA holding them accountable.",
    "Absolutely recommend this class to anyone interested in learning about people, relationships, society, the brain, life, etc., whether psych majors or not. Marvin Chun is a great lecturer and very approachable.",
    "I would recommend this course to everyone and not just those interested in psychology as the applications of the content we learn are widespread and apply to everyone. However, someone who might have taken psychology in high school would be better off taking a different course.",
    "You learn about why people act and think the way we do and why you should sleep more. I would recommend it to another student because the lectures were interesting, the papers were pretty easy once you understand how they want you to write them, and you don't have to take a final.",
    "An absolutely essential class regardless of what you want to major in! The content is always applicable and mostly interesting. It will change the way you look at the people and events around you.",
    "This is a good class but if you took ap psych in high school it's not worth it because you'll already have heard most of the \"cool\" stuff and you still won't do that well in the class because the tests are really specific to what he says in lecture (like if you zone out for a minute you'll probably get something wrong).",
    "TAKE THIS COURSE. It's super fun and extremely useful. Marvin Chun is the perfect lecturer, and most topics in the class were immediately useful to me.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. If you have little to no psych background then this class will be extremely interesting and very worth it.",
    "I would highly recommend the course for someone who wants an overview of Psychology. It was fun and interesting and Master Chun is an awesome lecturer. There is a lot of reading though so be prepared for that.",
    "Psyc 110 is a class about how people tick; it observes the brain, the mind, behavior, social interaction, cognition, and more. I would definitely recommend this course to another student; Professor Chun is an incredible instructor, and psychology is relevant to any future job.",
    "A really great course and in my opinion, a must-take class for any freshman with even a little interest in the subject. Professor Chun is charismatic and a great lecturer, and I always enjoyed getting to hear about the latest research from. I don't plan to major in Psych, but I do feel like I've learned a lot about the human mind and humanity in the class. Anyone planning on taking the class should be prepared to keep up with textbook readings (which cover different information from in class) and reread before the test. It's always a fair amount of work, but the responsibility is on the student to keep current.",
    "A Yale staple. Don't leave this school without taking it. Easy A if you do all the readings and put forth even average effort. Professor is phenomenal and the knowledge is applicable to every walk of life.",
    "Fun for all ages.",
    "I would summarize PSYC 110 as a broad overview of major psychology research findings. I would recommend it, but would also say it was a little boring.",
    "Large lecture, which is a good general introductory to psychology.",
    "I would certainly recommend this class to another student.",
    "It was AMAZING. take it!",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS!!!! (If it's Professor Chun or Bloom) This was my favorite class I have taken at Yale. Its a fantastic survey of psychology, covering a lot of basic, but fascinating material. Professor Chun was an engaging, clear lecturer, and he made every single class fun and unbelievably interesting. Guest lectures were similarly amazing, especially the lecture by President Salovey- make sure you are there for that. Workload is relatively light, and I found the class to be quite easy, despite claims that it isn't a gut. Each week has a fair amount of textbook reading, and there are 3 short papers throughout the semester. Tests are fair, and really not too difficult if you do the readings and take good lecture notes. This class made me want to be a psych major. It is unbelievable and everyone should take it.",
    "Overall I really enjoyed this class. Professor Chun does a really great job of providing interesting and relevant examples to help explain the key topics of the course. Keeping up with the readings is important because they are dense and have a lot of information, although most of the exam covers lecture material. It's a big class but Professor Chun offers spots for a group of students to have lunch with him which I highly recommend - it gives you the chance get to know him better.",
    "This is a good class to take if you're looking for a broad and general overview of psychology. It does what it seeks to do which is to show you that psych is a science, it is relevant, and it is fun. I would recommend the course to another student because most (if not all) the topics are personally relevant. It may not seem like a lot of work at first, but be sure to pace everything out at the start and schedule your own deadlines for readings, papers and lab requirement.",
    "Highly recommend- one of my favorite classes thus far and this is from someone who was a little cynical of psych and how much I would actually learn\/get out of the class.",
    "Good class but I would probably take it Credit\/D because it is so competitive in such a big class.",
    "I would not recommend the class. For me, the class was mostly hype. I would recommend finding a copy of the syllabus and attending the more interesting lectures, but taking the class is not something I would do again.",
    "Take it. If you have no psychology background, this will give you a good foundation and it's a nice course to end the day in.",
    "A must take course!! Marvin Chun is an amazing lecturer and you learn something new and insightful at each class. It's a reasonable work load and super fun.",
    "I would recommend PSYCH 110. The class is not very difficult and most of the lectures are interesting.",
    "z",
    "Great introduction to psychology. I recommend this class to everyone.",
    "interesting but challenging",
    "I would say psych is an introductory psychology course that studies the science of behavior and the mind. It's really interesting and taught by a great teacher. You should definitely take it if you have the chance because its not only interesting but also incredibly informative. It teaches information that's useful to have in everyday life.",
    "A great class. The work load is definitely manageable and you'll learn a lot!",
    "In psych 110 you were learn the basics of psychology. You cover a lot of topics but it is extremely interesting and a great class to take if you want to experiment in psychology.",
    "Take it! Even if you 're not interested in being a psych major there is a lot of interesting material.",
    "An overview and general understanding of what psychology is as a scientific discipline.",
    "I would recommend Psch 110 to a student with some reservations. It was mildly interesting, but you might as well just look up the syllabus and go to the lectures that seem interesting instead of committing to the entire class.",
    "Amazing class. Great lectures and generally easy exams. Easiest class I've taken at Yale. No reason you shouldn't!",
    "Great introduction to psychology. Course is for anyone interested in psychology, not just those people majoring in it. I would defintiely recommend it to a fellow student. Professor Chun is a great teacher.",
    "It was an amazing class but I underestimated the amount of work I was expected to put in to get a good grade. Marvin Chun is an amazing professor, the material was very interesting and because of these reasons PSYC 110 would make a really good Credit D course. But if you're like me and care about your GPA, I would not recommend taking this course for a letter grade unless you have sufficient amount of time to do the readings. Last minute cramming doesn't help a lot and since this course is mainly taken by freshmen who are super motivated, you'll have a tough time getting a good grade because of the messed up curve.",
    "This is one of the classes at Yale where if you have an extra slot on your schedule for a fun class, take this one!",
    "PSYC 110 is a course that introduces students to topics in the broad field of psychology. I would highly recommend it to another student, especially if they can take it with Professor Chun. This was one of the only lectures I looked forward to going to, and they are guaranteed to learn a lot, without having an overwhelming workload.",
    "Would recommend--applicable material, great professor, and not a particularly difficult (though not particularly easy class).",
    "I would definitely recommend PSYC 110 01 to a student. It is a psychology class that gives a great background about a lot of different fields of psychology",
    "PSYCH 110 is the best class I took this semester, and I would recommend it to pretty much anybody. The professor is fun, the material is almost universally interesting, and the class is not too difficult so it could probably be taken as a 5th credit without a problem.",
    "This is the perfect introductory psychology course. Professor Chun is always on top of his stuff and is very good at keeping things lively with his sense of humor. It is not a gut class, however, so make sure to do your reading. And don't lose your clicker! Remember to return it to Bass at the end of the semester!",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to another student. PSYC 110 is a great introduction course that covers content that is relevant to any field of study. The workload is manageable, the lectures interesting, and the professor is brilliant.",
    "TAKE IT",
    "PSYC 110 is an excellent course that all Yale students should take, especially with Professor Chun. The course is reading-heavy and students can't slack off, but it is genuinely a rewarding experience.",
    "Take it, but don't listen when he tells you to start CRED\/D\/Fail. It was the worst decision I could have made.",
    "Good class to get Freshmen introduced to lecture-style college classes.",
    "I would call the course a broad overview of the science of psychology, a humanities-ish science course or a science-y humanities course, full of engaging lectures, humor, and exciting material. I would definitely recommend it to another student, because I feel like I got a lot out of it. I would, however, recommend that the student make sure to pay attention to the lectures and do all the work because otherwise you're wasting your time on the course.",
    "Amazing class but it's so silly that they recommend taking it pass fail when it's an introductory psych class - everything about it but the exams was amazing, but the tests were borderline ridiculous and showed nothing but how great your memory is. Definitely take it though - just know you'll need to memorize a lot of studies and details three times a semester.",
    "ABSOLUTELY take this class. It is fun, interesting, and not an overwhelming amount of work. Even if you're not interested in psych, you will be after this class!",
    "PSYC 110 is a good course to see if you like psychology. The workload is minimal, but do not shrug it off. There are three tests; the first and third are not too bad. The homeworks are quick and few, and the papers are pretty short.",
    "Psych 110 is a great introductory course to psychology. You learn the basics in the field, but Prof. Chun makes each lecture really interesting and fun, so I definitely looked forward to going to lecture. I would recommend psych 110 to other students for sure especially if you want to take a class that has really interesting reading and material but not an unreasonable amount of work.",
    "Good interesting class. It is not hard, as long as you actually read the textbook, and I think Cr\/D\/Fail is unnecessary for anyone who knows how to study at all. The exams in particular, were pretty easy, with the highest scores in the high nineties. We also probably could have learned a bit more in leiu of a huge number of funny videos. Professor Chun and the guest lecturers are all pretty amazing and engaging, as well as accessible and friendly. Overall I would recommend this course.",
    "An amazing class. Definitely take it. If you already took AP Psych, this will be an easier course for you. A lot will be review, but the experiments and some content will be new and engaging. The guest lecturers are also fantastic. Non-cumulative tests and no final. Generous curve if you put in effort. Highly recommend.",
    "Good to take Credit\/D: interesting lectures and not lots of work otherwise. Tests are mostly multiple choice",
    "It was a good class that quickly covers a lot of different topics and information which at times can be overwhelming and feel shallow.",
    "Fun class that takes some intense studying around the tests in order to do well, as well as some textbook readings that correspond to class material. Lectures are always a pleasure, I always looked forward to going to them. Definitely recommend as a must-do class at Yale.",
    "Even if you are not a PSYCH major, it is a great course to take credit\/D (and then consider switching) because of the information you can gain about psychology and the sheer enjoyability of the course.",
    "An excellent introduction course for any major. Much of the topics covered are actually very relevant and applicable and I find a lot of these concepts from class throughout the day. I would definitely recommend.",
    "Certainly worth taking if you have the time for it in your schedule; it also makes a great 5th Cr\/D class, though I myself took it for a grade.",
    "Psyc 110 is an amazing class and I would recommend it to any freshman, no matter what their interests are. The lectures are really interesting and the reading is also pretty interesting and not that extensive (only about 2 textbook chapters a week). Also, it's not that hard to do well in the class. All you have to do is read the textbook and then cram the night before each of the midterms.",
    "I would definitely recommend PSYC 110 01 to whoever has some interest in psychology.",
    "TAKE THIS COURSE!! You absolutely have to do the readings to do well in the course, which is hard work, but in the end, it is a very satisfying intellectual experience. Essentially, this is a course on how to live life. You'll be a better human being because of it.",
    "A pretty good course. Honestly, I'd recommend Intro Cog Sci over this course. I found it more fullfilling and interesting. Psych is broader and more geared towards fun. Also psych has multiple choice tests that are rote memorization while cog sci makes you think more",
    "As pretty much everyone in Yale College knows, PSYC 110 is an excellent and interesting course. Its subject matter introductory level psychology is just useful life knowledge for all students. Marvin Chun is an excellent teacher. That said, the tests were more about minute facts and details rather than the broad, interesting concepts covered in lecture. The essays were on interesting topics; overall, I would definitely recommend this course, but beware the tests.",
    "I would say it is a good introductory course with a great teacher.",
    "Intro to Psych was probably one of my favorite courses at Yale thus far. An engaging professor and interesting material makes for a winning combination. Not only that, the course is far more applicable to everyday life than most other courses. I would definitely recommend this course to another student.",
    "I think the class provides a good foundation for not only psychology majors but also any student interested in the human mind.",
    "In order to do well, DO NOT PROCRASTINATE. Simply follow the schedule of readings religiously and review the lectures multiple times before exams.",
    "A great class to take while you're at Yale. You learn a lot of neat things that you'll hopefully remember after you graduate.",
    "Absolutely take it! I took it as a Junior and found to be incredibly manageable and quite easy - it can be a gut course if you know how to do well early on. In terms of work, there really isn't that much: 3 midterms (no final!), 3 research papers (500 to 750 words, take a couple of hours to do), and a lab experiment component (5 hours of psych lab experiments or 2 additional research papers). To do well on the midterms, be sure to pore over your notes from lectures and be sure that you take in depth and extensive notes during class - especially when Prof. Chun talks about various experiments. Doing the readings before lecture isn't necessary. I just read them before the exams and did well. Keep in mind that his midterms range widely in difficulty but as long as you read the textbook a couple of times and know the lecture material, you'll be fine. Where this class really shines is Professor Chun's lectures. They're engaging, informative and incredibly interesting. Having never taken a psyc class before, I didn't really know what to expect. His lectures were clear and organized enough that I came out of the class with a good basic foundation in psychology as well as a newfound appreciation. I also fulfilled a premed req, which is great. Overall, this class was low stress and easy for me - all while being super interesting! No brainer to take.",
    "It is a fairly basic introduction to the topics in psychology. As long as you keep up with the readings, the work load is not too bad and the midterms are fairly easy. If you are interested in exploring the basic topics in psychology this is a good class. However, if you are interested in learning more in depth topics I would look elsewhere. This class is not a gut, but its also not that difficult.",
    "Take this course if you have even the tiniest bit of interest in psychology. Professor Chun, if a bit overhyped, is a great, engaging lecturer. The class is also very practical and will change how you perceive certain things. While its size may be overwhelming, this makes it easy to find other people in the class and form study groups. The homework is minimal. The reading is a bit dense but just look for the bolded terms; they're all that matter. The tests require an average amount of studying. The papers are a bit tedious but they're totally manageable.",
    "Even though it is a huge class, there is plenty of interaction between students and the professor. I learned so much throughout the course and am sure anyone can benefit from materials taught during the lecture.",
    "Very good intro level course without too much work. Great as a Cr\/D for seniors who didn't end up taking this class their freshman year but want some exposure to the field. Although the exams are tricky, the content itself is not difficult. Fun atmosphere in class with Master Chun's sense of humor and excellent guest lectures.",
    "I would DEFINITELY recommend this class to those interested in psychology, human behavior, or just how to lead a better life. The professor is AMAZING, the workload isn't too bad. There are three short (500-750 word) research papers, quite a bit of textbook reading, and almost nonexistent other homework. I would recommend keeping up with the textbook (no matter how hard it can be) because it is actually interesting and will save you a lot of unnecessary all-nighters in the end. I've learned so much about sleep, love, human interactions, and the unexpected. 10\/10",
    "It is very fun and interesting. But be prepared to read and study a lot if it is new subject matter. Definitely would recommend to another student.",
    "Yes take this class! But make sure you start it off credit D\/Fail as professor Chun recommends because it is not a gut (easy) course at all.",
    "It's an excellent course that I would recommend.",
    "PSYC 110 is a lecture based course that introduces you to the fundamentals of psychology. It is fun, engaging, and the homework load is pretty light, as long as you stay on top of your reading.",
    "I would recommend it C\/D\/F",
    "If you are looking for a chill CR\/D class, this is it! But if you're actually looking to learn new things...don't take this class. It's interesting and fun enough to keep you somewhat engaged, but not too difficult and has a workload well suited for the CR\/D lifestyle. However, I felt like I didn't actually LEARN much because the class is very much a survey course and most of the things we talked about in class were already common knowledge.",
    "I would recommend it and summarize it as an interesting, enjoyable, and challenging class.",
    "An absolutely fantastic class; not really life-changing, but simply a very interesting lecture that I looked forward to going to every day. Would really recommend it; beyond papers, which could be done in 5 hours or so, studying wasn't that difficult. I would recommend students to make quizlets to keep track of all words in order to study for exams.",
    "Yes, it's a class everyone should take.",
    "This is one of those courses that everyone should take",
    "10\/10 would recommend PSYC 110 to everyone. It's so practical and fascinating.",
    "I would recommend this class to other students as I really enjoyed it. It is a great way to get used to a huge lecture class setting.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. You don't have to be science-minded to take it and do well, and a general knowledge of psychology is an extremely useful and rewarding tool.",
    "This class is fun and interesting and can be a relaxing break from other classes. There is little work, and it can be managed easily. You can do well in this class if you just go to the lectures and pay attention, and keep up with the textbook readings, but the lectures are enough to enjoy the class and to get an ok grade. I recommend the class. Marvin Chun is a great lecturer and it is clear that he is very enthusiastic about teaching. He obviously cares not only about the content but about the students.",
    "PSYC 110 01 is an exciting, engaging introduction to psychology, the scientific study of the mind and behavior. I would definitely recommend the class to another student, whether they are looking to learn more about psychology or are generally interested in taking a well-taught class that will give them insights about how human beings behave and what our motivations and interests are in life.",
    "I would say Psych 110 was interesting, but a broad range. So if they are looking to just get a taste of psych (which I assume most people taking an intro class are), then psych 110 is a great choice; however, if a student wants a more focused class on a particular psych topic, I'd suggest taking another class.",
    "I fully recommend PSYC 110 to other students to find out if Psychology is a passion they may want to further. I really enjoyed the course and it gave me a good understand of the bigger picture of psychology. It gave me insightful information that I find useful in my everyday life and even if I was not interested in Psychology, I would have been very happy that I took this course. I think it is a must take at Yale.",
    "Psychology is a great course for every student at Yale. It is very applicable to many aspects of everyday life, and teaches students strategies that can be used for overall personal improvement and success in many realms.",
    "PSYC 110 is an introduction to the broad field of psychology. The class covers different aspects of the social science and provides a better understanding of the types of psychology students can study further. I would recommend this class to other students because it is really interesting - even if you don't plan to major in psychology. However, it requires work and studying and it is important to read the textbook as assigned in order to better understand the material and tests.",
    "Yes, very good course and I have recommended it to other classmates. Fun, practical and easy to learn.",
    "I loved Psychology 110! Professor Chun is a thoughtful, humorous, and helpful instructor--I am always very engaged in his lectures even though PSYC 110 is probably one of the largest classes at Yale. The course material is pretty straightforward, and Professor Chun's tests are always fair and reasonable. I highly recommend this course to anyone who is interested in psychology!",
    "really good; a bit overhyped; good intro\/survey or 5th course Chun is really enthusiastic about the material. presents it in an interesting way. a decent but manageable amount of reading if you decide to do it. If you've taken AP psych, don't take this course, as much of it will be repeat material",
    "A must-take course full of useful, relevant information for everyday use taught by an amazing professor. I would definitely recommend psyc 110 to another student because of the access to the faculty in charge of the course and because of the interesting nature of the course itself.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend PSYC 110 to another student. It is a fun course for students who have not had much exposure to Psychology and are interested in learning more. It is definitely not a gut course. There is a lot of work but it is a manageable workload and the text book is great.",
    "Be aware of the grading, otherwise it is an enjoyable course.",
    "Intro psych is a great class and one that I would recommend everyone take. The content is interesting and very well-taught, but even more than that it is almost a life-management class. The things I learned definitely helped me through my first semester of college, and beyond anything else it's just really fun. I would definitely recommend it.",
    "Overall this is an enlightening though not particularly rigorous course. It serves its purpose as an introductory class because we got great snapshots of the world of psychology but rarely delved an deeper. Though a downside was that the material did not build on itself much, I did find myself applying knowledge from the course to everyday life. The homework was always easy and straightforward and the exams not too difficult. I would recommend this class to people who already have a heavy course load and are looking for something entertaining and not too stressful to spice things up. Also take it for Master Chun who is wonderful and really cares about the student's wellbeing!",
    "A classic course to take at Yale. I generally agree with all the praise most other reviews have. Chun is a great lecturer and the material is very interesting (though, for the most part, hardly ground breaking and often common sense). However, I really disagree with the general difficulty assessment. I started the class Cr\/D\/F like everyone recommends, but there was really no need. As a STEM major, this was the easiest class I have ever taken at Yale. I did the readings the week of the exams, only studied one to two days before, and had no difficulty with any of them. The material is common sense and easy to learn. There are sometimes a couple tricky questions, but everyone has trouble with them, so they don't matter. TLDR: Easy and interesting gut for STEM majors.",
    "Yes, I would recommend Psych 110 to another student. It's a great course whether you want to major in psychology or not.",
    "Difficult course that has broad applications and is taught by engaged, skilled professor",
    "I would absolutely recommend Psych 110, particularly if you haven't done psych before, because according to friends who took AP psych, a lot of the content is similar. Despite being a large lecture style class, Professor Chun manages to engage his audience with interactive presentations, humor, and insightfullness. Great class!",
    "I would recommend this course to a fellow student. Prof. Chun is excellent.",
    "Yes. I would recommend PSYC 110, but not to students that are not willing to do the readings. I also thought it would be a good way to diversify my humanities-heavy course load. This goal was--to some extent--achieved. I would also recommend this course to students that DO NOT have background knowledge of psychology or Malcolm Gladwell's books. Overall, a worthwhile and fun course. It is also a great opportunity to share knowledge with friends via study groups, etc. because it is a large lecture class. Professor Chun is a great instructor and the grading process is very fair.",
    "I enjoyed Psyc 110, but I would warn fellow students not to fall victim to the hype. Friends continually raved about this course to me this past fall, which established high expecations for Psyc 110 that just weren't met this semester. I left this class contented, now possessing a few cute psychological anecdotes to share in conversation, but without feeling I had really gone beneath the surface. Psyc 110 is fun, however, it is not quite as informative or inspiring as I would have hoped.",
    "It is a very interesting class that allows you to experience psychology rather than just learn it",
    "This class is fantastic. You will definitely learn a lot in this class, but be warned: you need to keep up with the reading. The book is actually very well written, so it's not too bad. I would take this class if you can, but take this class Credit\/D\/Fail. It takes some of the pressure off because the class is graded fairly intensely. All-in-all, though, a really excellent course.",
    "Absolutely take this class. Marvin Chun is a fantastic lecturer and got a round of applause after every class. I highly recommend it, even if you already took AP psych. The class is really easy, but worth it.",
    "DEFINITELY TAKE THIS CLASS WITH PROF. CHUN. This class should be taken freshmen or sophomore year for the maximum benefit. I seriously would reconsider being a psych major or double major with psych if I had taken this earlier rather than during senior year. Professor Chun also sprinkles some life advice into his lectures which I think makes going to class that much more important and enjoyable.",
    "I would recommend the class to any other student. I think it's a class that should definitely be taken before you graduate Yale.",
    "PSYCH 110 should be called \"Self-Help for Yalies.\" When I first told my parents that I was taking Introduction to Psychology, I could hear their rueful, indulgent smile through the phone; they viewed psychology as both a folly and a prerogative of the wandering liberal arts college student. However I quickly realized that psychology is not the kind of course that you take once and then forget about as you progress to more \"practical\" and \"applicable\" subjects. Psychology is the study of why people do what they do, and as long as there are people contributing to and learning from other disciplines, psychology will underpin them. Professor Chun was right in underscoring that \"psychology is relevant.\" I would recommend this class because of its sheer audacity. It tries to address almost every important, persistent question you've formulated by age 18: How can I be happier? Why does evil exist? Is nature or nurture responsible for the way that I am? Why can't I dispense with sleep in order to be more productive? How can I remember information with more clarity and longevity? One drawback of the class is that it must sacrifice depth in order to achieve this breadth, but I'd say the caliber of the textbook and the availability and approachability of TFs and Professor Chun provide plenty of resources to field your remaining questions. Speaking of Professor Chun, he should be reason enough to take this class. This is a teacher who knows his audience frighteningly well and he goes out of his way to frame every topic in the terms most relevant to us. For example, Professor Chun packaged his sleep lecture as a pitch to convince us why we needed more than the widely accepted six hours of sleep each night. Similarly he emphasized that the lecture on \"weapons of persuasion\" was pertinent to anyone who participated in campaigns that ranged from social justice to politics, which accounted for just about every single Yalie listening to him.",
    "I highly recommend taking PSYC 110 if you have any interest in psychology whatsoever. It may not entirely convince you to switch your major to psychology, but it is a great class for the basic understanding of psych.",
    "I would only recommend PSYC 110 to a student who was planning to major in Psychology. Other than that, I would steer clear of the class unless you find psychology very interesting and are willing to put in some work.",
    "Very recommendable if you're willing to do the work, see above.",
    "I'd never taken a psychology class before, but I feel like I got a solid overview of the field in intro psych. Some of the lectures flowed into each other, but there was also variety of topics. I feel like I learned something about myself too.",
    "Psych 110 is a good introduction to psychology, especially for those who are not familiar with the topic. Professor Chun is obviously passionate about psychology and I would highly recommend any class that he teaches. The course readings are a good bit of work, but the class was engaging and interesting.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. I always looked forward to class, and the lectures went by very quickly.",
    "The name of the course says it all: the class is an overview of the basic elements of psychology, including topics like emotional intelligence, prejudice etc. I would definitely recommend this course, but I would suggest taking the course Credit D.",
    "Fun class, just do the work.",
    "awesome class, take it regardless of whether or not you want to be a psych major. you can apply alot of it to your life. definitely recommended",
    "All the stuff people say about the class is true, it's amazing, take it. You have to put the effort in, certainly, but it's a ton of fun and teaches you a bunch of stuff that it either just really interesting or really applicable to your life. I mean, we're learning about things like how memory works and thought biases, which are literally relevant to everything in your life.",
    "This course is pretty ideal for a college course. It is interesting relevant and well taught. it even is not that much of a work load if you stay on top of it. I would definitely recommend it to another and suggest you take it with Chun.",
    "A very quick survey course of different fields in psychology. Interesting at the intro level, but not anything mind-blowing or super cool."
