    "This course is populated with students in the management and policy tracks. However, it does not seem as if the material is targeted to these students. It is a data management class which does not do a good job at teaching SAS. In retrospect, Mayur's class would be a better class to take if the intention is for policy people to learn SAS>",
    "Although I did fine on the midterm, I felt like I had to cram for it because our lab assignments did not reinforce the important concepts learned in lecture. Also, I don't think the lectures fully prepared us for making the decisions we had to make during the final group project. I found the project to be a very frustrating experience. There were only two of us in my group that really understood the principles behind the analysis and how to use SAS, which meant that we had to do the bulk of the work and repeatedly explain to the rest of the group what we were doing. Because I had to spend so much time re-writing our paper and revising the powerpoint presentation and explaining the analysis to everyone, it would have been easier if I had just done the project myself, and it probably would have turned out better. Working on the group project, it was clear to me that some people clearly will leave that class not understanding the basics of research methods. And it's unfair to punish those of us who did learn by assigning us to random groups. It would have been a much more enjoyable experience if we could have chosen our groups.",
    "The midterm \"quiz\" was extremely difficult",
    "I learned a lot from this course from both a SAS standpoint and a statistics standpoint. The term project tied these aspects together nicely and the proposal project provided us with a real world example.",
    "Could probably be combined with biostats II, they are a little redundant. The labs should also probably be in the computer labs because it is not very helpful to learn the stuff when you don't have SAS in front of you.",
    "Strengths: SAS immersion. Helps you understand why you're learning the system and what it's good for. The semester project was a great hands-on learning experience...you really get to apply the concepts you've learned. You'll surprise yourself with what you're able to to.Weaknesses: These concepts are hard and they are taught FAST. It's hard to keep up. Biostats II is a nice compliment to this course as it moves a little slower and reinforces what this course taught.",
    "I did not care for the topic, but it was manageable.",
    "Overall, this course is very useful and you learn a lot of skills. However, I felt that we just touched upon the surface of a lot of important topics and wish we had more time to go further in-depth.",
    "Andy did a great job of explaining complex concepts and providing a wide range of valuable information on research methodology.",
    "The course was poorly put together. Our \"lab\" consisted of sitting in a classroom and looking at a powerpoint, and then we were sent off to the computer labs outside of class time and on our own. This seems like poor course structure because \"Data Management,\" the equivalent course for students that are not HPA or HMP, has their labs led by labs in the computer lab where they can actually access TAs and help during labs which is necessary when learning SAS.",
    "Great overview of health services research and analysis methods.",
    "Important material and I definitly got a better handle on SAS and study design.",
    "It's good, but not great. I think Andy did the course a disservice by cutting back on the number of labs. I know that he did this to save students time, but most of this material is best learned by doing. I wish I had been forced to spend time learning the concepts by doing labs. If more labs are added, they should be worth more of the final grade. They take a lot of time. Rather than having one big midterm, I think the material should be broken down into two smaller quizzes.",
    "The course is very good. I actually felt like I learned things that Biostats 2 attempted to teach but didn't explain very well. Great to have experience with SAS. It actually made sense in this class and didn't in biostats.Strength: repetition of material. Lecture slides were good. Assignments were pretty helpfulWeakness: there were times when the material felt disjointed. Lab sections weren't that helpful, particularly since they weren't in lab.",
    "This course was strong in that the topics were relevant and useful. I hated it at first because it went so quickly and I am not particularly keen on SAS, but I realized as the semester went out how useful it can be even if I don't plan on using SAS during my career.",
    "Pretty good: I definitely got better at SAS and interpreting regressions. Not all the way there, but way better. This class covers a LOT of information.",
    "EXTREMELY helpful in understanding linear regression.Helpful in understanding logistic regression as well - could have been better in this area. Definitely good when taken in conjunction with Stats II.",
    "Strengths: I learned A LOT of new information that will presumably be useful in my future research endeavors.Weaknesses: slides often unclear, information overload",
    "great! an absolute must and completely took the place of biostats 2. i learned a tremendous amount and all the basics i need for internship\/job",
    "The course duplicates what is learned in Biostats. It really helped me learn SAS and better understand what the outputs really mean. I learned a great deal even though I dragged my feet along the way. I felt that the course neglected qualitative methods, though, leaving a big knowledge gap.",
    "this course is very specific and scientific and SAS related. It focuses on the methodology of a research approach.",
    "This is a course that covers important topics, but it does not cover them well or even thoroughly. The class rushes through topics and the instructor does not always convey topics in a readily accessible manner. When the tests come, it is often hard to piece together what - if anything - you have learned. It's cursory and all over the place.",
    "Lectures were confusing--too much information thrown at me. It felt like the lectures were more like \"review sessions\" for people who already knew all of the material, not 1st year MPH students who didn't know any of it (aka course not aimed at the appropriate audience). SAS assignments lacked guidance and the \"lab\" lectures were not helpful for completing the assignments. Also FOUR HOURS of lecture a week was completely EXCESSIVE! I suggest actually having the \"lab\" portion of the course actually taught in a computer lab, and using SAS, instead of listening to more lecture material that throws way too much information at the students (that they will never use or need to know)."

   "comments": [
    "Instructor: Andrew Epstein \u00a0He is good one-on-one but in the classroom setting, he discourages questions by making the student who asks the question feel stupid.I have never had a professor who was so blatant about the fact that he thinks that his students are incompetent.",
    "Instructor: Andrew Epstein \u00a0I think we could have used more guidance when we were working on the analysis of our survey project.",
    "Instructor: Andrew Epstein \u00a0Easy to talk to , easy to access",
    "Instructor: Andrew Epstein \u00a0The professor moved quickly when subject matter became more complex which hampered learning, but was readily available to explain concepts independently.",
    "Instructor: Andrew Epstein \u00a0Andy is obviously a very smart guy but at points had trouble explaining things to people without a health economics\/data\/statistics background. Even his examples to clarify things would lose people. I thought the course was laid out well and walked us through the concepts logically and presented a fairly complete picture at course end.The midterm for this course was excellent. The median grade was a 58 and if you got above a 72 then you received an honors mark. It was the first exam that I took that really challenged my knowledge of concepts and required that I know the intricacies and complications therein. Every student felt as though the exam was difficult and that's the way that exams at the graduate level should be.",
    "Instructor: Andrew Epstein \u00a0Good instructor, moved a little too fast through some of the material toward the end though. We probably could have spent less time on lin reg in the beginning of the course since we cover that extensively in stats I.",
    "Instructor: Andrew Epstein \u00a0He's a great teacher. He's very funny which is refreshing at YSPH. My one complaint about him is that is teaches complex stuff very quickly. I think he lost the entire class, save a few folks, when he taught logistic regression. When he received feedback that a majority of us were lost, he did review it - but at the same incomprehensible speed.He's a smart guy - just has to remember that we are not at all familiar with regression analysis and he needs to slow down.",
    "Instructor: Andrew Epstein \u00a0Andy is a great instructor and very receptive to students' concerns and questions. He covers material really fast, but if you have questions he's always more than happy to answer them another time.",
    "Instructor: Andrew Epstein \u00a0He is awesome and will be missed.",
    "Instructor: Andrew Epstein \u00a0The instructor seemed as though he had mentally checked out of the course since he will be leaving the school.",
    "Instructor: Andrew Epstein \u00a0Funny and entertaining. I would have loved more examples from articles \/ journal.",
    "Instructor: Andrew Epstein \u00a0He was pretty good. I think one small way to improve would be to tell a more consistent story or narrative to thread the lectures together.",
    "Instructor: Andrew Epstein \u00a0Andy is a great professor. He is extremely knowledgable and passionate about health services research.",
    "Instructor: Andrew Epstein \u00a0Great. Good at explaining things and responding to questions. Funny and witty. Made class entertaining most of the time",
    "Instructor: Andrew Epstein \u00a0He's obviously very knowledgeable on the subject matter, but he went very quickly. And, like all other EPH professors, it seemed like he was not interested in teaching - more like he is focused on research but ran downstairs twice a week to teach before running back to the office.",
    "Instructor: Andrew Epstein \u00a0He's a pretty good instructor--involves the class quite a bit, and his dry sense of humor made things interesting. The problem with that is that sometimes it's hard to tell whether or not he is making fun of you.",
    "Instructor: Andrew Epstein \u00a0Andy was good overall. His expectations were clear with regards to the homeworks and the group project, but I felt TOTALLY unprepared for the midterm and individual final project. I had no idea what to expect on the midterm. He should have provided practice midterms with answers. I also didn't know really what he wanted from the individual final project and felt a little lost. It was so great when he really drilled linear regression interpretation into us. I wish he did the same thing for logistic regression because I'm not quite as comfortable with it. Andy often talked waaaaayyyyy too fast and sometimes at such a high level that the ENTIRE CLASS was confused and had no idea what was going on. Then he would ask if we had any questions and I felt like...where do I even begin with the questions... I wasso confused that I didn't even know what I didn't know.... which was an awful feeling. Sometimes he was purposefully vague with answers to questions about the group project, which was frustrating but not as much as not knowing what was expected of me with regards to the individual project.",
    "Instructor: Andrew Epstein \u00a0strengths: socratic method. Epstein painfully drilled us on linear regression interpretation, with success. This was a very good exercise that should be encouraged in other classes.weaknesses: lacking diff in diff examples relevant to health policy. It would have been nice to read, practice or observe other studies that illustrate this evaluation method which compares projectsEpstein should write a textbook. Students enjoy his presentations but, rely on ppt.s to keep up, adding a plethora of notes in the margins. Reliance on class notes begets within group differences that could be avoided through a common text. The Allison text that Epstein recommended did not follow the class format or examples and i did not find it useful",
    "Instructor: Andrew Epstein \u00a0Excellent one-on-one. Not consistently helpful for large group lectures.",
    "Instructor: Andrew Epstein \u00a0Strengths: energetic, available, helpful, provided timely feedback on assignmentsWeaknesses: lectures often unclear or confusing, specifically the last half of the course, did not feel prepared for the exam (quiz)",
    "Instructor: Andrew Epstein \u00a0Andy is awesome, sorry to see him go.",
    "Instructor: Andrew Epstein \u00a0He is really good, though he sometimes explains things too quickly so we are left completely clueless. However, he invited us to tell him or Artem (TA) any problems we had with his teaching, and he was responsive to feedback.",
    "Instructor: Andrew Epstein \u00a0Dr Epstein is very knowledgeable and he encourages the class participation.",
    "Instructor: Andrew Epstein \u00a0Insensitive and overly casual instructor. He expects everyone in the class to already know the material and treats questions harshly. His manner of having students call on each other to answer questions, rather than answering and explaining them himself leaves students feeling confused and frustrated.",
    "Instructor: Andrew Epstein \u00a0He did not aim his lectures at the appropriate audience. He taught the material like we already knew what he was talking about (like a review class). I felt completely confused during lectures. Also, his assignments lacked congruity."

    "This course places statistics into a more easily accessible realm. It still may seem a little out there for management students but the second years state that this class proved to be very valuable over their summer internships and I believe them. This course also has the added perk of being biostatistics II on steroids so will allow you to skip half the lectures for that course.I would recommend this course to first year students.",
    "It was good to acquaint you better with SAS.",
    "If you're in policy or mgmt, this course is required. I would certainly recommend taking it in your first year at YSPH. It is valuable and will help you with classes down the line. Don't wait!",
    "This course will teach you more about how to utilize linear and logistic regression in data analysis and also how SAS can be useful. I would recommend this course to a fellow student; however, another data analysis course would probably be a good idea because a lot oftopics are just briefly touched upon in this class.",
