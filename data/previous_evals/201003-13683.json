    "This course is really great for people who haven't been exposed to sociology. It taught me how to look at things from another perspective.",
    "SOCY 311 is a great class to take. The assigned readings and writings are all very reasonable. If you are looking for a class that examines the implications of technology for society, this is definitely it. Overall, a great class, and also a topic that makes for great conversation in the dining hall.",
    "Take it! An excellent class--probably the best I've taken this semester. Prof. Almeling is an expert and engaging lecturer; the reading material is fascinating and nothing like you'll learn in any other course; and the whole course is generally very well organized to be insightful and enjoyable. There's writing to do every week, but it's very doable.",
    "One of my favorite classes taken so far at Yale. The course is interdisciplinary and brings in interesting readings about an important contemporary issue. Professor Almeling and Carolyn do an excellent job introducing sociological terms for non-majors. Since this is a writing intensive course, there are weekly reading responses that challenge you to concisely integrate and discuss a lot of material which can take a little getting used to.",
    "This class is very interesting to explore the meaning genetics from a sociological standpoint. It will really make you challenge the validity of the natural sciences through scientific articles published by geneticist and critiques of those articles. The scientific stuff is short and easy to understand. There's also a lot of sociology reading which is interesting and it tries to break down these ideas behind science and genetics in interesting ways. This class is a lot ofwork though: the reading responses are no joke, 250 words period, but they have to be an awesome 250 words. This class makes you earn the WR credit and also a learn a lot. You will be able to defend why race is not biologically based but we still have phenotypic differences by the end of this class. You will be able to defend how gender norms are reified by genetics after taking this class.",
    "Yes! I took this class on a lark, but it ended up being my favorite of the semester. The readings are interesting, class discussions are fascinating, and Rene and Carolyn are both great. The workload is actually not bad for a seminar (~100 pages a week), and definitely worth the effort.",
    "Excellent class. I definitely recommend it. Workload included weekly reading responses (just 250 words) and a final paper. You need to put effort into doing the readings and class discussion but it is really interesting and totally worth it. Genetic testing has a lot of components to it including heritable diseases, commercial testing, and paternity testing. If the material sounds even a little bit interesting to you, take it, even if you have no background or strong passion for the subject.",
    "I wouldn't really recommend this class unless you are extremely interested in the topic. The readings were often tedious, discussion centered on some of the same few issues all semesters, and the whole thing felt like there wasn't a goal in mind. I also totally didn't understand the expectations for grading.",
    "Take this class if you are at all interested in the subject matter - Prof. Almeling is great, and it really challenges you to evaluate the role of genetics\/genetic testing in our culture."
