    "I will definitely recommend this class. The working load is reasonable and grading is fair.",
    "If the course continues to be taught with an introduction to igneous and metamorphic rocks, it is maybe redundant with some undergraduate courses but for a non-geologist entering graduate student would provide a very solid foundation in \"rock knowledge\".For more experienced geologists, the course provides higher-level problem solving than was assigned in undergraduate courses.",
    "I highly recommend this course to other students because the content of this course is basic to geosciences and the professor has the ability to guide you through all the abstract concepts in petrology.",
    "A thorough introduction into the fundamental science behind understanding rock formation and evolution."
