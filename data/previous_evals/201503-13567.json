    "I was very disappointed in the course. I learned very little from the material and was not challenged. The syllabus did not accurately represent what was covered in the course. The material was very watered down and elementary. We did not have assignments or readings that helped us to engage with and learn the material.",
    "Professor Khalil really cares about student learning. He was always willing to meet with students at any time to discuss their term papers, and he offered helpful advice for how to continue.",
    "Professor Khalil's lectures were very interesting. More course readings would have been welcome.",
    "Professor Khalil struggled in teaching us how to conduct risk assessments. He was vague and never used case studies to illustrate how to apply the methodologies. This was very sad because he such a sweet man and seemed to enjoy teaching, he just couldn't do it well. The guest lecture we had and all the lectures on renewable energies were irrelevant and had nothing to with risk assessments whatsoever but with his green energy class he teaches online in the summer. He kept trying to sell himself to us but should've done it In a more educational way.",
    "Although the professor is very opened to help and orient students throughout the course, I think that the course wasnt well structured. The readings and assignments were not alligned with the theory revised in class. Environmental Risk Assessment is best learned through applied work, implementing risk assessment models to real world cases. We did not apply the models until the final term project, which I thought it was a weakness. The course is also mostly appropriate for students interested in industrial operation or public health. In my case as a land manager, I see less opportunities for applying these type of tools on my field."

    "A little more focus on environmental issues outside the industrial field",
    "The material was horrendous and Ill-taught and Ill-chosen",
    "I feel that because we weren't in the engineering school that the professor was afraid to dive too deeply into the risk assessment methodologies. I wish we could have had more assignments focusing on the methodologies we learned in class",
    "Sometimes the lectures were a bit unclear.",
    "Contents don't fit MEM profile. Teacher doesn't have empathy purr communication skills. Too much nuclear.",
    "Could have had more readings on the pros and cons of different risk tools (if there are such things) or more specific discussion of the benefits of using one over the other in different contexts. Also more updated material - risk is a hot topic in sustainability consulting right now - how is this being applied for business leaders and governments currently? Has the field changed?",

Environmental Risk Assessment was not so much of my interest as a land management or biodiversity conservation oriented student. Yehia Khalil is very opened to help students through the final term project and is a dedicated instructor. The course does not focus on the practical application of ERA methods, but provides an overview of the different methods and models used in this field."
