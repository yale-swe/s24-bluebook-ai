    "If one seeks to understand America, one should endeavor to understand Britain and its legacy.",
    "No. I would not recommend this course with James Vaughn. The weekly readings were very heavy and class sessions almost entirely consisted of his lectures and difficult questions. Vaughn also had a tendency to run class very late, often far longer than 5 or 10 minutes past 5:20. There are better seminars out there.",
    "I would definitely recommend it to another student. If you are interested in European history, it is great. You cover a very vast period of time. And it is all related and linked by the common theme of the rise of capitalism.",
    "It's a good class, although not entirely what I expected going into it. The readings are really interesting and Prof. Vaughn provides a lot of help with the term paper. That being said, I expected the course to be an examination of the development of the British Empire, when it is more about the links between the growth of the British Empire and the growth of modernity."
