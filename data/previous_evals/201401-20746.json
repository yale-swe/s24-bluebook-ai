    "Hard. Harder than 110 because you have to remember all of the characters and grammar structures from 110 as well. Otherwise almost the exact same format with daily quizzes and biweekly tests. If you took 110, you have to take this, so enjoy!",
    "It's incredible how far we've come in 2 semesters. Just keep up with you work!!",
    "Expect about 2 hours of homework per day, between memorizing characters and dialogues, and the daily homework. Working ahead really helps, but ultimately you HAVE to stay on top of the work or this class will bury you. That being said, it's amazingly fun and I found it really fulfilling.",
    "You will work so hard but you will learn an incredibly valuable skill. Do it.",
    "Don't fear the workload. You fall into a rhythm, and there's no busy work.",
    "Very intensive course but worth it. You'll learn quickly.",
    "This class is great for you to better your Chinese. It definitely is rigorous and fast-paced, so expect to have lots of work to complete. There will constantly be quizzes and narratives to memorize and recite, but you will definitely improve your Chinese language skills. The professors are all so fun and willing to work with you, so you'll enjoy your time!"
