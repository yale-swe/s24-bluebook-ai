    "A hidden gem of a math class at Yale. It really covers some interesting topics and is taught fairly.",
    "I'm not sure. I took this class to learn some linear algebra (not required for my major), but I'm not sure I left with a good grasp of it.",
    "I would recommend it. The homework is difficult and there is a good amount of it, but the tests are relatively easy and the course will teach you what you need to know.",
    "Peter Schultheiss, or \"the Tank,\" is a legend. He's full of smiles, classy, and you would never guess his age (over 90, if you haven't heard). He teaches the class with polish and style, and if you pay attention, you will succeed in the course.",
    "Yes. The psets, though numerous, are not bad at all; the two midterms are relatively easy too if you put in the time. The final was a little harder than expected, but manageable as well. I think overall it's a very straight-forward and well-taught math class, though how applicable I can't say since I'm not a science student. If you enjoy doing math problems and want another way to think through problems (or just want to take a break from writing papers), I would absolutely recommend this!",
    "Take it, it is a very useful math to learn. keep up with the homework.",
    "You can get by not going, but if you actually want to learn the material and do well, don't let the idea that other student skip a lot get to you and go, because its actually very interesting material.",
    "matrices, some proofs, and differential equations.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who needs to take a linear algebra course for their major - or even if they are just interested! Linear algebra is very different from calculus - the computations are much easier, but the concepts (working in so many dimensions, seeing how spaces are perpendicular to each other) are much more difficult. If at first the material seems hard, go slowly through the textbook or watch the MIT lectures online. The first test is extremely easy, but it does get harder from there. Overall I had no major complaints about this course - although the three PSETS a week is pretty annoying.",
    "Total Gut!",
    "MATH 222 is a solid class. Schultheiss is a great professor. A problem set is assigned for every class, but they're always short - won't take you more than an hour. The second exam is a lot harder than the first one, and the final is sort of a mix, but is a fair exam. Make sure to go to class! Schultheiss diverges from the material in the book (the types of questions on exams are the types that he talks about in class, not the book's type). However, going to class shouldn't be too bad at 10:30, and the lectures are pretty interesting.",
    "Math 222 is a comprehensive survey of basic linear algebra that will teach you the foundation for the mathematical field. I would recommend it if the student needs to take it for credit or a pre-rec, or if the student is just interested in learning about an interesting field of mathematics.",
    "Take it, good and important math class, pay attention to schultheiss though. First midterm is a joke, second midterm and final are way harder.",
    "A student will do well in this course if she (a) is able to understand Professor Schultheiss's lectures or (b) watches W. Gilbert Strang's lectures online. Strang, the author of 222's textbook, explains concepts by first doing a simple example to show that it is true - Prof Schultheiss goes immediately to the proof, and rarely stops to give students time to let it sink in. The student will do well on the exams if he prepares using Schultheiss's practice tests.",
    "MTH 222 is an excellent overview course in linear algebra. If you take it, take it with Professor Schultheiss. He's an excellent professor who explains everything clearly. The problem sets, though many, do not take much time, and having them frequently really helps you solidify your understanding of the material. Linear algebra as a topic\/field is a really useful area of math with applications to a ton of different other academic fields, so anyone who plans to do anything quantitative in their studies or career should take this course.",
    "If you are looking for a math class to take, this is a great course! The lectures can get a bit confusing sometimes, but you can always read the book or look at the Strang MIT lectures online. Schultheiss is a very good instructor, and if you need the class, take it!",
    "Standard linear algebra course with a LOT of self study because the lectures are fairly useless. Office hours are better. Go to Strang. For someone who breezed through multivar and spent a lot of her time in high school doing AMCs and AIME type math, I was surprised to be struggling in linear algebra. The exams are fairly easy though. Just don't expect to get a deep and thorough understanding of it all.",
    "If you're not sure what linear algebra to choose, this is a good one because it touches on the applications as well as the math behind it.",
    "Definitely! This was a great introduction both to practical applications (including least squares regression, the SVD, Fourier series, differential equations) and some of the deeper ideas (projection, spaces, similarity). The daily small psets made the class very low-stress. Overall a fun and extremely useful class.",
    "This class had 3 problems sets a week which became a grind. Exams were not much like problem sets and paying attention in class is a must. Overall linear algebra is interesting.",
    "Nobody really takes this class to take it; it's a prerequisite for something else, whether it be another class or a major. It's much easier than 225 unless you thrive in proofs. It's also much easier than 120 (which most people take before). If there's another class you want to take but need to take 222 first, it won't ruin your life.",
    "Solid class if you need to take linear algebra or are interested in learning more about it. It could definitely help you understand more difficult computation classes like Differential Equations.",
    "Great tour of linear algebra with a STRONG STRONG focus on applications.",
    "An applications-focused introduction to linear algebra; daily problem sets aren't bad at all and make sure you keep up with the material; Prof. Schultheiss is a wonderfully clear lecturer and is great at answering questions; tests are straightforward and not too theoretical",
    "Very useful",
    "This class is an awesome introduction to applied mathematics in a non-intense setting. Professor Schultheiss is amazing and really cares about his students success in the class. Definitely take this class!",
    "As I said in my review: I felt like I learnt a lot. It's true that I had to count on MIT Lectures and be a self-learner all the time (it's very time consuming if you're actually willing to learn, as you have to study on your own). Schulltheiss' method of having p-sets due everyday is very helpful in keeping up with lectures, even though it's overwhelming. The fact that Schulltheiss' section does not have a website on classes*v2 and that he's not a big fan of emails is a terrible down side, because you can never reach the professor or the materials online. He's a nice person and helpful in office hours, although his lectures are not helpful at all in learning the material for most of the times. He is always very happy in helping students and, as he might be in his 80's or 90's, you might feel like he's kind of a grandpa. If I was supposed to take this class, I'd probably take the other section, but MATH 222 wasn't my worst class this semester anyway.",
    "If you have taken ENAS 194: DiffQ before, this class is going to be pretty redundant. I wouldn't recommend taking this class after DiffQ - look for a different math class instead because you are going to be bored out of your mind. That said - if you are still going to take AMTH 222, Schultheiss teaches the easiest section. The weekly psets are a joke, you can just fake learning and finish them. But then you're just screwed for the exams (which if you know the material are extremely easy). Also - do this early on: watch the Strang MIT open courseware lectures (even better in 2x speed). Go to class, drop off PSET, and watch the equivalent Strang video in Ground Cafe. You will be MUCH better off in the class.",
    "I would not recommend this class with Professor Schultheiss. The subject material of Linear Algebra has the potential to be incredibly useful but the way it was taught it remained incredibly obscure. Homework is assigned daily in this class and is usually only 3-5 textbook questions, so the workload is very manageable. There are three exams: the first midterm is deceptively easy and straightforward. Professor Schultheiss has taught this class for a very long time, and he clearly knows his stuff, but he seems to have lost touch with the idea that his students are only learning it for the first time. He does not take the time to truly explain the intuition or relevance behind the concepts. He also does not use Classes v2 at all: it was necessary to come to class to copy down all the notes and assignments, but the time to actually understand what we wrote down came outside of class time.",
    "I would only recommend this course to students who need it for a requirement. Otherwise do not take it - it's disorganized and if you do not put effort in to listen and learn the material you will fall behind.",
    "I would recommend the class to someone who is looking for an applied linear algebra math course. The small homework assignments due daily help keep you on top of things."
