   "comments": [
    "If you're going to take this, you need to have thick skin. Louise does not beat around the bush, and she will be blunt with you. There's a certain amount of favoritism that happens in the classroom, in that she will pick a few people whose work she really likes, and they will get workshopped much more than is fair.",
    "If you get in, take it. Even if Gluck doesn't love your work, you will be writing better poems by the end of the term. And that's really all you should care about in picking writing classes.",
    "Poetry",
    "Absolutely. This is an intellectual and creative challenge \u0097 a poem and a response to a book of poetry are due each week. You get out of this class what you put into it, and the returns can be invaluable. The more time you spend on your poetry, the more you will be inspired to write (and revise and read) more. The format of actual class time (3 peer critiques per class) is wonderful. It's both exciting to read others' work and immensely helpful to have 15 different sets of eyes and poetic sensibilities responding to your work. I would recommend meeting with Louise as regularly as possibly (at least 2 or 3 times during the semester) to brainstorm possibilities for revisions \u0097 it's a very helpful supplement to the critiques that take place during class.",
    "Take this if it is the only thing you do at this school. Why are you even reading this.",
    "Every week three poems are chosen, and Louise holds court over them--students providing input. More valuable than the class comments are Louise's written comments--she will comment not only on the new poem you submit that week, but on any poems you submit for revisal. She took the time to comment on several of my poems a week. If you put in the effort she will reward you with great guidance.",
    "This is a tough class, though a good one. I felt that I improved as a poet and enjoyed my fellow students' work - but it's kind of like trial by fire. Don't take yourself too seriously. Be prepared to re-work, and re-re-work, poems. Work ahead of time if you can (I couldn't always). Do take the class, though... one of Yale's best on offer."
