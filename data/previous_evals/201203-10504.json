    "No I would not recommend it to a grad student because it took too much time out of lab (the weekly discussion meetings).",
    "Yes. The graduate discussion sessions were helpful.",
    "Yes, it's very helpful, but you have to be prepared, because it is quite demanding.",
    "I definitely recommend this class to my colleagues. The workload is high, but definitely the class is valuable.",
    "It is an intro course to physiology. Yes.",
    "Great, extremely comprehensive (and a little difficult) class, would recommend. Great lecturers.",
    "I would say it is a detailed look at physiology from a cellular perspective. I would recommend the course.",
    "I took the course only to satisfy a departmental requirement, but I believe that it is a good course, and would suggest it to anyone who needs to fulfill a similar requirement.",
    "Yes, crucial to understand physiology!!!",
    "I think it was a great overview course. If you can spare the class, I think a solid foundation in physiology is relevant to anyone whose work relates to medicine.",
    "I would recommend it to a student if the course material were directly related to their studies and the lacked knowledge of much of the material covered in the class.",
    "Class covering most organ systems and their functions, great knowledge for undergraduate and graduate science students. Many opportunities to learn the material. I would recommend it to others.",
    "It's unfortunate that this class has to be something different for so many groups of students - I don't think it was \"engineering\" enough for me, but I can't say how the premed\/physiology people would respond to the changes I would want. I would have liked to actually gotten my hands dirty with modeling and whatnot, and maybe a bit less memorization.",
    "If you are new to physiology I would recommend this but it lacks a lot of detail needed for actual research."

   "comments": [
    "I haven't chosen a department yet.",
    "It helped learn many important concepts in organ\/cellular physiology.",
    "This course offers me a very good transition of basic knowledge from my native language into English, also it enhances my understanding of physiological system which is very crucial for my research",
    "The course covers a broad range of topics including an interesting overview on the cardiovascular system, which is the my main area of interest. I think it has been very helpful to provide some general context to what I read during my research activity.",
    "I learned more than I was expecting to. I had already taken courses in both systems physiology and cellular physiology, but this course provided a nice bridge between the two. I think this course will be useful for my dissertation because an overall knowledge of physiology will allow me to better tailor my work to have more of an impact.",
    "Brought me up to speed for my biomedical engineering research. Helped me to put my research into perspective",
    "I find it more applicable in my life than in my research at the moment, but it gave a good foundation for understanding what may be medically relevant.",
    "Knowledge on the organ systems involved in my research and knowledge on other subjects covered by researchers in my department.",
    "Probably will not contribute at all to my research. It would have been more useful to me in an engineering context.",
    "I have already had undergraduate physiology so this course was more of a recap."
