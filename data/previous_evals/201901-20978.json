    "I think the course covers a lot, which I think is really helpful",
    "Strengths: 1. Good communication skills by professor. 2. General knowledge of the Earth's history was appreciated for students who may have not had a background in Earth sciences. Weaknesses\/Improvements: 1. Assignment of relevant weekly readings would have helped. 2. Less relevance could have been given to strong form and weak form coding methods, which would have given more time to spent on problems in geodynamics."

    "Yes, definitely. Even though the course was difficult and the term paper and coding assignment took longer hours than expected, I learned a lot from the course. It is essential for any PhD student to understand the geodynamics of the Earth and this course ensures that."
