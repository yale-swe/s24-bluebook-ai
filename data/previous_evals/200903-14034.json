    "Health disparities is an excellent course that motivates in-class discussion and a thorough understanding in various techniques at local, state, and national levels to improve legal policy and programming to address disparities. Capping the class size is a fantastic idea as it promotes deeper discussion and building a knowledge base amongst a few peers in this substantive area. There is a LOT of reading, but at least skimming them helps facilitate higher quality discussion, more engaging presentations and papers.I can't think of any recommendations for improvement!",
    "I loved the topic of this course, but feel there is a better way to teach about the complexity of the topic than just assigning a ridiculous amount of reading.",
    "excellent! where as many classes identify health disparities as fact but go no farther this class provided a multifaceted examination of the explanations for why this occurs across a number of disparities, populations, and levels.",
    "This course is EXCELLENT. I would highly recommend it. The strengths are the small class size and discussion based format. I cannot think of any weaknesses right now.",
    "Strength: Very rigorous, attracted very motivated students, great discussions, fantastic instructor; Weaknesses: I would have liked to see more about policy responses and interventions. We spent so much time talking about the problem as opposed to potential solutions.",
    "A wonderful course--my favorite at EPH. Although there was a lot of reading (sometimes almost 400 pages) and writing (2 single spaced pages a week in addition to the final paper), I really learned a lot.More specific feedback was given to Shelley last week.",
    "This was the most intellectually stimulating, thought-provoking, and useful class I have taken at YSPH!I have no critiques. I even loved writing to final paper!My only structural-level critique is that I think that students who take this course should not have to take CDE 505a. The same concepts are covered (in much more thought-provoking detail). I learned more in one two-hour discussion each week in this course than I did in 3 hours of lecture\/section plus concept sheet composing time. I would urge the administration to review this idea. SBS is an unnecessary pre-requisite, particularly for students with a sincere interest in health disparities and experience (either through reading and reserach, or in the the field).",
    "THE BEST COURSE I HAVE TAKEN AT EPH-- it was incredible. Shelley and Beth were amazing instructors, the reading was SO GOOD- the most applicable and appropriate selections I've been asked to read in this program, great discussions, and fair assignments",
    "This class was wonderful. I learned a lot from the readings, from my classmates and from Shelley. I have two main complaints about the class:(1) There was way too much reading. I understand that it is difficult to pare down the reading list because all of the readings are so interesting, but there is no way for students to complete all of the readings. Most of the students ended up just skimming abstracts or skipping readings altogether. It would be better if the required readings were cut down so that students could actually complete all of the readings.(2) This class did not have a great enough policy focus. One of the main reasons that I took this class was to draw on Shelley's expertise in law, health policy and health advocacy. I was disappointed that this was not incorporated more into reading assignments and classroom discussions.One suggestion:Please create a summary powerpoint presentation or handout for each class to synthesize the main points of that week's readings.",
    "This was an incredible class. Professor Geballe is a wonderful teacher, and if you're willing to put in the time to finish the reading, it's a great course.",
    "This is the best class I have taken at EPH. The course is well organized and thought-provoking. The class discussions are fantastic and the professor is exceptional!",
    "This course is my favorite of all my public health courses thus far. Though the readings were extensive, they were thought provoking and all relevant to the topic of interest for the week. I loved class discussions, though sometimes they could get unfocused. I would only recommend slightly more discussion of particular readings for certain discussions, but for the most part I enjoyed the freedom to extrapolate from the readings and draw from experiences to form debates about relevant topics.",
    "Great. The material gets a little repetitive, and if you've taken any courses on race\/ethnicity or disparities, you may have already done some of the readings, but class discussions, papers, etc. are still interesting if the class dynamic is still good.Policy\/ solutions could be more of a focus.",
    "incredibly comprehensive with good breadth and depth.Might be improved with slightly less reading and more specific focus on the readings required. Additionally, I would have liked to have received feedback on the work I turned in before the final paper."

   "comments": [
    "Instructor: Shelley Geballe \u00a0Shelley is an amazing person with a lot of experience in working on health disparities, the law, and non-profits. She has a way of making everyone in the class feel comfortable to participate and elicits comments from even those who are reserved. In terms of sharing her expertise - I think only one or two other classes at Yale have given me this type of insight and education.",
    "Instructor: Shelley Geballe \u00a0Dr. Geballe becomes obviously biased towards certain students in the class and is rude in her interruptions when students she does not like try to add their oppinion to the class discussion.",
    "Instructor: Shelley Geballe \u00a0Shelley is great! She is very thoughtful and knowledgeable on this subject matter. Her feed back for students in insightful and on point. Her presentation of the material is an asset, however is also creates plenty of space for student discussion of the material.",
    "Instructor: Shelley Geballe \u00a0Shelley is absolutely wonderful. She is caring, knowledgeable, passionate, encouraging, and the list could go on and on. I would take another class of hers without hesitation.",
    "Instructor: Shelley Geballe \u00a0Absolutely fantastic. Although I very much enjoyed our class discussions and having students lead the discussions, I would have liked to hear more from Shelley - maybe at the beginning of each class as an introduction or at the end of each class as a wrap-up.",
    "Instructor: Shelley Geballe \u00a0Shelley and Beth were great! Shelley is one of the most passionate, intelligent, and caring professors that I've had.",
    "Instructor: Shelley Geballe \u00a0Shelley is one of the most dynamic and interesting women (not even just professors) I have met and had the pleasure of interacting with and learning from in a long time. She is a gem to have on faculty at YSPH and other professors could learn from her teaching style (particularly having extremely high expectations but expressing the utmost confidence in us as GRADUATE students and professionals). I really appreciate how much she encouraged our group to interact, with each of us bringing a unique background to the table.",
    "Instructor: Shelley Geballe \u00a0Great. An incredible instructor. It was wonderful hearing her feedback and learning from her in this course.",
    "Instructor: Shelley Geballe \u00a0Shelley is an incredible professor. She is knowledgable and experienced with the subject matter. She is passionate about the subject and about her students. Given her incredible background, I wish that Shelley would've shared more of her personal experiences in health law, policy and advocacy with the class. Given that this is a policy course, it would be good to incorporate more law and policy into the readings and class discussions. I really enjoyed having Shelley as a professor. Thanks for dinner at your house!",
    "Instructor: Shelley Geballe \u00a0Shelley is an incredible person\/teacher\/mentor. Her feedback on coursework is extremely useful, and she challenged us to push our ideas to the edge during seminar as well. She's one of the best professors I've had, definitely at EPH.",
    "Instructor: Shelley Geballe \u00a0Shelley Geballe is a FANTASTIC professor. She has a wealth of knowledge and experience, and is adept at sharing it with the class. She is an expert at leading class discussions.",
    "Instructor: Shelley Geballe \u00a0Shelley is a fabulous teacher. It is very evident that she cares about her students and is interested in helping us think critically about the topic. Her knowledge and experience is quite impressive, but in her feedback she makes students feel that we too have valuable experiences and novel feedback even in areas that she has worked extensively. I also like how she would direct the discussion when it seemed to go astray, and would address sensitive topics directly.",
    "Instructor: Shelley Geballe \u00a0Great, practical professor. Amazing feedback. Not too hands-on, but knows how to lead a discussion to prevent it from going off track.",
    "Instructor: Shelley Geballe \u00a0Incredibly receptive, sharp, and on point at all times. She doesn't miss a beat."

   "comments": [
    "The course is a lot of reading and writing - it is intense, but rewarding. If you are at all interested in disparities and discussing the complexities that arise in different areas of health inequity, I highly recommend the class! In all honesty, I think anyone in public health should have this sense and would benefit from taking this class regardless of the concentration he or she is in.",
    "I would recommend this class for people who have been disappointed by the lack of information in disparities in other classes. Though many classes acknowledge that the disparities exist based on numbers, this class takes a much closer look at the social mechanisms at play. This class is a good break from epi data sets and numbers...however the numbers are there to identify the problems and focus areas...",
    "This class is absolutely wonderful. It allows for great discussion of interesting topics every week. Shelley is passionate and knowledgeable and does a great job of running the class. I can honestly say that I learned more in this class than in any other, even with its discussion based format. I looked forward to going to class each week. There is a TON of reading each week, but the readings were very interesting. Definitely take this class, that is, if you can get in. It was extremely over-subscribed this semester and Shelley did a lot of cutting down of students.",
    "A fantastic course if you're up for the challenge and have the time to devote to the extensive reading list",
    "YES. I would.If you're at all interested in disparities, take this course. Although it's work intensive, you'll learn more by asking Shelley a question or asking for her feedback on your paper than you'll learn in another course over the entire semester.",
    "When Shelley says the first class that the reading load is quite heavy, do not let her fool you; this is an undestimation of the work load. However, all of the work is, without a doubt, worth every second it takes to complete.You will cover a diverse array of topics, covering an extraordinary amount of detail related to current and historical health disparities issues in a semester.Make no mistake: this is *not* a policy class; it is a class about society, economies, communities, health, and most importantly, our role in eliminating all of the different disparities identified throughout the semester.Best class at YSPH yet!",
    "HIGHLY RECOMMEND- If you are getting your degree in public health, you should take this course",
    "YES! TAKE THIS COURSE!",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone. A fabulous way to delve head deep into the health disparities literature to see where we are so far and how far we have to go before alleviating health disparities.",
    "Great course to give a good overview of current issues in disparities. Be prepared to do a lot of work - reading, writing, etc. You get out what you put in, and it will be a lot more enjoyable if you participate and engage with the material. Shelley is a refreshing addition to the EPH faculty.",
    "In a heartbeat."
