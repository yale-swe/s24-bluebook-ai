    "Everything about this class can effectively be summarized by Monty Python's Life of Brian. All one must do to understand this class is open up YouTube and search for \"Monty Python Latin Lesson.\" I guarantee the depiction is accurate, down to the fact the cast messes up their explanation of the locative case, which everyone is always confused about. I would definitely recommend this course to someone else, provided that this someone else realizes that 1. it is a lot of work 2. it is a lot of work 3. it is a lot of work. Otherwise, I actually enjoyed it a lot, learned a lot, realized my grammar is still very rudimentary, got to read some Livy and Virgil. There are definitely worse things out there."
