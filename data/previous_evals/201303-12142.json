    "I would recommend it for someone who is interested in thinking about the senses more critically, but honestly I am more likely to recommend the reading list than the class itself.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this class. I feel that it is an interesting new approach to environments (focusing on the senses, particularly non-visual ones) that can benefit a student in any area of study. It is a way to appreciate more everyday situations as well as any museum visit. I also feel like the the workload is appropriate and there is a great deal of flexibility in terms of making the final project fit in with whatever the student is most interested in. It's also a great way to visit some of Yale's cultural centers with the people that make them so strong."

   "comments": [
    "The readings for this class were incredibly helpful to me - I am hoping to incorporate theoretical approaches to the senses in my own work, so knowledge of this literature is extremely important. Also, the final project was the most fun I've had in a long time putting a project together!",
    "This course was tangentially related to my area of study, and while my final project was completely independent of any other assignment I had this semester, I can definitely see myself applying some of the principles learned in this class to future projects. At some level, this is all about the human body, and a consideration of sensory effects on the body is crucial for any architectural space. I even recommended some of the readings to one of my students from another class, because the readings represent a great theoretical foundation to understanding much about space and environments. Overall, I think this course was particularly helpful because it represents a completely new approach by understanding experience through sensory effects rather than just quantifiable characteristics."
