    "Take this class for Shelly Kagan alone. You read a really underread but influential philosopher, and get to engage in philosophy with one of Yale's most brilliant professors. Shelly grades harshly, but provides great feedback and really helps you grow as a student and writer.Definitely don't take if you want an easy A, or aren't interested in actually doing philosophy.",
    "great class - recommend it!",
    "This course should only be taken if you have already Normative Ethics with Shelly, as it's a bit focused in its approach and the material can get dry occasionally. Shelly's fantastic, though, and you should definitely take anything you can with him!",
    "Careful study of Sigwick's Methods of Ethics, as advertised.",
    "Definitely.",
    "If you're lucky enough to be around next time Shelly teaches Sidgwick, fight to get in!Shelly Kagan takes teaching seriously. To each of our dinky, 5-page undergraduate papers, Shelly wrote a 5-page response, commenting on our papers' content and style. He hangs around after class for extended periods to continue discussion. He is a fantastic listener and guide during seminar.Shelly Kagan has high standards for his students. His classes are a stressful way to learn to write better philosophy papers, but nonetheless (or perhaps for that reason) a good way. But just because he has high standards doesn't mean you can't get a decent-enough grade if you're willing to put in the time: he makes himself available before papers are due to discuss your intended thesis, weights later papers more (if they're better), and is generous with extensions. His How To Write A Philosophy Paper is illuminating, but I regret not requesting a sample (excellent) paper from him (not sure if he would give one) or from other students in the class.I have a lot of opinions on The Methods of Ethics, but forming them was at least half the fun of the class, so I will not spoil that trip for you here. Suffice it to say that The Methods was a worthwhile read when discussed with Shelly Kagan.Of course, the philosophical caliber of your classmates will in large part dictate the quality of your seminar experience, but Shelly's own questions and analyses provide a high minimum quality to each lesson."
