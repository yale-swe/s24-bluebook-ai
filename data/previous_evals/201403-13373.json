    "Take this course if you'd like to fulfill a science requirement by spitballing about popular science topics for two hours once a week.",
    "It's an easy science where you write one 15 page paper. I'd recommend it if that's the kind of thing you're looking for but don't expect to learn much.",
    "MB&B 110 is an opportunity to explore a topic in biological research in detail over the course of one semester; Professor Summers recommends sources and ideas for the term paper (the only assessment), but the course is ultimately an independent study. I'd recommend it to the non-science major looking for a means to delve into one area of interest in biology - especially a senior for whom this might be their last scientific pursuit ever - but who does not require a great deal of assistance from the instructor.",
    "Take it if you want to learn more about a specific topic of science. Class discussions were interesting and informative. I recommend taking the class.",
    "Average. You may as well take it if you, like me, desperately need that science credit to graduate. You basically have to write one paper and do self-directed \"research\" on it all semester. If you pick a topic you're interested in, it could be cool.",
    "Yes I would;excellent science credit!",
    "This class is all about individual research, and the entire course consists of you selecting one science topic and producing a final paper at the end. I liked the flexibility of the class but it would not be for someone who needs structure in a seminar."
