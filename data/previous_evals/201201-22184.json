    "No I would not recommend it.",
    "I felt this was a good introductory math class that you should take if you haven't taken calculus before.",
    "Yes I would recommend it, however they must be ready to work hard to do well .",
    "I would recommend 112 to anyone who needs an intro math class at Yale. If you work on the material on a semi-regular basis, the class isn't difficult and the lectures are interesting if you want to learn calculus.",
    "An introduction to calculus but hard to follow even if you have prior calculus knowledge.",
    "It is difficult and definitely not a gut class. I was worried I wouldn't pass.",
    "Not unless the students has a very weak background in math and they have to take the class."
