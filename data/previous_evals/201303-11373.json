    "A lot of material, a lot of homework, tough grading standards, proof-based class. Required class for the major, so just suck it up and take it.",
    "Yes. It's a hard class, and you'll have to invest a lot of time into learning the material, but it'll be well worth it. If you're a BME major, you're required to take it, but if you're ChemE or MechE and you need an elective, I wholeheartedly recommend this class.",
    "Absolutely. Take it, even if you aren't in BME. You will be walked through a whole bunch of different areas in mechanics, and find the why behind the equations that are thrown at you in other science courses. Professor Humphrey is a wonderful teacher, and he always takes time to explain both the concepts and the reasoning behind them. The homework is always relevant and usually pretty interesting. This is an engineering course that really tries to teach you how to think about problems, and does so very well.",
    "Overall good introduction into biomechanics -- Professor Humphrey is a somewhat intense, but engaging lecturer. However, the class highly emphasizes theory, and there are very few practice problems assigned, so I left it with the feeling like a I learned a lot, but wouldn't really be able to apply any of it.",
    "BENG 353 is weird. Most people seem to like Humphrey's teaching style, which involves a lot of class participation and repeating and repeating certain concepts until they are drilled into your brain. I feel like I learned a lot about how to derive the basic continuum mechanics formulas, but no idea how to use them. Jay Humphrey also goes incredibly slow in some lectures, which is not only mildly insulting to BME as a major (he spent about 20 minutes doing the integral dy\/dx = y once) but it really limits the amount we get done in a semester. Furthermore, Humphrey gets obsessed with the most arbitrary things, which always end up on the exams. After taking this class, I realize I have no idea how to solve Navier-Stokes for anything other than a straight pipe, but Ican recite the definition for linear momentum balance in Jay Humphrey's exact words.",
    "Biomechanics is a very good course for any science major, it has a solid mechanics foundation that is accessible with a basic calculus background. Professor Humphrey is amazing and does a great job of making the class enjoyable. This is definitely one of my classes that I was sad to finish. Although, in fair warning the exam material can seem to come out of nowhere and Professor Humphrey has a habit of casually assigning 3 page papers on Thursdays to be due Tuesdays.",
    "This class is incredible. Granted, it starts out a little rough because the way the material is presented may not seem familiar, but you can catch on rather quickly. Professor Humphrey is an amazing lecturer, he tries to get to know all his students and genuinely does his best to make sure you understand what's going on. The really cool thing about this course is that it is taught to make you think, not just remember equations. It is very focused on how to actually derive equations and their applications, but for the most part you learn the theory of the equations, with a few application examples thrown here and there. I'm not even a BME major and I still really enjoyed this course because it taught me where equations come from, rather than just telling me to plug stuff in and get an answer. I'd say it's one of the most useful courses I've taken so far.",
    "One of my favorite BME classes. Initially, I did not look forward to this class because I didn't think I would be interested in biomechanics. However, after taking this class, I learned to love the topic. Professor Humphrey is a wonderful lecturer. He teaches you how to be very methodical in your way of thinking and articulate that in writing and in problem sets.We cover just enough in this class where we substantially covered all the topics introduced.Definitely look forward to this class!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course! Professor Humphrey is an amazing lecturer and he explains everything in a very intuitive and easy-to-understand way. The class is pretty math heavy but there aren't that many problem sets and they're usually pretty easy to get through. Exams were somewhat difficult but straightforward for the most part.",
    "This is a fantastic course, I recommend it even if you are not a biomedical engineering major. Know that it is very challenging but you are taking the class from an expert whose notes actually you will be using as your \"major text\" in the course. You MUST make time to study because it is easy to get lost.",
    "The best class I've taken at Yale. Professor Humphrey effectively guided us through much of continuum biomechanics without falling into abstract math land and while keeping it in context. The experience sharpened my overall thinking skills. Professor Humphrey starts from the very beginning, so as long as you know single-variable calculus, it's a must-take for everyone from BME majors to those looking for a good SC credit.",
    "BENG 353 is worth taking whether or not you are a BME major. Professor Humphrey is the best, and you learn a lot in the class. Plus it's not too much work.",
    "Very good course. Prof. Humphrey explains things very well -- he doesn't skip steps in derivations. You will emerge out of the class not only with a firm understanding of continuum mechanics, but also how to better design experiments.",
    "Very good class. Humphrey is great and you learn a lot. Not that big time commitment.",
    "This was an amazing class. Humphrey is easily one of the best teachers I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve had at Yale and I have so much respect for him. I learned so much, was rarely ever confused and I feel that I have a deep understanding of the material at the end of this class. The homeworks were simple but very helpful (except for the last one which was massive and had a lot of busy work). The tests were fair and Humphrey was clear about what would be on them. I would completely recommend this class. I never thought I would enjoy mechanics so much but after having taken this class I want to take more.",
    "Take this class if you really want to understand physics because you didn't in your first year physics class. Also take this class because it's one of the best taught science classes at Yale.",
    "The best QR I have taken.",
    "Humphrey is a really great instructor. Take it if you have to and definitely shop it even if you don't.",
    "Fantastic class that anyone should take. JH makes sure that you understand everything he says.",
    "I would absolutely recommend the class. It is a great class to take in conjunction with Fluid mechanics, the two build upon each other constantly. if you are looking for an elective, take it for sure.",
    "Professor Humphrey is fantastic, but the class relies heavily on a midterm and final which are not necessarily characteristic of problem set material and thus, allow the course to be difficult come test day.",
    "Amazing class.",
    "An introduction to biomechanics that provides the basis for understanding mechanics in one dimension and can work as a solid basis for higher level mechanics classes. The class integrates math, biology, and the practical application of the theory well in every lecture.",
    "My favorite class this semester! Professor Humphrey is great and you'll learn a lot! His exams were also really fair, so if you put effort it in, you will do well.",
    "Take this class if you need it, and even if you don't. All BMEs have to take this, but you might consider it anyway if you're in any other kinds of engineering or just a straight up biology major.",
    "Introduction to Biomechanics was honestly one of the best classes, if not the best class, I've taken at Yale so far. Professor Humphrey is pretty much the most amazing professor in the world -- he knows the material like the back of his hand (and he wrote the textbook, so you can literally review every step of every single derivation perfectly), and the way he structures the course makes it extremely easy to follow. The class is a mixture of physics and math with biological examples mixed in, so it's really interesting and easily applicable stuff, and the pace\/workload is super manageable (random homework assignments including some papers, a midterm, and a paper and final and the end) and keeps every class engaging. Even if you're just vaguely interested in physics or biology, you'll really enjoy this class!",
    "Awesome class! Humphrey is amazing. He presents biomechanics in a way that you'll never forget it. His teaching style is enjoyable and educational, but doesn't feel like he's trying to balance the two -- it's perfect in both respects. The course is logistically simple: a midterm, final, final paper, and some small homework assignments throughout the semester (practice problems, writing assignments, etc.), and everything is evaluated pretty fairly. Overall, great course. I definitely enjoyed it a lot.",
    "One of the best courses in the BME department. Highly recommend.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student, even those not in BME. It is a wonderful class, that anyone with an interest in biology and math should take. I learned so much and I enjoyed going to class everyday.",
    "Yes! If you have to or not, you will love the class. One of the best Yale experiences ever. Do, do take it! Prof. Humphrey is delightfully old school and makes sitting in class a wonderful experience. TAKE IT",
    "This class has been one of the better taught BME courses. I definitely learned more new material in this course under the instruction of Professor Humphrey. It was challenging material as I have not had previous experience with mechanics, but Professor Humphrey broke down the lectures into manageable and understandable chunks. I wished that I had taken more advantage of the TA sessions and perhaps reached out more on getting advice on writing the final paper.This is a required BME course so my only suggestion to BME majors is take advantage of it. Learn and ask questions; engage in the class.",
    "This is a very good class. The information is clearly presented and cohesive. Exams depend on a fair amount of memorization, which is good because most questions are straightforward, and bad because you need to have enough time to memorize all the information thoroughly."
