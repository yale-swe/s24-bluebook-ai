    "Would definitely recommend it to another student. Light workload.",
    "This class is about interesting material but is not particularly rigorous. Good fifth class for someone interested in humanitarian interventions. Lots of policy discussion, and each class is led by a student team. Professor Zinn delegated teaching to student leader groups every class and chimed into the discussion. This meant that classes did not benefit tremendously from her knowledge and varied based on how prepared the students were. Discussion was slow as a result.",
    "No, you don't get much out of it.",
    "Fascinating material that is practical knowledge, and the assignments are different and really useful for our professional lives - not to mention they look good on a resume. Discussions were really interesting, too."
