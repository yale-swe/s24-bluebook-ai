   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this class to anyone looking for a challenging but engaging graduate seminar on the history of science and religion, which I think even students from unrelated disciplines would find interesting. It has a moderate amount of work for a graduate seminar -- roughly one book per week, one reading response on that book due each week, and one 6,000 word final paper. The course was particularly strong in that it enabled students to learn outside of the classroom by directly engaging with primary sources in Beinecke and the YSM Historical Library during class sessions. Finally, Professor Dal Prete is a great professor who clearly has mastery of the topic, and who cares a lot about incorporating student feedback and enabling student discussion.",
    "I would highly recommend this class to other students. It is a great entry point for getting to know the literature in the history of science and religion. The course covers key events in multiple religions and multiple time periods.",
    "This course revolves around the \"complexity thesis\" that challenges the idea that science and religion are in conflict. The books read in seminar all in some way bring further complexity to the relationship between science and religion. If a student is interested in the social construction of knowledge, he or she should take this course."

   "comments": [
    "This course has been very helpful in developing an understanding of how science and religion have interacted globally. I really appreciated the opportunity to consider religions beyond Christianity. That really broadened my perspective.",
    "This course helped me explore a subject more than understand my discipline. It allowed me to explore research topics that interest me."
