   "comments": [
    "I learned a substantial amount of how different drugs affect the human brain and body.",
    "I learned lots about how drugs affect the body and how the body acts on drugs. Definitely an interesting class.",
    "Through this course, I was able to develop a much better understanding of neurobiological processes that I had discussed in previous courses as well as ways in which we treat them today, which I found incredibly interesting and useful.",
    "Facts about various psychoactive drugs",
    "I learned a lot about the different receptors and drugs in the brain. I got out of the class what I wanted.",
    "By taking psychopharmacology, I learned about drug action on the brain, both in the context of recreational and therapeutic drugs. I also gained an appreciation for the complexity of pharmacological discovery and administration, and how far we have to go in terms of combatting addiction and treating mental disorders.",
    "We covered the basics of pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and learned about drugs of abuse\/ recreational drugs and drugs used to treat psychiatric disorders. We also began with some basic neuroscience and neurotransmitters and receptors. This was a thorough and informative introduction to the field of psychopharmacology.",
    "This course was absolutely amazing for learning about the effect of different drugs on the brain. I learned a lot of new information regarding drug interactions and different psychopathologies.",
    "I learned much about the psychopharmacology of our brains including topics about how various recreational drugs work, brain anatomy and cell function, and how pharmaceuticals are used to treat mental disorders. There is a lot of material in this course, but it is all very interesting and useful."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: Dr. Brown is awesome. His wife bakes cookies for class and they're amazing. Also the material is super interesting, especially the lectures on illicit drugs and their effect on the brain and on society. Weaknesses: His voice is quiet, so it's sometimes hard to hear him. Also, I would have liked to go a little deeper in the mechanisms of action of the different drugs.",
    "The professor is great, the content is great, and the organization is great. No improvements necessary!",
    "I thought the course was very well-structured, with plenty of opportunities for students to contribute their thoughts as well as to engage with the material.",
    "Strength: interesting and extensive content Weakness: prof could have been more engaging (speaking louder, synthesising each chapter)",
    "I really liked the structure of the class and Professor Brown is just great.",
    "This course was strong in its format: first, basic neuroanatomy was reviewed, then the fundamentals of pharmacology were introduced, then the recreational drugs were discussed, and finally medications for psychopathology were covered. This was a comprehensive and helpfully-structured setup. A weakness of the course was the amount of information in each lecture. The slides were packed with nonessential content, and some sections were redundant, making it hard to determine what concepts and details were the most important. Slightly compressed and more organized slides could improve this aspect of the course.",
    "The information presented in this course is very interesting, but lectures can be dry. Information in lectures are straight from the powerpoints, which was actually very helpful. However, it was often hard to hear Professor Brown, and improving this aspect can actually really improve the quality of lectures. Otherwise, the course was pretty straightforward.",
    "The material in this course is awesome. It is all laid out on the slides so that we could go back and review, since much is covered in one lecture. One weakness is organization. Sometimes, the course felt jumbled.",
    "Teaching about drugs that treat depression, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, etc. This is boring, and made the last 3rd of the semester very dull. Please consider taking these drugs out, and focusing more in depth on the drugs of abuse."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, absolutely take this course if you are interested in how drugs affect the brain. I would recommend it especially after taking biochemistry, neuroscience and organic chemistry, because the mechanisms of action make a lot more sense. If you don't like memorizing things though, this course will be difficult for you. There are a lot of drugs out there...",
    "Amazing class. Really enjoyed it. Difficult material but manageable.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student - I thoroughly enjoyed the course material and delving deeply into the workings of the brain as well as how medications work on the brain.",
    "Not really unless you are really interested in the topic",
    "If you are interested in how drugs (both medical and recreational) act in the brain, this course is for you. Be prepared for a lot of information, but if you are able to distill many details down to essential mechanisms and frameworks, you'll do well.",
    "This was a thorough and informative introduction to the field of psychopharmacology. We covered the basics of pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and learned about drugs of abuse\/ recreational drugs and drugs used to treat psychiatric disorders. We also began with some basic neuroscience and neurotransmitters and receptors. The information was fascinating, especially if you are interested in pursuing psychiatry. However lectures could be dry. It was often hard to hear Prof Brown, so make sure you sit in the front of the room. Powerpoints are pretty clear and very informative. Exams can test minute details and are sometimes difficult, so reviewing powerpoints thoroughly is important; readings from the textbook were also interesting and helped flesh out what was presented in class.",
    "I would recommend to another student, very interesting topic. Easy A if you just memorize all of the slides (grade was only from three midterms this semester and you got ten bonus points added to one of your exams if you did a 10 min presentation on a topic of your choice). Took it credit d\/f and only reviewed the slides the night before and it was definitely doable. Not necessary to do the readings at all.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student, especially if you are interested in neuroscience and have some background in the area. The material is fascinating and you will leave finding that you know so much more about how and why certain medicines work. Professor Brown is one of my favorite professors I've had here and I would definitely recommend taking a class from him.",
    "Prof Brown is a great guy, he brings cookies to class for his students on a variable reinforcement schedule, so you never know when you're getting cookies, but it's frequent. The class is very interesting, at least when studying drugs of abuse. The tests are not very difficult and Prof Brown gives students opportunities to give an extra credit presentation if they need a grade boost. If you've already taken Drugs, Brain, and Behavior with Hedy Kober, this will be a gut. DBB is harder and goes more in depth."
