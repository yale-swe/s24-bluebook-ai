   "comments": [
    "Great course - really supported material from other biology classes. A programming background would have been helpful, but was not necessary.",
    "Having some background in MATLAB will help slightly. Having a solid math background is more important yet. That said, I managed without either; which I say without knowing my grade, so take that with a grain of salt. The biggest thing is that I really appreciated this course. Taking it in conjunction with biochemistry made the latter seem *much* more comprehensible. (Trust me, taking this class won't give you a better grade in biochem; what I'm saying is that the conceptual clarity of this course made up for the mud that is biochem, and made this shitty semester worth it for me.) 10\/10, and the class still might improve.",
    "An interesting class and a fresh approach to biology. The professors know the material well and do a good job of making it understandable. It's not always easy to follow the class though and to grasp the bigger picture, simply because there certainly will be things you aren't familiar with (eg. MATLAB, statistical mechanics, ODE, particular math formula) and there isn't enough time to explain them properly.",
    "I would suggest this class to those interested in learning more about MATLAB, but would emphasize that a strong math background (more-so than a strong biology background) is necessary to get the most out of the course.",
    "I loved it! Definitely take it if you can.",
    "This is an utterly fantastic course that will teach you things you never thought you would want to know but now realize that you could never live without about biology",
    "This was a strange course. I'm an econ major with interest and experience in modeling systems, so I was hoping this would be a fun science credit. Turns out, basic biological knowledge really should be a prereq. As should familiarity with stats because it's assumed knowledge. The psets were fine but the take-home final was painfully difficult.",
    "If you think you might be interested in mathematical modeling, or if you are just interested in getting a different perspective on biology, I recommend this course. It definitely opened my mind to a whole new area and helped me to appreciate the incredible systems that life has evolved. For example, how does chemotaxis work? How are irreversible developmental switches achieved? I was a little intimidated on the first day of class because I hadn't thought much about math since high school (and I'm a senior now), but the math mostly stayed within my realm of comfort. You should have taken calculus at some point, but based on my experience, it needn't have been recent. You also don't need to have ever coded in Matlab before - the professors offer a lot of hand-holding, so you won't have to write any crazy scripts or code without help. You'll probably be proficient in basic Matlab stuff by the end. Overall, the workload was not too bad, just a problem set every couple of weeks (usually took me 7-8 hours), occasional short exercises graded on completion, writing abstracts for a couple of papers (drawn from actual journals) every couple of weeks, and one group presentation on an assigned paper. The final was a pretty reasonable take-home problem set. My only complaint about the course is that I wish there had been more transparency in the grading throughout the semester, but otherwise I enjoyed my experience in this class. The professors worked hard to make the material accessible to true beginners, and were very patient with us.",
    "MCDB 261 is one of the best biology classes I have taken, and has made me seriously consider the new quantitative biology track. Don't get me wrong, you need to put in the time, but it is absolutely worth it. Having taken seriously the course evaluations from last year, Professors Clark and Emonet did a great job pacing the class, and as a student with no Matlab or coding experience, I felt right on track. The course material was really interesting. The idea that cell decisions are governed by changes in the concentration and dynamics of biological materials is super cool. The paper assignments were helpful and enriching. The TAs were top-notch. All of this being said, I will say that at some points, I would have appreciated more explanation in class on Matlab. For example, how does ode45 really work and how do we create histograms. The hackathons some times covered too much material and without sufficient attention to detail. In the end, I still learned a good amount of Matlab through the psets. I'm really glad this course is being offered to undergrad bio students."
