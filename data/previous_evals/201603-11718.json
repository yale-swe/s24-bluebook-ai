   "comments": [
    "I learned a lot about the roots of modern Latin American society, and the motivations and perspectives of both Spanish conquerers and indigenous peoples. I also got some fantastic practice with the Spanish language.",
    "I learned alot in this class. I especially liked reading the prehispanic Mexican literature and everything about the \"conquista\" of Mexico. We learned alot of history in this class, and that is always a big bonus for me. The choice of texts was well put together and alot of the themes overlapped.",
    "I developed the skills to be able to thoroughly read and analyze complex texts. I also learned how to determine the important parts of the stories and how to express my ideas on the works through well structured essays.",
    "I learned a lot about analyzing classical Spanish texts.",
    "I learned to think more critically about the idea of \"history.\" I expected the course to be about facts and literature, and it was about perspectives and understanding, a critical topic as I evaluated my own relationship to Spanish and my family.",
    "My reading skills in Spanish have grown tremendously, as well as being able to talk about Spanish literature both verbally and in written form.",
    "My analysis and writing definitely improved. I think ultimately I just learned so much about this time period.",
    "I developed my written Spanish immensely and learned a great deal about Colonial Latin American Literature through our readings.",
    "I feel that I greatly improved my understanding of colonial (and pre-colonial) Latin American Literature. I feel that my understanding of the period as well as a wide range of writing styles is vastly improved.",
    "I developed better writing and reading skills in Spanish.",
    "This course was an excellent introduction to early Latin American works. I learned about the authors of these texts, the cultural pretenses that affected the text, and how to more effectively read and understand the text.",
    "I gained a much deeper perspective into the canon of latin american colonial literature through this course. It was fascinating to read the original documents of conquistadors, mestizos and indigenous peoples alike to open my eyes to the various viewpoints necessary to construct a narrative of this incredibly important era in world history.",
    "The class definitely improved my reading comprehension and writing. Perhaps more importantly, however, the class provided me with a unique insight into the Spanish conquests in the Americas through the myriad of primary documents that we read.",
    "I have learned so much about early Latin American literature before and during the colonial period in this course. Aside from improving my reading and writing skills, this course definitely helped me develop a systematic way of approaching literature in a time period and region that I am not familiar with."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This course is amazing. You learn a lot about interesting and not often talked about parts of history!",
    "The strength are Stuart Atkins and Rolena Adorno. They were both very knowledgeable in the field, and Profesora Adorno is the funniest professor I've met at Yale. Her humor is underrated, and maybe i was one of few that laughed at the jokes made in class( the jokes were related to what we were learning). The text were good texts, especially Sor Juana, El Inca Garcilaso, and Bernal Diaz del Castillo. Those were my favorite. Not many weaknesses. Room was poorly lit sometimes, and its hard not to nap at noon.",
    "The strengths are the broad range of texts we covered as well as the works being very well selected in that they related and had common themes",
    "Professor Adorno was a compassionate and kind teacher who could sense the effort that you put into the class, and the lectures were always fascinating. The reading was a little unguided, which meant that it required more time, but overall, it was a fascinating course. I would enjoy more direction on the reading (themes to think about) and smaller assignments to keep everyone up to date and on task.",
    "Absolutely amazing course. Prof. Adorno is amazing. I can't compliment her enough. I would have preferred the class size being smaller to allow for more personal discussion of the texts.",
    "I think the course was perfect, the readings were interesting and challenging, but the grading was fair.",
    "The course provided a great selection of reading material (excerpts) that was insightful and accessible. The amount of reading felt appropriate. Class lectures were very good, as Professor Adorno is so enthusiastic. She knows so much about her field, and her lectures were dynamic and engaging. Even though the class was large, she created a community environment in which everyone participated.",
    "The strength is Professor Adorno. I can't speak highly enough of her. The one weakness would maybe be the large class size, but that's pretty negligible.",
    "This course was great for anyone who wanted to improve his or her reading comprehension. I was not best for anyone who wanted to improve conversational skills.",
    "The course was very well designed. The two test and two paper structure was great, and I loved the texts chosen. My only suggestion for improvement would be increasing the oral component of the class; I would have liked to have practiced my spoken Spanish more.",
    "The course was very well designed, and the material well chosen. The ordering and organization was logical and walked us through history and across Latin America through some of the eras most important authors. The classroom experience was generally great, although at times the lecture would venture off onto tangents that, while fascinating and intriguing, would sometimes confuse from the main theme or objective of the lecture and cause confusion.",
    "Professor Adorno was incredibly engaging and informative. Her lectures were always incredibly full of knowledge that went above and beyond the basic academic context of our work. The few lessons we received from Stuart were also well done and informative and he was always a genuine help in class. One weakness I would point out is the support that we as students get with the readings. Because many of the texts were far more difficult to read than your average Spanish text, I often felt that I needed a least a short summary or explanation of the context of the text in the class before it was assigned. I often felt in class like there was the assumption that I understood a lot more from the reading than I think I, and a lot of my other classmates, were able to understand.",
    "A definite strength of the course is that it forced me to read the texts in the vernacular and helped me move beyond dictionaries and translations. Additionally, the class forced me to improve both the quality and the speed of my Spanish writing. One possible weakness is that sometimes I feel that the syllabus could have been slightly more specific in describing what material would be covered in class. I feel that as the course moved along, the syllabus became less helpful in describing what was going to be covered in class the next day."

   "comments": [
    "Absolutely!!",
    "This class was great. Take it to satisfy a L5 or HU requirement or just take it for fun. You'll read a lot of very interesting pieces you probably would never have heard of or read anywhere else and I think there's a ton of value in doing that to better understand the history of this hemisphere.",
    "YESSS. This is a great course, especially to practice your Spanish. i learned alot of new vocabulary in this class, and alot about Latin American history and literature.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to anyone with a passion for reading and analyzing Spanish literature",
    "Great L5 class! Adorno is an amazing professor in every way! The class is relatively easy, and the readings are a little tough but thoroughly explained. The way Adorno engages with the class on an intellectual and personal level is absolutely phenomenal. I was not a native speaker, and sometimes I struggled with the speaking, but Adorno is so helpful and great. She was like a mother figure. Take this class for your own good.",
    "My Spanish was a little weaker, which made the course sometimes more challenging, but Professor Adorno's Spanish is clear and slow, albeit a little soft. Working with old Castillian texts (slightly different than Spanish) was difficult, but rewarding, and if you're looking for an intersection between history and Spanish, there's not a better class.",
    "Such a great course. Not much of a workload at all (there's some reading every night, but you can easily get by without actually reading it and just paying attention in class, though I don't recommend that at all because all the material is so interesting). Prof. Adorno is absolutely amazing. She's an absolute sweetheart, and so knowledgeable about all the texts. Her passion is truly amazing. She is a bit soft-spoken, so sit up front! She has a great sense of humor, and made the class incredibly enjoyable.",
    "Yes! I already have and would highly recommend this accessble L5 course.",
    "I found this course to be a fascinating overview of the region's literature. It is a great way to develop Spanish reading and writing skills. Professor Adorno is really fantastic and coming to class was a pleasure.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who wants to improve their Spanish writing and reading skills. Also for anyone interested in history honestly.",
    "Yes, the subject matter is very interesting.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. You won't regret it.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. The works we read were fantastic, and Professor Adorno is an amazing instructor.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to other students. The material is fascinating and is critical to understand a formative era in world history that still affects us today. The workload was just enough to be manageable without being overwhelming, and the class was structured in such a way that I was able to iron out most of my confusion during the lecture, which was very useful.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It is refreshing to take a level five course that is not focused on intensive grammar or advanced structures. Instead, this course is more of an interesting history class that just so happens to be taught in Spanish.",
    "I would recommend the course to anyone who has some interest in early Latin American literature. Even if you don't, this course serves as a good way of improving your Spanish reading and writing skills."
