   "comments": [
    "Level 3 Spanish is a little bit repetitive if you have taken level 1 and 2 at Yale. I would recommend this class if you are truly interested in learning Spanish, or if you need it for the language requirement.",
    "Good class. Although it is mostly a review of L1 and L2 grammar, the main focus is on the shorts stories we read.",
    "I would recommend this course if you are interested in learning spanish. i feel like i learned a lot",
    "Spanish 130 is a pretty standard intermediate Spanish class. I liked the culture aspect a lot (movies, short stories). Reymundi is very kind and genuinely wants to see her students succeed and improve their Spanish. The daily online homework was really annoying, though.",
    "I would recommend it. However, if you're starting with L3 and only have to take L3-L4 bear in mind that there are many wonderful summer opportunities for combined L3\/L4 courses that I failed to look into before I took this class.",
    "If this isn't your first Spanish class at Yale then you know what to expect. If it is then you placed into L3 so you might as well take Spanish to minimize your language requirement. I felt like I put a large amount of time into this class (lots of nightly homework) and that my Spanish still isn't any better than it was in high school. The reality is that there are a lot of languages at Yale that are better than Spanish for fulfilling the language requirement so shop around. From friends experiences things get better when you get to L5 if you actually plan on going that far.",
    "Spanish 130 is a really good class. It builds on the concepts developed in L2 and L3 in a logical way, and Prof. Reymundi is really nice! Take it.",
    "Great class but needs consistent, daily work to make the most of it."
