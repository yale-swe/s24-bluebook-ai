    "If you've taken Spanish for years but place into L2 here at Yale, you may be disappointed \u0096\u00a0I was. But L2 turned out to be a very good fit for me. The class is small and you have to think in Spanish every day, so by the end of the semester you simply have had much more practice. And the professors are simply great (try to get Juliana Ramos-Ruano!)",
    "Yes. For those who have only a year or two of spanish this class is a great way to build upon that foundation.",
    "I would highly recommend spanish 120 to another student. It's not too hard if you pay attention in class and Juliana R-R is the best teacher ever! Take it with Juliana if you have the option because she is awesome!",
    "I would recommend it if you need to fulfill your language credit.",
    "This course is very in depth. You can learn a lot, but only if you want to. The work is nowhere near unbearable, and it pays off. I would absolute recommend this course to everyone.",
    "The only thing about the class I particularly didn't like was how early it was. If you take a 9:25 class, be sure you can commit and be active at that time to gain as much as you can from the class. Other than that, the class was good, and I feel like y grasp of the Spanish language has improved.",
    "Spanish 120 is a fast pace spanish class taught completely in Spanish. I would recommend the class to anyone interested in Spanish. The professors are wonderful and the class size is small enough for plenty of individual attention.",
    "I would recommend this course. The work can at times be tedious but is never terribly difficult. If you enjoy spanish then this course will not be difficult for you. As long as you do the work and practice, this course is very enjoyable."
