   "comments": [
    "Good course. Sometimes it was difficult to know what needed to be remembered and what was just excess details, especially when it came to quizzes and knowing what will be on the final (which we haven't had yet)",
    "The greatest strength of this course is the presentation requirement. We get the opportunity to work and discuss important risk assessment issues with our peers in small groups and then present on them throughout the semester. This was great practice utilizing the vocabulary we had learned earlier in the semester and working through the more qualitative aspects of the science of risk assessment. There are two major weaknesses of this course. The first being that vocabulary quizzes are used in place of a midterm examination which just promotes writ memorization rather than actual understanding of the terms. The second is that the majority of the course 60% is graded in the last week of classes: a debate during reading week and a final exam. This essentially gives us an extra final (both worth 30% of grade, equally weighted) and demands extra time during reading week that could have been utilized during the semester instead.",
    "to improve, the instructor could ask students to read a risk assessment profile first, the introduce concepts. This way students would not feel lost when facing so many terminology about words. Just help students to get a sense of what to learn in the following lectures.",
    "This course is not well designed. No syllabus available. No textbook available. No regular assignments. The outline of the course is very obscure.",
    "-wish it involved some occupational exposures that are not substances\/ toxicants (e.g. workplace violence, shift work) -as a non-EHS student, it was often challenging to recall some of the chemistry\/math involved in deriving relevant formula",
    "Overall, this course provided a broad introduction to the concepts associated with risk assessment. The lecture was well-designed to introduce and grapple with the various topics in the class. Though some particular aspects of the class seemed frustrating and pointless at the time (the vocab quizzes), I understood why they were assigned later on, when we were doing the actual reading and interpreting of the risk assessments. The quizzes and lecture provided a solid basis for us to understand the complex language associated with these writings. The first presentation was a bit frustrating to try and prepare for. There was little guidance given, and a wide array of information to try and cover. Often, it seems like Dr. Borak will have a specific outcome in mind, but will rarely give us the proper guidelines to find that outcome. I understand if some individuals are willing to spend the time and effort to find the single correct needle in the haystack of the information we are often given, but for others it is not a feasible outcome. The second presentation went better, since we had a better understanding of expectations, and the information was much more interesting. Overall, I think those classes may work better as whole-class discussions, as we had after the presentations were finished, since that spurred on much more interesting conversation. Though, I suppose that runs the risk of individuals not completing the reading, since there is less threat of looking silly in front of one's peers.",
    "This course provided a strong introduction into the basics of risk assessment. We left the course understanding the components of risk assessment, the challenges of uncertainty, various models used over time, the difference between cancer and non-cancer risk assessments, and the difficulty in determining regulation in the face of uncertainty. I appreciated the structure of the course - focusing on foundation and basics and then applying those concepts to real-world situations. Exams were very fair. However, we would appreciate feedback\/grading on the discussions, presentations, and debate prior to final exam.",
    "the class was definitely the hardest. The readings were complicated, long and way harder than any other class."

    "Instructor: Jonathan Borak \u00a0Prof. Borak is very interesting and makes the information much more absorbable",
    "Instructor: Jonathan Borak \u00a0Dr. Borak uniquely demands the most of all my professors while simultaneously providing the least amount of clear expectations. This is frustrating to say the least. He does not provide a clear summation of the course and schedule via a syllabus nor does he give clear requirements for major assignments unless prompted repeatedly by students. A written description with expectations for each major project would make navigating this course much easier. Dr. Borak is often defensive in responding to questions on the course material in lecture as well as in office hours. This makes it difficult for students to ask questions. Dr. Borak does not facilitate learning in a constructive manner while in lecture (i.e. prompting question and response or discussion about the materials). Many other professors use homework assignments and clicker questions throughout the semester as well as a mid-semester evaluations to gauge how well students are understanding the course material. I think that clicker questions would be a welcome and engaging addition to this course.",
    "Instructor: Jonathan Borak \u00a0Knowledgeable.",
    "Instructor: Jonathan Borak \u00a0Students felt confused about his requirements in assignments and exams, and found it hard to keep engaged.",
    "Instructor: Jonathan Borak \u00a0Brilliant professor, learned so much in this class.",
    "Instructor: Jonathan Borak \u00a0Dr. Borak is a good lecturer, with a solid understanding of the concepts associated with risk assessment. He was able to present on the extensive uncertainty present within the topic with ease and clarity, and helped guide our understanding and comprehension of the topic. He gave countless examples that helped clarify specific cases, and fairly freely offered his time to discuss any questions that arose.",
    "Instructor: Jonathan Borak \u00a0Dr. Borak is an excellent professor who is clearly experienced in this particular field. He provides excellent, interesting examples throughout his lectures. His slides are clear when looked at one at a time, though somewhat disorganized and challenging to digest as a whole. He is always eager to speak with students and is very supportive of us in general. His one weakness is slight disorganization of all of the course material. It was difficult to digest all 400+ slides of material and organize the \"big picture\" on our own.",
    "Instructor: Jonathan Borak \u00a0Dr. Borak is a nice, very knowledgeable teacher. I think he is trying his best in teaching a very hard class and doing a good job.",
    "Instructor: Jonathan Borak \u00a0He is the BEST lecturer in YSPH"

   "comments": [
    "Interesting course - good critical reading\/thinking skills can be acquired or developed from taking this course",
    "Risk assessment is an introductory course on the science of risk assessment that will teach students how to critically read and understand risk assessments, while balancing the more qualitative aspects of the science. Very end of semester heavy with regards to work, and requires a lot of peer interaction via group presentations.",
    "I think this course, might be a little dull, but very useful for an EHS student, maybe policy student as well. I particularly love the debate part. It helped us to understand the principles of risk assessment comprehensively and provided us the methods of application in real world.",
    "I would not recommend it to another student.",
    "Non-EHS students, be ready to go a bit outside your comfort zone. You will learn a lot!",
    "This course discusses the ins and outs of Risk Assessment, the scientific process of quantifying and qualifying data to aid in regulation of chemicals and processes. I would highly recommend the course for anyone interested in regulation, or of understanding the complexities behind the regulatory process. Further, I would recommend this course to anyone who enjoys grappling with uncertain answers, as this course contains a fair amount of that.",
    "This course delves into the components of risk assessment, the challenges of uncertainty, various models used over time, the difference between cancer and non-cancer risk assessments, and the difficulty in determining regulation in the face of uncertainty. The first several weeks are spent going over the basics of risk assessment (i.e. vocabulary, models). You then apply these concepts to real-world situations.",
    "When I first started this class, I was so intimidated. Then I was overwhelmed by the amount of readings. Later on, I really appreciated how much I learned and how my understanding of risk assessment changed and how I became very critical of the literature I read."
