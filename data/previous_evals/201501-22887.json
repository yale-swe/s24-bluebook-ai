    "Not a fun class. Don't think that just because you took bc calc, it will be easy, even though the class pretty much presents basically the same material. If you took bc calc in high school and did well, just take 120. You do not want to spend a semester taking this pretty painful, joyless class.",
    "Please don't take this class. Take MATH 116 instead. You will regret taking this class, I did every day of spring semester.",
