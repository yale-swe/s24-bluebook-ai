   "comments": [
    "The reading list is something to be excited about. Absolutely take this class because Professor Garsten is one of the best lectures at Yale. The books you read and discuss will change your life!",
    "This is a really interesting class but a lot of work for the writing credit. Would recommend taking this in the non-writing intensive path.",
    "If you want to get an overall introduction to political thought, and are willing to put the work in, this is a great course.",
    "I would recommend the class. The class consists of weekly readings along with weekly responses and a decent amount of writing. Keep up with your readings because you can get behind easily. If you don't like reading a lot and writing a good amount, it wouldn't be such a good idea. This definitely helped me further my knowledge in concepts applicable to politics and improved my writing style. It was interesting and spanned a great expanse of philosophical works throughout history. It ties these works to politics and current affairs. These are old and classical works, so not for people looking for new and modern philosophical thinkers. Fantastic class overall.",
    "I would recommend if you want to read these classic texts.",
    "Lectures are interesting, readings are long. They're manageable, but you don't have to do all the readings. I really appreciated how receptive Prof Garsten was to questions.",
    "PLSC 114 is a really great class. If you're interested in political philosophy definitely take it. Garsten makes it enjoyable and he is a great lecturer. I did not do writing-intensive so the workload was fairly light, only two papers and a final exam. Writing-intensive is a bit more of a commitment but I think it is probably worth doing. It forces you to engage with the material more. Overall, I would recommend this course. Definitely take it.",
    "Great introduction to political philosophy",
    "Great course for those students who would like to engage many of the readings of DS without having to actually commit to DS. However, do not take this course writing intensive; the work load is much more substantial for little to no additional benefit with your writing.",
    "Overview of a lot of books you should read before leaving Yale. Garsten is a great lecturer and clearly one of the prominent figures in his field, but has such a soothing voice that you might find yourself spacing out in class. Two essays and a final if you don't do the writing intensive (don't unless you have to) make the workload besides reading quite manageable.",
    "Learning the foundations of political thought. It will expose you to a variety of writers from early Plato to the infamous Karl Marx. For someone with an interest in philosophy or ethics, this course it quite the hoot. I personally would not take the course again if I had to option to go back in time. It was a relative waste of a credit for me but I did get some writing out of it so eh.",
    "This class is way better than its DS equivalent and will teach you more. If you're interested in political philosophy this is a great introduction.",
    "PLSC114 is a course that is challenging in terms of the workload but is an excellent introductory class to philosophy - especially for those who are in the writing-intensive sections. Students who read the works will find that this course can be life-changing.",
    "Political Philosophy is a pretty nice overview of the western cannon where you will cover major works from ancient thinkers (Plato, Aristotle) and more modern thinkers (Machiavelli, Smith, Hobbes, Tocqueville, Rousseau, Marx, Nietzsche). Professor Garsten is a pretty good lecturer too - lectures are engaging, well-organized and encourage you to think about potential interpretations to the text. Writing intensive is really not much more work - you write one ungraded response for completion points each week and then you develop this into a few mini-essays (one of which gets written into a final essay). It's a great way to take the stress out of writing one long perfect essay the first time around. Overall, I would recommend this class if you've never had any experience with political philosophy. At times, the class seemed a little bit too interpretive - focusing way too much on interpretations of the text rather than actually evaluating and either defending or criticizing the arguments presented in the text. If you're more interested a more evaluative and critical perspective of political philosophy, maybe consider taking Political Philosophy with Thomas Pogge in the Philosophy department or Moral Foundation of Politics (MoFoPo). I also wasn't too thrilled that we read a total of four works by Plato and Aristotle. I wish we spent time reading more modern authors like Rawls, Foucault, and Weber. I also wasn't too crazy about reading the Federalist Papers - public school has given me enough American political thought and constitutional history to last me a lifetime. I honestly had been so excited to take this class and was a little bit underwhelmed by it. It was definitely a good enough introduction to the authors, though. However, I may have enjoyed MoFoPo or the Philosophy department version more.",
    "This class is an introduction to many different political philosophers from different time periods. However, all of them seem to be western philosophers. It is a class worth taking if one has the time to keep up with the readings and is actually interested in political science, but they are often a lot more than is necessary for discussion and learning.",
    "Yes, but only if you are genuinely interested in political philosophy. Otherwise, you could skip all the readings and look through spark notes, but that would effectively ruin the point of the class. It helps then to do the class writing intensive because you are more accountable for learning, which makes the final exam so much easier but also makes the class itself more worthwhile.",
    "A standard political philosophy class that engaged and gave the foundation for future classes. Would recommend",
    "Take it if you love DS-kind readings and writing papers on them",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. Professor Garsten was incredibly engaging, and you will want to go to class to hear him lecture. That being said, he does not use lecture slides, so you'll have to go to lecture to get the full effect of the course. I would also recommend taking the course writing intensive. Although it is a lot of work, you will find yourself becoming a better writer and you'll learn the material better for the final. It's a good overview of basic political philosophy, and I didn't find any of the readings to dense or dry. Definitely take this class if you're at all interested in political philosophy or a political science major!",
    "I really enjoyed this course. It provides a really strong base in major philosophical texts and sets you up well for any future endeavors in the field. It does get a bit repetitive as you get used to the one-book-per-week rhythm, but enjoyable overall. Worth taking.",
    "A great introduction to the foundation of political thought. I would highly recommend.",
    "Fantastic way to get a survey of some of the most important books out there. Prof Garsten is absolutely amazing and you will look forward to going to class! Sections werent that great though. If you take it non-writing intensive, the workload (two 4-5 page essays and the final) is super manageable.",
    "YES! Take this course if you're looking to learn a good amount about some of the most famous and influential philosophers to have ever lived. Keep in mind that this course does require a significant amount of reading (which should be expected considering that it's a philosophy course) and that, regardless of whether you take this course writing intensive or not, you will be expected to write papers and take a final exam which will require that you know your philosophers well. So stay on top of your readings and think critically about the material. You won't regret it in the end! An additional note: Because the course will seek to expose you to various political philosophies, you may find yourself questioning your own views on what you had previously thought of as 'just' or 'unjust' within the socio-political realm of evaluation. So be prepared to not only internalize material or the sake of the class but also for yourself. Again, I re-emphasize: this course is awesome.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone who want a good overview of political philosophy. Garsten is great and it is a good class whether or not you have a background in the subject. I feel like all political science majors should take this- it's not too hard but you'll get a ton out of it.",
    "I would probably not recommend this class to another student, unless the know they are incredibly passionate about the subject, and will read the books because they want to, not because the lectures and discussions will be worthwhile. Also, this is not a class for someone who likes a class to be purposeful - the lack of assignments and feedback makes it difficult to discern any sort of purpose.",
    "Definitely take this class; it'll broaden your horizons.",
    "This is a great course for getting a taste of the DS syllabus without the suffering. Garsten is a wonderful lecturer so if you're choosing between this course and the one in the philosophy department, choose this one. Get Amy Gais as your TF if you're looking for your writing to be improved and definitely take it Writing Intensive. The WI option allows you more writing practice and incentivized you to actually read the texts.",
    "Take this class. It is definitely a quintessential Yale course, with outstanding lectures and an incredible reading list. If you're looking to read many of the books that you know you should read but haven't yet, this class is for you. Provides an effective introduction to political thought and basic philosophic theory...one of the most enjoyable courses I have ever taken! Take it with Professor Garsten. He's a wizard.",
    "PLSC 114 is a great class to learn about the most important philosophers of the world. The writing track is significantly more demanding and difficult, but it's not too hard to get through. It is vital to always read in this class, because if you don't, they'll know.",
    "Don't take it, especially writing intensive.",
    "It is a great overview of western political philosophy and will help to inspire students to further pursue political science or philosophy. I would recommend it to another student because I found it very interesting and I feel that I have a much better grasp of the origins of many aspects of our current political landscape.",
    "Too ambitious. Lots of reading.",
    "Solid class, a lot of dry reading although it gets better by the end with Marx and Kant. Take it if the reading list looks interesting to you, I personally had wanted to read a lot of the books before the class and saw the class as a way to finally do it.",
    "Intro political philosophy is a great class to learn about the big names you've heard in your life -- Plato, Socrates, Marx, Nietzsche, etc. The reading can be dense, and taking the class writing-intensive is definitely a lot of work, but I still really enjoyed the course and think I got a lot out of it. I had never learned political philosophy before, even though I had learned a lot about modern politics, but I think it's really important and interesting for understanding history and politics today to understand the fundamental underpinnings of what it means to govern or be a government. Professor Garsten is a great lecturer, and the TFs are smart and willing to help. I had heard this class was tougher than MoFoPo, but I am glad I decided to challenge myself and take this one.",
    "This course is an amazing survey of a variety of political thinkers! I'd have chosen this course for the syllabus alone, but on top of that, Professor Garsten is a delight to have as a professor. Extremely articulate, he makes each subject relevant to current events and encourages the contemplation of the conversation happening between the authors. I cannot recommend this class highly enough!",
    "Yeah, i would recomment the course it was more about breadth than depth",
    "I would recommend this class to a student who is interested in classics and the humanities and wants to get a more condensed version of Directed Studies. The texts we read are very influential and important to know regardless of whether or not someone is a political science major, but I think it is the type of class where you really have to like the material and want to put in the time to read everything in order to get a lot out of it, so it might not appeal to everyone.",
    "PLSC 114 is a fantastic introduction to the \"great books\" of the Western world. It's almost like an abbreviated DS course. The class is well organized and professor Garsten is incredible. I'd absolutely recommend it anybody interested in learning about some of the fundamental ideas that shaped the Western world.",
    "A great survey of important works of political philosophy. Professor Garsten's lectures are outstanding and will significantly improve your understanding of the texts. The workload is not terribly heavy, but writing is graded rigorously--be prepared to put thought into your papers.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who wanted an overview of political thought throughout the ages, but would emphasize that this course focuses on the political aspect of these thinkiers more than the philosophical aspect.",
    "This was a delightful course with an excellent reading list and an outstanding professor. It expanded my horizons and helped me to think critically about the world around me. Professor Garsten is absolutely wonderful. I enjoyed his lectures very much, and his insights go far beyond any general breakdown of the text. He helps you to challenge the status quo and think for yourself why these texts and ideas are so important in our thought. That said, the reading, though excellent, is heavy, and if this was my only course I could certainly manage it, but with other classes and extracurriculars I found it impossible to do a thorough reading of all the texts, especially since for the writing intensive sections there is a reading response due every Friday. In spite of that, I liked this course a lot and would recommend it to a fellow student.",
    "Absolutely! It's one of those must-take classes at Yale, and Garsten is a great lecturer. It made me want to major in EPE. Writing intensive is a ton of work though, so be sure that your other courses are not too hard (mine were and it turned out to be a huge source of stress).",
    "Adequate introduction to modern Western thought. I did not take writing intensive and felt that I did not engage enough with the material. If you have the time, take it writing intensive.",
    "Intro to political philosophy, several readings of important political philosophers.",
    "This is a great introduction to the world of political philosophy. The course is well-structured and covers a wide array of political philosophers. In addition, Professor Garsten is a terrific lecturer; all of his talks are crisp, thoughtful, and illuminating. In addition, he is incredibly kind and gracious and very willing to meet with students after class\/in office hours. The course entails a fair amount of work, particularly if you are in the writing intensive track. That said, you will gain a lot more from the course and be better prepared for the final if you elect for the writing intensive option; I learned an incredible amount throughout the semester. In sum, a highly recommended course!",
    "Strongly recommended if u r the kind who loves reading Plato, Aristotle, etc.",
    "I would definitely recommend the course to anyone in interested in a broad, if a bit simplistic, introduction to political thought from a wide variety of time periods\/contexts.",
    "I would recommend PLSC 114 to any student who is interested in reading some of the major works of political philosophy. I recommend that students look at the syllabus before deciding whether or not to take the class. This class was not too too much work during the semester (although it's definitely more if you do writing-intensive), but there was a ton to review before the final. I thought lectures ranged from pretty good to very good. The best lectures were the ones where Professor Garsten made very interesting connections between the readings and modern politics.",
    "Yes, I thought the texts were very interesting and enjoyed the discussions about them.",
    "Professor Garsten is the world's best dad. He walks you through old texts on political philosophy clearly and kindly and offers suggestions about how they can change your political worldview. Professor Garsten is approachable and eager to speak with students in office hours. I think you should take writing credit. It's actually manageable since each piece of writing builds on a shorter piece, so you never add more than 1000 words.",
    "This class was absolutely phenomenal. Having never taken a philosophy class before, I really enjoyed the challenges of thinking philosophically and I appreciated the practical political tie in. Professor Garsten is a brilliant lecturer and his lectures were always captivating and interesting. I'd recommend this class to students seeking to broaden their ideological horizons. I'd also suggest actually doing all of the readings because regardless of whether or not you're taking it writing intensive, it will help tremendously on the final.",
    "This is a great class for people who want to cover an enormous range of philosophical thinkers from Plato to Machiavelli to Nietzsche. We really read A LOT, so make sure you can cover this material before you take the class! I had to catch up so much by the end of the course because I was not in writing-intensive and therefore had no incentive to keep up with the readings...this did not work so well in my favor. Professor Garsten is a really phenomenal thinker and lecturer (and a nice guy overall). Come to lecture prepared to take lots and lots of notes! As far as sections go, I feel like a lot of your overall experience really depends on your TA (including grades, discussion level, etc.) Take this class for a challenging reading list and an interesting learning experience.",
    "100%. This course is a must. You will learn so much and Prof Garsten is amazing.",
    "I would recommend this class to someone because the reading list is fascinating and, I believe, all those books are must-reads."
