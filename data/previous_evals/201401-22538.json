    "The physical background of protein NMR.",
    "The class starts with very basic quantum mechanics to explain NMR, with an extensive background of the theory behind NMR, and then into more application of the theory. I would absolutely recommend this class to another student. It was very useful and interesting.",
    "The course is a little disorganized, but not a lot of work is needed throughout the semester. That said, if you take the time to process the notes, you will learn a lot about the theory of NMR.",

    "I definitely know a lot more about the capabilities of NMR as well as its limitations as a spectroscopic technique of analysis after this course"
