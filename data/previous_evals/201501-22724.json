    "Yes, I would recommend Russ 140 to another student. Language skills are critical for the interconnected world in which we live. For students who entering into this level of Russian, I would encourage them to continue on their journey of language study.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course. It is engaging and incredibly effective.",
    "Take it. Irina is amazing and your Russian will really improve.",
    "Yes! If you're thinking about quitting Russian now, don't. You'll improve so much from this semester, and have a lot of fun learning the language more in-depth. We also read a lot of poems and short stories, so you get a great cultural component and can feel good about yourself for being able to (sort of) read Pushkin, Blok, and others in their native language!",
    "Yes, I would recommend it. It's a lot of mindless drill work every single night, but if you can get over that, then it's worth it."
