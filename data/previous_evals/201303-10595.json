    "This is an awesome class to take and it greatly improves all your French skills. I know I've improved a lot because of this class. You start out with a very condensed review of L1 French (but very useful, since people who are taking this class did not take L1; they simply placed into L2, so they usually are not all at the same level), and then you can begin the usual L2 material. Classes are pretty fun, the workload is definitely worth at least 1.5 credits, and the instructor, Madame Skorupa, is one of the best and enthusiastic you could have at Yale.",
    "Take this class!",
    "Learning how to speak French fluently .",
    "Yes I would recommend it. Great for students with a basic foundation of French but wanting to learn more useful expressions. Also good for strengthening and building grammar.",
    "I definitely saw my French improve over the semester but it's a lot of work. Expect daily homework that usually can't be off due to heavy work in other classes."
