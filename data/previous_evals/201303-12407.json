   "comments": [
    "So, so good. A fascinating overview of what is often the most inaccessible and misunderstood era of art. I was genuinely interested in lecture each week, and sections in the YUAG were excellent. This course may have convinced me to become an Art History major - I'm genuinely sad to see it end. The mode of thinking about art takes some time to develop, and the concepts can be hard to grasp, but once you begin to understand it, your perspective on contemporary art will be wholly changed. Take it!!!",
    "This was my first art history class and was a great one to take credit\/d. Professor Joselit is really awesome and a great lecturer. Section met in the YUAG every week and there was a midterm, 8-10 page paper, and a final - all of which were not particularly difficult. I really enjoyed the class and is a great one to take first if you've never taken art history before but enjoy visiting the MoMa!",
    "Yes and no. If you love modern art and conceptual art, it definitely explores the work that's been done from an interesting angle. I didn't love the content, especially after the midterm",
    "I recommend this course to someone interested in getting a sense of period of art!",
    "Good course - definitely helped me gain some perspective on contemporary art. the lectures are usually quite good but can get a little dry sometimes. Workload (midterm+final+final 10pg paper) is very manageable.",
    "GREAT class! Survey of some incredible art, with historical\/trend analysis that is fascinating. Plus Joselit is extremely nice and engaging, and, of course, totally brilliant!",
    "Absolutely, very interesting, enjoyable class especially Credit D",
    "-good course to get a grasp of contemporary art-accessible even if you've never taken an art history course",
    "I liked it, didn't love it. Depends how much patience you have for contemporary art thinking. I love contemporary art; was less into drawn-out speaking on the less-accessible points.",
    "Of course, one must appreciate the depth and breadth of the material when forming expectations about this class; we covered a very interesting and busy time in the history of art. You can always go into more detail in any one of the topics\/themes\/artists but if you are interested in modern art\/ postwar art, this is the course that will give you the basis for understanding and future research. Finally, as a non-art history major, and actually a STEM major, I can attest to the fact that this course does not require such background. However, I am also not the best person to say so because I have a huge interest in art and art history and have taken a general art history course before.",
    "Absolutely take the course if you want to know about art that can be very strange sometimes, but very interesting. Reading was significant which surprised me and they were often very difficult without much review, but they weren't too significant in tests and evaluations.",
    "Definitely take this class.",
    "Definitely a class worth taking. A great survey on Art History since 1950.",
    "Western Art Since 1950 was a great class to get a better understanding of modern art- not only this history behind it, but the why and how as well. Section was also great- there is nowhere else you will be able to spend an hour a week analyzing world famous paintings right in front of you!",
    "This course is extremely accessible for non-art history majors and one that offers extremely compelling arguments for the sometimes fairly incomprehensive and hard to appreciate modern art. I definitely recommend it!",
    "Absolutely. I approached the topic very hesitantly at first, but I came out with a head swirling with new ideas. Modern art is fascinating and comments on economics, philosophy, math, and a bunch of other fields, so there is bound to be something interesting.The readings, despite being written by modern artists, are surprisingly diverse and legible.",
    "Take this class Credit\/D like I did and don't be afraid to challenge everything that comes up\/everything that your classmates believe in or see in art.They are using their brain, not their eyes\/bodies to think!",
    "Fun class, don't even know if it's still happening because joselit left.",
    "I loved this class. It was a wonderful introduction to contemporary art. The class covered many movements and about 60 years. I know Joselit is leaving but I think this class should be taught again!",
    "Definitely! This will teach you how to walk into a gallery and understand contemporary art.",
    "The course covers a lot of information (so tests aren't fun), but you will leave the course with a solid basic understanding of art within the past 60 years. I would recommend this course.",
    "Really interesting class- study a wide variety of art. Sections are fun because you get to go to the Art Gallery!",
    "Definitely. If you're not sure you have the time for all the memorization, start out credit\/d and see if you want to switch it.",
    "this course begins with a quick lead-up to the movements of the 1950s. Following lectures group progressions and movements by overarching themes, often bouncing back and forth between older works to establish a narrative. Closing lectures include work from the current year. The course is complemented by work from the YUAG.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to any student. I have a very basic art history background and it was great to learn the history of western art through such knowledgeable people. On top of this it has broadened my knowledge of artists that I feel relate to my own work.",
    "Very good survey course of modern and contemporary art. Interesting readings and correlations between lectures. Equally accessible to majors and non-majors alike. This course takes advantage of Yale's collection in section, which is a plus.",
    "If I could, I would take this course again. It's a must for an art student.",
    "This course provided an excellent overview of different trends in art from 1950 to the present. I would recommend this course, particularly for a student who is introduced in thinking through thematic issues rather than simply receiving a chronological account."
