    "coastal resilience, storm surges, seawall construction, economic analysis",
    "GIS skills, learning about the economic background of costal defense, and how to prepare a defense plan within the model we were provided",

    "An understanding of how SLR and storm surge risks are assessed in economic terms. Built on previous GIS knowledge and applied skills to produce GIS outputs. Understanding some of the dilemmas with coastal protection decision making Understanding some of the terms and variables that feed into a model for economic assessment of coastal protection and non-protection.",

   "comments": [
    "strengths: practical and interesting economic analysis weaknesses: a little bit more about GIS. I wish I knew GIS was a key part of this class.",
    "This course had a strong focus on a particular problem and treating it as a project to be addressed. It would benefit from more structure and feedback as the project progressed, as well as clearer expectations on what the project and focus of the course were.",
    "The class wasn't very organized, but it was brand new and the model we were basing our entire project off of was developing throughout the semester, so it was a learning process for all of us. The way we were to be graded throughout the semester was rather unclear.",
    "Small class allowed for easy interactions between students and instructors, very much a collective learning and sharing experience. Some elements of the project were trial-and-error, but they provided valuable lessons in my mind, and any other project (in or out of the school setting) would encounter trial-and-error elements. I appreciated this.",
    "I wish the course were a bit better organized and that it was made clearer what was expected of students and when. I felt like time was often wasted trying to figure out what we were going to do in class and that could have been avoided if the professor had laid out a plan ahead of time. I also think it should have been more clear that the majority of the work would be in GIS, especially since both professor and TA did not have GIS skills. Lastly, I think more attention could be paid to solutions other than walls, because in reality walls will not be practical everywhere and will often have environmental \"costs\" that can't be given an economic cost."

    "you should have a good understanding of GIS",

    "It is helpful to know GIS before taking this class.",
    "Provides an insight of econometric (and GIS) based approaches to assessing coastal vulnerability and protection to storm surge.",
    "Since this was the first time the class was offered, I'm sure it will change in the future, but I only recommend taking the course if you are really interested in coastal protection from sea level rise. Even then, be prepared to work pretty independently and deal with some lack of organization."
