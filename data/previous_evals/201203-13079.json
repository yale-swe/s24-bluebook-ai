   "comments": [
    "Yes, they just need to be prepared to devote a lot of time for taking photos as well as time for being in the darkroom.",
    "take it! you learn the basics of photo taking, developing, and printing. darkroom skills are really valuable, and it's very satisfying to make prints and learn some photo history while you're at it.",
    "Definitely. I'm a senior engineering major and wanted to take an art. I'd recommend this class to anyone.",
    "Highly recommend, but bear in mind that it is a giant time suck--as it should be. At the beginning they say 10 hours in the darkroom a week but I feel like it was more. I would've liked a more in-depth look at what contemporary photographers are doing but I can understand how that might be suited to a class in, say, the art history department.",
    "Definitely take B&W Photo! Just seriously consider a CPA Award to cover the costs of the class.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend the class to anyone interested in black and white photography. Be aware that you need to devote a lot of time to the dark room, though.",
    "If you've taken a film photo class before, intro photo is exactly what you would expect it to be. Most of the actual work takes place outside of the class, while the lectures alternate between the technical aspects of making prints and a historical perspective on photography as a form of art. It is a challenging course that pushes you to work harder than you might expect from an intro course, but the finished products really do reflect what you put into it. Be warned that it is a pretty expensive endeavor, with the $150 materials fee reflecting only about a third or fourth of what you will be putting into the class. Don't let that stop you from taking it though, as the experience is quite worth it if you are even remotely interested in photography as an art form. If you're one of those people who just likes to take pictures of friends and memories, think long and hard before you commit to film photo, as this class is as far away from that as you can get with the same basic equipment. Definitely not a class for the faint of heart",
    "I would absolutely recommend Intro to B&W, but only if you're willing to put in the time to create something that you're really proud of. This class is a lot of work (especially right before crits) and can be incredibly rewarding if you're willing to experiment\/take risks. We spent one day per week in lecture, which was at times engaging but was also incredibly long. The other day was spent in the darkroom. Although this is an intro class, it would still be enjoyable\/challenging for someone who's already had experience developing\/printing from 35mm film. Crits were generally a positive experience (it was great to see classmates' work), but could also be brutal. This was one of my favorite courses this semester.",
    "Fun photo class, suitable for all levels",
    "Great Class.I highly recommend that, if wanting to take this class, to take it with Ben. His class was much more challenging than the other professors, and it resulted in amazing improvement in everyone's photos.Be expected to lay down some serious cash for supplies, the end result is quite worth it. And, the enjoyment I found while being in the darkroom often had me feeling like I was neglecting my schoolwork, when in fact was doing my schoolwork. :]",
    "AMAZING CLASS, take it if you get the chance! Be aware that it will eat all of your time, so it's best to take it if you have a lighter load one semester so you won't be under stress during all the time you'll spend in the darkroom. If you can allow yourself that, the time will pass quickly and it's easy to enjoy the long hours in the basement, perfecting those prints and going out into the world to make pictures.",
    "If photography deeply interests you, then you will love this course - be forewarned that you will be spending a LOT of your time outside of class working in the darkroom. Success in this class requires consistent effort and thought, and you will make the most of this class if you throw yourself completely into the work. You will love this class if the possibilities of photography excite you - you will be given free range to create and execute your own projects. Ben is an excellent resource."
