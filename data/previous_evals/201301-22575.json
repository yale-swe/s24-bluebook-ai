   "comments": [
    "I would not recommend this course to future students, it is not the fun \"Queens of Pop\" class that you experience during shopping period.",
    "no. don't. the discussion were cool but were never let be to mature and the assignments are tedious",
    "I'm torn about this. The material of the class is wonderful, and if you love pop music this is a great way to engage in it critically. The essays are fun and easy to write, and the workload is totally manageable. However (and this is a big however), it's run like a high school class. Every time we turned in an essay, the next class we would spend nearly 30 minutes workshopping the writing, fixing awkward sentences and talking about con-arguments. Also, one day a guest from the music library came in and talked to us for half the class about how to search for articles on the library database. There are also needless \"preparatory\" assignments for the essays that make it feel like you're being babied through it all. I wouldn't have minded all of it but for the fact that we only covered about half of the material (we were supposed to have units on pop, hip hop, jazz, and rock, but we only got to pop and hip hop). Emily is leaving so who knows whether this is being offered again. It has the potential to be a great course for the music department, but it needs some work.",
    "I thought this class was going to be fun. Just talking about Britney Spears and Madonna and the like. But it wasn't. Instead it was angry WGSS majors complaining about how everything in pop music is anti-feminist. It's a shame because it could have been an awesome class.",
    "I don't think I would but it may be better next year the second time around.",
    "A great way to reconsider the \"norms\" of pop media\u00e2\u0080\u0093 the people in the class also really help to develop what we talk about. Every student does presentations which are some of the most interesting parts.",
    "Well worth it for anyone with any interest in either music or feminism or pop culture, no matter what background or level of familiarity.",
    "Queens of Pop is a fun class. It's basically Billboard Top 100 for credit (in the best way). Basic feminist theory, basic music analysis, basic film analysis + Britney Spears, Beyonce, Madonna, etc. There's a lot of discussion and presentations for which you get to pick a song to focus on. There's also a lot of writing, which is taken seriously (although you get a theoretical grade until you revise for the final project, which is just kind of weird - not necessarily bad though). Lots of fun, interesting, interesting, thought-provoking but not too hard. Take it!",
    "This class was excellent! If it is offered again, take it. Professor Green does a really good job of explaining musical and academic concepts to students. It was a really fun class."
