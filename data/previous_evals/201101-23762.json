   "comments": [
    "I definitely recommend it, the readings are super interesting, Prof. Brown is the best; and has unmatched first-hand experience in the corporate law world.",
    "A great course covering material and themes relevant to anyone considering law school, especially the field of corporate law, or entering the business world. You will get to learn about corporate social responsibility, the real and debated rights of shareholders, and how corporate governance--the way corporations delegate power and decision making among the board, management, and shareholders--affects a company's profile and arguably success. Professor Brown's experience working at one of the world's largest (if not the largest) pension funds adds real-world experience to the seminar's content. You get to see how an institutional investor's perspective may differ from some of the academic arguments over the desired level of shareholder participation and why. I would definitely recommend it to anyone with an interest in these and related topics!",
    "Definitely a much-needed break from typical theory-laden Yale courses. I learned a good amount and got the chance to hear some truly fantastic guest speakers. The HBS case approach to the course was one that I enjoyed and I looked forward to reading the cases each week. Prof. Brown is a wonderful guy and brings a unique perspective to the course since he represents an institutional investor (TIAA-CREF). You'll get to discuss a lot of household names and their governance practices: Goldman, Target, Nike, Wal-Mart, etc. I highly recommend it.",
    "This is a great course on a subject that doesn't get much attention in other disciplines. Professor Brown is incredibly knowledgeable about the topic - he's one of the top guys in corporate governance at TIAA-CREF (if you don't know what this very large private pension fund is, you'll certainly will by the end of the course).You don't really need any background in business topics to take this course. Workload is pretty light and generally intersting (2 short written assignments + final research paper).Also, guest speakers are fantastic as well.If you're interested in this topic - either from a business or a legal perspective (we did both) - definitely sign up for it!",
    "learn about the ins and outs of corporate governance, kinda like a survey, a watered down version of a law school, though with no legal jargon",
    "Stephen Brown understands what a college seminar should be: fun, interesting, and not too much work. Readings about corporate theory can get dense or dull sometimes, but you don't have to do the reading. Don't skip the case studies, though \u0097 they're all enjoyable reads, handpicked by Brown, and cover famous corporations like Wal-Mart and Nike. If you have the opportunity to take this class, do it; even in a semester when you have a lot of time-consuming classes, it would work well as a fifth class.",
    "The course discusses corporate governance- the relationship between executives, the board of directors, the shareholders, and the stakeholders. It's a great course if you're interested in entering the business world or law, or even if you will one day hold stocks. It can get kind of boring, but I think the cases you go over will make it much more interesting.",
    "Yes, it was very chill but still informational and useful. Take it if you want to go into corporate law!",
    "A small lecture on corporate law and corporate ethics taught by a corporate lawyer.",
    "A class unlike any other at Yale. Valuable for anyone interested in the corporate world or interested in how corporations affect our lives. Highly recommended.",
    "Fantastic course! Learned so much useful information about corporate America.",
    "Overall, a good class. Emphasis on governance and shareholder rights and less on CSR. Can be strengthened by more class discussion. The HBS case studies were interesting but the discussion was lacking because the professor talked for most of the class.",
    "An informative course on a (lamentably) rare topic in college discussions, namely the ways that governance functions within a company. Course matter was at times repetitive, but not difficult. Professor Brown is extremely friendly and enthusiastic about both the subject matter and his students--a very approachable, good guy. The force of his personality generally drove the course more than discussions, which could be a little superficial or forced."
