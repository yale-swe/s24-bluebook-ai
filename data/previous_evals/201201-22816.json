   "comments": [
    "Great way to improve your writing skills.",
    "When I took the class it was five 1250-1500 word essays and three shorter exercises. You will always be working on either a draft or final version of a paper. You will be given one week for the draft and one week for the final copy. Each essay has a pretty general prompt which reflects the essays you are reading in class. This class requires a fair amount of time, but is definitely manageable. Writers of all skill levels will gain a lot from this class.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. Shop it first (all of this is assuming you get in, given the huge popularity of 120) because it all depends on the professor-student dynamic. But it's definitely one of those Yale hallmarks, and unlike HSAR 115, you can experience it in a seminar setting. Readings are great, workload is relatively heavy but doable. Do the readings. Don't not do the readings. And take this class.",
    "You should absolutely take this class.",
    "Awesome, lots of work but well worth it.",
    "DEFINITELY RECOMMEND. TAKE OVER ENGL 114 FOR SURE. Be prepared for a lot of work, however.",
    "In English 120, you read about three or four short essays for each class, discuss them, and write a first draft every two weeks and a final draft every other week. The assigned readings are enjoyable, and you get used to writing 1250-1500 word essays (unless you absolutely hate writing).If you are looking for a class to improve your essay-writing, this is it, folks. Don't let the English department's grading guidelines hold you back. What you learn is so much more rewarding than the grades you receive, and you will see yourself improve (if you put worth the work). Take it with Professor Shirkhani if possible. She's a freaking rock star teacher.",
    "Yes I would definitely recommend this class. The readings are great and are always fun to read. The essays are very tough and are a lot of work but very rewarding to look back on.",
    "English 120 was really a great experience. We write a paper every other week, with the weeks in between having a draft due. Prof. Shirkhani was really great, she was personable and I felt taught me a lot about writing. It was much more worthwhile than Engl 116, which I also have taken. There are readings for every class, but they're usually pretty short and enjoyable. The workload isn't crazy, as some people say it is, but I still think it's ideal to take it as a freshman because it sets the standard for writing and you'll have more time to devote to it.",
    "Yes it's a fun class; definitely one of the most fun classes I've taken at Yale.",
    "It was a love-hate relationship, with the hate coming first but the love coming strong. At first I thought that I didn't like this class, that the instructor just didn't like my style or didn't understand my way of doing things, which all previous English instructors had liked, but soon I discovered that my frustration lies in my being emotionally attached to my writing and distrusting\/disliking criticism. Once you realize the audience you are writing to, which is different since this is reading and writing the \"modern\" essay, you can really grow. I feel so much stronger about my writing now, because I expanded my strategies and style and learned a lot in the process. Overall, it was wonderful and probably a staple Yale experience. However, it's a lot of work if you do want to achieve the noticeable growth that this class can help you with. Don't take it as a fifth class.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this class. As someone who's not too fond of writing AP Lit-like essays, this class definitely find a new appreciation for writing because of its incorporation of creative writing techniques. I enjoyed the small seminar setting and because of it, students were able to really discuss and give feedback to each other. My writing improved tremendously! Shirkhani is also an awesome professor!!"
