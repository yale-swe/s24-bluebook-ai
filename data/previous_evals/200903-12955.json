   "comments": [
    "This is a difficult class. Some of the material is dry. Tacitus is the best historian.",
    "Although the texts are dense and there is perhaps too much reading for in-depth understanding, I highly recommend the course as it is a wonderful overview of ancient historical and political thought. The lectures are really enlightening, one develops a relationship with your highly knowledgeable section leader, and discussion really gets at the important tensions and issues raised by these works.",
    "In that it is part of Directed Studies, I would recommend it. But, inherently, I think it is the most scattered and least engaging of the three classes.",
    "You should do Directed Studies.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. It is, to be sure, quite a bit ofwork--we read and discuss a tremendous number of texts. That said, all the works on the syllabus are excellent. While Dr. Levine does not take as active of a role in class discussion as I would like, she does encourage student participation excellently; everyone is expected to contribute to section. Thus, discussions are usually quite good. Essay topics, further, are quite interesting.",
    "Directed Studies History\/Politics introduces you both to classical history and to classical historical\/political thought, with an emphasis on the latter. These books provide unique approaches for understanding history, and much of the course is making sense of that.This was by far the heaviest workload of any DS section, assigning 200 dense pages a week in the latter half of the term. If you can manage to stay ahead of it, it's fine, but, if not, you can be in real trouble. Also, in my experience, these were the most harshly graded papers of any course.I would recommend this course to any budding historians, and as a necessary compliment to the other parts of DS.",
    "Yes, probably the most challenging class of the 3 however."
