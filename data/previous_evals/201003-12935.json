    "Yes. Doing research complements standard normal courses effectively, and there's no better lab to work in. The seminar itself is not a huge additional amount of work, and most of the reading is interesting (and some mindblowing if you don't already know the concepts). Time commitment not small with research component, but it's really damn fun.",
    "ONE OF THE GREATEST CLASSES EVER. You get to play with monkeys and work at one of the leading labs in the world, while simultaneously talking in seminar format about studies about humans and animals with one of the best professors at Yale. Oh, not to mention attending lab meetings with some of the smartest people in the world (seriously). Class is formative and educational, and a truly unique experience. Everybody is jealous of PSYC 371 students, and for good reason. I'm going to miss this class, and if you're interested in animal cognition or general awesomeness, and you have the hours to put into lab, DO IT!",
    "Definitely take it, it's a once-in-a-lifetime educational experience.",
    "It's like directed research in monkey lab with extra readings and papers on the side. It's a lot of work but Professor Santos is amazing so I'd definitely recommend it.",
    "Yes, definitely! Laurie Santos is awesome, working with monkeys is cool, and the atmosphere of the lab makes for an awesome learning environment. Most of my best stories from this semester are related to monkey lab. Take it, definitely!",
    "GREAT COURSE! Working in the monkey lab is a truly unique and rewarding experience, and Professor Santos is a fantastic teacher. This course is a MUST TAKE if you're at all intersted in learning about or doing research with primates. Really teaches you how to set up and run a good experiment. Make sure you have the time though -- it meets once a week at night for two hours, then you'll have to go into lab three times a week for 1.5 hours each.",
    "YOU GET TO PLAY WITH MONKEYS. what else do you want in life?",
    "THIS COURSE IS WONDERFUL WONDERFUL WONDERFUL. I learned so much about the field of animal cognition (and about human psychology!!) The opportunity to work hands on with the capuchins was amazing. I will certainly continue to be associated with CapLab as long as I can, and, in fact, because of this work, want to pursue a career studying animal cognition. THe capuchins are a riot, and are smarter than... well, smarter than your pet dog you thought was so smart. You will find yourself becoming very attached.This class not only introduced me to ths rigorous study of animal cognition, but also to the development of human psychology.Invaluable. Unmatchable. Take it. Oh, there is a high time committment. 8 hrs per week or so in the lab, plus a 2 hour lab meeting.",
    "You get to work with monkeys. It is as cool as it sounds",
    "Hands on research experience with monkeys. If comparative cognition interests you, take it.",
    "This course could be very demanding in terms of sheer hours of input, but it provides very worthwhile exposure to the laboratory setting, and a great discussion section, to boot. The workload outside of the required hours was not too onerous. Definitely a worthwhile course.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS ALWAYS. I held hands with a monkey and fell in love. What more could a girl ask for?Also Laurie Santos is the coolest professor at yale and the material is awesome.",
    "Great course with awesome discussions that are bound to excite you (as a psychology student). The lab experience is wonderful too (working with capuchins). It's a truly unique, great, opportunity.",
    "This class is a great introduction to capuchin psychology and into the capuchin lab. I would definitely recommend it, with the caveat that the person has to be willing to commit a decent amount of time to the class. Between lab and class it's a lot of time spent in class for a 1 credit course, but I would definitely say it is worth it.",
    "Absolutely recommend. Really great way to get lab experience and learn a lot. Plus it's a lot of fun."
