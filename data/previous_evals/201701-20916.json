   "comments": [
    "I discovered that I really enjoy public health and the readings we did for this course.",
    "This course is the perfect mix of science and politics. Prof. Bazell introduces plenty of science concepts, which are sometimes difficult, but they are well-integrated and he breaks them down nicely. You gain multiple perspectives on every issue, and the way it develops as the course progresses facilitates learning.",
    "I developed new insight on cancer. It really opened my eyes to the complexity of the disease and the various impacts it can have on patients and their families.",
    "Part of the history and evolution of cancer and its treatment, controversies over some cancer treatments, the economics behind cancer research, the different efforts that are being made despite the seemingly slow progress in \"the war on cancer.\" We focused a lot on breast cancer and lung cancer.",
    "Everything behind cancer not just as a biological disease but also a social and political phenomenon that impacts nearly everyone",
    "I learned a lot about the history of cancer treatments and drug development.",
    "A fantastic course that revolutionised the way I thought about and perceived cancer and its treatments. It also developed my critical thinking abilities through the readings and class discussions.",
    "I learned a lot about cancer -- I'm still using the material I learned in class in my internship and even in daily life."

   "comments": [
    "A strength was that we had great guest speakers and Professor Bazell responded to student feedback and allowed the course to go in a direction that the students wanted and enjoyed. The readings were a reasonable length and were interesting.",
    "Strengths: Excellent curriculum. Brilliant professor. Readings are engaging and interesting. Guest speakers are fascinating. Weaknesses: Surprise quizzes are not nice",
    "There was a lot of reading of scientific articles.",
    "I like how the professor made the class adapt to the students he was teaching, but feel as if it was a bit slow in the beginning, but definitely picked up towards the end in terms of interesting material to engage with and methods of teaching\/learning.",
    "Strength: Course is built on the students and progresses with the students' intellectual development. Weakness: Wish the class was longer and did more stuff together outside of class like field trips to help the class bond.",
    "A strong course that mixed the science and understanding of cancer with its long and complex history and societal impacts. The guest speakers to the class were also very significant in their respective fields and gave the class a very relevant and meaningful feeling in todays world as well. No weaknesses - amazing course!",
    "This was a great course! Prof. Bazell made sure to check in once in a while to ensure that students were happy with the way the class was taught, so it was an extremely productive working environment."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course to another student. You do have to read scientific papers but it is a relatively easy science credit and is also very interesting. If you are interested in history of science or public health then you will get more out of it.",
    "I wish I could verbally explain this course to everyone who is considering shopping it. Just take this class. It is phenomenally taught and super interesting. As a political science student, sometimes I felt intimidated by the actual science, but then you can just ignore it and ask questions. Actually knowing all of the details isn't important, but you become acquainted with so many different topics and themes. There are surprise quizzes, but when you all do poorly on the first one, he'll make them all open computer and open notes and then you'll get all A's! Readings are easy and interesting, but you can definitely skip a few. Class discussions are relaxed. Midterm paper is easy and short and very open, final paper was probably one of the best parts. Please please please take this class. If you get in, don't you dare drop it. It's the perfect science class for non-science majors, and it's the perfect science class for science majors.",
    "Yes! Especially if you are not a science person.",
    "Absolutely loved this class, personal topic that became a passionate one. Professor Bazell is not only a great teacher but also a wonderful person to talk to! Highly recommend if you get the chance.",
    "Yes, I think I learned what I want to do in the future in this course.",
    "This was one of my most enjoyable classes of the year. Fascinating and I learned a lot. Customized to students. Flexible approach. Manageable workload.",
    "I would say to any student, regardless of major\/interests - take this course if you get into it! It may start a little slow, but it picks up very quickly. It may be a science credit, but there is so much flexibility with your assignments and the course topics and class discussion are so fascination that it will make you feel very knowledgable coming out of class everyday.",
    "Yes!! This course was such a great introduction to the world of cancer, including it's history as well as the science behind it. If you're even remotely interested in cancer, I would recommend taking Bazell's class. He did a great job of bringing in outside experts in various fields to expose us as students to not only the different facets of cancer but also the different careers we could follow if we wanted to pursue cancer research, ranging from the financial side of things to hospital surgeons. So YES please take this course!"
