    "A bit more theoretical but it's definitely a very good class to take.",
    "Excellent course. I came into the class without that much background in social theory, but Prof. Eyerman made the material very accessible. The (1-2 page) response papers that were assigned each week had a meaningful positive impact on class discussion; the more the people in a class do the reading, the better the discussions will be. Our discussions were typically very good. The midterm assignment (two short essays) and the final paper (10 page essay) were both very manageable, but both still gave me a chance tothink more deeply about the material. In short, a very good course, and definitely worth taking if you're interested in post-World War II social and political thought.",
    "This is an amazing course. I loved the format - we just read a book every week and talked about it. Because we had to write a response for every session, everyone actually did the reading and some of the best discussions of my Yale career took place in that room.",
    "Take this class if you want to learn how the study of sociology can interact with anything you do!",
    "One of my favourite courses this year. The seminar is quite simple--a book or so a week, with discussion and relatively straightforward written assignments--but it never feels onerous. The class discussion was fantastic, largely because of the smaller size and because everyone came prepared and interested in the material. Professor Eyerman is really great: he knows how to guide the discussion without being overbearing, and helps keep a sense of overarching structure yet also lets the conversation wander as it will.",
    "This course was a broad survey of influential sociological theory since the 1950's. It covered a broad range of topics, but discussions perhaps hinged around the agency\/structure debate, discussions of power structures, and the meaning of modernity. While many of the writers we read were not directly related (Arendt, Goffman, Mills, Foucault, Bauman, Giddens, etc), they were all fascinating. The seminarwas almost entirely discussion based, with Professor Eyerman serving mostly to guide the students. If you are looking to learn from the professor, this might not appeal to you, but if you are looking for thought-provoking discussion, its perfect. Professor Eyerman himself was very helpful and definitely seemed to care about the class. The readings were reasonable, and there was a weekly reading response due, which formed the basis for the next discussion. Graded assignments consisted of these, a take-home midterm, and a 10 page final term paper, none of which were too time-consuming. Again, if you are looking to think about issues that you might not have thought of before, take this course, even if you have absolutely no background in sociology.",
    "This is a theory class, so we read many different authors such as Arendt, Mills, Goffman, and Bauman. We dealt with a lot of big topics, including power, modernity and trauma and healing. I loved how this class introduced me to many theoretical lenses through which I could view other topics that we hadn't discussed in class; all of the readings and seminars were really interesting and stimulating. The other students in the seminar were really engaged and knowledgeable, and it was overall a great experience. The weekly reading responses helped me digest and think through the sometimes difficult readings before class. The final paper is very open-ended, so you can really write about anything you found interesting during the course. It's a lot of reading, but definitely worth it, and Professor Eyerman is awesome!"
