   "comments": [
    "Comprehensive understanding of various definitions of populism, and different ways to measure it in political speeches.",
    "I gained a deeper understanding of Populism, which is a concept I hear talked about often in politics, but I did not know have an academic knowledge of it.",
    "I now understand what populism (and is not), how to recognize it in different contexts, and how to examine arguments related to populism on a deeper level.",
    "I came into this class with a vague association between populism and xenophobia and racism and sexism--aspects of the 2016 election (what with Trump called a 'populist') and of the U.S. People's party. The class exposed me to many different historical instances of populism, from Latin America to Europe, and we discussed both differences (often economic) and similarities (campaign style, rhetorical). However, the most important takeaway for me was the tension between populism and liberal democracy, towards the end of the course. We did a lot of debate and thinking about what it means to be a true democracy, and what tenets are most important in that form of government, and whether that conflicts with the core of someone's definition of populism (there are many). I definitely did a lot more thought about power, institutions, the people, and authoritarianism and came away with a very different understanding of populism than I arrived, which I believe is especially useful with regards to evaluating modern day events, such as recent elections in both the US and France (and more to come in Germany, etc).",
    "This course provided a really comprehensive understanding of populism as a political phenomenon. It also helped me to think about current events in a more analytical way."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Great seminar atmosphere and Prof. Aslanidis is great. Would have liked a couple more papers\/reading responses to get more graded feedback.",
    "The course was well done. Although, I wish we had learned about populist politics in other parts of the world such as Asia and Africa.",
    "Absolutely incredible class. Professor Aslanidis is very engaging in the seminar and the material is both challenging and exciting.",
    "Strengths: wonderful readings listed on the syllabus, professor accessibility, interesting subjects. Weaknesses: discussions devolved into arguments about Trump (more because of the students' inability or lack of knowledge on other subjects rather than any fault of the professor's), student presentations were awfully planned and executed they were hard to follow, had too much text on each slide, and by the end, they rushed through it.",
    "While I really enjoyed the discussions in each seminar, I thought that they could be more well structured to really get to a debate\/clash of ideas (although I realize that can be difficult in a room where most people fall along the same segment of the ideological spectrum). A lot of focus was placed on American populism, conflating Trump with a populist, and oftentimes too much discussion reverted back to him (although again, difficult for the professor to control). Overall, I enjoyed the class and felt like I walked away with something new. The methodological workshop was very interesting, and it would have been great to do more workshops like that, perhaps using different methodological strategies utilized by different researchers. There was *a lot* of reading, although most of it was relatively interesting, many times two of the readings would generally make the same argument and were a little excessively wordy.",
    "This course provided a lot of time for open discussion which I thought was probably the best aspect of the seminar. I think the course might have been slightly better if we devoted two or three weeks to each topic and went into more depth, rather than moving on to a new topic each week."

   "comments": [
    "Would recommend to anyone looking for a solid, timely political science seminar.",
    "I would recommend this to another student who wants a greater understanding of Populism and the academic literature around it.",
    "Yes very unique course",
    "If you have any interest on understanding what phrases like \"populism\" and \"the people\" mean and have meant in the past, this is definitely the class to take.",
    "Yes, I would. Be prepared for the reading workload to actually participate in discussions. The papers are pretty long, but since you get to pick the topic, they can be pretty interesting, although there's little guidance which simultaneously gives you a lot of flexibility but also many ??? about how the papers will be graded. I think it's an important topic to know about though, and has helped me understand political movements both in the US and abroad much more thoroughly.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone that is interested in learning how to apply a concept that is used a lot in the media today, but that not many people actually understand."
