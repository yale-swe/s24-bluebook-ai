    "It's a good writing credit if you don't want to read literature. However, the reading is nevertheless substantial. Your experience is also very dependent on the TF you get.",
    "AMST 192 covers a wide range of topics in the 20th century pertaining to work and daily life. I liked that the course had a lecture and seminar component, and the readings were pretty interesting. However, the lectures were often disjointed and I didn't know what to get out of them. In addition, the reading group really shapes your experience so make sure that you get one that you like! Mine had potential, but ended up having a ton of awkward silences because the discussion leader only asked trivial questions.",
    "Yes. Very much so. It's about the way that work and daily life have changed throughout the past 120 or so years under capitalism, in America and around the world. It's more about work than daily life, but that's partially because daily life is mch more studied in other courses on culture and such.",
    "Take it. It all comes down to which section you get into, as 95% of the work is based on the particular topic that your section examines. Not all that difficult - about 30 pages of writing all told over the course of the semester, and no in class exams.",
    "I would recommend it if you really are passionate about capitalism and working conditions, and have the time to read about one book a week and respond to a lot of presentations. Also, there is a 4000 word essay at the end. That paper was rough.",
    "Recommend. Lots of work, but worth it. The more you do, the more you learn and the more you will get out of the course. Go to class --- great lectures if you're interested.",
    "Take it if all you want is a writing credit or if you're interested in labor unions.",
    "The lectures can be all over the place. I didn't really get into them, but overall the class is pretty easy. Interesting set up where you have a lecture by Professor Denning on Tuesday and section on Thursday. Pretty writing intensive- writing response every week, but you technically don't have to go to the Tuesday lectures at all to participate in section. Cool class if you like your section. Also, there are no tests! There's a final research paper, and a easy take home final.",
    "This is a tricky one for me to give my opinions on. I took it for the WR credit, and I wasn't disappointed--only 2 papers (one that was 1500 words, one that was 4000) and a 1500-word (easy) take-home final. Weekly readings, almost all picked out by other members of the research group, so they're usually pretty interesting. In terms of the course itself, though, I'm torn. On the one hand, my research group was awesome--if Jose Ramirez is teaching Knowledge Work again, take it! I think part of how much I enjoyed it, though, was that we had an excellent group of people--if you don't like your research group, it will definitely drag. I certainly feel like I learned a ton about the way I look at society from the research group.However, lectures were boring and impossible to follow. Most of the class stopped taking notes after the third class, which was fine, because you hardly ever needed to know the stuff for assignments. He has a sign-in sheet, though, so you're expected to attend.Overall, if you have a good research group and need a WR, go for it. But expect class to be awesome once a week and tedious the other half.",
    "Not easy. Section is AWFUL and having to write a total of 26 pages in one week (finals week) just about killed me and made up for the lack of writing the entire semester.",
    "Take it! But it really depends on the discussion section. I recommend the information technology one, if the same TF is teaching it.",
    "AMST 192 is a solid class. Professor Denning is a very good lecturer, and he does a great job of making fairly dry material seem pretty interesting. It was not my favorite class I've taken at Yale by any means, but it was not a bad class, either. The work load is reasonable. My only complaint would be that the lectures spent too much time on the early 20th century for me. I would have liked to see more discussion of modern issues.",
    "Great class and fairly easy writing requirement",
    "It is a greatwriting course that allows students to develop their own research interests, which is not always easy to do with other courses. The material is very interesting and revealing, covering issues that will not likely ever be covered in another course. Professor Denning gives great lectures, though sometimes it was hard to see how it all linked up until the end. He did a great job structuring the course into different research groups - other Yale professors should follow that idea, it's extremely effective in helping students learn and follow their own interest while linking them to course material.",
    "I think it is a good course that you can have fun with. The information is definately interesting but it has a liberal bias.",
    "If you want to take a class with one of the few more radical professors at Yale (who is an amazing professor), and are at all interested in how changes in capitalism affect people's lives, then take this course.Make no mistake, this course is not a rant on the pitfalls of capitalism, but rather it is an academic overview of the state of people's lives under various working conditions, which draws from a huge wealth of interdisciplinary sources that Denning has pulled together.",
    "A broad class about work and daily life under capitalism. I would recommend the course to anyone interested in labor history or who has a personal interest in some aspect of the topic--there is a lot of room for self-direction.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. The class was good. It combined most aspects of a seminar and a lecture. The class meets twice a week. On one day, we have the lecture by Professor Denning. On the second day, we break off into our seminars with our specified grad student. Professor Denning and our grad students are always willing to help.",
    "I would not recommend this course. I thought this course was rather frustrating because all I learned was that many people were discontent with the capitalistic societies. The discussions were stilted, and the readings were not as interesting as they sounded. Going to lectures became tedious, especially towards the end when they seemed like a laundry-listing of problems with capitalism.",
    "It is unlike any other class at Yale. For a student looking for a different reading of history, I recommend it.",
    "Loved it! Fascinating material with a great professor.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course. The Workload is manageable and the course material is very interesting. This course will get you to think about America's economic system in ways you most likely never have or would before.",
    "You should definitely take it. It's a great class and relevant to everyone's life (unlike, say, that English class you're considering)."
