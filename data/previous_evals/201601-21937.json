    "A class that requires a lot of outside work, to do well, but minimal work while actually in class. This class will teach you strategies to speak confidently and competently on a wide range of topics; whether you are trying to teach, motivate, or change someone's attitude, you will learn it all in this course! A really great course that introduces you to the art of public speaking.",
    "Public Speaking was one of the best classes I've taken at Yale, but this was in large part due to Elise Morrison as the professor.",
    "Elise is an incredible professor, so without her, I don't know whether this class could be anywhere as good, but I will say this. I realized early in the semester that I wasnt checking my phone once even thought the class is two hours long to see what time it was. I would step out of York 220 after each class and wonder at how quickly the morning had passed. That feeling of being lost in something so immersive is incredibly important to me, and something I can not express enough thanks for. Thank you, Elise, for demonstrating to us how to put emotional intelligence into our words. Thank you for the insightful feedback on my speech outlines. Thank you for saying you are proud of me. Cameron may watch Obama speak when he seeks an auditor to emulate, but I will think of your lectures. Thank you!",
    "BEST CLASS. This class is one of the best I have taken at Yale. I learned so much and feel like a much more confident, effective speaker. In this class you do 4 speeches, each with a different end-goal, and get immediate feedback on each one. The feedback is incredibly helpful and all my classmates and I really improved over the course of the semester. The class has a very chill atmosphere, which makes speaking a lot less stressful and nerve-wracking, which made it so that everyone was comfortable and doing their best. The work was at a perfect level and I would recommend this class to everyone and anyone."
