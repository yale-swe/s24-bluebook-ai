    "Great course overall that further garnered my interest in global NCDs. Having a variety of speakers and lectures also allowed for more diverse learning content. There could have been clearer instruction\/expectations for projects, however, maybe through the form of a rubric that students can refer to.",
    "All around very well organized, interesting content, and comprehensive. All the assignments were good reflections of the material taught.",
    "strengths: the professor, topic is very important",
    "One of the best courses I have taken at YSPH. Nicky is a gem. Brilliant, approachable, funny, engaging...I left class feeling so empowered. My ideas felt like they were valued and I loved that the small class size allowed us all to get to know one another and each other's interests. It was my favorite course of the semester.",
    "This class is wonderful. It is well organized, with a deliberate and clear purpose for each class. Professor Hawley could not be a more skilled lecturer or professor. She provides insightful comments on all work and fosters a very engaging, fun and supportive in class environment. I cannot say enough good things about this class.",
    "Dr. Hawley is an amazing instructor who really cares about the students and their individual interest. A very important topic also! A class all people interested in global health should take!",
    "Although a bit basic, this class is a good introduction to the world of global NCDs. The first few classes are a bit slow, but the class picks up when we get to the units that address how to reduce the burden of global NCDs. The guest speakers were fantastic! I do wish we had fewer reading responses, as they were quite time-consuming.",
    "Excellent introduction to non-communicate disease with a global focus.",
    "Strengths: Great discussions, many various topics in global health covered Weaknesses: Summaries may take a long time"

    "Instructor: Nicola Hawley \u00a0Professor Hawley is excellent, certainly one of the best professors I have had at YSPH. She is extremely caring and wants her students to succeed.

Incredible, I feel very luck to have had the opportunity to take this class with her.",

   "comments": [
    "Overall, a great course for those interested in global NCDs without a lot of background knowledge",
    "Would absolutely recommend! Only comment, I think it would be a good assignment to have the different sections of the final paper due at different increments during the semester. Then after feedback, a final culmination of the paper edited and possibly with a last section not previously written. would be a good timeline.",
    "NCDs are an increasingly critical topic in the health space - anyone interested in health should take this class!",
    "This class covers a range of topics within global NCDs. The first half of the class is spent learning about the main NCDs and their risk factors. The second half is spent learning about potential interventions and solutions. It is well organized and extremely well taught. My favorite class at YSPH. I would recommend it to every student, regardless of concentration.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course! NCDs are too often forgotten about in global health and this class is important for learning about them and thinking about what can be done in the future.",
    "Excellent introduction to non-communicate disease with a global focus.",
    "Really interesting. Much more policy focused than epidemiology focused.",
    "Take it!!! Also the class could use more males."
