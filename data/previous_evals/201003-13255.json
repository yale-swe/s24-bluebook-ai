   "comments": [
    "Take it if you want an easy seminar with a very manageable workload.",
    "Take it. We all need to know more about Rwanda.",
    "I would recommend this class because it;s subject is really important and the professor is, in my opinion, very good. Sometimes he would lecture a little bit too much in the class, but I really like how he moderates the discussion in class. While most professors ask questions which are basically tests on whether we did the readings, David Simon brings it to the next level. We are made to think about hypothetical situations and offer explanations for our reasoning.",
    "We analyzed the application, implementation, and aftermath of the Genocide that took place in Rwanda. With the readings, one learned about the consciousness behind the killers, victims, and witnesses to the event and how to potentially diffuse any situation that seems to parallel the revolt.",
    "An extremely interesting topic that gives more than just insight into the 1994 events, covering the tensions beforehand and the recovery process afterwards. The material is not uplifting of course, but parts of the course show the good sides of people and of Rwanda. Professor Simon is a great guy -friendly and interesting. Fairly graded, one of the most interesting classes at Yale, and not pressurized either.",
    "This is a great course. I would recommend it if you want to learn about how genocide happens and probe how to create reconciliation. It's not tough either -- it's a pretty relaxed seminar. I think Professor Simon would rather have us learn about such issues out of our will instead of forcing loads of work on us to do so.",
    "I would recommend the class. It provides a wonderful understanding of one of the most important events of recent history. Prof Simon and the class are both great. Don't take the class with the expectations of a lot of comparative perspectives though. I believe there were only two readings that really related to other genocides.",
    "Would totally recommend, both for students of Africa and those who are not. Very interesting topic taught very well."
