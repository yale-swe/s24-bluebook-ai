   "comments": [
    "MATLAB!",
    "I learnt how to use MATLAB and how to think of biological processes mathematically.",
    "The course was unique in the sense that it was very applied. Many of the other MCDB courses are heavily focused on memorization of material as opposed to applying material. 261 was very applications heavy which provided a fresh experience. More specifically, I developed a lot of Matlab skills (I had no coding prior to the course). From an insights perspective, it was especially interesting to see how simple mathematics can model and predict complex biological behaviors.",
    "Learned more MATLAB, more about specific biological systems\/pathways (e.g. GLUT transporter, chemotaxis, oocyte maturation, etc.), and how quantitative, mathematical descriptions of such systems can be used to model and describe their qualitative behavior.",
    "I have a good understanding of the molecular and mathematical basis behind simple cell motifs (switch behavior, stochastic processes, etc). I had never used Matlab or programmed in general before taking this course, but I now feel comfortable writing programs in Matlab and am sure I could pick up other languages relatively easily. I also learned how to read and present scientific papers. Overall I would be comfortable approaching some sort of biological modeling problem from a mathematical and programming\/simulation point of view.",
    "This course teaches basic MATLAB skills, as well as analyzing simple systems in terms of differential equations."

   "question_id": "YC403",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I think that this course should cater better to people of all skill\/knowledge levels. I was at the very beginner spectrum and felt that I suffered a lot because of my lack of statistical\/mathematical prowess. In the matlab part of the course, there is an attempt to level the field but not in the theoretical part.",
    "The material is very new and very novel which makes for an interesting course. One potential improvement could be to have more of a coding crash course the first two or three weeks of the course so people who dont have a coding background are able to catch up on basic Matlab skills and notation.",
    "Overall, a really wonderful course. Strengths include those of the instructors and the balance of breadth and depth of topics covered (biologically and also mathematically: oocyte maturation and lambda phage but also fixed point analysis vs. stochastic modeling). Weaknesses and possible improvements: Some of the online notes (both from specific lectures given this year and ones recycled from previous iterations of this course) are a little unclear (e.g. variables not defined properly, changing definitions) and could be made easier to learn \/ study from. The same goes for lecture slides, where there are oftentimes (seemingly) random equations strewn about and it's unclear what's going on (in hindsight; it's clear when being taught for the first time). Also the hackathons don't work as well as they could because there are some groups that soar through and then leave quickly while others spend much more time, working with the TFs & professors. I would suggest, given the class' small size, to split the students into 4 groups, each led by a TF or professor. Then, those smaller groups could work through the hackathon with a professor\/TF at a better pace, ensuring everyone's understanding throughout the process.",
    "This course feels very intimate - more like a seminar than a lecture. This course has to reach students with broad backgrounds - biology but no programming, only programming, etc. - so sometimes the material can be repetitive\/basic for some students. I wish the sections had been better structured - many students ended up not going to them. This course should hold different but parallel discussion sections at the beginning of the semester for students with programming or biology backgrounds. I think this course could be improved with a textbook or assigned reading (almost everything relied on in-class notes)."

   "comments": [
    "Honestly this is a great, often overlooked class. For someone who was really sick of memorizing things, the programming and quantitative aspect of this class was really enjoyable. I also felt like the material presented added a new dimension to my understanding of MB&B-related content in a unique way.",
    "I would recommend this course to students with strong mathematical and statistical skills.",
    "A really great course that combines bio, math and compsci. Specifically, biological systems are studied mathematically and modeled via MATLAB. Professors are great, TFs are great, low work, homework is manageable (pass fail for the most part), no final exam, really interesting material. I'd especially recommend this course if you're BME.",
    "I would recommend this course to any students who wish to learn how cells create function, structure, and memory out of reactions and rate constants. I would also recommend this course to students who want to learn basic techniques for biological modeling.",
    "I would recommend this course. I really enjoy MATLAB, and I think modeling is a very important skill. There aren't very many assignments (only three, rather than a weekly problem set, plus a simple exercise due for most classes), which means you do have to self-motivate a lot."
