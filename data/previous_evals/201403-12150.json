    "Latin 110 is a solid introduction and you don't need any background to keep up. It's a very low-key language option. Josh is a good teacher.",
    "Definitely take, it is a very worthwhile class.",
    "If a student is willing to put in the work, I would definitely recommend Latin 110. It has a lot of homework per night, but learning one of the first languages makes up for it.",
    "I would recommend it to a fellow student. It is a language course with the typical daily work load but without the hardest aspects of language learning (speaking, phrases, idioms, etc).",
    "A lot of work but very rewarding. Yes.",
    "Fast paced learning of Latin basics! Take this course if you're learning for a foundational understanding of a very applicable language. The class was also noted to be very good for students of comparative literature.",
    "Latin grammar 101."
