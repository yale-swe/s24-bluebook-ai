    "Great course! Thought how to syntactically analyze a language and do so in a generative and non-prescriptive way.",
    "I now know a ton about syntax, which is really cool.",
    "This course was a great introduction to Syntax, and really helped me to understand more how language works!",
    "I learned how the structure of sentences is analyzed through X-bar theory. We studied lots of evidence for the rules of X-bar theory and the way language is constructed in the mind.",
    "All the basics of syntax! A lot of tree drawing, constituency tests, head movement, etc. We covered many interesting topics, all of which built off of each other.",
    "I honed my critical thinking skills in an interesting way, and I became comfortable with concepts of syntax which I've never been exposed to",
    "I learned an incredible amount about the structure of language, and the myriad ways that what we know about language and how people speak has contributed to contemporary knowledge of how people speak.",
    "A broad and thorough introduction to syntax.",
    "I now have a huge appreciation for language. I find myself listening closely to what people say and analyzing their sentences, and I get bit of a thrill when I encounter interesting syntactic structures in use."

   "comments": [
    "Overall the class was well organized and engaging. Sections were excellent. Problem sets were challenging but excellent at teaching material.",
    "The course suffers from the \"we'll teach you this now but its going to be proven wrong later\" dilemma, but that might be necessary. Otherwise, it's a surprisingly fun, interesting class that can show you a lot about language and make you more interested in linguistics than you might have first wagered.",
    "I don't think this course really had any weaknesses that I could point out! It's engaging, the lecturer(s) and teaching fellow are helpful and engaging, and the material is always fun!",
    "The course does a good job of teaching both the background of the theory and how to apply it by the construction of trees, etc. The sections were very helpful in reviewing and solidifying the information in the reading and lectures.",
    "I thought the course was very well run. Syntax seems like a hard subject to teach, and the instructors did everything they could to make the process easier.",
    "I found every part of this course helpful. Lecture was quite helpful, section was a great chance to ask questions and practice, and the problems sets helped to cement the material. The only thing I might say was a weakness of this course was that we used examples from languages other than English rather infrequently. I'm sure this was a deliberate choice, so that we as students could engage more with our own grammaticality judgements, but I wish that more different languages had been used as examples so that we could've gotten a sense for how universally X-bar theory and other theories can be applied.",
    "This course was excellent, one of the best I've ever taken at Yale. Professor Zanuttini's instruction was always extremely clear and engaging, and the homework and tests were challenging and fair. I left with lots of new knowledge and an interest in a new subject.",
    "The course was well organized and moved through the material in a clear and logical way. Both instructors were engaging lecturers and very helpful, especially when we moved away from the textbook.",
    "The class has a very friendly atmosphere, and is structured very well."

   "comments": [
    "This class is mandatory for linguistics majors, but it's also fascinating for people from a wide variety of other disciplines. The knowledge about deep language structure imparted by this course is invaluable, and Professor Zanuttini is an angel.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student interested in linguistics, mathematics, philosophy, or psychology\/neurology. One very important branch of understanding how the human species has a universal underlying method of communication.",
    "Check this out. Especially if you're a CogSci person or you are just interested because why not? It's actually really cool, not too stressful, and overall a great experience.",
    "Absolutely! Even for someone who has little to no knowledge of linguistics, this is a really great course. If you need it for the linguistics major or just need a social science credit, I highly recommend taking Syntax.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course, even to those not majoring in linguistics. It can work as a first course in linguistics, though a previous one would be helpful. The topic of the class is interesting if you're interested in the structure of language and you're willing to dive deep into the most widely accepted theories of sentence structure in languages. English only gets a small preference in this class: you will talk about many languages in the world and (beautifully) you need no previous experience of those languages to learn how they work in the theory.",
    "Yes! If they were interested in Syntax, this course is an excellent, well-run way to learn the basics.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this class. Certainly any linguistics major should take it, but I think it would also be useful and interesting for other majors as well. It presents a different way of thinking about language and speakers' knowledge of language.",
    "If you have even a passing interest in linguistics this is definitely a course you should take. The assignments and exams are fair but difficult, and the content is never boring. Professor Zanuttini always conveys difficult material in an engaging way. Especially take the course if Matt Tyler is the TF--he does a great job with section and office hours, and he's been the best TF I've ever had at Yale.",
    "Syntax I is a very interesting course. Professor Zanuttini is a very kind and amiable teacher, and - just as as important - she knows what she's talking about. There were times that some of my peers (the class is reminiscent of a seminar, regarding the smaller class size and the interactivity of the class) would ask pretty novel questions, and I was impressed by her ability to respond to this questions and keep the class on track and focused. Even though the class was full of graduate students and Linguistics majors, I didn't feel too out of place and enjoyed learning about the structure that lies beneath language. I really came to appreciate the discipline of linguistics, and I would definitely recommend it as a great way to go slightly beyond the intro to linguistics sequence. There were some slight asterisks I would want to point out, however. There are about 10 homework assignments, and while they are not designed to take a long time to complete, they are not a walk in the park, and it is definitely a good idea to work with your other classmates, as trying to take them on solo is pretty difficult, especially when dealing with something as subject to variation as linguistics (you will find that two people will completely disagree on whether a given sentence is acceptable in standard English, this is a very common occurrence). I also found that the grading on the homeworks was tough, but I never thought the grading was blatantly unfair or fixed - it's just very easy for a couple of mistakes to tank an otherwise flawless assignment, so make sure you cross your t's and dot your i's before handing in assignments! The tests in this class are challenging. There's not really much focus on regurgitation, but your explanations need to be pretty clear, and you can lose points if you start providing murky answers! This can be pretty frustrating especially if you aren't the best at taking tests under pressure, but you can work with the professors and the TA to figure things out. The TA is very open and is a valuable resource, leading sections and extra office hours, and you will definitely need their help to do well! Syntax I, overall, is a very good class, and as long as you stay on top of the classes, go to section, and work with others, you'll do well. (Of course, that's true in every other class you'll ever take, but it bears repeating!) Good luck.",
    "This is a great course that gives a general introduction to syntax. The material was interesting and the class was clear and well run. Weekly problem sets are substantial but not excessive, and lectures are excellent.",
    "This is a truly fascinating and very fun course. I have understand sentence structure and grammar in a much deeper and more meaningful way. I procrastinated doing my other homework by doing syntax psets; I actually actively enjoyed the homework and even the exams simply because syntax is so fun. Raffaella and Matt are wonderful."
