   "comments": [
    "Yes I would very much so recommend this course to any who wants to learn French, but also anyone who wants to learn culture, and other important aspects of life.",
    "I would say that it was a basic French course that really improves your french, and I would definitely recommend it.",
    "French 130 08 is a great class to take if at an intermediate language level. It is a very demanding class with an enormous workload but is also very rewarding once improvements in your language skills is realized. In addition, the class itself is very interactive with lots of reading, role-plays and questions-and-answers: It makes it easy for one to pay attention to the lesson.",
    "French 130 is an intensive study of French that I feel aims to improve spoken, written and listening skills, using conversation and literature.",
    "French 130 is a comprehensive speaking and writing course that will improve fluency and understanding of grammar concepts. Expect up to 1.5 to 2 hrs of daily preparation to fully complete all assignments, oral practice, and reading. The course packet is well designed and if completed as assigned, most definitely helps in preparing for exams. Films and readings are not necessarily the most captivating, but when regarded in an academic context they improve understanding of concepts covered in class.",
    "French 130 is the level where grammar is reinforced and it is likely that you have seen most of it during high school. You also read a number of novels during the course of the semester. This course is structured well.",
    "I would recommend French 130 as it provides a good review of French grammar with a focus on listening comprehension. Having taken French in High School and placing into L3, I felt that grammar concepts were mostly review. However, the class helped to solidify my understanding of the different verb tenses and moods. The homework assignments, while sometimes lengthy and tedious provide great listening practice. Additionally, the novels and movies used in the class were all entertaining."
