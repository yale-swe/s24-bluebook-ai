   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this course if you're in any science discipline here at Yale - it is applicable to a wide range of topics and is well taught.",
    "CHEM 328 with Professor Baxter is reasonable in the workload. Professor Baxter works with the class to make sure that the material is presented in a clear manner.",
    "Take it to fulfill your requirements. Otherwise don't.",
    "Chem328 with Professor Baxter is definitely harder than in previous years with Elsa Yan, but you'll actually learn a lot",
    "I actually really liked this course despite the much greater workload than when this course is taught by a different teacher. It was good to see a teacher that really made us learn the material without having to make us do all the fancy calculus. It is a good course.If you are reading this you are probably also looking at the MB&B major and CHEM 332.I would say if chemistry is not your primary interest but rather biochem or medicine, this course is much better.Essentially what I'm saying is,IF YOU ARE PREMED THIS ONE IS MUCH BETTER THAN 332.",
    "Professor Baxter isn't the best teacher - you'll probably learn more by taking the physical sciences pchem. Because Professor Baxter isn't the best teacher, you'll probably spend the majority of your time learning out of the terrible textbook (Tinoco, Sauer, Wang, Pugilisi). If I could have done it again, I wouldn't have taken this class. Baxter will probably get better over time though.",
    "I imagine you don't really have a choice here if you're an MB&B major. I've heard good things about CHEM333, but 328 is good enough if you want to take biophysics. Professor is good, though the tests fluctuated in difficulty a lot.",
    "If Richard learns from this semester and improves, he'd be better than Elsa. So yes.",
    "The concepts covered in the class are really useful skills for biochemistry or physical chemistry lab work. The class itself is one of the easier science classes I have taken at Yale. You're taught everything you need to know to succeed on the exams and Professor Baxter did a great job presenting the material in an organized understandable fashion.",
    "Chemistry 328 is a course that will teachyou the thermodynamics, kinetics, and other aspects of physical chemistry that are most applicable to the life sciences. If you do not have to take it I would not necessarily recommend it. The material is interesting, but it is not presented in a way that was clear and understandable. Furthermore, the assessments were somewhat unfair and the expectations for each one were not stated very explicitly. Professor Baxter's lectures were OK -- but they are early in the morning and often very theoretical, which can make them difficult to follow.",
    "This class is challenging, but I would recommend it to those who are interested in creating a solid foundation in thermo\/chemistry. Class problem sets are of medium difficulty while tests range from medium to very hard.",
    "Take this course for your major. Take this course if you want to know PChem. Do not take this course just for fun - there are better options in the sciences. Tough material. New professor this year. But course definitely got better as it went.",
    "I would recommend this class for the MBB major or if you have interest in learning in detail about some physical chemistry concepts you may have learned briefly about in Gen Chem. Pchem can be interesting at times, but not the most interesting class...It was a problem set a week and 3 midterms and a final-a lot of work but reasonable. The exams were tough, make sure you use your sheet of formulas well! Definitely ask the professor if you have questions-he's very willing to help.",
    "Overview of pchem with some applications to biology. Interesting and not overly intense. Overall a positive experience.",
    "I would only recommend this class if it is required Otherwise, don't waste your time.",
    "CHEM 328 is a difficult course by almost any standard. Trying to build up from the basic laws of thermodynamics to concepts of equilibrium and kinetics is not an easy task, and requires a considerable investment of study time. Unless you are very confident that you will have enough time to learn the material well, or you are required to take this course, I feel that other courses would be a better use of your time. Professor Baxter can sometimes be confusing in his lectures (but I took this course the first year he taught; he has probably improved), and the textbook (if it's still Tinoco) is not an easy read. The tests for this course in my year were of variable difficulty, but again, that is sometimes characteristic of a professors' first year, so I can't say much about the tests you'll have. If you do decide to take this course, make sure to check out Professor Baxter's lecture notes online; they're very helpful.",
    "This is a pretty straightforward course. The curve is not terribly nice but you do learn the necessary physical chemistry concepts coming out.",
    "This was a really great course! Even if you have already taken CHEM118, you learn about thermodynamics from a much more elegant perspective (since you actually get to use a little calculus in the derivations--not too much in the homework or exams though! Don't worry!). The course is a really really good review of MCAT chemistry, Professor Baxter is an AMAZING lecturer and professor, and you also get to bond with your fellow MBBers in a small class setting. However, the textbook for the course was horrible. Hopefully they will change it, but you might want to get a copy of Atkins too if you actually want to practice and understand the theoretical basis of the derivations given in class. (Don't worry, you don't have to know derivations for the exams)",
    "You probably have to take it. Ignore all evaluations from previous years - this class was hard. A couple of the tests were absolutely outrageous though I expect that this will be changed in following years. Still easier than 332 I imagine though... Seems to be curved to around a B+.",
    "Yes, this is a good physical chemistry class. It is not insanely hard, but difficult enough to where you feel like you learn a lot of material in a semester.",
    "This course is a good way to learn the bits of physical chemistry which pertain to biochemistry and biophysics without having to slog through things only of interest to pure physical chemists. The professor, while somewhat inexperienced, is very bright and learns quickly from his mistakes. His research focus is right in line with the topics in this class, which gives him a useful perspective on them."
