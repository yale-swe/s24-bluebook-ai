   "comments": [
    "Absolutely! But be willing to put a ton of time in it otherwise move out of the way and let someone who's serious take it because there's a lot more to be learned than just how to use the digital camera you have or do some things in photoshop.",
    "Yes -- it's especially great for students who feel they haven't found a creative outlet yet at Yale.",
    "Great course! Be aware that getting in will be very difficult (we had about 80 students apply for 12 spots) so definitely put effort into the application they hand out the first day of class. I had no prior experience with photography but never felt like I was behind, at a disadvantage etc. One recommendation: try pick a theme at the beginning of the course and stick to photographing it throughout the semester. That way, feedback is more helpful and you're really able to chart your progress.",
    "Definitely recommend. You'll put in a lot of time, but it's totally worth it.",
    "TAKE IT if you want to learn about photography, even if you have no experience! It's a great intro class, but also a great second class (after dark room). I absolutely recommend it, especially with John.",
    "Yes, I highly recommend this course to anyone who can get into a section; even if you have no experience in photography, taking this class is a great balance to your other academic commitments during the semester.",
    "I highly recommend this class to anyone who is interested in art photography but who has little to no experience. It's a great beginner's class that will get you started on the right foot re: the basics.",
    "Take it! It will absolutely change the way you think about photography. It is also fairly miraculous how everyone improved as a photographer from the beginning of the class to the end; just about everyone in my class produced a solid, cohesive body of work by the end of it. Actually, wow -- the more I think about it, we all improved a looot. The only downsides are 1. getting used to the DMCA (which isn't actually so bad) and 2. the frustration that naturally arises from feeling stuck taking pictures in New Haven, particularly when it's super cold outside.",
    "Definitely take this course. I would recommend Lehr too, if he weren't leaving. But I still feel this course holds a lot of value and has been one of my favorite experiences at Yale.",
    "This is an amazing class. Take it if you get the chance! It was a fantastic way to work in a very different medium. It's definitely a bit of work, but it's great to have a creative outlet that demands a kind of effort that you aren't asked to put into other classes. Digital photography is a really fun art form, and it really forces you to look at the world in a new light. One of my favorite classes at Yale so far!",
    "I would recommend this class. It's not too much work but is pretty fun. You'll learn how to communicate more with your photographs and get a basic introduction to Photoshop.",
    "Definitely take this class (but take darkroom photography first!). It really has the power to develop you as an artist, even if you don't really think of yourself as an artist."
