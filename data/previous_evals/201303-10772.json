   "comments": [
    "This course is for those who already have a foundation in language learning or who are very committed to learning a language that is very different from their mother tongue.",
    "Definitely take this course if you get the chance. The professors are incredibly, and really really care about you. Make sure you don't take this with a heavy workload though (as I did), because the work involved becomes very stressful. Still a phenomenal class and you will leave the semester with a lot of knowledge about the language.",
    "I would highly recommend CHNS 110 to anyone who is really passionate about learning Chinese. You really have to be dedicated to it and takethe time to learn a lot n your own. To someone like myself, who has taken Chinese before it wasn't extremely difficult but still challenging because of the amount of memorization and focus on perfection of tones. However, to someone who has never taken Chinese before, I think this course would be very difficult!"
