    "I learned some basic information about different psychopathology issues, met different people who work in the field, and learned about Winchester 1 in New Haven.",
    "I learned more about developmental differences. The placement was fantastic.",
    "I gained a deeper understanding on various developmental disorders. I gained a lot of knowledge surrounding this subject, which was useful to me in thinking about a future career that is related to children and adolescents.",
    "There were lots of interesting lectures on various aspects of non-normative child development.",
    "I think the course was very interesting and gave a nice overview of all the different aspects of child psychopathology. It was even more interesting to have placements as working directly with the children offered different insights.",
    "I learned about the nature of various psychopathologies and how they develop in children.",
    "This class is so important for everyone to take. You learn about different developmental psych disorders such as autism depression etc and it will open your eyes. The practicum is a great way to get first hand experience with this.",
    "I learned so much. We got to meet twice a week with an expert and leader in the field, Dr. Volkmar, as well as lots of guest lecturers and discuss all kinds of disorders in children and adolescents. What a cool experience, and Dr. Volkmar is amazing! This course, beyond teaching me about atypical development, humanized disorders for me! As a hopeful future elementary school teacher, I know I'll be able to take everything I learned and be more accepting, responsive, and knowledgeable in my future.",
    "broad overview of diagnosis and treatments for childhood mental illnesses. ability to write a super long paper! (don't worry, workload is light besides this paper)"

   "comments": [
    "I liked how the course brought in many different people. I think the course could be a bit more structured, though, and involve students more. In addition, it might be nice to point to ways in which the field is limited or can still grow in the lectures, since that didn't really come through. Maybe if we got handouts every time about the key takeaways that we should learn from each class that'd be helpful. Also, it'd be nice to get some information on our progress for our grades since we had no idea until the very end.",
    "Strengths: great speakers, interesting topics. Weakness: it would be great to delve into a little bit more detail on some topics.",
    "Strengths - lectures were informative and professor is very knowledgeable Could be improved with more discussion and peer-to-peer interaction, but if a lecture style learning environment is preferred, this is a great course",
    "The class had a seminar size but lacked seminar conversations. It was lecture style with questioning and it felt a bit stilted at times. But the speakers they bring in are pretty great. Since there are various speakers, it does seem a bit disjointed between classes but it's a nice class to learn in. The assignment directions were also quite unclear. The professors are all very nice.",
    "Maybe more structured grading would be helpful as the whole course depending on a final assignment is a bit scary.",
    "I thought this course was excellent.",
    "Strengths- learning from the worlds leading researcher and clinician in autism and get to meet people who work in various different fields as guest speakers.",
    "There was a bit of overlap on content sometimes with the guest lecturers. This is fine, but sometimes when they were more dry, it really made it a challenge to engage with the material consistently. The strengths were learning from a variety of experts and the practicum, which was an incredible experience!",
    "The practicum experience is a great part of the course. Not only was it fun but it also helped solidified more theoretical topics that we learned during class. The guest lecturers were another great part of the course. They were all very interesting and had a wide variety of careers in the field.",
    "Strength: great environment to ask questions and get real detailed answers Weakness: not a ton of cohesion between different topics"

    "It would be a really good fifth credit or if you really enjoy learning about developmental psychopathology.",

    "Yes. I learned a lot and the practicum was amazing.",
    "Take this class!!!! 1000%",
    "yes! fun times and great teacher",
    "Absolutely. Getting to work at Chapel Haven (a special education school) is an invaluable experience that will change you!",
    "ABSOLUTELY",
    "Yes, if you are willing to engage with the materials and have previous interest in the topic. Otherwise, you might just show up and not get a ton out of it."
