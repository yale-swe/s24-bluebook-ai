   "comments": [
    "This class engages learning modes and education not typically embraced in Yale's academic culture; rather than writing our own work, the Yale students edit the men's work. Valuing a constructive and positive rather than overly-critical mode of analysis, our assignments are not about making our work incredible but rather about drawing out what is already theatrical, dramatic, emotional, etc. about the men's work. I learned how to navigate a prison environment also re rules and regulations. I had no interest in Dante's Inferno prior to the course, but this class drew out its contemporary relevance for me."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Sometimes information could be a bit slow to come to students.",
    "The strength of this course is the unparalleled opportunity it gives to work with extremely talented, diligent and wise individual in a prison. It reshapes your sense of what 'justice' means and introduces profound questions about suffering, privilege, life circumstances, and exposes in a very real way the relationship between race, poverty, and incarceration in America. This course could be improved by providing a little more structure for the class readings, which are great but are not tied directly into the course at any point, so that students are left to read them on their own (or not at all).",
    "The strength of this course is definitely the time in Cheshire with the men. The greatest weakness is the time we spend outside of that classroom. There is little that this class actually has to do with engaging the text of Dante outside of working with the men. The best way to read it is with them and I find that even then it becomes less important as the course continues.",
    "The prison went on lockdown several times so some weeks we spent at the Divinity school. Those weeks felt less helpful generally in terms of how much we learned, but it couldn't be helped. The assignments were consistent and interesting. We got to work with and develop friendships with incarcerated men in a relatively relaxed setting, an opportunity not many undergrad students have in an academic context. We read The New Jim Crow, but we never discussed it and based on other students' comments in class, I am not sure everyone read it. There should be a strict rule around not looking up why your partner is incarcerated. Racist remarks made on the bus back to Yale sometimes went unchecked."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course!! It teaches things about life, suffering, justice etc. in a way that no theoretical course can hope to parallel. Although contact with the incarcerated men is forbidden after the course is over, they will remain lifelong friends in my mind, and yours as well if you take this course.",
    "I would because of the work with the men, but other than that I don't know if I would. I found the structure to be poorly organized and Professor Jenkins difficult to work with.",
    "It is a really warm experience that opens up Dante to its contemporary relevance and embraces subjugated knowledges of the incarcerated men. If that sounds like your jam, take it."
