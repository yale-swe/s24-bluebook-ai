   "comments": [
    "Yes, I would recommend this class to those who want to study Chinese further after finishing the elementary level. Textbooks were interesting and teachers were wonderful!!",
    "It's a decent amount of daily work but not overwhelming at all as long as you stay on top of everything. I found this course perfect after studying Chinese in high school; it wasn't too challenging and gave me a chance to get used to the teaching style at Yale. Take it!",
    "I would definitely recommend Chinese 130 02 to another student. I love chinese and I feel like I've learned so much in one semester, maybe more than I learned in my four years of high school. I love the emphasis on tones because my previous instructor didn't emphasize the importance nearly as much as I believe he should have. Chinese 130 02 was great and I can't wait to take L4 in the spring.",
    "Yes, definitely! It's a lot of work but the course teaches you so much.",
    "Absolutely. I think I was placed in exactly the right section (although I probably could have jumped into L4). I felt confident in the classroom and comfortable making mistakes. Chinese 130 is the next level up from high-school Chinese, but it's not too much of a stretch. I would recommend it without reservations. I have never felt better about studying Chinese.",
    "I definitely recommend this course. The coursework is not too intense and you get a ton out of it. My listening and speaking in particular improved a lot.",
    "Chinese 130 is a very challenging, but very rewarding course. You have to put a lot of time and work into it, but it is worth it in the end.",
    "Yeah, definitely take it!",
    "Definitely take this if you're interested in learning chinese at a fast pace. However, if you're taking a very busy\/difficult class schedule you might want to wait for another semester to take this class so you can actually dedicate time to learning and not just try to get by just by preparing for the day to day assessments.",
    "CHNS L3 is well-taught, and the professors are very nice and encouraging as you practice Chinese. There is a good deal of work involved in the class, but not as much as in L1-L2, so if you went through that, you can handle this.I found the class grammar and vocabulary harder to absorb than in L1-L2 because if there is one thing I would change, it would be to reduce the amount of words. Not only do we have lessons from our main textbook (D&H), but there another online textbook we use, so there are like 80-100 words to know in about 1-1.5 weeks. Then repeat. So while I can recognize all the characters, I feel like I can't use very many of them in speaking.To do well in this class, you HAVE to stay ON TOP OF THINGS. That is the most important KEY to the class - otherwise, you will miss an assignment, and it could be costly. But if you keep good habits, you will do fine. Try to get a Chinese friend to help you - that will be a HUGE benefit.",
    "Rote memorization. I would not recommend this course to someone who is looking for a course that will inspire interest, wonder, or excitement about Chinese.",
    "Can't speak for this class as compared to L1 or L2, but as a student who had taken a fair amount of Chinese in high school I found the course well designed. If you set aside a half hour to an hour every day to not only do the homework for the next day but practice a little bit of character writing and speaking you should do just fine.",
    "A work-intensive course that is definitely worth the effort if you are really interesting in mastering the language.",
    "This is the type of class that you have to put in the time for to get good. It's less hand-holdy than L1, and you have to write alot more characters. The structure isn't quite as fun as L1, but the teachers and the classes still bond, so everyone has a good time.",
    "Chinese 130 is definitely an intense course with heavy work load, but it is so worth it. If you wish to really learn Chinese, you really should take the course. You will get as much as you put effort."
