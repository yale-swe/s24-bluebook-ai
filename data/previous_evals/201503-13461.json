   "comments": [
    "At times, I thought the amount of material was too great to facilitate meaningful learning. As a result, class sessions sometimes felt rushed.",
    "Shimi is an exceptional teacher, and he does a great job making a course which sets out to accomplish a very ambitious and probably unreasonable goal (giving a meaningful review of the physical sciences in one semester) as useful as possible. Coursework is roughly comparable in amount and difficulty to other similar FES classes... something which is problematic given the ambition of this class. A heavier, more intense workload would be justified.",
    "Question 10: Shimi is an incredible teacher. He actually cares that you understand his material, and he presents it in a very accessible way.",
    "Covered a good level of detail of each of earth's systems to provide environmental managers with good working knowledge.",
    "This class is very demanding, but worth it in the end. Shimi is a fantastic professor and really wants his students to learn the material. He is very patient with those who don't have a scientific background. I highly recommend this course.",
    "The content of the course is very helpful. The TA's and the professor are excellent but the course goes really quickly, so it is important to stay on track and go to office hours if you don't understand something. The things I learned in the course were very helpful in other courses. I recommend this course to have a basic understanding of physical sciences.",
    "Question 4: Because we were introduced to completely new material each week, it was difficult to anchor new concepts, especially when most of the material we learned was given equal weight. I would have preferred diving deeper into some of the material at a slower pace, even if this also meant exposure to less material overall.",
    "Shimi is a professor primarily, not a researcher who also has to teach. This is evident in his lecture style, his dedication to making sure everyone understands material, his patience, and his genuine sense of care for student comfort. Shimi is the only professor I had this semester who mentioned created a safe space in the classroom. For me, this was a really big deal and something that I hugely appreciated. Shimi also makes himself very available to students, through in-class problem set time and also out-of-class tutoring hours. This class was challenging, but it was also really enjoyable. Physical Sciences gave me a solid background in a variety of topics, and I used what I learned in this class in several other classes this semester. The material is directly applicable to a variety of classes and careers. I'm very glad that I signed up for this intro class--I'd recommend it to all new students.",
    "Shimi is a clear, thoughtful, and kind professor. I think that the class structure could benefit from some restructuring. I'll elaborate in the following sections.",
    "The textbook (Tarbuck et al) was not very helpful, but the online lectures were very helpful.",
    "The course gave us a strong foundation to excel in a field of environment. The material is slightly heavier on chemistry. the video given by the Professor was really helpful to understand class materials.",
    "Way too much content is covered at a surface level. I know it's supposed to be a intro. course, but it would be much more beneficial to cover fewer topics and dive deeper into the content.",
    "He's uses up-to-date to technology and techniques to relate what has been taught in the class. He's very responsive and has vast knowledge of the subject.",
    "This was a very helpful survey course of scientific disciplines - however breadth obviously requires the sacrifice of depth. While many topics did build on each other, it would have been helpful to my learning if there were different types of assignments than simply problem sets - like perhaps a paper or a presentation that requires independent research and application. All of the content was incredibly helpful to learn, but we sped through it so quickly that I worry I will not retain much of it.",
    "I didn't love the 'flipped classroom' nature of the course."

   "comments": [
    "I liked the flipped format. Video lectures are useful ways to clarify unclear material before an exam. Working through the problem sets in class was a good way to get through a lot of problems without getting stuck on individual problems for too long that it becomes counter-productive.",
    "Shimi is a great professor. I appreciated his responsiveness to questions and his ability to cogently explain complicated concepts. I feel that I received a broad overview of a number of important environmental processes, which is valuable.",
    "Understanding scientific processes like differences in soil development and climate change",
    "Really liked the flipped format.",
    "Shimi's dedicated teaching. It was clear that he had a personal desire to see us master as much content as possible.",
    "The relationship between lectures, quizzes, and problem sets was usually clear. When it came time for the midterm and for the final, there are no secrets or surprises about what he was testing you on. The professor was very straightforward with the material.",
    "It was helpful to listen to the lectures on my own so that I could stop and repeat the lecture. Clicker questions were somewhat stressful but allowed for good discussion and problem solving amongst students and made the course interactive.",
    "The well-thought out syllabus and assignments. It felt like we were learning the most useful and important aspects of physical sciences.",
    "The best thing if the course is that everything you learn is very relevant to whatever your focus is in FES. The workload is very intense but because it is very well organized it seemed to be less work. There are many office hours in case you don't understand something.",
    "Shimi is very responsive and a great lecturer. I appreciated his attentiveness to all students in the course, making sure that everyone was on track. The TFs were very helpful too.",
    "Lots of interesting and important information that is important for environmental managers to understand.",
    "Though Physical Sciences is time-intensive, I appreciated the chance to practice using the material both in quizzes and problem sets after each lecture. This felt rough at times, but it really helped me stay up to date with material.",
    "I found the clicker questions in class to be helpful. It was a good way to test my knowledge of the material for that day's class, and to clarify in situations where I was uncertain. I also liked that the course reintroduced me to quantitative thinking.",
    "I liked the way the course was taught using online lectures, quizzes and problem sets.",
    "The design of the class is commendable because it allows the student to be fully engaged in the course. The quizzes provides us an opportunity to work in groups and learn from friends. The clicker quizzes in the classes retains our focus and keeps the students awake.",
    "The professor presented the material in a clear way and really wanted us to understand it.",
    "Shimi is one of the most caring and responsive professors I have had so far. This is a good overview of physical sciences (soil, water, atmosphere) and the concepts of the course prove very useful in understanding how the physical world works. The online lectures were great because you can pause, speed up, or slow down as necessary.",
    "Online presentation from the professor was the bet part. We can replay it if we did not clear about it.",
    "The TAs and Shimi were great at making themselves available and were super helpful and patient.",
    "Textbook, at-home lectures were great and worked well for me",
    "The course was excellently structured in Canvas and this made it simple to navigate the bulky course load. Shimi incorporated interesting audiovisual data components from NASA, NOAA and other top sources and this made the learning very interesting. He also provided an opportunity for students who attended COP 21 to make presentations in class. As a COP 21 fellow, I appreciated the opportunity to share exciting experiences from Paris with the entire class.",
    "Been able to use satellite technology to see how what has been taught is currently been used in modern day",
    "Shimi is a great instructor who patiently explains concepts. It's helpful to have the quizzes as an accountability mechanism to ensure we prioritize the homework amidst our other school demands.",
    "Shimi is an excellent teacher who clearly and patiently explains concepts to his students when they don't understand something. He offered 4 sets of office hours a week which was very generous and helpful for all the problem sets we had to do before each class meeting.",
    "The Professor took a very keen interest in the progress of students and made every effort to ensure students were comfortable with and understanding the material presented. The flipped classroom style was ideal for the content of the course.",
    "Professor is clear and very smart. Content is really relevant and enlightening."

   "question_text": "What aspects of this course need the most improvement?",
   "comments": [
    "It covers to many materials for one course. We learned the basic but not the essence behind things. A lot of problems are not intellectually challenging, you just need to find the right place to look for the information, which becomes a guessing game. The problem sets use information on different websites a lot and feels like a high school project. We are not thinking, just trying to identify the info and paste the answer.",
    "While problem sets were helpful, I did feel that there was an inundation of material. Having only one problem set per week might help to decrease the workload for this course. I'm not sure that any material could be omitted but I do think there was a lot covered in the class and I'm sure I won't be able to remember most of it. It might be better to cover less and ensure more comprehension.",
    "Would be nice to include more info on current, ongoing environmental challenges in each module i.e. countries that are struggling with sea level rise. There are definitely pieces of this in the lectures, and I understand time is a constraint, but I thought these were some of the pieces that stuck with me best.",
    "This course would be much more productive as a higher level, more intense class, or a two-semester offering.",
    "I started to get a little frustrated toward the very end of the course with in-class clicker questions. I was having a hard time relating them to the lecture material presented and they were sometimes presented in a confusing way. I personally was not a fan of the flipped format. I would have rather listened to lectures in class.",
    "Problem sets should ideally be able to completed in class. I'm not sure I got a lot out of them most of the time perhaps because they were primarily quantitative, but that did allow me to practice equations, conversions, etc.",
    "Sometimes, the flipped classroom approach felt isolating and difficult to keep with the pace. This class is a lot of work and there is a lot of material to learn. Preparation materials for finals could improve because there is so much to learn, it's difficult to know where to focus. Also, I felt like the final did not reflect all that I had learned and studied.",
    "I think it would have been good to have more time to discuss the topics in class. Connect the things we learn with current environmental problems and have more of a dialogue with the professor and other classmates.",
    "I think the style of the class is too repetitive. I believe that some of the content would have stuck more had I learned it in the field, reinforced with hands-on exercises.",
    "I feel like this class has so much information that it could be split into several different classes and maybe I would have absorbed more of the information; just so much to take in in one semester. Also, the material pre-midterm was much easier than the material after the midterm. It would be helpful to order the information to make the workloads more manageable.",
    "This is a hard question, because I think the class is structured very well. Though I'm sure students would protest, I might suggest four exams instead of two so that each exam only includes a quarter of the material. Or, four in-class exams covering a quarter of the material each, then one take home final covering everything from the semester.",
    "I was very frustrated by the speed of the course, which was far too quick for me to really digest the information. We spent only one day on climate change, one day on energy, one on oceans, etc. There could easily be a course for each of these! While I understand that this was an overview intro course, the lectures (and the exams) were very detail-oriented and I found myself working to memorize small bits of information that are definitely not logged in my long-term memory. If I could redesign the course, I would do two things: 1) I would dedicate the first half of the course to a scientific overview of the Earth system. For the second half, I would allow students to \"choose their own adventure\" - that is, they could elect one of a few possible subject areas to learn more about. Presumably, that would be the subject area most relevant to them. That way, climate people could walk away with a clear understanding of climate, water people of water, ag of soils, etc. I understand that these systems are all closely intertwined, but that would be made clear in the first part of the semester. The second half would allow students to glean a more thorough understanding of the science most relevant to their area of study. I think the flipped nature of the course definitely lends itself to this kind of structuring. 2) I would change the format of the final. I was very dissatisfied with the exam; I studied and felt like I understood the course material fairly well, but I am quite sure that this was not as well-reflected through the final as I'd have liked. Seeing as this is a science *for management* class, it might have been helpful to write a paper discussing the scientific background necessary to understand a certain historical\/current management issue.",
    "modules towards the end of the semester were had more content to cover per lecture than the start most of other units. If the work load would be redistributed equally it would be more effective for the student's learning",
    "Although the quizzes demands us to read the materials and watch the video lecture and also reviews our understanding, it could have been better if we had questions which allows us to get the overall picture of the topic. A quick review of the topic at the beginning of the class would be helpful.",
    "I think that more of a field trip or lab component would have helped to solidify the concepts. I also have mixed feelings about the flipped format. I really liked being able to replay and slow down lectures, but I feel that using every class to do problem sets could have been changed up a bit.",
    "This course covers a lot of material. It is a flipped course (online lecture viewed before coming to class), and class discussions were mostly led by walking through clicker questions that cover the main concepts. The clicker questions are a good way to make sure people are following along, but I feel like it could be helpful to start each class with a summary of the main points and asking what questions people have from the lectures before diving in to the clicker questions. I also felt like the course at times was testing very specifically such that I would memorize facts rather than focusing on the underlying concepts. For students like myself who are more interested in the management side and will not go much further on the science side, I would have preferred that we spend more time relating back to the management problems or issues caused by the science\/reactions\/etc. and testing us on our knowledge of those concepts.",
    "Everything was find. Sometime I found the problem on the video's sound quality.",
    "A class trip had been scheduled but this did not materialise. The class should consider including more thematic class trips.",
    "None",
    "I wish there had been more\/different opportunities to apply what we learned in class through perhaps a group project or a paper. The quick pace of the class and extreme breadth of material made it difficult to really fully grasp the topics before we moved on to the next. For someone not going into the scientific field, I also wish there had been slightly less emphasis on equations that we will likely never ever have a reason to use, and instead redirect that time on emphasizing concepts and other material that might be more helpful (e.g. rather than having to calculate the vapor pressure gradient, instead spending more time on minerals and climate).",
    "I think in the energy unit it would have been helpful to do more on renewable energy. Many students at FES are interested in it but more should be taught on both the up and downsides of renewable energy, for example its intermittency nature or other environmental impacts (i.e. birdkills for concentrated solar power). While it is also important to teach conventional fossil fuels, I think to gloss over renewables was unfortunate given its importance in the world today. It is important for all students to understand the complexities of it from a foundations course like physical sciences since they may not get exposed to it elsewhere in their coursework.",

I am much more comfortable working with scientific data, numbers, units and concepts than before the course. Course may not be necessary for people from a more scientific background, however, the material is wide ranging so it will cover concepts people aren't as comfortable with and it provides a good wide ranging scientific foundation for environmental managers regardless of what they go into. Focus is definietly on water soil and air, with energy and climate only getting brief but useful attention.",

It provides a strong background on a variety of subjects that I'm sure will be very helpful going forward.",

    "Mostly - I wish I had a better grasp on fewer topics, rather than a tenuous grasp on many.",
    "Yes.",
    "I felt that the course did not demand the degree of knowledge acquisition or skill mastery that I had expected it would. This strikes me as more of a structural failing than an issue with the instructor, who held us to the highest possible standards given the circumstances.",
    "Yes. Shimi was clear from the beginning what the objectives of the course would be, and he followed the syllabus.",
    "Yes, and far exceeded them. It was much more than a refresher.",
    "Yes! It exceeded them.",
    "I feel that I could have learned more about certain topics but the pace was too fast at times.",
    "Yes, though I'm not sure whether course material was presented in such a way that it will stick. Perhaps a paper, where concepts are applied, would have helped accomplish this more than studying for an exam.",
    "Yes, definitely. This class helped me in another class where less emphasis was placed on direct teaching. I'm sure the knowledge gained from this class will be very valuable in my future classes as well as my career.",
    "The knowledge I gained in this course met my experience and is crucial for other units I will enroll in",
    "Yes, the course fulfilled my expectations.",
    "Yes, although I think that having more of a lab\/field trip component would have made me feel even more comfortable with the quantitative component. Perhaps in the future instead of aiming to do one field trip (which we didn't get to do this year), there could be an option of 3 different field trips that each student would choose from (ie water, soil, or atmosphere), so that everyone could get some hands on experience in their field of interest.",
    "Overall, yes -- this was a good refresher course. It went more in detail on some concepts than I was looking for (soils, for instance), and because of the comprehensive amount of material covered in the course, I am not sure how much of the specifics I will retain a year or two out.",
    "Yes it meets my expectations.",
    "Yes",
    "Yes- the course met and surpassed my expectations.",
    "Yes",
    "Yes, although I wish there had been less emphasis on applying certain equations and more on scientific concepts.",
    "Yes",
    "Yes they did.",
    "yes, absolutely"

   "comments": [
    "Advantage is that you can get a nudge to keep moving through problem sets through group work which can prevent you from getting too hung up on an individual problem. Disadvantage is that sometimes going back to review it is difficult to remember how to do certain problems that the group worked through. Overall, benefits of the group far exceed the disadvantages.",
    "Obvious- it is useful to be able bounce ideas off of classmates. The flipped structure of the course facilitated this nicely.",
    "We struggled through and figured out the problem sets together.",
    "While I didn't participate in a formal workgroup, cross checking my understanding of problem set questions with classmates was helpful.",
    "Informally, yes I did participate in a work group. I worked with a fairly tight group to complete all problem sets, and this was really helpful. I learned a lot from my peers; we were all very dedicated to the class, and also to helping one another when someone was confused. We always took time to explain concepts and talk through our work, even if one person was much faster than the rest of the group. This was great, and helped everyone learn.",
    "N\/A",
    "Group work helped me understand the course material better and get higher scores in the problem set and clicker questions",
    "I participated in group works to solve the problem sets that we were given after every classes. it was a good opportunity to share ideas and discuss issues.I found that we could solve the problems sets working in a group faster and learn a lot as well from the discussions.",
    "Collaborative group discussions were useful in navigating some complex problem sets."

   "comments": [
    "Can kind of be a \"get out of it what you put in\" type course. You can probably get by with less effort but the resources are there to learn a lot from the course if you put the time in.",
    "Carve out a lot of time for this course in your schedule and create flashcards (or other study materials) as you go along in the semester so as not to be overwhelmed when studying for midterms and finals.",
    "I'd take it!",
    "To get the most out of this course, plan to engage with Shimi and the TAs frequently, and be prepared to dig into outside materials if you require an in-depth understanding of the content that it briefly touches on.",
    "I think all students in environmental management should have a foundation in physical science. Having a basic understanding of how the world works is essential to management and policy decisions.",
    "Don't stress about all the little assignments. Try to just learn as much as you can. Go to office hours!",
    "Expect to do a lot of work for this course, but it's worth it!",
    "Don't fall behind and go to office hours",
    "Dear future students, be sure to thoroughly understand the concepts presented each week. It's very difficult to catch up and to try to remember it all when exams roll around.",
    "Take it, please. You come to Yale thinking that each of your professors will love teaching, but that sadly doesn't seem to be the case always. Shimi does love teaching, and he makes otherwise difficult material very accessible. This class provides a great foundation for a wide range of specializations, and it will undoubtedly help you in other classes with less patient professors. I think this class should be a firm requirement.",
    "students should make sure they prepare before hand for each module of the course (before the class). This will help you understand the course material better.",
    "I would advice them to get the over all picture of the topics as they go on reading and attempting the quiz questions and solving the problem sets.",
    "Shimi is a great professor and is available to answer questions. He does a good job of fitting in a bit of everything that one would need to know if this was their last science course. It also serves as a good foundation if you want to go on to take other advanced science courses. I found the course challenging, maybe partly because there wasn't a lab\/field trip component to help solidify concepts. The fact that you learn a bit of everything can get confusing when you have to apply equations.",
    "Try to make sure you're really learning as you go -- this course covers a huge amount of material and if you fall behind, it's almost impossible to try to learn it all at the end.",
    "This is an excellent course that will provide a strong foundation of the most important part of environmental science: geology, soil science, hydrology, environmental chemistry, atmospheric science, and climate science. you also need to prepare for the quizzes. The quiz have to take before every session.",
    "I highly recommend this course for everyone. Prospective students will find it useful to always finish the assignment, preferably on the day they are given as the course load is heavy and the pace can be fast.",
    "Fast paced and keeps you on your toes",
    "I highly recommend this course but you must allocate at least 1.5 hours of time before every class in order to watch the lectures and do the problem sets. I highly encourage going to office hours to get your homework done since the TAs and Shimi do a good job of walking through the steps if you are struggling.",
    "It is definitely worthwhile to take this course, especially if a scientific understanding of these issues can contribute to your work and area of interest. The Professor is great and you can definitely learn a lot!",
