    "NO.Do not take this course. It is too long (no friday class, but there should be), and Professor Harris is not engaging enough for that sort of length. The stat mech portion doesn't have a textbook, which makes it very confusing, and class notes are insufficient.(The T.A. this semester was terrible, but that probably won't be a problem in the future.)Professor Harris is not flexible about problem set deadlines, so be careful if you are someone who has trouble getting things in on time. He also assigned us a pset that was twice the length of a normal one over the spring break!The midterm exam was too long, but the final (probably in reaction) was very reasonable in length. The content of both exams was reasonable.",
    "Three-week crash course on stat mech, + E&M treated pretty seriously. You probably know if you're gonna take this. The class was definitely more work-intensive than 401, and was not just a rehash of 201 E&M. If you're thinking about taking 430 instead, they don't really cover the material at a more in-depth level (we both use the Griffiths textbook; they do dialectrics (which we don't), but we do radiation (which they don't)). Plus, you'll have to take a separate stat mech class, which is probably pretty rough.",
    "Professor Harris teaching this class makes it pretty great. While it's rough to have this material in 75-minute lectures, you'll be fine as long as you ask questions to keep yourself engaged. This is required for the regular physics major, but I can't compare it to the concurrent intensive physics lecture. If you're not a major, know you'll be competing with majors. The exams are very much based on the homework problems.",
    "This is a good class if you are frightened by E&M or the crazies in 430, especially if you don't need 430.",
    "This class is pure AWESOME served with a mild side of AWESOME. If you want to have your mind blown at least once every class period with the amazingnessof Physics (which clearly you do since you're probably in the major) then you should\/need to take this class anyway. Probably not as in-depth as 420\/430, but it's not like you don't learn anything here, and the workload is manageable (even though problem sets take like, 10 hours to do, especially when you get to E&M).",
    "I would recommend the class to a fellow student because it's very useful and well-taught. The class covers two important subjects (stat-mech and E&M) fairly well, though stat-mech definitely seemed rushed and glossed over. E&M was well covered, but the last few weeks of material (besides relativity) felt rushed and confusing."
