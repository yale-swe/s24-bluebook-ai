    "Thinking and Writing About the Law is a great course for anyone who wants to improve their ability to think about constructing arguments and writing really good prose. It's not just for those who want to be lawyers, so don't be frightened away by the title. Ehrgood puts more time into the course than just about any other professor at Yale. He may not be everyone's style, but if he is you gain a ton from working with him.",
    "A course that will teach you to write clearly & succinctly. This class will help you understand the source of ambiguity in writing and how to move past it.",
    "I absolutely recommend this class to anyone, even if you aren't interested in becoming a lawyer. This class teacher you to write clearly and concisely.",
    "This class is a lot of fun, and Professor Ehrgood is an excellent teacher. Be prepared for a substantial amount of work at the beginning of the class and lively class discussion. The course is less about specific rules about the law and more about how to write well. I never felt bored in class.",
    "This course is truly excellent, like few other are. I remember sitting in class each day, literally smiling, just excited to be surrounded by friends, to play around with language and new ideas. I feel so lucky to have had the chance to take it. The reason? Andrew Ehrgood. I've never met someone who treats language so tenderly, reveres it even. We knew it from the first meeting-- the way he would spin out a sentence, pause for two seconds, then trim the frayed edges and retie the loose strings. It was obsessive and awesome. In this class, he shared that love with us and trained us in the precision and care that it demands. Ehrgood trained us to take this care not just with language, but also in arguments and legal reasoning. He expertly decided to skip substantive law and focus on the language and discourse of the law-- what truly distinguishes law from other writing and a way to more richly understand it. As we slowly learned this 'legal' way of thinking, studying cases (fictional and not became so much more rewarding. Sharing this way of thinking with this class while vigorously discussing our main case, the Speluncean Explorers, made it even more exciting-- as did pushing it to extreme depths in our midterm letters (excuse the pun). This course demanded a lot from us, particularly during the first semester. I remember my first night, I stayed up until 2 am working on my propositions and considered dropping the course. The first semester was so intense that the second semester felt almost anticlimactic-- maybe balancing the two out a bit more would help. But, regardless, no matter how hard I struggled to just get a single word right or how many hours I obsessed over the details of an argument, I never regretted it. I, too, became obsessed. And I knew-- our weekly meeting left little doubt-- that Ehrgood had worked just as hard to make this class so great. For that, I thank him.",
    "Take this class, whether or not you are interested in the law! Your writing will improve tremendously over the course of the semester. The course is front-loaded, so the work will be a bit intense at the beginning, but wonderfully light come finals crunch time. Professor Ehrgood is the bomb--he's so engaging and dedicated to the class, and really makes the material interesting and accessible. A+++++++++++++"
