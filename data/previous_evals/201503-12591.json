    "An intensive introduction to Russian. At the end of the semester you really feel like this is the way to learn the language at Yale. The instruction is great and it makes what is meant to be a challenging language very approachable. The workload is massively overestimated. Nightly homework takes maximum one hours, and the course is obviously cumulative so you don't need to study much for the weekly tests. I found it helpful to dedicate a few extra hours per week to familiarize myself with the alphabet and cursive, because mastering that early on really pays dividends down the line.",
    "Russian 125 is intense. After only a semester, being able to listen to long video-based dialogues was rewarding. Learning the language in such a small class with Prof. Muravnik and Dasha was great, and having people who are really committed to the class makes it even better! The discussions about the Russian language from someone as knowledgeable and charming as Prof. Muravnik make it more than just language-learning. That being said, however, Russian itself is an extremely difficult language, and I would only take it if you're committed to seeing it through to the end.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this level of Russian to anyone who is seriously interested in learning it for literally any reason at all. I thought it was an amazingly effective way to learn a language, and I would totally do it again for another one if that comes up. That being said, I would caution someone who is taking a full load. It's really important not only to stay on top of work, but also to review basically whenever possible and take the time to learn the vocab. It's a very time-consuming class, and probably wouldn't pair well with more than one other intensely time-consuming class.",
    "The course is very good but also challenging and time-consuming. It is important to have a realistic assessment of one's language-learning capacity prior to beginning the course.",
    "I would most definitely recommend this course to other students, both graduate and undergraduate. It's challenging but definitely worth taking."
