   "comments": [
    "Yes, for sure.",
    "Absolutely would recommend it if you're interesting in the material.... it is a really interesting overview on a rarely broached subject! It's deals with blacks and jews' relationship from all different perspectives and time periods",
    "Yes- take it if you have any interest in African-American or Jewish political history in the United States.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student regardless if they care about black or jewish relations because it's a great seminar to take.",
    "A very interesting class on Black-Jewish relations. You will be able to explore a topic of significant interest to you on your final paper, and the midterm\/midterm paper aren't terribly difficult.",
    "This is a great class if you'd like to explore coalition building (and breaking) between different communities, specifically Jews and Blacks. I learned so much from this class and, by the time it was over, felt like I knew things I did not know before starting the course (a good feeling at Yale where classes can be so theoretical that you walk away feeling just as unknowledgeable as when you entered). The assignments are closely related to the coursework and there is a lot of room for creativity and personal experience sharing. I really enjoyed this class.",
    "Black and Jewish Community Politics was an insightful look into the relationship between Jewish and black communities in politics, culture, and urban society. I would definitely recommend this class to another student! It's one of those classes you can only take at a place like Yale, and Professor Brown-Dean is the country's expert on this topic. Though of course it varies from year to year, the class is also a fascinating place for cultural dialogue between Jewish and black students and people bring their own personal stories into the class.",
    "The intersection of the history of Blacks and Jews.",
    "TAKE IT!",
    "Great course- each class had a specific enough focus that we really learned about the event and were able to have good discussions, but the course itself was broad enough to encompass a range of contemporary issues. Professor Brown-Dean lectured for the first part, then students led discussions for the second part. This format worked because her lectures were very clear and interesting, and students were invested in the course, generally did the reading, and were able to contribute a lot. Biggest downside of the class is that Professor Brown-Dean is nearly impossible to get in touch with outside of class and her one hour of office hours a week. She doesn't return e-mails.",
    "I would definitely recommend Black and Jewish community politics to another student. The format of the course is great and seminars allow for both a short informative lecture\/overview and then great, educated class discussion. You might think that it would be hard to compare these two groups considering they hold relatively different positions in American political life today but the continued relationship between them is very interesting. Most of the readings are really great, a few of the books get a little repetitive but you can skim. The midterm and two papers is a bit of workload but definitely manageable and worth it.",
    "I would recommend this if interested in the topic, of course. I'm not a poli sci student so I didn't like some of the statistic-y articles but I was definitely interested in all the material. Class discussions were good but sometimes we didn't really get anywhere and they were all about feelings..it was really good later on in the class when people began to open up and feel more comfortable.",
    "This is a really interesting course that focuses on the intersection of two groupswhose interactions, positive and negative, don't usually get a ton of attention. Professor Brown Dean is super knowledgeable and respectful of both groups, which made her a great discussion leader. One weakness of the course is that it jumps around a bit topic wise, with no real rhyme or reason. Other than that, it comes highly recommended.",
    "Overall a very very interesting topic, and I'm glad I took this course. The readings were for the most part incredibly interesting and discussion was good. If you're looking for a very interesting topic with smart and engaging people, take this class. However, it's not a typical seminar, in that Professor Brown-Dean spends about half of each class giving a mini-lecture on the subject. Sometimes useful, often sort of boring and repetitive if you had done the readings or had any background from classes like African American History or basic poli-sci.But overall fun and enjoyable, recommend for a not super work-intensive seminar."
