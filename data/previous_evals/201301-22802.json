   "comments": [
    "You will read and discuss a variety of news articles about contemporary issues in Chinese society. Assignments include essays, oral presentations, and tests. There is a pretty good emphasis on learning chengyu and sentence patterns, but at times the class did not feel rigorous enough for such a high-level course.",
    "Yes, I would recommend it. It is a fantastic course. You won't learn massive amounts of new vocabulary, but there's lots of chengyu, and my reading got significantly faster and better.",
    "Yes. Great upper level Chinese class. A lot of work, but manageable, and well worth it.",
    "This is a wonderful upper level Chinese course. It is well paced, the information is interesting, and students are engaged. Your Chinese may not see \"leaps-and-bounds\" improvement, but you will definitely be able to maintain your Chinese level and learn how to better use more complicated vocabulary and grammar structures. Professor Zhang is phenomenal, one of the best professors I have had at Yale. His instruction is clear and he truly cares about each students learning.",
    "It's quite a bit of work, but very manageable. I would definitely take this class if you want to learn about current issues in China in a very up to date manner",
    "Pretty good class, very laid-back this year. Don't know if that will change with the new teacher. You could pretty much coast through the class and do fine without making any meaningful improvement in your Chinese -- I think he got tired of that by the end of the year, so he'll probably be more proactive about forcing you to really use your Chinese -- hopefully, that will mean more feedback, which would really be good.",
    "CHNS 167 is a discussion-based survey course of various current topics in Chinese society, often with a media focus. The workload is steep, but other than that the course is informative, not too stressful, and often fun. I would recommend it to students with the proper Chinese background, but with a warning that if you haven't spent much time in China recently you may struggle. Though I understand it will be taught by a great professor next year.",
    "It's a really chill class and the material was really interesting although I wish there was more practice for speaking. Sometimes the pace of class can be really slow and you zone out. I liked that we had a final project to do, that was a lot of fun (a video news report). I was expecting it to be harder, actually, so it was really nice that it was a class I didn't really have to study for. Zhang Laoshi is the bomb (late homework? no probs) but someone new is gonna be teaching it next semester, so that may change.",
    "CHNS 167 is an excellent class for students who are interested in contemporary issues in Chinese society, and for those who are willing to take on a fast-paced course. The homework we are assigned isn't light, even though class only meets twice a week. That said, the homework assignments\/tests\/oral exams do keep you on your toes and ensures that you're still keeping up with your language skills (presuming that most people who take this class are students who have attended an intensive language course during their college career.)",
    "A relaxed, high-level Chinese language class where students read and discuss contemporary issues in Chinese media. Expect lots of student involvement, participation, and group projects.",
    "Zhang laoshi won't be teaching this anymore, so I think the class will change. That being said, take it if you're at all interested in China. Readings had both much more difficult vocab and a much more nuanced perspective than things I read in other classes (at Yale and elsewhere). Not that much work, but there is some really difficult vocab here."
