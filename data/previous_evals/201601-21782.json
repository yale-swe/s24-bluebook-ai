    "A great continuation of French 150 dealing with real-world issues in modern day French culture and society, with interesting discussion topics and some great films! Madame Pinzka is wonderful and understanding, and you will build a great vocabulary and solidify your grammar.",
    "French 160, like most L5 French classes, is work-intensive -- there are many readings, short essays, and oral presentations\/exams. However, if you put in the work, it is worth it, a great opportunity to learn about French culture and develop written and oral skills. I would highly recommend Professor Pinzka, as well!",
    "Having taken French at Yale every semester since 130, I thought it would be a good next step after 150 to take this course. I would say that 160, on the whole, has the most interesting course material of all the French courses I've taken; as opposed to previous French courses, which tend to be pretty lit-heavy, 160 is centered around contemporary issues in French politics and society (with significant discussion of other Francophone countries around the world as well). Every week or so, we would discuss a different topic related to France or the Francophone world, such as religion, immigration, labor, the EU, etc. Assignments consisted of vocabulary exercises, posts on message boards, essays of around 300 words or so, readings (articles mainly), and watching contemporary French films (which I thought were great and added richly to the course). There are also three in-class, essay-based exams, a presentation on a topic of your choice (which took place throughout the semester), and two oral exams as well. All are fairly graded and relatively manageable. While a firm command of grammar is key for success in the course, it is not actually tested upon or discussed, so do keep that in mind before taking the course. Mme Pinzka, as with much of Yale's French department, is a great instructor, and always kept classroom discussions lively and interesting, and very approachable and understanding as well. In short, if you enjoy French, want to keep up your speaking and writing fluency, and prefer a course that examines contemporary political and social issues as opposed to being literature and grammar heavy, I would recommend this course, especially with Mme Pinzka.",
    "This course was good for getting a sense of current political issues concerning France and the popular culture surrounding that. It was a lot of reading and nightly assignments for the amount of information that was touched on in class. I learned a lot of vocabulary, but my overall proficiency did not improve. Professor Pinzka is very enthusiastic and does a great job. It would have been nice to have a little more small-group conversation, though. If you are already very confident in your spoken french, take a literature course.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to other students, no other course could have left me feeling so well prepared to go study and France this summer for the first time.",
    "A basic French culture class. You'll learn a lot but it's actually so much tedious work. The key is to just learn what you should and shouldn't do"
