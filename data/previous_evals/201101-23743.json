   "comments": [
    "Yes! Not too much work, but you learn valuable terms and have the course book for reference later on.",
    "Take this class! Not only is it fun and super easy, but you'll really learn a lot of useful vocabulary and information pertinent to the medical professions. Class was really laid back and the daily homework assignments took half an hour, tops. Mercedes is an incredible professor and very nice as well. If you need an L5 class, this is without a doubt the one to take, and if you just want an amazing, low-work class, take it too!",
    "This is a wonderful course- I truly recommend it!",
    "Yes I would recommend the class to anyone interested in Medicine.",
    "Yes! It was a fantastic course, particularly if you are interested in the medical field.",
    "This is a good L5 Spanish class for pre-meds. We cover most of the body systems and learn about various diseases using Spanish vocabulary. There are daily assignments and a project, but overall the work is very manageable. I highly recommend this class.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student, especially if they're interested in pursuing a career in medicine. The work is not too intense, however, we still learn a lot.",
    "If you are looking for a good L5 class and like physiology, this is the class for you.",
    "Medical Spanish is great to take if you either just want to practice your spanish or are interested in actually learning medical terms in spanish. It definitely works for both because you get to practice, and you learn a lot. It's not a ton of work, I really liked the class.",
    "SPAN 225 is a relaxed and fun way to learn about human systems and diseases in Spanish. Each class goes over a different health-related topic. The class can seem disorganized at times and the notes become difficult to copy down. However, the overall class is very structured. Each day in class, you are assigned a short essay to finish by the next class and the class consists of an hour lecture followed by a 15-minute video. If you really want to improve your speaking and writing skills, this is probably not the class you should take. It is easy to not speak in the class as Professor Carrerasdoesn't pressure anyone to speak and writing a short essay a day can become formulaic. However, overall great class. I learned a lot and it was fun!",
    "This is an excellent class to learn about medical physiology and diseases. It is basically a broad introduction to medicine. The best part is that you are learning it all in Spanish, though - so it is as if you are learning two subjects at once. I would highly recommend it! The workload is also not bad at all - you write about a page for each class. This is a good fifth class or an easier credit if you are looking for it, and you will learn a lot of information that you can use in the future!"
