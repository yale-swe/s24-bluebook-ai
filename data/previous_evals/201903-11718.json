   "comments": [
    "In this course, I developed my close reading abilities like how to ask important in-text questions or how to consider the context in which a story is written in can affect its message. I also improved my essay writing by learning how to stay specific and with the text instead of making broad generalizations.",
    "I learned a lot about an area I've always been interested in but never had the chance to study about. We read stories, poems, biographies, and literatures to better understand the subject and that was truly challenging but rewarding.",
    "This course was effective in helping us think about readings critically and within the context of other cultures.",
    "I gained insight on the different religions in India. I learned how to approach the topic of religion in a neutral way and read and analyze texts for richer perspectives. Through this course, I have started to appreciate Indian religion, its beauty, and artistic and historical qualities."

   "question_id": "YC403",

   "comments": [
    "This course allows a student to read a wide range of materials, which is beneficial in creating a relatively well-rounded familiarity of Indian religions and philosophy. However, this meant that we could not swell upon certain extremely interesting texts and were always never to \"finish\" reading other texts that could have been by themselves, the subject of an entire semester's worth of analyzing.",
    "Strengths: 1.We discuss about every little thing we read 2. Class participation is very inclusive 3. Professor was able to explain everything Weaknesses: 1. 99% reading based 2. Vague and confusing texts Improve? Incorporate other activities and assignments besides reading and writing a paper",
    "The stories read for class are certainly interesting, but class discussions could be improved. I believe if class participation was counted more heavily as a grade, and if it was made apparent it was counted as a grade, then students would be more engaged."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Yes, I would highly recommend this course to another student. First, the ideas and philosophies encountered in this class provide different meaningful perspectives on how we can view the world. For myself, I came with little background to Indian religions, and I finished this course with a broad understanding of the three major religions to come out of India. The two essays are completely manageable and we also had short weekly reading responses that were critical in allowing me to formulate, digest, and engage with the information from the class.",
    "This course is wonderful! If you're up to do the work and keep an open mind, you'll love the class because it really does expand your knowledge about India and its religions.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this class to other students because the topic of this course is just so cool. Indian religion is just so rich. There are so many texts, and people really must see the pictures Professor Granoff presented in class because they are truly amazing. I wish I can visit some of those places one day!",
    "I would highly recommend this course. Professor Granoff was extremely interesting to engage with and the discussions she led not only taught me a great deal about classical Indian religions but also made the class think about concepts like free will and human life in completely new lights. The reading material was some of the most engaging I have ever read and I always looked forward to the seminars."
