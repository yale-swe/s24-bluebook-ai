    "take it!",
    "It seems like a pretty standard language class. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a language credit.",
    "I would recommend it if you are trying to fill a language requirement.",
    "It goes over all the concepts and tenses to set you up for L4.",
    "It's a great course. Take it.",
    "Spanish 130 seems relatively easy during the first half of the semester. However, do not let this fool you. The grammar gets convoluted towards the end. Try to complete the preparation, so you do not fall behind in class.",
    "Yes I would recommend taking the class and talking it with reymundi. She is easy to understand and is a sweetheart. She's super nice and easy to approach",
    "If you want to learn Spanish, L3 is definitely a great class. You learn a lot at a fairly quick pace. Lissette Reymundi was one of the best professors I've had! She really cares about her students and puts a lot of effort into ensuring their success. Her energy in the classroom made going to class fun and worthwhile every day. She was very approachable and never intimidating. If possible, I highly recommend taking L3 Spanish with her.",
    "Take it with Profesora Reymundi. Take it to learn Spanish. Take it for the culture and the stories and the relative ease of the course in general. TAKE IT!"
