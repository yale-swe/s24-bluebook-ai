   "comments": [
    "Understanding of different types of leadership, philosophical views on leadership, different points of view from people in different fields\/disciplines\/schools.",
    "I learned about leadership in theory from the readings, but honestly the most important things I have learned are by interacting with Professor McChrystal and my classmates in discussions. They bring such a wealth of life experiences and perspective that challenge me to think about what a true leader is, and how I can improve my own leadership capabilities.",
    "I have gained another framework to analyze leadership, I have broadened my perspective on leadership I have learnt on parts of my leadership skills I need to improve on",
    "Great class on leadership.",
    "In the fall semester, I learned to think about leadership in a broader context than I previously had. Studying the evolution of leadership across time and cultures, and its adaptation to new technologies, helped me understand the nature of the leadership challenges I am likely to face throughout my career. I also learned that the successful leadership style varies with the context. As a result, I gained a greater understanding of my own leadership experience that will help inform and guide my approach to future leadership challenges.",
    "Mostly, this course (so far) gave me the opportunity to really reflect on my past experiences, think about what is ahead, provide (or revisit) some foundational principles, and overall make me into a better version of myself. I look forward to the next semester, and I appreciate the course's nuanced approach to a difficult topic that means different things to different people.",
    "This class is INCREDIBLE. Not only are Stan and Chris amazing at teaching nuanced elements of leadership that cannot come from textbooks, but the class also brings together an astounding curated group of classmates just talking to them has been invaluable.",
    "theories of leadership, interesting applications of the theories, limitations and benefits to the theories. the seminar discussions are incredible and really allow you to engage deeply with the readings. best seminar i've taken at yale by far.",
    "Self-reflection on leadership strategies."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: quality of instruction, quality of readings, variety of students, quality of class discussion",
    "Strengths: fantastic class discussions, amazing trip to DC to start the trip which fostered a close classroom environment from day 1 Weaknesses: sometimes it feels like the readings (e.g. 'foundational' texts of leadership) aren't conducive to insightful class discussion, but the instructors always offer opportunities to provide feedback and adapt accordingly.",
    "The readings are great but they are extremely complicated. I struggle to understand them especially the Confucius one. Moreover, the readings can be interpreted in so many ways some targeting as to how to interpret them would be helpful",
    "Discussion based and everyone participates. The readings are spectacular and always a major part of the conversation.",
    "The substance and readings of the course, the in-class discussions, and the varied activities planned throughout the course are excellent. The long gaps between intense clusters of classes feel somewhat disruptive to the flow of the course, which could be improved by teaching it in a single semester.",
    "I'll reserve some comments for the final course feedback - as I want to see how the course builds over the year and don't want to be too hasty to judge until I've seen the whole picture. For an overall sustain though, I like the agency\/onus put on the students to prepare and be accountable. That doesn't necessarily exist in all classes here at Yale. This provides interesting class discussions with relevant guidance\/interjection from General McChrystal and Chris.",
    "the only weakness is that it could meet much more often and that there is a pretty intense workload. the strengths are everything else: it really is unlike any other course Ive taken at Yale in the best way!",
    "stan and chris are amazing at fostering discussion and asking excellent questions. the professor and TAs arrange opportunities to become friends with and really get to know the other students in the course. no weaknesses. fantastic course.",
    "Self-study on theories of leadership. Can improve in areas of the student to student engagement. The course discussions often evolve to direct student on instructor discussion instead of peer to peer discussion with instructor shaping."

   "comments": [
    "Absolutely. It is a unique experience, unlike any courses I've taken in undergrad or grad school. The subject of the course, the format of class discussion, and the variety of students in the class make this a truly memorable and meaningful experience.",
    "Yes absolutely! It is truly a privilege to learn from Professor McChrystal.",
    "Yes, this is the best course at Yale so far",
    "Yes. 100%.",
    "Without a doubt, one of the greatest courses that Yale University offers. The material is, of course, engaging; but, more than anything else, the class turns on the leadership, kindness, and insight of the instructors, General McChrystal and Chris Fussell.",
    "Absolutely. This course is a unique opportunity to explore the various models of leadership and to understand and adapt your own leadership style according to the situation and the organization's goals. In particular, learning about the development of leadership across time and the evolving demands on leaders today is critical training for anyone seeking to manage successful business, nonprofit, or government organizations.",
    "Yes. The key here is that no matter what you want to do, or where you are in life, if you have any aspirations to climb a corporate ladder, serve in a leadership position, or just be a valuable member of team, this course will help you improve.",
    "YES!!!!!",
    "absolutely. 100%.",
    "Yes, easily the best course I've taken in my 13 years of university",
    "Yes if interested in improving leadership qualities in yourself"
