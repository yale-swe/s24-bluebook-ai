    "yes, useful when preparing for comprehensive exams",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course. This course is imperative for any individual interested in taking the IR comprehensive exam or coursing out of IR. Not only does it provide an overview of several relevant topics, but the organization of the course also shows how to begin putting different parts of the field in dialogue in order to inspire new projects."

   "comments": [
    "This is directly related to future research, so this was an incredibly helpful course.",
    "This course was extremely helpful in my preparation to course out of IR. I was able to use two of the papers that we had to do to explore literature for my coursing out paper. Debs' feedback was also very helpful to do this. This course would have also been extremely helpful to take the comprehensive exam, as we read a lot of important material and discussed things by topics. The only thing is that the workload was pretty heavy, especially with the two 6-page single-spaced papers, presentations, AND final exam, plus reading responses and readings. But, to be honest, now that I'm done, I'm very glad I did everything because I learned a lot from ALL the assignments.",
    "prep for field exam, possible teaching in IR subfield",
    "I liked the topic reviews. Definitely helped me come up with a research topic!",
    "This course provided several potential topics of interest (either new questions or gaps in the field) that I hope to follow up on in the future. Dr. Debs pointed out gaps in the field at various points; these broader critiques allow students to learn to independently spot research gaps. I think this was the most helpful portion of the class.",
    "I certainly feel that I learned a lot about international security, though I do wish we could have focused a little more deeply on some of the classic texts and debates."
