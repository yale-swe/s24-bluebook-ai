   "comments": [
    "This is a very good class, and you can get a lot out of it, but I would probably only recommend it if you're very interested in the topics because it is very detailed and intensive.",
    "No. It's too broad to get much of anything done. It really should be a lecture.",
    "I would recommend this course. The primary source readings are very well selected and always trigger interesting discussion and debate. The professor also brings a lot to the course.",
    "nice syllabus. ok class",
    "This is a course that offers a broad survey of policies and ideas governing U.S. foreign policy from the founding to the present. The broad time scale of the course means that each topic is only covered on a surface level, but the ideas may be of great interest. Beware slow discussion.",
    "Great professor, interesting material, manageable workload, great classmates. What more could you ask for in a class?",
    "The course covered the philosophical underpinnings of the foreign policy of the United States from its inception to the present. Readings focused on primary source material from contemporary debates at various periods throughout American history. If you're interested in the subject material, you will enjoy this course, and the workload is definitely manageable.",
    "I would recommend it as long as they really love American history because this class offers new perspectives on the big international events in US history.",
    "Definitely worthwhile. The readings are interesting and light--but don't expect an in-depth analysis of all the topics covered."
