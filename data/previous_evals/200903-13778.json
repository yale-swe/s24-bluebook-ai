    "Yes, cool class. Not a lot of work, and fair grading. However, quite dry and boring at times.",
    "JUST TAKE THE CLASS. YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT. Smith is wonderful, the reading volume is light but very interesting and fun to get through, and discussion is great! NO papers; very fun, optional debates (do one!!!); fair exams. YAYYYY TAKE THIS CLASSSSSS.",
    "Great to take as 5th credit. Very easy but you still learn a bit.",
    "good classwould recommend it",
    "Yes.",
    "While you don't often get to express your own views in this class, you gain a greater knowledge of the professionally accepted views and thus have a better background for formulating your own personal views on the issues.",
    "yes, i would recommend this class. it's not too much work, and the material is pretty interesting.",
    "It's okay. Prof Smith is great, but the course is a little bit shallow. It's okay.",
    "The course has two midterms and a final which are straight-forward. The topics are interesting, and you will want to go to the lectures. The readings introduce you to really interesting ethical issues like physician assisted suicide, genetic testing, and cloning. There are also optional debates between groups of students which provide a break from lectures. Take it!!",
    "Take bioethics if you are look for an easy, sometimes interesting course. Only 3 exams, there isn't that much reading and you don't have to do all of it to do well in the course. The issues you discuss are interesting, although a lot of times the readings\/lecture are one-sided.",
    "Yes, this class is definitely worth taking no matter your major. The work is not that demanding and the readings that you do are very interesting. Even more than bioethical issues, you also gain a great deal of perspective on what it means to be in a family and gives you different ways to view your relationships with others. Hopefully you will not get a TA that makes the class even better.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. It's a great introduction to bioethics with a friendly professor and it's not too challenging in terms of course work, but is challenging in that it gives you a lot to think about and sort through to come up with your own conclusions.",
    "I would recommend it: not too hard, interesting, fun.",
    "Great class, not too much work, excellent professor who is clearly an expert in the field.",
    "Pretty good class that introduces you to several key topics of interest in the field. Smith is very nice, and very helpful.I would recommend this class: the grading is not harsh at all and the material's interesting enough. Zaragoza was a pretty great TA: I don't know if he'll be here next time, though. Smith is one of the better professors, certainly one of the nicest, and teaches a pretty interesting class. Look at the syllabus and see if it interests you.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. Although it seems a bit boring during shopping period, keep going, and take the class! It's not very difficult, and the readings (which you should do for the midterm) are really interesting. Professor Smith is also a wonderful lecturer and the debates are really interesting.",
    "Great introduction to the field of Bioethics and essential for anyone interested in going into medicine. However, the exams were awfully subjective and had little to do with how well you understood the material.",
    "I would recommend this class as if really allows you read about and gain new or solidify your opinions on topics such as cloning, stem cell research, abortion, death and dying, genetic enhancement, etc. It really gave me better insight into these topics that most only have generalized opinions on or have only read about in the news. It's great to be able to see different authors' opinions on different topics as well.There's a fair amount of reading, but the tests are fair, and there are no papers unless you choose to do a debate, which are also entertaining and informative to watch.",
    "Great class. Must take. Not a lot of work and really fascinating.",
    "The best class I've taken at Yale. Prof. Smith really cares about the material and always has interesting lectures. The material is always relevant and engaging.",
    "This is a great course if you would like to get a general overview of bioethics as a field. We covered a lot of topics ranging from abortion to euthanasia to genetic testing, etc. The material was extremely interesting and Dr. Smith makes the lectures very enjoyable. The workload is fairly light and the in-class debates were a lot of fun as well. This class is especially helpful if you are pre-med because these are the types of issues that are very relevant in medicine and it is especially helpful to be familiar with these issues for medical school interviews.",
    "The class was ok. It's good to know about the abortion debate and stem cell research debate. There is not a lot of reading. The tests are multiple choice. If you have the chance to do the debate, do it.",
    "It was a great class. I took it because friends have recommended it to me, and I'm glad they did. Professor Smith is great, and the material is so interesting to think about and talk through. It really pushes you to think about issues that do not have one right answer, so you have to figure out how to back up your point of view if you have a strong one. Totally fascinating, totally recommended.He's great. His lectures are really well planned and he is so lovable. He also is great at explaining things that seem like they would be tough to explain. He really reaches out to his students in a pretty decent sized lecture classes because he really cares. I love him.",
    "Great introduction to bioethics, pretty easy, interesting and enjoyable. David Smith is great, make sure to go to lunch with him.",
    "This is a great class that I would highly recommend for anyone interested in present-day issues in bioethics such as reproductive technologies, euthanasia, and abortion. Professor Smith is wonderful and one of the best lecturers I've had so far. Take this course!",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class. Even if you have no prior experience with the material, or do not imagine you would be that interested, it is truly a fascinating thought experiment.",
    "An very good class if you have any interest in the mateial. Good professor and a very managable work load.",
    "Great course--the death and dying reading is a bit emotionally challenging (for me, anyway) but it sure is an important topic to consider. Take this class!!!",
    "It covers a lot of interesting issues in Bioethics, and covers them from many different perspective, which is nice. I think Smith was good as picking pieces to read that balanced difference views. Not too much work, and pretty enjoyable overall.",
    "A fine course. Pretty easy - two midterms and a final, all of which are based entirely on the (meager) readings. You won't really be asked to think for yourself, but you'll at least be exposed to various theories on a lot of important bioethical issues (stem cells, abortion, end of life care, etc.), and it's pretty hard not to find them interesting.",
    "Issues in Bioethics covers a wide range of topics including abortion, genetic testing, death and euthanasia, truth-telling, egg donation, and others. In general, the classes are interesting, and the sections invite discussion about these topics.I would recommend this class to anyone who has any sort of interest in these ethical questions and would appreciate the opportunity to form a more educated view on these subjects. The workload is not excessive, which makes it easier to enjoy the class. However, I would recommend doing the reading in order to answer the multiple choice questions on the tests and to be able to participate in the discussion sections, which are mandatory to attend.Furthermore, Professor Smith is a good lecturer, and this course is a great way to learn about a new subject in an interesting way, without killing yourself trying to remember many unimportant facts.",
    "A course about the big questions - possibly the biggest questions - out there. The material is remarkably well-selected, the course is superbly structured (and the structure is adhered to!) and the work is designedsuch that the class works with you -- not against you. Take the class - no two ways about it.",
    "Not a great class, in my opinion. The class is not really challenging but also doesn't really teach you a lot or make you think that hard. The course is listed as Poli Sci, it really isn't \"ethics\" in any kind of pure sense. In generally I found it wishy-washy and not super-interesting.",
    "TAKE IT. Excellent class. Super interesting, good readings, great lectures. altho warning, it had a christian slant. but so does american society. get to know david smith, he's really interested in students and super awesome and supportive. Move slowly, very easy to keep up. easy to do well. GET A GOOD TA.",
    "This class is one I feel every Yale student should take. It verses you in contemporary ethical issues such as abortion, research on children, care for the dying, physician assisted suicide, patient-physician relationships, and so much more. I found the content of this class spilling over onto other areas of my studies and relevant to the issues in my everyday life. Professor Smith does an excellent job of present the completing sides of the issues, making discussion selections lively and interesting. The work load was manageable and the exams were fair, making the course compatible even with those outside the major.",
    "This course is a great introduction to the current issues in Bioethics. Professor Smith is an engaging lecturer. The courseload is very managable, too.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to every student at Yale. The issues dealt with during the course should be important to everyone, and the course is a great way of finding out more about such important issues.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. One of the best I have taken at Yale.",
    "It is a good overview of the debates surrounding bioethical issues (abortion, truth telling, genetic counseling etc.) but it is more about the debates than the issues themselves.",
    "This class is easy. If you enjoy not doing the reading because you know that the professor will summarize everything in class, then Issues in Bioethics is for you. That being said, the topics are interesting and can be thought provoking.",
    "This class basically tests you with exams that are more like reading quizzes. The lectures just rehash the readings. The readings can be pretty good and they are usually on very interesting and controversial topics, but the lectures don't really offer much more than reading quizzes. There are a few student in class debates which make things a little more interesting. The class isn't too hard, so if you are interested in some of the topics it is probably worthwhile but you may end up slightly disappointed.",
    "Bioethics is a pretty good class. The material is definitely interesting and Professor Smith is a good teacher, albeit kind of quirky. I recommend it, but the tests can be a little tricky so watch out for that. Good class though-- it gets you to think about some important things that you will not learn about anywhere else at Yale.",
    "Issues in Bioethics is a good class; I would recommend it to you.",
    "Bioethics is a great class. It is one of the best I have taken at Yale. Professor Smith is a wonderful professor who takes time to get to know students, even in such a large lecture class. His lectures are always interesting, and it's not too hard to pay attention for the entire lecture. The midterms and final are fairly easy if you've paid attention in lecture and done some of the more important readings. Word of advice: take the two midterms and don't do the debate to get out of one. The debate is much more work than studying for a midterm.",
    "Religious Studies 273 is a study of ethical concerns, primarily dealing with beginning and end of life issues. The material was interesting, but discussion was often frustrating. Trying to create ethical standards with no moral compass felt like trying to draw a straight line using a ruler made out of spiderweb- a tenuous attempt at best.",
    "I would probably recommend this class. It was not an amazing lecture, but the subject material is pretty interesting.",
    "Political Science 281 was an introductory course to the field and works of bioethics. It explored a variety of topics and authors in the field, giving a small sample of each. I would wholeheartedly recommend this course to another student, as it was one of the best I have had at Yale.",
    "Poli Sci 281 is definitely worth taking. At times it felt a little formulaic: we would read opinions from a few different authors on various bio-ethical issues, discuss them in class, and repeat. But overall it was a great class. Smith was a pretty solid lecturer, and he really cared about his students (he set up a series of lunches with students and invited them to office hours). For anyone interested in medicine, law, or science, it's definitely worth a look.",
    "Definitely take this course if think any of the topics covered would be interesting, especially if you're pre-med (but if you're not, it's still a great course - the topics covered would just be especially relevant if you're planning on working in healthcare). It's not a difficult class as long as you do the reading, which there isn't a lot of. The tests are fair - you know what will be covered. If you're thinking you might want to take it, go to a few lectures (they get better after the first one). I would recommend this course to any student.",
    "yes,take it. the reading is managable-- he assigns few enough pages you can actually do it all, and not feel like you're wasting your time. interesting subjects, not terribly difficult if you pay attention in lecture and at least vaguely keep up with the readings.",
    "I would summarize it as a course that goes over many different issues concerning the physician community with its patients, as well as many other relationships. It requires its students to read different author' perspectives on different issues and think critically, comparing them to each other and also to their own beliefs.",
    "Take it for credit and don't worry about a thing.",
    "Okay class. Not a lot of work, but the exams make it hard to do poorly and hard to do really well. Do a debate, as those are graded more easily.",
    "It is very similar to what the title suggests... a course in bioethics. It focuses on different ethical dilemmas that our encountered in the field of medicine, especially with new technologies like genetic mapping.",
    "Take this class.",
    "Workload is relatively light and the readings are moderate in difficulty. Professor Smith is very clear in discussing the material, so even if the reading is hard to understand, the professor clears up any misunderstandings and spells out the main points of the readings. The exams are very straight forward and Smith is very clear about telling students what will and will not be on the test. Sections can be fun if the TA is smart and amiable and the other students are willing to discuss the material. Great class that I looked forward to every time.",
    "This is a great course. TAKE IT! TAKE IT! I'd previously struggled in philosophy courses but the (small) amount of mainstream philosophy included on the syllabus is extremely accessible. The readings are interesting but totally manageable, and while lectures are enjoyable I always left feeling like I'd learned something. Something meaningful, even though I'm only beginning to discover what it was I learned...the exams are very fair (the in-class debates are a nice substitute for one of them), and Professor Smith is incredible. He is the top of his field but wonderful at teaching semi-intro courses like this one - his dry sense of humor merges well with his steady, clear lecture style. I don't think anyone was ever bored. The mix of religion, politics, and philosophy was great. I was never planning on becoming a doctor, but after this class I'm considering going into the medical field. One of the best classes I've taken at Yale, ever.",
    "Absolutely. The workload isn't too heavy and the topics covered are extremely relevant. Simply put, a great course to take.",
    "I would certainly recommend Bioethics to just about anyone. It's a great 5th class. Not a lot of work and really interesting.",
    "take it -- easy grade.",
    "Issues in Bioethics went beyond simply relaying information and equipped me to be a skilled participant in conversations concerning major topics in bioethics. By far, my favorite components of the course were debates. Plus, Professor Smith is great! All in all, a great course- definitely recommended.",
    "A great intro to the ethical issues surrounding medical care in the U.S. It mostly deals with fairly practical applications, although there is a little bit of formal ethics involved."
