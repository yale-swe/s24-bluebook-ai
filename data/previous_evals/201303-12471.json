    "I would recommend this class to another student.Summary: The basics of glass blowing methods and techniques. Starting with scoring\/cutting and melting glass with a torch, working all the way up to joining pieces together in different ways, reshaping glass forms and fixing cracks\/chips.",

    "I am better able to assess damaged laboratory glassware, and decide what can be fixed and what is better replace. I learned how to seal samples under vacuum and how to fix and\/or make simple glass pieces.Although this is unlikely to have much impact during my doctorate, it may be very helpful in the future as a researcher somewhere that might not have a person like Daryl on hand.",
    "I have a better understanding of the glassware that I use in my research every day, from the simple to the complicated. On top of that, if I ever need custom glassware for a particular purpose I have a better idea of what is needed and what can be done."
