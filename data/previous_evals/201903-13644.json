   "comments": [
    "Knowledge with parsings and diagnosing problems through charts\/mapping. Greater insight into urban infrastructure and issues of environmental justice.",
    "I learned how visual parsings can help ecologists and leaders in local government tackle wicked problems in urban ecology, ranging from environmental racism, to climate change vulnerability, to deteriorating infrastructure.",
    "How to analyze projects from an entire systems perspective. The use of parsings to help students evaluate large, seemingly non-understandable problems was really helpful.",
    "I learned how to use parsings as a tool to evaluate complex social-ecological issues.",
    "A very scientific way of looking at cities. The parsing practices we had throughout the semester are especially helpful for systematic thinking.",
    "Factors that go into decision making",
    "Integration of sociological and ecological systems are complex and change over time. I learned to examine, or parse, urban and ecological issues in the same critical framework, with relationships between eachother.",
    "learned systems thinking, socio-ecological frameworks and how to apply these to various topics",
    "How to think of the structure of various policies, environmental relationships, modern ideas in our society.",
    "Learning to \"parse\" the readings was a new approach that has helped me better absorb and understand complex topics.",
    "Systems thinking, understanding of human networks involved in decision making",
    "Learned how to parse complex urban-ecologies, their problems, and solutions.",
    "The course is an introduction to inter disciplinary thinking. Each weeks topic was different and hence, it broke a linear way of thinking and discouraged prioritizing a particular method to tackle issues. This was the most valuable lesson. However, the topic is short lived-only one week. On the positive side, one can further an area of interest in the culmination project for the semester. KNOWLEDGE SKILLS AND INSIGHTS The course encouraged an interdisciplinary exchange of thought processes. An exposure to the students from the Forestry, Law and Management schools, it exposed me to their thought process in addressing ecological issues. This was an invaluable experience especially because the course demanded a group project with students from different schools for the final project. My final project was done in collaboration with students majoring in Law and Ecological management.",
    "System thinking, importance of networks. how to tackle big problems"

   "comments": [
    "Yes",
    "I the knowledge I gained from the class aligned closely with my expectations. Morgan provides a clear overview of what the class will cover during the first lecture, so there is no confusion about the seminar objectives.",
    "It aligned well. The trip to Baltimore and NYC exceeded my expectations and really helped me engage with the learning.",
    "The in-class discussions on student parsings were helpful to hear about different angles\/perspectives to analyze socio-ecological issues.",
    "Slightly less scientific than I thought, but I think I need to redefine for myself what \"science\" means in such a difficult discipline - urban ecology.",
    "I gained a lot of relevant knowledge",
    "It aligned really well with my expectations. Though I think maybe more concentration on a certain area of ecological service might have framed the class better.",
    "pretty well; I was exposed to lots of new concepts that seem very relevant in the field of urban ecology",
    "It was overall good to gain a perspective different from my own studies, which I had expected.",
    "Fairly well. The parsing method is interesting and useful, and I am curious how it can be used more rigorously to present systems to decision making groups. The idea of boundary objects will serve me well.",
    "It exceeded my expectations.",
    "The course encouraged an interdisciplinary exchange of thought processes. An exposure to the students from the Forestry, Law and Management schools exposed me to their thought process in addressing ecological issues. This exposure, I believe, will be helpful in a holistic program formulation and in turn to effectively conceptualize urban projects in the future.",
    "Very well"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of the course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Great course. No recommendations for improvement--the trip was especially engaging!",
    "I appreciated the course's emphasis on problem parsings. I also thought that Morgan's lectures were thorough and thought-provoking. I wish, though, that Morgan had allotted a bit more time for class discussion.",
    "The course allowed for a lot of self-reflection, which was helpful, but also there were times where I felt I needed more guidance. Additionally, it would have been nice to do an example parsing with the class all-together. Morgan, Clara, and Colleen's openness with students definitely helped us feel at ease that we could discuss hard topics and evaluate them openly.",
    "I think the parsings can be a powerful tool to diagnose real-world problems but I find the course still lacking on the applied component. Perhaps a case-study approach can be taken where a given social-ecological problem and its context is provided and students must use parsings to evaluate the situation and propose a solution. The solutions can then be compared to what actually happened, or if it's a live case-study, a representative from the case can be brought in to weigh in on student insights.",
    "Practice with Organizational Networks in addition to Problem Parsings throughout the semester (maybe not every week, but alternating weeks?) would be very helpful, especially for the final project.",
    "The classes are well-organized, and constantly getting to share our thoughts with classmates and seeing their research is awesome.",
    "Field trip was a great way to get a hands on experience",
    "Strengths: Great lectures, great readings, great instructors, great assignments, AMAZING field trip. Weaknesses: Could be more group parsing exercises because I think the setting for parsings should include group interaction and 'feeling comfortable being uncomfortable.' Better in class conversations could be made through less in-class parsing\/ topic of interest presentations but more questions asked\/ more conversations generated around the subject. The presentations would be better if we knew when we were going to present too.",
    "I would have appreciated more feedback on our weekly assignments so that I was more prepared for the final assignments. I really enjoyed the selection of readings each week and found all of them very fascinating.",
    "The weekly assignments were helpful, although in the end I felt it would be more great if there were more varieties of assignments",
    "The field trip was a great experience! Very informative and enjoyable. I'm not sure if completing a Topic of Interest every week was the best use of our time. I put together a presentation every week and only shared one of them with the class. I enjoyed researching new topics each week, but because we never knew when we were going to present, I feel as though I spent a lot of time preparing presentations that I would never actually give.",
    "The strength of this course is the systems thinking and the field trip demonstrating what some of this systems thinking can achieve. The class not only presented a way of thinking but a way of relating to other people involved in decision making that takes into account different perspectives and finds common ground. The course could be strengthened with more group work around the parsings--practicing the skill of working with diverse conceptions of a system.",
    "It's a finely wrought course that pretty much nails it. A cumulative final project might be something interesting to try.",

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend that students really take ownership of the parsing assignments. I found the parsings incredibly helpful both inside and outside the class. The more time you devote to the parsings, the more enjoyable and engaging the class will be.",
    "Definitely take advantage of the field trips and the real life work that Morgan, Clara, and Colleen do. They have valuable field experience - so ask questions!",
    "Parsings will seem very confusing at first. They will seem very confusing for the first few weeks. But you will be very comfortable with them by the end.",
    "Be prepared to look at situations from a different point of view",
    "I would recommend the student to keep up with the readings or do as much as possible because they were very interesting and really helped to inform the lecture and discussion each week.",
    "It would be great if you are considering to gain a different way to look at various things",
    "Spend some time at the beginning of the semester really learning how to \"parse\" the readings. I found parsing to be a really useful skill that is applicable to other courses.",
    "Take advantage of the topics of interest to craft your final project. The work you do on these topics can build up to an interesting final project.",
