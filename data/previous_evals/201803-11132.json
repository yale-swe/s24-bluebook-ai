   "comments": [
    "While learning about French culture and history, I gained speaking and vocabulary skills such as debating and making an argument, writing skills, and an appreciating for learning about culture, not just language.",
    "During this course, I was able to learn more about the contextual elements of the French language, in addition to improving my oral fluency and comfort with the language. The course gave me a deeper appreciation for French culture and the historical context in which contemporary French exists.",
    "I learned much more about French culture and what living in France would be like in 2018.",
    "You get a ton of conversational practice taking this class, but also learn a little bit about a lot of important contemporary topics in France.",
    "I learned a lot about French history, culture and politics. I learned a lot of new useful vocabulary",
    "Well-rounded overview of where France is at today and what challenges it faces.",
    "You learn a lot about French culture and society.",
    "This class was incredibly effective at taking me through a practical use of formal French to the extent that I would feel comfortable applying it in the workplace."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The course was organized comprehensively, with each unit covering a distinct part of French culture. Towards the end of the class, we did more debates, and I think those should be incorporated throughout the semester.",
    "The course is great for considering a wide range of concepts pertinent to the modern French identity, but there was so much content that it often felt too generalized, and not all concepts were equally discussed.",
    "There were many helpful assignments that helped me learn how to apply new vocabulary to cultural information that was presented in class. I received frequent feedback that helped me improve my written and spoken French, and the large projects were challenging yet manageable. One weakness was that there were a lot of native speakers, who elevated the quality of French in class but also made it very difficult to participate as a non-native speaker. Maybe making it clearer that this course is directed more towards people learning spoken French than towards fluent speakers looking to improve their grammar could improve this.",
    "I liked class discussions, but often felt we had too much reading outside of class that wouldn't be reflected in our discussions once we got into the classroom.",
    "Fun class",
    "I liked that we covered a wide array of topics and had a good balance between readings and movies",
    "As it was, there were a good amount of readings assigned per class but class discussion never actually centered on the readings (speaking only for Pinzka's section of the course), leaving little incentive to actually do the readings. This made the workload less, but I also feel like I could have gotten much more out of the class if I had done the readings. In the future hopefully Pinzka makes the more readings more vital. Otherwise, I felt like the syllabus and content covered does a very good job of looking at different sectors of French society. Perhaps remove one or two of the topics to allow time to explore some of the other topics with more depth. Trips to YUAG was nice, although I didn't really feel like it connected with what we were doing in class that much.",
    "I believe the course was very good at sourcing study materials from a diversity of mediums including film, articles and a textbook. While I thought the seminar format was effective to allow conversation, the course could have maybe been improved maybe by being slightly smaller to allow even more dialogue."

    "I would. I think I learned more about France and my French improved most in this class than other classes I have taken (except study abroad).",
    "Absolutely; I've gained so much confidence and ability by being in this class, and I've learned so much about French culture.",
    "Yes. It is a helpful course to improve your French speaking and learn about French culture.",
    "Yes I would recommend it -- it's a pretty chill course and you'll enjoy the class periods because they're just conversations about interesting topics.",
    "Definitely. It was really interesting and we did a lot of fun interactive assignments",
    "Yes. If you are interested in continuing French and learning about France its a great course.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student looking to get a practical and applicable understanding of the French language. All the material covered is very pertinent to the kind of french one would encounter in the real world."
