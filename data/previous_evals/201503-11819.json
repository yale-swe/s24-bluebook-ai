   "comments": [
    "I wouldn't recommend this course to another student unless its a prereq. It is confusing and more stressful than it needed to be. I didn't understand 3D concepts and it's not fun.",
    "I believe this would have been a good class if you are considering engineering or applied sciences as an alternative to MATH 120. But I wouldn't recommend it if Professor Jiang is teaching as it is difficult to learn from his teaching style.",
    "probably depends on who's teaching",
    "Maybe the class will be different if it is taught by a different teacher, but after this semester, I would summarize the class as disorganized, disconnected, and poorly taught but well intended.",
    "I think generally this is a great class that is better than Math 120, but it was a rough semester because the Professor was new and the class was disorganized.",
    "I know that a lot of people hated this class, but I actually really enjoyed it and found it manageable, especially when I took notes on the book ahead of lectures (easy because Professor Jiang posted the slides before the lecture), and started the psets ahead of time. Finding study partners to compare psets with before turning them in really helped my grade. We were allowed cheat sheets for the midterm and final, which alone I think made this class easier than 120. I don't really know any other differences between this and 120, except the pacing for this class was relatively slow at the beginning, and then we hurried through the later chapters. Professor Jiang got off to a rough start as a new teacher, but tried really hard to improve, and I think he succeeded.",
    "Make sure you get a good professor for this course. If not consider taking 120 instead.",
    "Given this was Prof. Jiangs first year of teaching this class, Im not surprised there were so many bumps in the road. We spent way too much time on the first few topics, which were easy to grasp, and consequently we didnt have enough time to adequately cover the hard stuff in the last chapter (vector calculus theorems), even though we were expected to know it just as well as the easy stuff (the final exam was unfair in this regard). The class was basically self-taught. The level of understanding we got from lectures (if we attended) was much lower than what was needed to complete some of the problem sets. You get a cheat-sheet for each test but you dont really need it except for the final. I was disappointed in this class, especially because it was sold as a more applied version of MATH 120 (not true at all), and I wish I had taken MATH 120, which is a more reliable and well-paced class. Im glad Im not planning to go into engineering or else Id have a poor foundation of multivariable calculus having taken this course.",
    "Until Liang Jiang ups his teaching game (this was his first time teaching an undergrad course), probably try to take this course when someone else is teaching it.",
    "I would absolutely never recommend this class with this professor. Always always always avoid Liang Jiang. Always. You're making a mistake if you take it with him. You will regret it. Terrible Class. Lecture was not helpful at all and the gap between the textbook material and the problem sets was almost insurmountable. TAs were not particularly helpful, not because they didn't want to be, but because they assumed our level of math capability was close to theirs. 1st midterm should have been thrown out, especially cause I didn't have a good physics background. 2nd midterm was a perfect test of abilities. It was tough, but fair. The final was disgustingly difficult. It was in no way even remotely similar to practice. There was no good way to prepare for it. The functions were insane. Left a horrible taste in my mouth. If I had to do it over again, I would have tried to do it with a different Prof. Always loved math until this class, not because Multi is hard, but because there were no real resources for help when experiencing difficulty. I should have taken MATH 120 instead. Take it with a different professor. You might want to still be an engineer if you take it with someone else.",
    "I would not take this class again even if I was paid to. Examinations were ridiculously frustrating since there was no way to be prepared for them unless you already took the course AND have extraordinary math capabilities. The final exam was a waste of time since there was no way of showing that you learned any material taught in the lectures. The problems are just ridiculous. I should have taken Math 120.",
    "ENAS 151 01 is a similar class to MATH 120 and good to take if required by your major. I would not recommend taking this course unless you have a good understanding of calculus.",
    "This class is basically MATH 120 but \"for engineers.\" DO NOT, I repeat, DO NOT take this course with Professor Jiang. I would not recommend this course to anyone, because it was a class that took more of my time than necessary and caused the most stress and anxiety than any other class I have taken thus far.",
    "I would stick with Math 120. I had to teach myself most of the concepts in this course, and we covered less than Math 120 as well. The homework also takes a considerable amount of time, and it often feels tedious.",
    "I would recommend this course to people who would like to learn a more applied approach towards multivar. Although most proofs are not covered rigorously, it will gain you the right intuition about theorems and the understanding of how to use them, which might be more favorable depending on your purposes. If you are physics inclined consider taking this course instead of Math120.",
    "Please God don't take this course. If you must, please take it with Smooke. If your only option is to take it with Jiang, consider changing majors. The problem sets will take an entire day of constant banging your head against a mathematical wall, the tests are neigh impossible and uncurved, the lectures are worse than just reading the book and being confused by yourself. You would be paying Yale to sit in your room and try and teach yourself multi through Khan Academy and friends' advice. The only bright spot of this class was that it brought together the class in mutual despair over the content and the tests. After the final, people just started laughing uncontrollably because the whole situation was so surreal and horrible. Do yourself a favor and avoid this class.",
    "Don't take this class with Liang Jiang. It could be really interesting with another professor, but taking it with him will destroy AND FRUSTRATE YOU.",
    "Difficult problem sets but tests are fair.",
    "A terrible class that is made infinitely more difficult by way it's run. I did not and still don't feel like the material was horribly difficult, but the manner of the class, psets, and exams made it awful and is most definitely hurting my gpa. TAKE 120!!!!",
    "I would recommend allowing the instructor to become a little more familiarized with how the course should be organized before taking ENAS 151. This was the first semester for this course to be taught by this instructor so there were some details that were ironed out as the course progressed. Overall by the end of the semester the course,the way the course was taught was much better than how it started. After a couple more semesters with this professor I feel like it would be even stronger.",
    "Do not take. 120 is easier (believe me- I helped my friends in 120 whilst dying in 151).",
    "DO NOT TAKE IT WITH JIANG",
    "DO NOT TAKE THIS COURSE!!! IF YOU NEED TO TAKE MULTIVARIABLE, TAKE MATH 120!! Horrible course. I took multivariable calculus in high school, and this class made me more confused than I had been before. Lectures were long and boring, and asking questions made me more confused than before. The lecture powerpoints were full of typos, The weekly p sets were extremely long (4-7 hours total for each one), far too difficult, and seemingly unrelated to what we talked about in class. Psets consistently made me want to rip my hair out\/cry, and math usually comes easy to me. There were even long p sets during exam weeks- the p-set due 3 days after midterm 2 (labeled as \"short\" in an email) was a whopping 13 problems long, and took me almost 5 hours total to complete. Sometimes, we would have to do long, proof-style problems in the p-sets with no preparation in class whatsoever. Not only were these proof problems impossible to do, but during lectures, professor jiang would often times say that because we were engineers, learning the proof was dumb and purposeless, yet he made us do the proofs on the p-sets. The most awful part of the class was the final. I managed to get a score of 102% and 96% on the first two midterms, respectively, yet somehow on the final exam, I got a raw score 49%. I studied a fair amount, and reviewed all of the p-sets thoroughly. The final was nothing like the p-sets, and had typos. I understood how to apply the complicated theorems and concepts to most of the problems on the final, but the expressions were so complicated and unintelligible that I got to a point where I simply could not integrate any more and had to give up on the problem. Overall, this was a horrible class and I would never recommend it to any student.",
    "The class is a hit or miss depending on the professor.",
    "It's a less proof based version of multivariable calculus. I would not recommend it unless someone is required to take 151 or 120. I would recommend it instead of 120 though.",
    "This was a very challenging class. I'm not sure I would recommend it unless the student has some background in multi variable classes. However, if the student is up to the challenge, this is a very rewarding class to finish.",
    "Very challenging course but interesting content.",
    "I would not recommend this class with this professor to a fellow student. It was very stressful and I felt I learned very little. In summation, the lectures were unhelpful, the homework and exams were exceedingly difficult, there was no accountability between the TA's and the professor, and learning had to take place on your own."
