   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this class to other students! Be aware that work is weekly and regular, as opposed to being more sporadic throughout the semester - but there's also no final exam, paper, or project, which means as long as you keep up during the semester you'll do fine and you'll enjoy the course! Karen Wynn is hilarious, thoughtful, and knowledgable, and you'll learn a lot from her, not just about babies but about what the implications of infant studies say about human morality.",
    "Take this course if you love talking about babies and also the human condition. Though the conversations always start at babies, they always can grow into something bigger. The workload is super-manageable for the course, with nine weekly one-page papers and no final paper, and the debates and discussions are so interesting and fun to have. I personally felt very comfortable talking in the course, and everyone has something to contribute, even those without any background in psychology or infant cognition. The topics that we discuss are extremely important, and Karen Wynn is the goddess of infant cognition, so she'll be sure to give you all of the deets that you need to understand the field.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course as a psychology seminar. You learn a lot and the topics are really interesting.",
    "Really fun and interesting seminar. You will learn a ton!",
    "Would recommend if you have at least a little interest in developmental\/social psych and\/or babies. The course was basically reading a lot of journal articles and writing on some semi-original thoughts from them. Classes were mostly enjoyable, though went off on tangents a little much for my tastes.",
    "We read 3-5 current papers on babies every week and then discuss them. There are weekly one page reading responses, but you don't have to do them every week so there's some flexibility. You can also choose to do less reading responses and write a larger final paper. I had a lot of fun! Good discussions and not too much work.",
    "Awesome class. You read about 4 psyc papers a week (from journals) and discuss. Grading is done based on short reading responses (500-600 words) each week, so by the end you've been working the whole semester and never have a big final paper or project (though you can do a longer paper if you are interested). Prof Wynn leads a great discussion and I always looked forward to this seminar!",
    "I felt as though I learned a lot about the field, and also how to be a better psychologist. The weekly papers were especially helpful for that. However, class discussion really varied from week to week in terms of how engaging and valuable I felt it was.",
    "I would absolutely, 100% recommend this course to another student! This is, far and away, the best psych seminar that I have taken at Yale. Professor Wynn is funny, warm, and quick. She provides a fascinating perspective as a researchers and shows materials from her own experiments (so cool!). The amount of reading is completely reasonable and the assignments are completely manageable--better yet, the work for the class really enhances your understanding of important concepts and makes for a rich discussion. That is to say, you will definitely not feel like you're doing busy work. The expectations are high for the assignments, but if you work hard, you'll definitely do well, and it's so nice to just do 9 intense reading responses rather than a final paper. Take this class!! (Note that the focus for the class changes from semester to semester. This time it was social development. But I think this class would be fabulous no matter what.)",
    "Definitely recommend for anyone interested in infant studies. Professor Wynn has not only done extensive research in this field (which you'll read), but she also does a great job of making the seminar run smoothly and getting people to contribute without feeling coerced. Weekly position papers aren't too big a deal, and the option to not have a final project is wonderful."
