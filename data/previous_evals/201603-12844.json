    "This class provided me the chance to practice speaking, writing, and listening to Arabic. I don't think I made huge leaps and bounds in my Arabic skills but it was a good practice space.",
    "I learned vocabulary and also kept up my reading, writing, and speaking skills up. I don't think I learned a lot because the level of the course was very low for my level, and I was not pushed. The issue with this is not with the course itself, which could have been an appropriate level for people who took Arabic only at Yale \/\/ only for two years. However, I am disappointed that the Arabic program did not encourage those at higher levels, e.g. after studying abroad\/ having studied Arabic for three years, to push themselves and take a higher level class (or to take Shaami instead). Here I need to emphasize that the Arabic department NEEDS ANOTHER PROFESSOR so that there are enough classes!! It is too much right now to put this all on Sarab, Aziz, and Elbousty. Also, there aren't enough classes taught beyond L5 at a higher level! Please please hire another professor so that students can learn Arabic at Yale. Arabic is such a difficult language and it takes a lot more than simply 6 semesters to learn the language.",
    "This course focused more on writing and speaking. Grammar was never really a focus and I wish it had been.",
    "I did not feel as though I learned a lot in the course. The course had a ton of potential with its interesting set up\/syllabus, but my expectations fell short, as I felt as the the course did not build upon itself and that there was not enough of a focus on grammar or speaking.",
    "My Arabic did improve, but not as much as I had hoped. The reason for this was that I was behind when I began the class. I took levels 1 and 2 at Yale and then did the Yale summer program for levels 3 and 4. The instructors in Morocco were excellent, but it is difficult to cover what students did in two semesters at Yale in just eight weeks. The fact that Professor Elbousty did not cover material that he should have in to first two levels did not help matters. We spent time learning things like dual and feminine conjugation and case ending when we should have already know those things. I did not realize that this was a problem until I got to level five and was behind. I would like to have retaken level 4 because I would have learned more, but that is against school policy. I was in a class with native speakers and students who were more advanced than I was and as a result was lost the entire time. There should be a better placement system. Despite the fact that I was behind, it was relatively easy for me to coast through the class."

   "comments": [
    "The strengths are that we always have things to do in class and a variety of ways to practice the language. I also feel that Professor Al-Ani speaks at a perfect, appropriate level for our comprehension skills. Weaknesses are that we are only asked to learn a small amount of vocab a week, hindering our potential and doing nothing to close the huge gaps between the skill levels in class (some people who have studied for less than a year -- including summer -- vs. some people who have studied for many and some people who are native speakers). Also this class should NOT have a section; it is only 1.0 credits, we already meet three times a week, and the homework is considerable. If there is a section, it should be with a native speaker. Lastly, I wish there were texts we could engage with that are at an appropriate level for this stage in our learning. We were meant to read Arabic literature (I was googling every other word just to get even the slightest sense of the meaning) and I think we should have been still on texts written for Arabic learners. I understand that reading beyond our level gives us skills in terms of comprehending things through strategization, but I feel like my reading and writing would be much improved if we also engaged with texts at our actual level of understanding.",
    "I like learning from the aljazeera articles. However, I thought the level was a little low. The videos were appropriately challenging for me and my listening skills significantly improved through the videos. However, I think we could have had a higher volume of material to read -- or at least that would have been more what I was looking for.",
    "The course needs more structure. It needs to focus more on speaking and grammar and continuing to build a strong base of arabic. I know it is L5, but Arabic is a tough language and I know that courses at other schools continue in a fashion similar to the syllabi of l1-L4 in their higher level classes.",
    "There was very little instruction. Students read articles and watched videos at home and then answered questions on them. The professor taught grammar when we requested it. Personally, I think the class would have benefited from more instruction."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend whenever possible that people study Arabic, but I would urge people to consider resources to study abroad or study elsewhere (e.g. Middlebury programs) because the Arabic program at Yale is not good. I have been frequently frustrated by the organization of classes (I have now taken L1-L5) and do not believe the program challenges you in the correct way to really push you forward with the language. There's lots of busy work but not a lot of work that really challenges you.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course if it is the appropriate level for you. It *should* be a course for those who have only done through L4, and people with more arabic experience should be encouraged to take a higher level. The final project was good, too! You mostly read aljazeera articles about various topics and watch videos as well, and then for the final project read some excerpts of great Arab novels and research writers \/ make presentations about that. You should see in the beginning of the term if the level of the Al-Jazeera articles is appropriate for you. I also always think it is better to push yourself in a language class. If you are reading texts at a level not appropriate for you it can be frustrating. If this course is the right level, take this course with Ustatha Sarab is possible: she is great! The department is lucky to have her.",
    "No. I feel as though the course was almost a waste of time, something I find very sad due to my love for the language.",
    "I would not recommend this class and if a student, like me, is taking this class in a diligent hope to keep up or improve their Arabic skills, I would highly recommend studying abroad or elsewhere. This L5 language classs was taught without a cumulative vocab list of any kind and there almost never seemed to be any teaching plan for the day. Students picked our own random al-jazeera articles and had to come up with a group vocab list which we were quizzed on every Friday. With practically no organization on the departement's end, the class was run by students and the only ones who benefitted from this haphazard system seemed to be the many native speakers. We had long projects which were entirely buzy work. The departement needs an overhaul and I would not recommend this class. It is an absolute shame that Yale does not put more funding or energy into such a crucial language and that the only students who are successful in Arabic are those who can afford to supplement their studies through other instututions.",
    "I would not recommend any course in the arabic department to students. My experience has not been good, starting with level 1. I did not realize how much the professor neglected to teach me until I got to higher levels and by this point it is very difficult to catch up."
