   "comments": [
    "Of the three DS courses, Philosophy ties with literature for best but is definitely the harder of the two. You will have to tackle some pretty difficult authors--Aristotle definitely comes to mind. With that said, if you put in the work, this class will be very rewarding, and even Aristotle will start to make sense. Professor Sattler in particular is very good at elucidating difficult philosophical concepts. She will give you the tools to evaluate philosophical arguments with a good measure of rigor, and you'll have regularly interesting discussions. I advise against switching out of her section--with her, you really are in good hands. I recommend this course.",
    "Taking Directed Studies has been one of the best decisions I've made since coming to college. This section, Philosophy, was my favorite of the semester. Professor Sattler is a great section leader, extremely knowledgable and willing to answer questions, and the texts covered in the course are fascinating and invite the reader to consider their world from a number of different angles. It's also an introductory philosophy class, so the survey style allows you to get a good foundation for future philosophy classes you might take later at Yale. Obvious weaknesses of the program include the \"insane\" amount of reading (which, by the way, I thought was manageable, even if it was time consuming,) and the fact that you only really interact with a small group of people within the freshman class for most of your classes. However, DS is absolutely worth taking. It's the first set of courses I've ever taken that has taught me how to think.",
    "Dissecting the texts really changes and forms your perspective on a lot of things, and it is definitely a worthwhile investment. Although I can't testify to the caliber of other professors, professor Sattler was excellent.",
    "Yes I would recommend this course. It exposes you to a lot of interesting ideas and this is the class that you can get away with very minimal work done and still participate and learn something from it. Beware though, if you have not taken philosophy before, philosophy classes aren't just simply pondering the big questions of the world--it is actually very logical and systematic, the papers (as you will learn) are very rigid in structure and a great deal of time is spent merely on reconstructing the philosopher's argument. Yes, just trying to reconstruct what the hell the philosopher was talking about in ONE paragraph can take five pages (sc. Aristotle).",
    "For me, philosophy became a deal-breaker and the reason I struggled a lot with DS. I just never clicked with it and therefore the class was very difficult. A lot of other students was able to be a lot more engaged with the class and loved it, so I think a lot of my problems stemmed from me rather than the course itself.",
    "A highly discussion based class in which the basics of philosophy are explained. Highly recommended!",
    "DS is terrific \u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00c2\u00a0looking back on the semester, I'm really glad I did it. People react to philosophy in different ways, and while I don't think that it's something I see a lot of in my future academic work, I loved it. If you can, try to get Professor Sattler. She is an amazing scholar and teacher who will provide a great introduction to philosophy. She is rigorous and really teaches you to think like a philosopher. Unlike some other teachers who seem to explain everything to their classes, she teaches you to unpack and make sense of dense philosophical writing yourself. Try to go to office hours, especially before papers. If nothing else, DS philosophy will make you a more reasoned, more rigorous thinker, and will teach you to handle arguments with precision. Professor Sattler is probably the best person to introduce you to this world.",
    "I certainly would recommend this course to a fellow student because not only did I learn a great deal of philosophy from it but it also gave me a sense of further curiosity on the subject, which I consider to be a great achievement for a course. The course was also very enjoyable because of the quality of the teaching.",
    "Good professor, good class. A nice safe pair of hands in which to learn about the fundamentals of Western thought.",
    "Absolutely. Eye opening. Everything is covered quickly but it gives you a great basis .",
    "For those who have never taken philosophy, this class will be challenging. Yet soon enough, you will realize that everyone else is struggling as well, which can be frighteningly comforting. This course covers a lot of material in very short time, but by exam week, you will find you have moved on to intelligence level 100. This course is worth it.",
    "DS philosophy offers a solid but rapidly presented grounding in early philosophical works with an emphasis on Plato and Aristotle. If you do not plan on continuing your studies in philosophy, this is a good way to familiarize oneself with the subject matter and if you do plan on pursuing philosophy, the course helps in finding areas of interest. One thing to note: you probably took a fair amount of literature and history in high school, but you most likely have a more limited experience with philosophy. Philosophy texts and papers are different that what you are used to and are challenging because of this newness. Be patient and enjoy the discussion.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to anyone looking for a basic understanding of ancient philosophy and philosophy as a discipline."
