    "I would recommend this class.",
    "Syntax II is a good introduction to some of the big questions that have driven the advancement of generative syntactic theory. There is a good balance between discussing empirical problems and their analyses according to various theories. Even more than in Syntax II, several theories are presented alongside each other, but often no particular approach is shown to be superior; this is exciting because it shows the current state of the field and its research questions."

   "comments": [
    "I felt that this class extended my knowledge of syntax considerably, filling in gaps in my understanding and introducing me to essential primary literature. Many of the core concepts I learned are referenced not only in the subfield of syntax, but also in other areas as well. I am not primarily a syntactician, but this class enabled me to feel more confident exploring syntactic questions in my own research."
