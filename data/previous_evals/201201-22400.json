    "As long as the student is ready to read a lot and write quite a bit, I would recommend this class.",
    "I took this course as a freshman because the title sounded ridiculously cool. I ended up reading a serious amount and writing the longest and most well-researched paper I had ever done. I was out of my element\/league, but that made the course extremely useful and interesting. What made this class great was really the teacher (Lui) and the structure (I guess typical junior seminar structure). Don't get me wrong, the material was very interesting and the final paper was open and thus allowed you to choose practically any topic between 1600 and 1920, which made me care about the paper so much more, but having to do real, junior-level work was what made this class amazing for me. Maybe it's just me - I really enjoy working in an environment full of older, more experienced, and more knowledgeable people - but this class made me grow as a person. Definitely take it. If you don't want to take this one, shop a junior seminar. There were two freshmen in my course; you have a shot at getting in.",
    "I would highly recommend this course, particularly to someone with an interest in social history and in historical methodology. You will learn not only how to discuss history but also how to write history."
