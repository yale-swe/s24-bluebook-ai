    "Good course, typical senior essay colloquium.",
    "Alison was super sweet and gave very helpful advice! Her deadlines, however, sucked - I really would have appreciated a lot more flexibility in setting my own timeline for my project (a year-long thesis). It was frankly unhelpful to constantly have to turn in long drafts for this class. Everyone's draft pages were almost always badly written and incomplete - making it kind of meaningless to get feedback on them, and hard to give feedback. I really needed time this semester to actually conduct my research, and I felt like this class at times hampered my ability to do that.",
    "Pretty helpful and necessary. Writing a thesis is way different than writing a simple research paper, and you'll pick up some useful tips and tricks if you come to class and actually pay attention.",
    "A great course that provides structure to writing your senior essay while also allowing enough flexibility that you can pursue whatever scholarly paths you've discussed with your advisor. Really helpful. (Although that might depend on who's teaching it--Alison Kanosky was incredible!)",
    "A small seminar with working groups and a number of deadlines to meet.",
    "AMST 493 is a weekly seminar wholly devoted to writing and revising a senior thesis paper or project in American Studies. I'd recommend it to any American Studies seniors interested in feedback on their paper\/project not only from their advisor, but from an American Studies instructor and fellow students in the major.",
    "If you plan on doing a yearlong thesis, then you have to take this class. I would recommend taking it and spending this semester really reading\/researching\/gathering sources\/taking notes and just writing 20 pages by the end. The next semester can be used for the heavy duty writing.",
    "Great help to completing your thesis! This seminar is really meant as a place to allow you to feel comfortable so if you are considering writing a thesis, shop the class the first day and see how it goes! You don't have to come in with a complete research plan at all and the seminar helps you develop that. I found it relatively helpful throughout the semester!",
    "Great! Alison is awesome and did a great job accommodating a super wide variety of essays and projects. Definitely take this if you're doing a thesis, it's a help rather than a hinderance!"
