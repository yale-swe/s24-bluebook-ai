   "comments": [
    "If you can take this class, do! It's the best class I've taken at Yale. I think the material is interdisciplinary and accessible enough that almost any student, regardless of major, could do well and find it interesting.",
    "Take it. No more need be said.",
    "A great survey of the \"practical\" applications of research in psychology and neuroscience. Although we often ended up coming to the same conclusion (\"fMRI scans are difficult to interpret so we should be cautious\"), people always had interesting things to say and it was easy to stay awake despite the early start time. Reasonable workload (weekly reading responses, a final paper) - highly recommended for psych\/cog sci majors or those interested in the implications of these disciplines for fields as diverse as law and religion.",
    "The class was interesting, and I would recommend it. However, Professor Chun is pretty arbitrary in his grading, and I wish he would contribute more to the discussion.",
    "I'd recommend this to anyone interested in psychology or bioethics issues. The readings were good, the discussions were great, and the workload is more than manageable.",
    "I highly recommend this class if you can get in!! You leave each class feeling really passionate about the issues you discuss. Marvin Chun is a great professor, take this class if you can.",
    "If you get the chance to take it, I cannot recommend this course more highly. You read several papers a week on a variety of topics, and write a weekly response that really engages you with the issues at hand without being too stressful. Class discussion is also excellent, since this class is really made by the wide variety of students Professor Chun admits.",
    "YES! This was the best class I have ever taken. Professor Chun is fantastic and chooses the best possible people for this course, all from different backgrounds and with interesting contributions to make. The material is fascinating and the reading responses and reading really get you thinking. The class ties together psychology, neuroscience, philosophy\/neuroethics with policy making and is very applicable to daily life. Definitely take this course if you can!!!",
    "I would highly recommend this class for anyone interested in psychology.",
    "The class is a forum in which to debate ethical questions as they relate to cognitive science. Topics span neuromarketing, neurolaw, and neuropolitics. Chun does not teach you anything; he just polices the discussion. Assigned papers are all scientific ones.I would recommend to a student who is very vocal and wants to debate issues in class. This is a class that is more about debate than it is about information or understanding the issues.",
    "Take this class if you can get in. It rules!",
    "Great course, professor, students, and readings. Highly recommend it, especially if you have some burning question that you don't think can be answered in another course. Can't promise that your question will be answered, but at the very least you'll gain the confidence that comes with knowing that no one knows. Professor Chun stays in the background and lets the students contribute and respond to each other. Not too much reading (around 50 pages\/week, sometimes less) - and the weekly reading responses make sure you do what's there and remember it. The presentations are really fun, especially your own, and you'll look forward to class discussions. There were a few grad students that made some really interesting additions to the class. The paper is short, but can be tough if you ask a question that you really care about. It will take you longer than you think, so, if you take it, make sure to meet with Professor Chun and discuss topics,research and structure.",
    "Psychology 413 is a survey of ethical topics in neuroscience. I would highly recommend Psychology 413. The instructors, students, and discussions are top notch. This is a rare opportunity to enjoy."
