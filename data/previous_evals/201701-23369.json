    "Very good course! I wish they offered more classes like this at YSPH. Very informative and exciting to learn about.",
    "important class to take for people interested in womens health research",
    "This course provides a good overview of many issues in reproductive and perinatal epidemiology. It draws on current literature, and involved a very interesting array of guest lecturers. Guest lecturers are a real strength, as are Prof. Jukic's lectures. An important strength of this course are the weekly writing assignments, which over the course of the semester helped me become a more critical reader of epidemiological articles. I really enjoyed these assignments. A weakness of the course was that the journal club discussion sometimes foundered, although they improved somewhat by the end of the semester. This might have been because Prof. Jukic emphasized that the discussions were time to ask questions and make mistakes this seemed to open up discussion a bit after she emphasized this, so for future iterations of the class I would recommend restating this many times at the beginning of the semester. Also, I don't think there were formal introductions (names, interests) of students in the class at the beginning of the semester, and adding this in might help foster a sense of group comfort.",
    "Strengths: many different topics in perinatal epidemiology covered, discussions were great Weaknesses: weekly summaries could be a lot of work",
    "Overall, this course covered a variety of perinatal topics, epidemiological concepts were discussed during the lecture and journal club, and assignments were based on practical research skills (i.e. journal club, presentations, working in groups). The length of the lecture could have been a little longer and the length of the journal club could have been shorter to allow more time for the teaching\/learning of important content and concepts. The template for the journal club provided a general framework to evaluate and discuss perinatal epidemiological issues. However, based on the current master's level epidemiology curriculum, students may not have been familiar with the more complex epidemiological methodologies used in the journal club papers. The instructor explained these methodologies before\/during the journal club. Adding a few paper-specific questions to the journal club each week would help students to focus and reflect on these issues prior to class."

    "Instructor: Anne Marie Jukic \u00a0Anne Marie is extremely receptive to student needs and student feedback. She is extremely passionate about this topic, which really comes across in her lectures. Additionally, I loved the guest lecturers that she brought in - they added another level of expertise to the course, which tied in other chronic diseases.",
    "Instructor: Anne Marie Jukic \u00a0very organized and thoughtful lectures",
    "Instructor: Anne Marie Jukic \u00a0Prof. Jukic is extremely knowledgeable about the biology of reproduction in pregnancy and epidemiology. She is equally comfortable explaining statistical and epidemiological concepts as she is hormonal fluctuations of the menstrual cycle. She is also an excellent reader, challenging you to make your analysis clearer. I very much appreciated this!",
    "Instructor: Anne Marie Jukic \u00a0This was an amazing course overall because Dr. Jukic is an amazing professor who cares about her students and goes above and beyond for them. I loved every topic we covered and the guest lectures were always informative. Dr. Jukic gives all the guidance one needs to succeed in the class. She is so smart but has a way of breaking down thought concepts for everyone to understand. She is also incredibly kind to her students.",
    "Instructor: Anne Marie Jukic \u00a0Gives great feedback, clear lecturer, great guest lecturers chosen",
    "Instructor: Anne Marie Jukic \u00a0The instructor was very knowledgeable and was an engaging teacher. The instructor used active learning techniques such as small group activities during the lecture. These were valuable opportunities for students to think about, discuss and reflect on issues. Incorporating more of these active learning opportunities would enhance student learning. Dr. Jukic was very sensitive to the needs and research interests of the students. She was willing to revisit difficult concepts during class and provide additional resources to students. One suggestion would be to incorporate DAGs into an assignment to help students develop a greater understanding of this new concept. She also worked in collaboration with students to select journal club papers each week, which was a novel approach that was empowering for students."

    "This course is very good for anyone interested in maternal and child health. The scope of lectures got a little detailed, but the way Anne Marie taught it makes it very easy to understand. I loved the topics and the projects throughout the semester. The course was very engaging and I learned a lot! After taking this course, I'm confident that I'll pursue something in this field.",
    "Useful course for anyone interested in perinatal epi.",
    "more practice of DAGs and analysis of DAGs. for me, it has been a while since last epi class, so reinforcing concepts like misclassification and other biases during lecture would be helpful. inclusion of lecture re contraception research",
    "This is a great class to learn about key topics in reproductive and perinatal epidemiology, and to begin to get familiar with some of the methodological issues unique to this field. I strongly recommend it to anyone interested in reproductive or maternal-child health.",
    "This course is an awesome intro to perinatal epi. Dr. Jukic is one of the best professors I have had at YSPH.",
    "If you are interested in perinatal epidemiology, it is the class to take",
    "This course provides a foundation for perinatal epidemiological research and concepts. I would recommend this course to another student."
