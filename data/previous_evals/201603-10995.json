   "comments": [
    "This course afforded me the tools to examine all of the material I read with a new (and frankly, incredibly important) lense. Every historian ought to have space, territory, and the groupings of people and land on their mind when engaging with the past -- this class trains you to be a consciencious, thorough historian! I also believe that it afforded me with a new way in which to listen to others.",
    "How to read (and create!) maps as a subjective form of discourse.",
    "Through this course, i learned about the history of a variety of forms of cartography. However, more importantly, I also learned a variety of skills that are important for conducting critical historical scholarship. In this class, we learned how to understand and asses the methodologies of secondary sources, how to interpret theoretical arguments made with regards to cartography, and how to incorporate these assessments into our own writings. This class also helped me develop historical writing skills.",
    "This course really did change my thinking. The readings we did and the discussions we had challenged me to analyze texts, maps, and paradigms of thinking in new ways. It not only made me question and rethink how I approach both primary and secondary sources, but also how I perceive the world in general. I know it sounds cliche, but seriously!",
    "This course made me think about maps in a new way, and even question my definition of what exactly a map is. The course provided a novel way to think about history and the role that maps played in different events.",
    "I learned a great deal about how maps are used as tools of power, intentionally and unintentionally. I also learned how to do original research and read scholarly work in a more critical and thoughtful way.",
    "I learned how to critically read academic papers in a way I had never considered before, as well as how to critically assess and question maps.",
    "I developed the strongest reading and writing skills I have in college so far. My analytical skills went up by leaps and bounds. I was consistently challenged and fat myself learning and growing weekly. It was somewhat breathtaking, actually, to observe such learning happening over such a short period of time. I learned a tremendous amount about history and culture, too, but also about the STUDY of such things."

   "comments": [
    "Really phenomenal course. I found all of the assignments engaging and productive, and thought that the presentation format of class was awesome, thought provoking, and something I looked forward to!",
    "Strengths: Professor Rankin runs discussions very well. He keeps a good balance of being hands off and letting students speak and articulate their ideas, while also stepping in to guide the discussion, keep it on track, and share relevant information. The readings are (for the most part) also a definite strength. They are both interesting and very helpful in reinforcing the concepts that Professor Rankin is trying to teach. Another key strength is the weekly discussion questions. I found these very helpful in helping me to interpret the readings. I also thought they helped me get into the mindset of assessing the methodological choices of the writers -- something that I think is a valuable skill. The assignments were also all well thought out and helpful. I especially enjoyed the map redesign, but I thought the paper, the redesign and the final paper all helped me apply the concepts and skills we learned through readings. Weaknesses: Not many. Some of the weeks a whole book was assigned when Professor Rankin probably could have just assigned a few chapters from that book. But otherwise, the course was well designed.",
    "I think the course is structured really well. The readings each week speak with each other, and having to write discussion questions helped me organize my thoughts before going into seminar each week. There was a lot of reading assigned each week, but it was all interesting. I also thought the bigger assignments built on each other well, and I really appreciated presenting my work and hearing from others about theirs.",
    "Professor Rankin is really great, and the class discussions are really interesting. I also really enjoyed the larger assignments. The reading load, however, is really large, and getting through all of it each week can be kind of a slog.",
    "The course's focus was interesting and class discussion was always lively. However, there was a lot of reading and it was hard to fully engage with all of it. Additionally, some of the units felt slightly repetitive.",
    "It's a great course - good structure, timeline, Rankin is really passionate about the subject and about helping students understand the material.",
    "The reading was interesting, but there was a lot splitting books, for example, up over two weeks would have given me more of a chance to deep dive and ponder, rather than fitting it all in one week, when it felt more like a burden than learning. The strength is the WONDERFUL professor and great discussions, as well as the emphasis on in-depth assignments rather than busy work.",
    "This class was designed in a way that required a high degree of student participation. Its strength lies in the variety of the assignments reading responses, a map analysis, a map redesign, and a final paper.",
    "I think providing more chronological structure to the course could be helpful as a way to facilitate more understanding and discussion of change over time in regards to mapping."

   "comments": [
    "Incredibly demanding course, though well worth the effort. You're not expected to know anything about cartography beforehand, but you will be asked to expand your existing theoretical and technical knowledge and to think more critically about identity, knowledge & power (very nebulous terms, but really what this course is all about). Professor Rankin is always willing to guide you through anything unfamiliar, and he's great during office hours.",
    "I could not recommend this course any more highly! It is the environment in which I have, arguably, learned the most -- both as a result of the material and as a product of the thought and effort put into the course by Professor Rankin.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to another student. It's a lot of work, but if you are willing to put the work in, you will walk away this a whole new set of skills that will be useful in future classes.",
    "I would totally recommend this class! It's certainly not easy, but it's worth the work and will really push you to be a better academic. Dr. Rankin not only facilitates great discussion, but he also gives feedback and advice for research and writing methods, which is super helpful.",
    "If you're at all interested in maps, take this class! However, it's not a course that teaches you how to make maps - it's much more about the role of maps within history. That being said, it's accessible to non-history majors, and really interesting.",
    "Yes, I would recommend that you take this course if you are interested in maps and\/or global power dynamics, but only if you can commit to doing the readings carefully and participating actively in discussion.",
    "It's a great course. It makes you think and see maps in an entirely different way that you will take away from the course for years. It is, however, a LOT of wok, so be prepared for plugging in a lot of hours for this class. The assignments (especially the map redesign) were very difficult, but very fun.",
    "DEFINITELY. I would warn them that it would be time-consuming and intense, but highly worthwhile. I've used so much of what I've learned in other classes and in daily conversation.",
    "Yes, it's true: you will never look at maps the same way again. This course was one of the hardest and most rewarding classes I have taken at Yale. Rankin has designed his class such that it's impossible to get away with not doing the reading\/work. The assignments are weekly discussion questions, a map analysis paper, a map redesign (which was awesome and very hands-on fun), and a final paper. Rankin doesn't give much feedback, but when he does, it's very helpful.",
    "Yes. The course was fantastic - maybe my favorite at Yale so far."
