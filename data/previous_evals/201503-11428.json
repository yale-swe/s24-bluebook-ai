   "comments": [
    "Weekly readings from 70-200 pages, discussion in glass guided a lot by Professor asking questions and urging students to draw their own conclusions.",
    "ITAL 680 offers a concrete overview of the literature of Italy's romantic era. A decent amount of time is spent reading the works of Foscolo and Leopardi, two authors that are particularly critical to understanding the foundation of modern Italian literature. So yes, I would definitely recommend the course to another studentboth for the importance of the content and for the pleasure of studying with Prof. Mazzotta!",
    "A great introductory class to Romanticism and key figures in Italian literature, with the possibility to explore a wide range of texts. I would reccomend it to anyone interested in learning more about the topic and with a solid knowledge of Italian."

   "comments": [
    "As an Italian major, I had previously studied Italian literature from the Medieval, Renaissance, and contemporary eras, but had not studied the period from the 1700s to 1800s. This course helped me to fill in that gap, allowing me to better understand how Italy's literary identity of the earlier two eras eventually progressed to the Italian literature we find today.",
    "The course enriched my knowledge of a key moment in Italian literature and exposed me to a wide range of texts that, albeit not directly related to my main research interests, are essential to my general formation as an Italianist."
