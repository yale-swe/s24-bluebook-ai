    "I really learned a lot from this course. We had to do pedigree and probability calculations in the first half of the course sessions, with the practice from homeworks, I felt prepared for the midterm exam. We addressed a wide range of topics during this semester, that advanced my knowledge in genetics in combined with population-wide disease prevention. Genetic epidemiology is truly a very important research field in helping with disease etiology exploration.",
    "Great class! I did learn a lot about genetics and genetic epidemiology. The combination of molecular science and population science is very exciting. Though some of the basic genetic knowledge is a little bit hard for me, I still love this course.",
    "I wish the slides had more helpful information about how to tackle the homework problems. I often had to google for more explanations. Perhaps some more example fully done out in class would have helped.",
    "Great course",
    "Systemically introduced the basic concepts of genetics and genetic analysis.",
    "great",
    "Great class with a good progression through the syllabus and some interesting ideas. The lectures were interesting and informative. Three ideas for improvement: 1. The pacing of the lectures needs to be a little better. We ran a little slow and missed the end of a few lectures. Nothing major, just need to get the timing down a little bit. 2. Think about doing this class twice a week. Maybe with the first one focused on theory and the second one on applications. I would have liked to have had things spread out a little bit more. 3. There were a number of times that we did something for the homework that we had not covered exactly in class. There wasn't really a good textbook for some of the practical calculations. He was generous and understanding with the homework, but it was frustrating to have to do things that we had not covered in class and we could not look up in the text. I guess that he should just be a little more deliberate about how the lectures translate to the homework, since we did not have great outside resources for some of the topics.",
    "Great overview of genetic epidemiology. Really liked the small size of the lectures and the level of detail of the slides.",
    "This is a great introductory course for anyone who is interested in learning about genetics and its relation to public health.",
    "It was a great course. I think you need some scientific background--sometimes the topics covered are a bit in depth. Also, I felt that having a final paper wasn't that helpful. Maybe a take home exam would have been better."

    "Instructor: Andrew T. DeWan \u00a0Dr.DeWan was very patient and kind with questions from students during the class and office hour. The slides Dr.DeWan prepared were very abundant and clear that even after class we could still read ourselves that helped us with the homeworks.",
    "Instructor: Andrew T. DeWan \u00a0Dr. DeWan is very nice and patient. He explains every question clearly. I love him",
    "Instructor: Andrew T. DeWan \u00a0The lectures occasionally were rushed to finish, and we sometimes had to rush through things that were covered on the HW. I would only recommend maybe trimming the lectures to really emphasis the new material and calculations.",
    "Instructor: Andrew T. DeWan \u00a0informative, thoughtful for students",
    "Instructor: Andrew T. DeWan \u00a0very nice and knowledgable",
    "Instructor: Andrew T. DeWan \u00a0I really liked him. He was engaging and understanding, even in a class where there was not a lot of student interaction. Not that he did not attempt to have student interaction, most people just chose to stay quiet.",
    "Instructor: Andrew T. DeWan \u00a0Andy was a great instructor; very approachable both during office hours and over email.",
    "Instructor: Andrew T. DeWan \u00a0Dr. Dewan is a fantastic professor and lecturer. He cares about his students and makes sure that everyone understands the material. He is very good about answering questions and always made himself available if you needed help. One thing I wish he did differently was gave us more examples in class that related to the homework problems, because sometimes he would give us problems that we did not go over how to do, which made the homeworks much more challenging.",
    "Instructor: Andrew T. DeWan \u00a0Great instructor. Very attentive and always available."

   "comments": [
    "This is a very specific topic course that only those students who are interested in genetic epidemiology will be helpful to them to have a full background understanding about this field. Still, I largely recommend this course as Dr. DeWan is the best instructor ever in YSPH.",
    "Great course. I recommend it. This course makes me think and I learned a lot.",
    "Yes, this course was very interesting, and was an excellent introduction into genetic epidemiology.",
    "Yes",
    "I would recommend it.",
    "Very good introductory course for students who are studying statistical genetics but without much biological background.",
    "interesting",
    "An interesting course on general human genetics and genetic epidemiology. The material is presented well, and the professor is engaging. This is a good introduction for people who are thinking about using genetics in their future public health work (which should be everyone).",
    "Great overview of genetic epidemiology, recommended for students with any level of genetics background. Final paper was enjoyable to write.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to another student.",
    "Have some biology and genetics background before entering into the course. I used a lot of outside material to study up on the homework."
