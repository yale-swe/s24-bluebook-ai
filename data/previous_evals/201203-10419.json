    "It trained me in ways to read, contextualize, and think about ethnographies as not just standalone texts, but part of a process of fieldwork, theorizing, synthesizing, and writing.",
    "The course allowed me to deepen ethnographic knowledge around my particular topic of interest as well as engage in theoretical questions. At the same time as it helped me prepare for my concentration, we read classics of ethnography that zoomed out to the discipline of anthropology in general."
