   "comments": [
    "Great idea for a course. Fascinating to see the development of communication, but simply too much to covering just one course. I have learned a lot of anecdotal stuff but not much else in terms of themes except for common sense. Fairly graded midterm and the assignments are fairly straightforward and interesting. very relaxed course, interesting material and the professors are great.",
    "You should take this class. It's hardly any work and the topic is great -- it should really be called \"The History of Writing\" which it covers from ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia to the Internet. There are tons of guest lecturers and three professors. It really is good and seems to be underrated based on the fact that there were only a handful who took it this year and some didn't come to class. It's relaxing and actually really interesting even if you never knew you were interested in the topic.",
    "The idea for the course is excellent, but it suffered from poor execution. The class should be a survey of major themes in the history of human communication, but it tried too hard to cram too much into the semester. As a consequence, the story got very muddled, and it was very hard to decide what to study when the midterms and finals came around. Unless changes are made to the scope and execution of the class (sit in on the first few classes and see if you can follow along), I would not recommend this course."
