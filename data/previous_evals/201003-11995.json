   "comments": [
    "This class gives you a lot of exposure to a variety of topics related to HIV\/AIDS in Sub-Saharan Africa (though most of the course specifically focuses on the country of South Africa). The course touches on a number of different disciplinesincluding politics, demographics, biology, and anthropology. There isn't a lot of political economy, so you might be disappointed on that front if that's something you're interested in. It helps to be familiar with statistics. Professor Nattrass is wonderful; this class was one of my favorite at Yale.",
    "Would totally recommend if you want to get a solid idea of what AIDS is about. Prof N is v. friendly and \"hands on.\" Be prepared to learn almost exclusively about South Africa though.",
    "Definitely take this course! It's not too demanding and the material is interesting.",
    "REcommend highly. Excellent overview of the AIDS epidemic in Southern Africa.",
    "Great course - definitely recommend it.",
    "It is a highly recommended course on the history and currently epidemiology of AIDS in Souther Africa, particularly South Africa, with an emphasis on using computer software to model the epidemic. It is a fascinating and worthwhile course for anyone at all interested in HIV\/AIDS and global health.",
    "A great class. If you are at all interesting in AIDS, South Africa, or global health take this class.The modeling project at the end is a huge challenge, but in the end you'll feel like you did actual real-world work in this class. Also Professor Nattrass is hilarious and fun to have around.",
    "Yes, it's very interesting, manageable course load and good professor.",
    "pretty good.",
    "This class is an incredibly interesting and unique look at AIDS. It's alot more stats\/modelling focused than other classes at Yale which is incredibly useful for those actually looking into Public Health. There's not too much work outside of the three papers (although the last paper is KILLER). You will get a lot out of this class!",
    "This class teaches you a lot about the complexities of the AIDS epidemic in South Africa. In that respect, it's a great course. Be ready for a number-heavy approach, and an emphasis on modeling the epidemic using data you find. Discussions can be a bit all-over-the-place, but if you participate you'll find that Prof. Nattrass is really an expert in the field, and someone you can learn from.",
    "This course concerns the AIDS epidemic in southern Africa, in a multifaceted and in-depth approach. The major project involved modeling AIDS using UNAIDS software.Yes, I would recommend INTS 347 to anyone interested in learning and talking more about AIDS."
