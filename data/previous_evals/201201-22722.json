    "Exposes you to various methodologies and theoretical frameworks that could be applied to your senior essay. This class is really what you make of it. If you take the methodological explorations seriously, you can really ruminate on your senior essay and make progress. It's a lot of fun to get to know your fellow WGSS majors and their interests better, so enjoy!",
    "If you're taking this course, you're a WGSS major and its required. Our class with Liz was great, however, she won't be teaching at Yale anymore so I can't really say how it'll pan out in the future. It's helpful if you have some senior essay topics planned out ahead of time--but again, it'll vary depending on the instructor.",
    "You have to take this if you're a WGSS major. It was a pretty bad class when I took it--I hope (though I'm not hopeful) that they find a way to make it better.",
    "The required junior theory and method seminar for WGSS majors. It was great to have the whole group together in a class. Also, I was really excited to hear from my peers about the work we're all pursuing. The course meets late at night, so it can be tough to make it until 9:00, but this sort of academic camaraderie is exactly what I was hoping for coming to college.",
    "It's required."
