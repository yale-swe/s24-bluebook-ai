    "-strengths: engaging, informative, relatively fair workload -weaknesses: slides look like they're from the '90s, not enough problem solving done as a class (as opposed to hand-holding) It would be cool to try to work through a student-suggested policy problem or question in a class, see if we can glean anything from it. If each student suggested something there must be at least 1 topic we could have gained information from using techniques learned in the class.",
    "I think this would have been a great class if 1) I was passionate about stats and able to get excited about the details of the models, 2) I had more background in the material. I think there should be a stronger prerequesite - I took a stats class at Yale but I was lost when it came to the different models and distributions",
    "9 homeworks is maybe too much. Difficult of homeworks and midterm was fair though.",
    "It is an excellent course in introducing the basic operations models and their connection with policy making."

    "I would recommend it to people excited about stats and willing to read abstract texts and put in quite a bit of work.",
    "Course does a good job of covering a lot of the basics of operations research type mathematics. If you have very limited mathematics background the course might be challenging, but there is little to no assumed knowledge and almost everything is taught from the ground up. I think the course does a very good job of talking about interesting applications so even if you know the theory the course will be useful and interesting.",
    "Yes. This is one of the most useful course I have ever had since it explains originally technical terms in a clear and intuitive language.",
    "Definitely."
