   "comments": [
    "Yes, it is a good class for 1.5 credits and not too much work.",
    "Yes, if you are willing to work. Do not take it if you are just looking to breeze by a language, much more challenging that Spanish 130 but if you put in the time than it is a great class.",
    "Tough but excellent spanish course for intermediate speakers seeking fluency.",
    "I would recommend Spanish 140. It's a pretty good course in grammar, mostly uses and treatments of the subjunctive, but things that are useful to know. The readings are pretty interesting, and give you insight into Spanish\/Latin American culture. You also finish the semester by reading the novella \"Las batallas in el desierto,\" which I really enjoyed. Take it with Wan Tang if she's teaching it--she's awesome!",
    "To be honest I think L4 is much easier than L3. There is more reading but the exams are easier since you presumably know the fundamentals already. I highly recommend Wan. She is enthusiastic, clear and supportive.",
    "I would recommend if you want to continue because it is a good overview where you can hone your skills.",
    "Spanish 140 is essentially just a continuation of Spanish 130, only you have to read a novel at the end. It meets everyday, and the workload is manageable, you have a little bit of homework every night. There is an oral exam and a final, and an oral presentation. The class is great, take it with Wan Tang if at all possible. She is the best teacher ever! The class isn't hard, and I feel as though my spanish speaking abilities have greatly improved upon taking it!!",
    "Spanish 140 was noticeably more difficult than Spanish 130. There is still a lot of grammar work, but with an increased emphasis on in class discussion. Some of these discussion topics would be hard for me to talk about in English, let alone in Spanish. In addition to this, going to Spanish class everyday really became annoying towards the end of the term, but overall, I'm glad I did it.",
    "Only with Wan.",
    "I took it to get that extra half credit. It was a smart choice... annoying that it met 5 times a week, but worth it in the end.",
    "Spanish 140 02 was a pretty good class. It wasn't terribly difficult, and probably most useful for improving speaking skills and reading comprehension. I would recommend it to another student.",
    "Spanish L4 jumps right into the subjunctive verb tense which was a little challenging because I hadn't taken spanish since high school. After a few weeks of listening to and trying to speak spanish everyday, it becomes more comfortable and is a very doable class. I would definitely recommend it."
