   "comments": [
    "You work on a semester long group project using this communications strategy that Paul Lussier teaches you. It's much more communications based than environmental\/climate based. Paul actually emphasizes climate vs. Climate, and how we aren't supposed to be focused on the Earth's climate but the people's climate.",
    "I loved the course, but I think you'd have a rough time in it if you have conservative beliefs when it comes to environmental politics, mostly because the other students in the course would maybe burn you at the stake. Very educational though.",
    "Prepare yourself for a life journey condensed into one class. At this point in time you cannot begin to imagine where you will be at its conclusion.",
    "Definitely! It was a great course.",
    "This is really like taking two different classes: 1. The in-class, lecture\/discussions about different communications theories and readings, and 2. The group projects. The class did require quite a bit of work, but it was work that I loved doing, and it was incredibly rewarding. Classes could be a bit frustrating at times, but if you can take the class and work on a project you really care about, absolutely take it.",
    "Take it if you care deeply about the environment and climate change issues. Take it if you care about understanding people. Take it if you want to learn how to communicate a message so it'll get a response. Just take it.",
    "ABSOLUTELY. THIS COMPLETELY CHANGED MY LIFE PATH. IT IS NOT ONLY USEFUL FOR CLIMATE CHANGE COMMUNICATIONS, BUT ALSO FOR COMMUNICATION IN LIFE. YOU WILL ALSO LEARN HOW TO BE A BETTER PERSON JUST BY BEING AROUND PROFESSOR PAUL.",
    "Take this class if you are interested in investing time in one project for an entire semester. Also, if you are passionate about communicating scientific or environmental issues",
    "I would be hesitant to recommend EVST 311. It explores interesting ideas -- how do we effectively communicate around climate? How do we bring people together to talk about climate? What are the different areas we have to focus on? There is a semester-long group project, and if you get a good group, that might well be rewarding. But a lot of the class is essentially learning buzzwords - humanistic communications, stakeholders, etc. - and it felt like a lot of learning how to use sophisticated language instead of actually thinking about the issues themselves. Paul is very passionate, and experienced in the area, but unfortunately incredibly disorganized and his teaching is very scattered - and he mostly talks at you, instead of engaging in a discussion with you. The only evaluations in the class are from the group midterm and the group final, so the only grade I knew during the semester was the one group grade from them midterm. Because there is basically no work (just a little reading each week that we mostly didn't talk about), I have no idea how I did, and also didn't feel like I was pushed that hard, or grew that much, in the class. While EVST 311 is about a really interesting topic, the class itself was very disappointing, and I'd hesitate to recommend it.",
    "An interesting class that makes you think differently and critically about the ways that we communicate messages, especially messages that we think people should logically accept easily. A lot of the enjoyment of the class rides on the success of your project, and I found my project, at least for the first half of class, more stressful and futile than enjoyable. The readings were extremely manageable, there were no tests, and I found working on the project became fun and productive by the end of the semester. I didn't get a ton out of the actual 2-hour block of class though, as it often felt that people (including the professor) were just talking in very enthusiastic circles. Many people in the room really enjoyed these discussions, but they weren't really my style. This class was not as life-changing for me as many previous reviewers have implied. I recommend that you shop the class, and really really think on if you can handle Paul's discussion style\/format for the whole semester.",
    "EVST 311 is an introduction to humanistic communications. You learn how to present climate communications in a way that appeals to the values of the recipients of this information. It's complex, and not easy to follow, but the skill is invaluable, not only for climate\/environmental communications, but for all communications.",
    "This class really changed my whole outlook on climate change! If you are passionate about making change in the field, especially on the policy side of things, you should shop this class. Paul is a character and will take some getting used to. He is very enthusiastic and really knows his stuff. Sometimes he talks in circles and sometimes he moves so fast everything goes over your head. Sometimes you can't even tell which of the two you are experiencing but I think the class is worth the confusion. I learned a lot and got to work on a really cool project! The projects are really great. You get what you put into it. This class was such an experience and I came out of it a different person. However, if you are looking for a chill class then I would not recommend this.",
    "An enjoyable, fast-paced course. I HIGHLY recommend this course for any STEM majors. Period. It is not enough to know the science; we must also know how to communicate it to the public, and to specific groups (religious, political, socioeconomic, etc.). In addition to once-a-week class, you work on with a client immediately applying the tactics. Please please please at least shop this class.",
    "EVST 311 is hands-down the best course Ive taken at Yale and in my entire educational career. Never have I taken a class that has been at once as inspiring, challenging, and paradigm-shifting as EVST 311, and the credit for that is entirely due to Pauls charisma, expertise, and incomparable perspective on why the way we currently communicate about environmental issues isnt working. I cannot give a more enthusiastic endorsement of this class; it has completely reinspired me academically and pushed me to get involved with a field that was heretofore unknown to me. This class appeals to more than just students in the EVST departmentit is multidisciplinary and shows why climate change action is a priority and opportunity for everyone, not just stereotypical liberal environmentalists. Any interest in social justice, economic stability, public health, natural resources, national security, development, communication, or education? This class is for you. Take it and prepare to have your paradigm shifted to recognize action on climate change to be an opportunity to rethink society and imagine a prosperous and healthy future where nature is a partner in our success."
