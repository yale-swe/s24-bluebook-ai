    "Capstones in general are a great way for seniors to get real world experience working on group projects while still in university. Ours in particular focussed on MEII, which is a middle east investment institution which gives credit to SMEs with out enough collateral to be considered credible enough to obtain a loan from a traditional bank. Bo was an awesome professor and made the entire process and made us WANT to do the work. We spent time talking on the phone with other DFIs and institutional investors to try to advice MEII on how to be more profitable. Overall, amazing experience. Global affairs keeps getting better and better.",
    "Choose your capstone wisely -- I would personally pick more specific goal-oriented projects because I like to work within a clear framework of expectations and standards",
    "It's the Global Affairs capstone. Do it if you want to graduate as a Global Affairs major. Don't if you don't.",
    "Your advisor can make or break your capstone. Make sure to keep this in mind during capstone preference selection. Overall a very good experience, but very much due to my interest in the topic and having a good advisor."
