    "Given the context of the class, sometimes there coursework was heavy with deadlines and sometimes it was normal in the reading and written assignments. I think it's hard in general to assess this class as a regular class with feedback from the professors with our groups and what was taught-which is not so much specific concepts or theories, but about working in the real world, in developing countries, and the professionalism involved. What we learned from our projects was primarily self-taught, which is another great skill to havein the workforce.",
    "This course was absolutely fantastic!!",
    "On top of the class we had a DILS creole teacher that prepared us to the language skills necessary to be able to perform our duties while in Haiti. Mr. Robert Lamothe also trained us in general Haitian culture, history, cuisine and architecture. He was a great addition to the class.",
    "This was an amazing course that brought together students from varying backgrounds, disciplines, and schools. I learned so much and really appreciated all of the work put into organizing the experience in Haiti."

   "comments": [
    "The best aspects of this course was the interdisciplinary fields applied to the problem in Haiti. The small class size facilitated the flow of conversation and Gordon and Gary were great instructors in that sense. As the TA Heather balanced out the instruction and was essential for the coordination during class and while in Haiti. The class application of working on projects in collaboration for an organization demonstrated the need for professionalism without being too formal about grading, etc, which is much different than other classes I have taken. I think it's partially because the majority of the class had some work experience prior to coming back to school and so it didn't need to be stated I(for the most part).During Haiti, the ability to visit different parts of the country and compare the different hospital and business models allowed me to see how different organizations work in different capacities.Reading books on Haiti was also a great way to supplement my knowledge of the country and the people there.Lastly, dinner\/snacks was also great to have.",
    "The trip was fantastic! I also really appreciate the leadership style and flexibility of the course instructors.",
    "The best aspect of this course was the field trip to Haiti. The second best aspect of this class was the book assignments. The third best aspect of this class was the Haitian creole lessons.",
    "Opportunity to travel in Haiti and discuss in depth the complexities of overseas NGO\/humanitarian efforts.Students from 3 different schools (Forestry, Public Health&Nursing)",
    "Discussion of the role of NGOs and government in development, implementation barriers in development, data driven presentations, the USAID and professor guest speakers",
    "The best part of the course was having the opportunity to work with an NGO \"client\" in Haiti. By far the richest part of the learning experience was to coordinate back-and-forwarth with the NGO before the trip in trying to hone in on specific project ideas, then spending time with the NGO staff during the trip, and after returning, producing deliverables for the client based on what they had said they wanted and on our experiences in Haiti.I also really enjoyed having done my independent study on agroforestry in the fall and then being able to apply what I had learned in an on-the-ground experience.Also, the class was a wonderful, supportive, kind learning environment. The instructors and all the students are wonderful people who all got along, so the class and the trip was really fun!",

   "comments": [
    "The professors were in charge of 2 groups each; however, I felt that that they did not spread their time evenly between the two groups, especially during the trip in Haiti. They each had their own interest and stuck with those two groups while the other two groups were more often left on their own.Organization was well done considering the change in the course and the lack of syllabus. However, I think that groups should start even sooner in the projects if it is possible. In the real world you are confronted with last minute reports, etc so perhaps it isn't too different in that regard. However, as students, sometimes it's a real struggle to complete work so last minute.",
    "none",
    "I would try to schedule the book reports along the semester and not cluster them into one single class. It felt like there were too many things happening at once during the same class.",
    "More materials in general need to be brought into the course in an organized way before the trip. For example, it would have been great to see Baseball in the Time of Cholera before going. It's perhaps hard to do this because of the groups - but perhaps a list of literature can be created for each group before the class starts.",
    "In preparation for the Haiti trip, I feel that either the instructors should have provided more guidance to the students in terms of the kind of projects to do OR that the instructors should have allowed the students to steer the interactions with the NGO clients from the get-go. I remember the first 2 or 3 weeks where we were told to not contact the NGO directly, which left us confused during those weeks of how to even begin thinking about our project. Once we were allowed to communicate with the NGO directly, it was a great learning experience to navigate that relationship and expectations on our own.Also, the lectures leading up to the trip could have been more rich in content to help us better prepare for the trip."

This class was smaller than last year, but given my other comment about the lack of support from the professors during the field trip, it would have been nice to have a fourth person so that every group had at least one Yale affiliated instructor\/TA with them. This would also be beneficial during class time when questions arose during group meetings.",

There were only a couple times that I was confused about what was going on as we prepared for the trip. For instance, it would have been a bit better if the students could have received some of the information with more notice (like a packing list, the trip itinerary, etc)."

This class was really important to have a broader view and understanding of the international development cooperation or international aid programs.
